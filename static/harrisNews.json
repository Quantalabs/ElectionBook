Vance on ‘SNL’: “Please Don’t Make Me Do This”","text":"Bowen Yang is tired of impersonating J.D. Vance on Saturday Night Live. \n\n The Wicked actor first played the vice president of the United States in September 2024 — a mere two months before Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. On Thursday, Yang appeared on The Daily Show and said that despite playing the character for less than a year, he would be more than happy if Lorne Michaels recast the role of the Republican politician on SNL.\n\n “Loren asked me [to play Vance] and, I said, ‘Please, please, please don’t make me do this,’” Yang explained to host Desi Lydic. “I really do my best with him, but every time I have to play him, I go to Lorne and I say, ‘You can do a buyback, You don’t have to stick with me.’” \n\n The actor and comedian offered the SNL creator a few options for his replacement: “Please reach out to Zach Galifianakis. Please reach out to Taran Killam. But no, that’s my charge.” Yang said he’s found it “challenging” to portray the vp, partly because of Vance’s accent. \n\n “You know what, I worked with an accent coach,” he revealed. “We had to find the middle between Appalachian and Ohio. We really had to find the right [accent]. I was like, I don’t want to screw this up.” \n\n At the beginning of the live sketch comedy show’s 50th season, Yang debuted the role of Vance alongside James Austin Johnson as Trump, Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris, Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walz, Dana Carvey as Joe Biden and Andy Samberg as Douglas Emhoff. \n\n Aside from his Vance’s dialect, Yang said he had “such an uphill battle” playing Trump’s right-hand man because he anticipated that “everyone in America is going to be like, ‘This Asian guy is playing that guy?’” \n\n He added, “I was like, I really got to nail this down. And I’m just telling you guys, I’m doing my best.”","summary":"“Everyone in America is going to be like, ‘This Asian guy is playing that guy?’” the comedian said he thought when the show’s creator asked him to portray the vice president.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bowen-yang-jd-vance-saturday-night-live-lorne-michaels-1236188843/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NUP_206142_00007-H-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 22:29:02","author":"McKinley Franklin","authors":["McKinley Franklin"],"language":"en","source_country":"bz","sentiment":0.155},{"id":310260172,"title":"Former Trump aide says he knows exactly when president's bromance with Elon Musk will implode","text":"Elon Musk will be an enemy of president Donald Trump by this time next year, according to former Trump staffer Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nScaramucci, who spent an infamous 11 days in Trump's first White House, shared his thoughts on Musk's role in the Trump administration while speaking on DailyMail.com's Welcome to MAGAland podcast. \n\n'I think Musk's a very smart guy... I don't think Musk will be speaking favorably of Donald Trump 12 months from now,' the former White House communication director said on Friday.\n\n'I think Elon is between a rock and a hard place. He is in it now, the problem is when you get in it, all types of cognitive dissonance fill your brain with wanting you to stay in it,' Scaramucci added.\n\n'It is very hard to admit the mistake, and I was a Trump supporter, so I had to face it myself. I had to face my ego. I had to face my human frailty... I think Musk's gonna get there.'\n\nScaramucci said the tariff war would help drive Musk away from Trump, adding that it would be 'very bad' for Musk if Trump continues with his tariffs. \n\nThe billionaire hasn't been shy about sharing his opposition to the president's sweeping international tariffs.\n\nScaramucci, who had a chaotic tenure as White House communications director in 2017, claims Trump fired him after he disagreed with him on national security policy. \n\n'I was the first person on Wall Street to offer Trump support, but it became impossible [to continue supporting him], and I said, for my family, for my country, I have to speak out against what he's doing,' he recalled on Welcome to MAGAland.\n\n'Six years later, and I said if he returned to the presidency, he would wreak havoc on the global economy. He would try to pull us away from our allies. He would certainly hurt the cause of freedom in Ukraine, which he has done, and it would be a nightmare for all of us.'\n\nThe investor soured on Trump after his stint in the White House, and went on to support Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in the 2024.\n\nTrump has long rubbished Scaramucci's claims about him, suggesting that his former aide is bitter and that he has an ax to grind. \n\nScaramucci was appointed as the White House Communications Director on July 21, 2017, and later that same day, Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned, reportedly over objection to his hiring.\n\nOnly a few days later, the newly minted Trump official found himself at the center of a P.R. crisis when he launched an expletive-laden rant on a phone call with a New Yorker reporter, which he thought was off the record.\n\nBy July 31, the president had dismissed 'the Mooch,' on the advice of his new chief of staff, John Kelly, who doubted that Scaramucci was credible enough for the role.\n\nWhen he was sacked, his total tenure of eleven days became tied for the shortest in the history of the position.\n\nAlong with Matt Borges and other high-profile Republicans, he created the Right Side PAC in June 2020, which was a super PAC that aimed to prevent another Trump presidency and supported Biden.\n\nThe former Trump appointee doubled down on his support for Biden in 2024, contributing $30,000 to his campaign in June.\n\nTo listen to the full interview with Anthony Scaramucci, search for Welcome to MAGAland, wherever you get your podcasts now.","summary":"The former White House spoke to the Welcome to MAGAland podcast on Friday,","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14600333/anthony-scaramucci-predicts-end-donald-trump-bromance-elon-musk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/11/20/97186371-0-image-m-94_1744400037344.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 22:07:34","author":"Editor,Germania Rodriguez Poleo","authors":["Editor","Germania Rodriguez Poleo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":310258440,"title":"How Popular Are Conservative Podcasts With Gen Z? What New Poll Shows","text":"Several conservative podcasts, including those hosted by Charlie Kirk, Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, and Dave Portnoy, have built significant audiences among Gen Z Americans, particularly those who voted for President Donald Trump in last year's election, according to a new survey.The Axios-Generation Lab poll's findings suggest that partisan media consumption trends are firmly established among young adults, with many aligning their podcast choices with political preferences.Why It MattersDuring his successful 2024 campaign, Trump appeared on numerous podcasts to speak directly to voters, a strategy that reflected the increasing influence of the medium on political engagement.Gen Z and younger millennials are turning to podcasts not just for entertainment, but for political commentary and news. These platforms offer unfiltered access to voices they trust, shaping perspectives outside of traditional media frameworks.What To KnowAccording to the new poll, there is a clear partisan divide in podcast preferences.The Axios-Generation Lab poll, conducted from February 21-28 among a representative sample of 972 18- to 34-year-olds nationwide, found that in the past month, 34 percent of Trump voters in this group had listened to a Barstool Sports podcast—making Trump supporter Portnoy's shows the most popular among young people who voted for the president.That figure dropped to just 9 percent among those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.Other conservative-leaning podcasts also showed a strong skew toward Trump voters.Roughly 27 percent said they listened to The Joe Rogan Experience monthly, 19 percent to The Charlie Kirk Show, and 18 percent to The Ben Shapiro Show.Among Harris supporters, only 3 percent said they listened to Kirk or Shapiro, and just 6 percent tuned into Rogan's show monthly.The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Kirk's rapid rise in conservative media—he now holds the number 1 spot among conservative podcasts, according to Salem Media—underscores his resonance with young right-leaning Americans.\"This isn't just a win for Charlie,\" David Santrella, CEO of Salem Media Group, said in a press release. \"This is a defining moment for conservative media. The torch has been passed, and we're not looking back.\"While some podcasts like The Daily, TED Talks Daily, and Call Her Daddy drew more balanced audiences, Axios noted that entertainment and leisure preferences were also split along political lines. Harris supporters, for example, were more likely to attend concerts, while Trump supporters leaned into sports.What People Are SayingConservative influencer Charlie Kirk said in a March statement: \"We're not just talking. We're activating a generation.\"Generational expert and HR consultant Bryan Driscoll told Newsweek: \"I see this not as a podcast story but rather an echo chamber story. We've spent the last decade or so watching people silo themselves on social media, and now they're doing it with podcasts.\"He added: \"Gen Z, like many generations today, are seeking out voices that confirm what they already believe. And that goes for both sides of the aisle. Everyone is just reinforcing their own worldview with a pair of earbuds.\"What Happens Next?With podcasts growing as a primary source of news and opinion among Gen Z, political campaigns on both sides are likely to double down on appearances in these spaces.Trump's repeated use of podcast interviews in 2024 could set a precedent for future candidates seeking to bypass traditional media filters and connect with young audiences directly.\"The political divide is about identity,\" Driscoll said. \"Podcasts have become ideological accessories. When two people can listen to two different shows about the same issue and walk away with opposite 'truths' I'm terrified, because we're not just polarized—we're post-reality.\"","summary":"The Axios-Generation Lab poll's findings suggest that partisan media consumption trends are firmly established among young adults.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-popular-are-conservative-podcasts-gen-z-what-new-poll-shows-2058898","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2626071/ben-shapiro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 22:02:56","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.184},{"id":310258428,"title":"Trump Denies FEMA Aid Extension in State He Won Three Times","text":"Democratic Gov. Josh Stein announced Friday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has denied North Carolina's request to extend the full reimbursement period for Hurricane Helene recovery efforts.Stein posted on X, formerly Twitter, \"Today, I learned that FEMA refused our request to extend its 100% reimbursement period for another 180 days. I got this news while I was in Newland with families who lost their homes in the storm. The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored. I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA's bad decision, even for 90 days. Six months later, the people of western North Carolina are working hard to get back on their feet; they need FEMA to help them get the job done.\"In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, President Donald Trump voiced sharp criticism of FEMA's response in North Carolina, accusing the agency of being too slow to release recovery funds and failing to coordinate effectively with state officials. Trump repeatedly claimed that federal bureaucracy was delaying critical aid, saying in one press briefing, \"The people of North Carolina deserve faster, better action. FEMA needs to cut the red tape and get the job done.\"He also suggested that political bias might be influencing the pace of assistance, given Trump's staunch support in hard-hit areas of western North Carolina, though FEMA denied the allegations.Trump has consistently secured North Carolina's electoral votes in the past three presidential elections. In 2016, he defeated Hillary Clinton with 49.83 percent of the vote to her 46.17 percent, a margin of 3.66 percentage points. The 2020 election saw a tighter race, with Trump narrowly surpassing Joe Biden by 1.34 percentage points.

That marks a sharp decline from early January, when his net favorability was nearly even.Why It MattersMusk's slide in public opinion has been both steady and significant, particularly following his appointment by President Donald Trump as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new federal task force designed to, according the White House, slash government spending.Since DOGE's launch, Musk has faced mounting criticism over several controversies: the firing of federal employees, accusations of DOGE workers accessing sensitive payment information of Americans and concerns that Musk may eliminate vital public programs. His involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election also appears to have backfired.What To KnowSilver Bulletin aggregates national polling data and updates its average several times a week. Its methodology, developed by Silver during his time at 538, adjusts for polling house effects and sample types, making it among the most authoritative sources of U.S. political data.\"Musk's numbers have been on a downward trend—especially since Trump took office,\" Silver Bulletin's team wrote. In January, Musk's net favorability stood at -0.2 percent. His public image has since eroded as he became more politically active, most notably after taking the helm at DOGE.On Silver's chart, three key moments mark his decline: his endorsement of Trump in mid-2024, Trump's victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and the start of Trump's second term in early 2025. According to Silver, the correlation between these events and Musk's growing unpopularity is difficult to ignore.What Other Polls ShowPublic opinion data from other sources supports Silver's findings. A Morning Consult poll conducted from March 28 to March 30 found Musk's unfavorable rating had climbed to 54 percent, up from 45 percent after the 2024 election. Among Democrats, his unfavorability rose from 71 percent to 83 percent, and among independents from 48 percent to 59 percent. Even among Republicans, while 73 percent viewed him favorably, only 47 percent had a strongly favorable opinion—less intensity than for Trump.A Reuters/Ipsos poll from the same period found 57 percent viewed Musk unfavorably and 39 percent favorably—nearly identical to Silver's numbers. Pollster Charles Franklin told Reuters, \"It's a strong argument that Musk's net impact was negative. He gave Democrats a foil for campaign messaging.\"The Harvard/Harris Poll in late March reported a 10-point drop in Musk's net favorability in just one month, from an even 44-44 split in February to 49 percent unfavorable and 39 percent favorable. CNN analyst Harry Enten remarked, \"I have rarely, if ever, seen a shift this dramatic ... Musk's net favorability dropped from +24 to -19 between 2017 and 2025.\"Future of Musk and DOGEDespite Trump calling Musk a \"GREAT PATRIOT\" on Truth Social, the association with the administration appears to be harming the Tesla CEO more than helping. Tesla recently reported a 13 percent drop in first-quarter sales, and critics argue that Musk's political alignment is undermining his brand.According to media reports, Trump has privately told advisers and Cabinet members that Musk will soon step back from his prominent role as a key adviser.Musk's heavy involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race appears to have been a tipping point. A poll conducted by Democratic firm Blueprint and shared with The Washington Post found that 30 percent of voters said Musk's multimillion-dollar intervention made them less likely to support the Trump-endorsed candidate, Brad Schimel, compared to just 5 percent who said it made them more likely. Musk had heavily funded and promoted the campaign of Schimel, who lost to liberal candidate Susan Crawford.The backlash prompted national Democrats to make Musk a centerpiece of their messaging, casting him as a symbol of Trump-era government overreach.What People Are SayingSilver, in his Silver Bulletin: \"Although Musk may eventually leave the government, he'll remain an exceptionally important and controversial public figure even if he does. Until then, he could be a liability for Trump.\"Democratic pollster Evan Roth Smith, analyzing the poll for The Washington Post: \"The verdict from the race appears clear: The closer Musk is to an election's central narrative, the worse Republicans do. And while the president might seek to distance himself from Musk in the coming weeks and months, the impression that Musk is currently a central figure of the Republican Party seems indelible. Democrats are already trying to goad him into a larger public-facing role for a reason.\"Carter Wrenn, longtime Republican strategist, told Newsweek: \"Polls are showing Musk's popularity is upside down. That could definitely be a problem—especially with swing voters, independents, and ticket-splitters. Musk, personally, carries some negative baggage that could hurt.\"What Happens NextTrump's DOGE initiative was launched via executive order on his first day back in office and is poised to sunset in July 2026.

(AP) — A federal judge has rejected President Donald Trump’s effort to dismiss a defamation lawsuit against him filed by the men formerly known as the Central Park Five who were exonerated after spending more than a decade in prison for the 1989 rape and beating of a woman who was jogging.\n\nU.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia denied Trump’s motion to dismiss in a brief Thursday night order.\n\nThe five men sued Trump in the midst of last fall’s presidential election campaign, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about them during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump misstated key facts of the case when Harris brought up the matter, saying “They admitted, they said, they pled guilty. And I said, ‘well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty — then they pled we’re not guilty,‘” Trump said.\n\nThe men — Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise — never pleaded guilty; they were convicted after jury trials. Also, no victim died.\n\nIn a statement, their lawyer, Shanin Specter, said they are “gratified by the Court’s ruling and thorough analysis and look forward to discovery, trial and the ultimate vindication of these five fine men.”\n\nThe men had asked for compensatory and punitive damages, saying Trump had knowingly defamed them, purposefully made false statements about them and sought to inflict severe emotional distress on them.\n\nJudge Beetlestone’s order dismissed the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nTrump’s lawyer, Karin Sweigart, in a statement called the lawsuit an “unfounded and meritless attack” on Trump. The judge’s dismissal of certain claims is a “victory,” Sweigart said, and vowed to ”continue fighting to protect the First Amendment rights of not just the President, but all Americans.”\n\nIn the request to dismiss the case, Sweigart had said the president’s statements were protected under Pennsylvania laws that grant civil immunity over statements made on a “matter of public concern.”\n\nSweigart’s request to dismiss also said Trump’s statements were “substantially true,” that he didn’t dispute the men were ultimately exonerated and that he had only intended to portray his thinking in 1989 when, following the men having confessed, Trump purchased a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty.\n\nAt the time, many in New York saw Trump’s ad as calling for the teens to be executed.\n\nThe five men had been teenagers when they were accused of the rape and beating of a white woman jogging in New York City’s Central Park. The five, who are Black and Latino, said they confessed to the crimes under duress. They later recanted, pleading not guilty in court, and were later convicted after jury trials. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 after another person confessed to the crime.\n\nRichardson, the youngest member of the five, was honored by Syracuse University in 2019 after he told Oprah Winfrey that he dreamed of going to SU as a music student when he was jailed at age 14.\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed, Specter said Trump “defamed them in front of 67 million people, which has caused them to seek to clear their names all over again.”\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson attacked it at the time as a “frivolous election interference lawsuit.”","summary":"The group was exonerated after spending more than a decade in prison.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/04/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-central-park-fives-defamation-case-against-trump.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/QTL7UNTMQ5G7HOLFHVRHB3PQ3Q.jpg?auth=0af253b6bc83806988cfdf3267d937e70401dfafe6f97e9e1ef93e5aee41bc11&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 21:10:53","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":310257988,"title":"Karoline Leavitt says what everyone at White House is thinking after Trump's roughest week so far","text":"Press secretary Karoline Leavitt ended her briefing by telling reporters 'thank God it's Friday' after President Donald Trump's roughest week so far. \n\nLeavitt spent just 21 minutes at the podium Friday - an abnormally short time for a White House briefing - before breathing that sigh of relief. \n\nShe had been peppered with questions on a variety of topics including the most obvious - tariffs, the Russia and Iran talks, Fox News' Peter Doocy getting attacked by a bird, and the physical Trump was getting at Walter Reed presently. \n\nCara Castronuova, a former champion boxer turned White House correspondent for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell's Lindell TV, asked Leavitt if the White House planned to release the president's 'fitness plan' as part of his annual physical. \n\n'He actually looks healthier than ever before, healthier than he did eight years ago, I'm sure every one in this room can agree. Is he working out with Bobby Kennedy and eating less McDonald's?' Castronuova asked, cuing laughs. \n\nLeavitt chuckled as well.\n\n'I can confirm the president is in very good shape, as you see on a near daily basis here,' she answered. 'And in that vein, thank God it's Friday. It's been a very long and busy week here at the White House, we'll see you all on Monday.'\n\nShe added that the White House would release Trump's physical results 'as soon a we can.' \n\nThe president will head directly to Joint Base Andrews after departing Walter Reed - heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. \n\nLeavitt said he wouldn't be put under anesthesia during Friday's medical exam - which in the past has meant the vice president has briefly taken over, including when Vice President Kamala Harris became the first woman to hold presidential power when President Joe Biden was getting a colonoscopy. \n\nTrump leaves Washington after a chaotic week - of implementing tariffs - and then delaying some of them, but escalating a trade war with China. \n\nLeavitt was asked Friday why Trump wouldn't just call Chinese President Xi Jinping and get the ball rolling. \n\nShe answered by saying that the U.S. would be 'gracious' if China intended to make a deal.\n\n'If China continues to retaliate, it's not good for China,' she added. \n\nLeavitt was then asked again if China needed to make the first move. \n\nShe punted. \n\n'I'm not going to comment on communications that are happening or may not be happening or either way, we'll leave it to our national security team to get these discussions underway,' she said. \n\nThe press secretary was also pressed on how much medical information about Trump the White House would release. \n\nTrump had publicly called on Biden to receive a cognitive exam in June 2024 - even before his disastrous debate - after the Republican included them as part of his White House physical in 2018. \n\nLeavitt wouldn't expressly say how much of Trump's medical records the public would see - and didn't answer a question directly about whether Trump's new White House physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, would address the White House briefing room. \n\nShe did hammer the Biden White House for what she called 'one of the greatest cover-ups and frankly political scandals this nation has ever seen.' \n\n'Well I can tell you there was certainly a lack of transparency from the former president, from the entire former administration, and frankly, a lot of people in this room when it came to the health and the confidence of the former President of the United States Joe Biden,' Leavitt said.\n\nShe continued: 'This president is clearly committed to transparency. You in this room see him and hear from him on a daily basis. You in this room know from covering him, it's hard to keep up with him.'\n\n'He is a machine working around the clock every single day and the physician after today's physical will provide an update on the report in the effort of transparency,' she added. \n\nDuring Trump's first term, Dr. Ronny Jackson held court in the briefing room for an hour after the president's first physical in January 2018. \n\nDr. Sean Conley didn't do the same, but did brief reporters during Trump's hospitalization with COVID-19 in October 2020.\n\nLeavitt did commit to 'releasing all of the results, as many of the results as possible' from the physical, according to a reporter's question.\n\n'Of course, yes, the physician will do that, I spoke with him this morning,' Leavitt said.","summary":"Press secretary Karoline Leavitt ended her briefing Friday with a telling sign of how chaotic President Donald Trump's tariff week had been.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14600577/karoline-leavitt-thank-god-week-over.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/11/21/97187267-0-image-a-9_1744402635498.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 21:08:35","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":310253240,"title":"Rep.

James Clyburn, D-S.C., called former Vice President Kamala Harris a “great candidate” who was ill-served by her campaign team, during an interview on Friday.\n\nThe Democratic congressman was responding to CNN anchor Kate Bolduan asking about a New York Times report which said that since Harris’ loss in the 2024 election, the former vice president has been mulling over another bid for the White House or entering the 2026 California gubernatorial race.\n\nClyburn said he wasn’t going to advise Harris on her next steps but praised her as a “tremendous talent” who had been let down by her campaign staff during the presidential race.\n\n“I will say this. I think that she is a tremendous talent. I think she ran a great campaign. I think she was ill-served in that campaign by people who should have listened to some of us who saw and felt things,” Clyburn began. \n\n“Listen to Bill Clinton when he told them what was going on.

Every time Donald Trump sets fire to another piece of the global order, I find myself staring at the same spot, wondering how we got here – and what I’ve missed in the script of modern politics.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to “teach a lesson” to all of America’s trading partners. True to form, he didn’t waste time testing that theory. In February, he launched a trial balloon by slapping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. The pretext? They weren’t doing enough to curb migration and drug trafficking. Ottawa and Mexico City quickly came to the table, validating Trump’s belief that the tariff stick could beat other nations into talks. That success emboldened him to try the same strategy globally.\n\nSo he did. And what followed was, frankly, more entertaining than many had expected.\n\nMarkets crashed. Oil prices plunged. Economists predicted a recession. Americans started stockpiling food and supplies. The media raced to outdo one another with the most ridiculous nicknames for the unfolding chaos. Meanwhile, the White House calmly insisted everything was “going to plan.”\n\nAnd what exactly was the plan? Trump himself made it quite clear: to make the world “kiss his ass.”\n\nThis, in essence, is the classic Trump playbook – what some call his “psychopath strategy.” He creates a crisis, then offers to dial it back as a “goodwill gesture,” demanding concessions in return. In this case, those concessions were to include correcting America’s trade deficits and forcing production to return home.\n\nBut this time, Trump may have overplayed his hand. Starting a trade war with the entire world simultaneously didn’t just rattle governments – it shook Americans at home. As the reality of a potential recession hit, Trump’s approval ratings plummeted. Many in the public began to view the president and his team as, to put it mildly, lacking in competence.\n\nThe widespread backlash gave Democrats a rare opportunity to go on the offensive. Anti-tariff rallies sprang up across the country, organized by liberal groups and activists. Trump faced public rebukes from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris. Congressman Al Green even announced plans to introduce articles of impeachment – for a third time.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the left sounding the alarm.\n\nRepublican Senator Ted Cruz, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, warned of a potential “bloodbath” for the GOP in the 2026 midterms if the tariffs triggered a full-scale recession. Billionaires on Wall Street – many of whom had backed Trump – voiced their displeasure. Most notably, Elon Musk, a longtime Trump ally, publicly criticized the president’s trade adviser Peter Navarro, calling him “an idiot” and “dumber than a bag of potatoes.”\n\nFaced with political, financial, and public pressure, the Trump administration acted quickly. On April 9, Trump announced that 75 countries had contacted him requesting deals. In response, he reduced tariffs to 10% for a 90-day window, framing it as an opportunity for negotiation.\n\nBut not everyone is budging.\n\nChina, in particular, has proven to be a far more resilient adversary. The US–China trade war continues to escalate, with tit-for-tat tariffs now reaching 140% – and climbing. If it goes on unchecked, trade between the world’s two largest economies could shrink by 80%, with catastrophic consequences for both sides.\n\nSo what’s next?\n\nTwo scenarios seem likely. Either Trump pressures his trading partners into quick concessions and declares victory, or he walks away halfway through and finds a new distraction – much like he did with Ukraine.\n\nRemember the fanfare when Trump promised to deliver peace in Ukraine “within 24 hours”? Or even “within 100 days”? The moment it became clear that wasn’t going to happen, the White House stopped talking about it altogether.\n\nThat’s Trump’s style. Create a spectacle, dominate the headlines, then quietly move on once it stops working.\n\nAnd let’s not forget – he still has a few cards left to play. Gaza, for instance, which he once dubbed the “Riviera of the Middle East.” Or the Iranian nuclear issue, another favorite of his unrealized “brilliant ideas.”\n\nSo no – I won’t say I’ve seen everything. If anything, recent events have taught me that with Trump, there’s always more madness just around the corner.\n\nAnd the scariest part? Sometimes it works.\n\nThis article was first published by the online newspaper Gazeta.ru and was translated and edited by the RT team","summary":"Did the President of the United States get what he wanted? \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/615636-why-trump-quickly-rolled-back/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/67f9789485f54040840b33a3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 20:18:03","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":310237092,"title":"Fox News hires Hugh Hewitt after messy exit from Washington Post","text":"Hugh Hewitt, the veteran conservative commentator who quit the Washington Post in a huff this past fall after an on-air argument with left-leaning colleagues, has joined Fox News Media as a contributor, the network announced Thursday.\n\nHewitt will provide political analysis across all Fox News platforms and is set to make his debut appearance on Thursday’s edition of the evening news wrap-up show “Special Report with Bret Baier.”\n\nFox News, which shares common ownership with The Post, released a statement citing Hewitt’s experience as a nationally syndicated radio talk show host as well as a contributing columnist for several publications.\n\nHewitt’s arrival at Fox comes months after he walked off the set of the online Washington Post program “First Look” following a heated exchange with liberal columnists Jonathan Capehart and Ruth Marcus over claims surrounding President Donald Trump and the recent election.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Capehart had questioned whether Trump was “laying the groundwork” to contest the election by citing alleged irregularities in Bucks County, Pa.\n\nMarcus agreed, saying the former president had been preparing for such a challenge for months.\n\nHewitt attempted to respond but was interrupted by Capehart, who insisted Marcus finish her point.\n\nWhen given the opportunity to speak, Hewitt defended the Trump campaign’s legal efforts, pointing out that a judge had sided with Republicans in extending voting hours in Bucks County after voters were reportedly turned away after a 5 p.m. deadline.\n\n“We are news people, even though we have opinions, and we have to report the whole story if we bring up part of the story,” Hewitt said.\n\n“So yes, he’s upset about Bucks County, but he was right and he won in court.

would reorient the Washington Post editorial page so that it would tout “personal liberties and free markets” — a move that prompted the resignation of opinions editor David Shipley.\n\nDozens of prominent staffers have left the paper in the wake of its controversial decision to block its editorial board from publishing an endorsement of the Democratic nominee, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, just prior to the Nov. 5 election.","summary":"Hewitt will provide analysis across all Fox News platforms and is set to make his debut appearance on Thursday's \"Special Report with Bret

Move for Fast Cash","text":"Controversial figure Omarosa Manigault-Newman has revealed why appearing on the new reality show Got To Get Out was so high-stakes for her. \n\nIn an exclusive new interview with DailyMail.com, Omarosa revealed she had a secret hidden debt that made her starring role as a cast member was ‘so hard’. \n\nThere was a $1 million prize on the line.\n\nThe new show, which premieres Friday on Hulu, features 20 television personalities stuck in a mansion who must plot their way out of the property.\n\nHowever, the longer it takes them to get out, the more the prize money decreases. \n\nSo time is money, literally. \n\nThe show’s description explains that contestants ‘can split the money equally in the end, or at any point in time, try to make their escape with the accumulated money all for themselves, leaving others to start again at $0.’\n\nOmarosa, who got her start on Donald Trump’s The Apprentice, is part of a 20 strong cast, which includes The Hills star Spencer Pratt, former Real Housewives of Atlanta members Cynthia Bailey and Kim Zolciak, and Dancing With the Stars performer Val Chmerkovskiy.\n\nOmarosa revealed she was especially motivated to win because the money could clear her student loans.\n\n‘This was an opportunity to win a lot of money, a life-changing amount of money,’ Omarosa told DailyMail.com.\n\n‘So with the debt that I have from school, loans and all that, this is the kind of money that would be very, very helpful,’ she revealed. \n\n‘This was tough, but it was a great experience.’\n\nCurrently, the 51-year-old is in law school at Southern University, and will be graduating next month.\n\nShe also has earned degrees from Howard University, United Theological Seminary and Payne Theological Seminary.\n\nOmarosa noted during her interview with DailyMail.com that her time on reality TV has been ‘all in fun.’\n\n‘I think people know that you do what you have to do on the shows, yes, I push the limits, yes I scheme and backstab and do all that, but it’s all entertaining and all for the fans,’ she admitted.\n\n‘It’s all for the fans, and I know that they’re going to love the game play of Got To Get Out.’\n\nHer appearance on Got To Get Out comes months after President Donald Trump claimed that he only hired the Apprentice star Omarosa as a White House aide as an ‘experiment’ and fired her because everybody ‘hated’ her and she was ‘late all the time.’\n\nThe revelation came in the book Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass by Variety’s Co-Editor-in-Chief Ramin Setoodeh.\n\nIn the book, Setoodeh talked to Trump about Omarosa’s White House dismissal for the first time.\n\nAfter three stints on The Apprentice and appearances on the 2016 campaign trail, Trump announced he was hiring the former reality star just weeks before his 2017 swearing-in – as assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison.\n\nShe lasted until December – fired by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly over overuse of the White House car service, Politico reported, and other bad behavior, DailyMail.com explained.\n\nTrump told Setoodeh the issues were even more broad.\n\n‘I saw her very little in the White House. The White House is a very big place! It’s buildings, actually. But the people hated her in Washington,’ he said.\n\n‘Her personality – she was late all the time. She wouldn’t show up,’ the ex-president continued. ‘Look, I tried to rehabilitate her reputation as an experiment.’\n\n‘And when I did, I said, “This probably won’t work out but let’s see what happens,”‘ Trump added. ‘And I also said… “When she gets fired, you always have to pay a price.” It’s too bad. In the White House, she didn’t cut the mustard.’\n\nOmarosa had worked in the White House before – under Democratic President Bill Clinton – but entered Trumpworld in 2004 as a contestant on season one of The Apprentice.\n\nIn 2018, she released a book titled Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House, which detailed her time working under the President.\n\nShe endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nControversial figure Omarosa Manigault-Newman has revealed why appearing on the new reality show&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Debt-Stricken Former Trump Aide from The Apprentice Discloses Her Urgent Move for Fast Cash first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/debt-stricken-former-trump-aide-from-the-apprentice-discloses-her-urgent-move-for-fast-cash/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-Debt-ridden-Trump-aide-who-met-President-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 19:59:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.171},{"id":310239308,"title":"Trump’s new favorite children","text":"Something unexpected happened during Trump’s presidential campaign: his two youngest children, both unplanned and neither initially welcomed with enthusiasm, became critical to his political career. Despite having five children from three marriages, he never imagined that 31-year-old Tiffany and 18-year-old Barron would be more instrumental in his return to the White House than his three older children—Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. The three had been deeply involved in his 2016 campaign and first term, yet in 2024, they were almost irrelevant. This time, it was the moment for the family’s 'black sheep'. Once in a while, while riding in his limousine or private jet, Barron would call Trump and give him helpful strategic advice. \"There have been many times I've been traveling in the course of the campaign with my father-in-law in the car going to places\", said Lara Trump, Eric’s wife and one of Trump’s closest confidantes. “And Barron would call and say, 'Dad, I've an idea as to how you can get more votes. You need to go to this football stadium or appear on that podcast', or whatever it was. He was always throwing ideas, focusing on young voters. We have to give Barron some serious credit.” Barron's mother, Melania Trump, said after the election that he deliberately stayed out of the spotlight, but he makes everyone else look small. He’s smart, very funny, and is going to do amazing things. “He was very vocal” in giving advice to his father on what media appearances to make in order to gain a more favorable shift among younger people. He knew exactly who his father needs to contact and to talk to,” Melania said, \"He knows his generation, because nowadays the young generation, they don’t sit in front of the TV anymore,” Melania said. \"They rely on podcasts, social media, and live streamers to get information. As a result, Barron brought in so many young people”, she added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: https://bit.ly/4eJ37pE | Apple App Store: https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNv >> This isn’t just the usual Trump family exaggeration. According to election night polling, there was a sharp shift rightward among Generation Z, particularly among young men, and especially young white men. Vice President Kamala Harris still won more than half of the votes from this generation, which came of age during the COVID-19 pandemic, but her share was significantly lower than what Democratic candidates typically receive from young voters. Trump, an aging 78-year-old who may or may not know how to send emails, and whose last known favorite song is Y.M.C.A. by the Village People, ran a campaign that was more relevant to young voters than Harris, a 60-year-old who aligns herself with Beyoncé. And much of that, it turns out, was thanks to Barron. Tiffany Trump’s influence was more indirect but still highly significant, she simply married someone whose father knew exactly what Trump needed to win Michigan, the critical swing state. Tiffany's husband, Michael Boulos, is the son of Lebanese-born billionaire Massad Boulos, who now serves as a special adviser to Trump on Middle East affairs. The chemistry between Trump and Boulos Sr. was immediate, ever since Tiffany first introduced her boyfriend, who is four years younger than her. During the campaign, Boulos Sr. became an influential figure in Trump’s inner circle. Most notably, he worked tirelessly in Michigan, spending time in Muslim communities and helping to persuade them, at the very least, not to vote for Harris, whom he accused of committing “genocide in Gaza”, while making vague promises that Trump would help the Palestinians. When Trump secured a victory in Michigan, with a significant portion of the state’s Muslim population voting for him, Boulos got all the credit. On election night, Tiffany and Barron stood onstage at Mar-a-Lago, facing a crowd of cheering supporters. They had both been there also when Trump won the election in 2016, but back then, Barron was a silent ten-year-old, and Tiffany was the daughter Trump rarely mentioned. Eight years later, they had helped him orchestrate what is being hailed as the greatest political comeback in American history. The story feels like a plotline from Succession, but now the question is, what does it mean for their future? Tiffany’s transformation: the jabs, the revenge, and the rise in her status During Donald Trump’s first term, the White House operated like a revolving door, with staff coming and going at an unprecedented pace. Few departures were as memorable as that of Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted just 11 days as White House communications director. Most firings stemmed from Trump’s insistence on absolute loyalty if you strayed even slightly from his line, you were out. But the dismissal of Madeleine Westerhout, a name largely unknown outside Trump’s inner circle, was different. It was a scandal even by Trump-world standards. Westerhout had been a loyal Trump aide since 2015, back when his candidacy seemed too implausible to even be a punchline. Once in the White House, she held a critical position as a key gatekeeper to the Oval Office, screening Trump's official calls and controlling the access of outside advisers. “Madeleine is the key. She's the secret,” Trump once said. So when she was abruptly fired, there had to be a serious reason. It turned out that two weeks before her dismissal, Westerhout had been drinking with reporters at a bar and had a little too much. She opened up to the reporters that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany. \"Trump couldn’t pick Tiffany out of a crowd\", she said, adding that \"the President did not like being in pictures with Tiffany because he perceived her as overweight.\" Westerhout was fired, not personally by Trump, who prefers to have others do his dirty work, but by his aides, who correctly saw that drunkenly gossiping with journalists was unacceptable for someone who had access to the president’s every move. But it’s doubtful Trump himself was particularly offended by her remarks about Tiffany. After all, at his wedding to Melania, he had assigned Tiffany the task of handing out the ceremony programs to guests. Tiffany was born in October 1993, at the height of Trump’s affair with model-actress Marla Maples. The romance had started while he was still married to Ivana, the mother of his three eldest children. Trump did cut Tiffany’s umbilical cord, which already made her more special than Ivanka, Donald Jr., Eric, or Barron, none of whom he had bothered to show up for at birth. Twenty minutes after she was born, he was on the phone with The New York Times, announcing his newborn daughter, whom he planned to name after the jewelry store located beneath Trump Tower. Trump’s marriage to Maples lasted four years. When they divorced, Maples took Tiffany to California, raising her alone in a Los Angeles suburb. Trump paid child support and covered her tuition, but Tiffany’s relationship with her half-siblings -Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka - was distant. “Her father wasn’t able to be there with day-to-day skills as a parent\", Maples told PEOPLE. \"He loves his kids. There’s no doubt. But everything was a bit of a negotiation. As far as time, it was just me, but it was important for me that Tiffany would form her own relationship with him.\" Trump never wanted a child with Maples, and for much of Tiffany’s life, he made sure she knew it. In one interview, she admitted, “It will be … a chance to be Tiffany, not just ‘Tiffany Trump.'” Just a month before the 2016 election, Trump sat for an interview with Melania and his four eldest children. Tiffany spoke only once during the entire interview, visibly searching for a way out the rest of the time. On election night in 2016, Trump took the stage and said, \"I'm very proud of my children. I mean, I'm just looking at them right now as an example... but I'm very proud 'cause Don and Eric and Ivanka and, you know, to a lesser extent 'cause she just got out of school, out of college, but, uh, Tiffany, who's also been so terrific.\" On Trump's inauguration night in January 2017, Tiffany stayed at a Washington hotel, while her siblings stayed at the White House. But she got a small moment of revenge in one of her rare public appearances alongside the family. When Trump was looking to get a kiss from her, she very visibly dodged him. The clip went viral. On election night in 2016, Trump referred to Tiffany: \"I'm very proud of my children. I mean, I'm just looking at them right now as an example... but I'm very proud 'cause Don and Eric and Ivanka and, you know, to a lesser extent 'cause she just got out of school, out of college, but, uh, Tiffany, who's also been so terrific.\" Whether by coincidence or not, Trump’s attitude toward Tiffany started to shift around the time she began dating Michael Boulos, whom she met in 2018 at a Mykonos club owned by Lindsay Lohan. Boulos was born in Houston, but when he was young his family moved to Nigeria, where his father, Dr. Massad Boulos, founded a conglomerate across West Africa. Boulos Jr. attended an American school in Lagos and became a celebrity in Nigeria, a country Trump infamously referred to in 2018 as a “shithole.” When asked about the remark, sources close to Tiffany told PEOPLE, “Tiffany’s not keeping her finger on the pulse of that BS\". Almost everything about Boulos’ background seemed like it would trigger someone who is as racist as Trump. But as always, Trump made exceptions when it suited him. He had long done business with wealthy Arab investors and enjoyed rubbing shoulders with them. The entire Trump family has close ties to Saudi royals and Gulf billionaires. Boulos came from money - the ultimate Trumpian prerequisite. Boulos gifted Tiffany a $600,000 bracelet, which greatly impressed Trump. After meeting the father Massad Boulos, Trump fully embraced the match. Tiffany announced her engagement to Boulos on January 19, 2021, the day before Trump left the White House. In the Rose Garden, Boulos slipped a $1.2 million ring on her finger, and Tiffany posted beautiful pictures on Instagram. Trump, notably, stopped mocking her in public, and two years ago he hosted a lavish wedding for her at Mar-a-Lago. Her new standing within the family likely won’t change her preference for staying out of the spotlight, but she can now walk into Trump family gatherings with far more confidence. Tiffany and Boulos live in Miami, not far from Ivanka and Jared Kushner, Donald Jr. and his ever-changing partner, and, of course, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Last October, Trump proudly announced that Tiffany was expecting her first child - his 11th grandchild. She’s no longer the black sheep. Barron stayed in the shadows but brought in the youth vote Like Tiffany, Barron was not a child Trump had planned. Melania once recalled breaking the news to her husband: \"He came home, and I told him he'd be a daddy, and his reaction was...at first he needed to take it in. It was a real surprise. And then he was very happy.\" Barron was just a few months old when Trump famously spent several nights in the company of adult film star Stormy Daniels. On the other hand, at least he got to choose his son’s name. Children of U.S. presidents don’t choose the spotlight, and American media traditionally respects their privacy, especially while they are under 18. When Trump entered the White House, four of his five children were already adults, but Barron was just ten, and his early years there were difficult. Katie Rich, a writer for Saturday Night Live, posted a tasteless tweet that \"Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter.\" Comedian Rosie O’Donnell, whose own daughter is on the autism spectrum, tweeted: “Barron Trump Autistic? If so - what an amazing opportunity to bring attention to the Autism epidemic.” The tweet included an edited video that suggested Barron was autistic. The backlash was swift and justified. Melania Trump threatened to sue YouTube, and the video was removed. Barron received unexpected support from Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Bill and Hillary, who had faced similar treatment from the right-wing media in the 1990s when she was just 12. \"It's high time the media and everyone leave Barron Trump alone and let him have the private childhood he deserves.\" Speculation about Barron being on the autism spectrum stemmed largely from photos of him as a solemn-faced child who rarely smiled and often appeared disengaged. Melania dismissed the rumors outright: \"He is a very strong-minded, very special, smart boy. He is independent and opinionated and knows exactly what he wants. Sometimes, I call him Little Donald. He is a mixture of us in looks, but his personality is why I call him little Donald.\" From what little is known about his childhood, he loved playing with cars and helicopters, enjoyed soccer when he went outside, and was highly skilled with computers. Eight years after being mocked by liberal corners of the internet, Barron is getting his quiet revenge. He still avoids the spotlight, doesn’t give interviews, and rarely speaks in public, but his presence on social media is significant. In one of his rallies, Trump said to Barron: “You’re pretty popular, he might be more popular than Don and Eric. So Barron, it’s good to have you. Barron, had such a nice, easy life. Now, it’s a little bit changed.\" Now a freshman at New York University’s prestigious Stern School of Business, Barron spends his days on campus before returning to his “dorm” - an entire floor at the Trump Tower penthouse on Fifth Avenue.

Trump had each department deliver a brief report during the meeting that lasted for more than an hour.\n\nThe secretaries used the opportunity to laud Trump for his leadership style despite the stock market reeling from his unpopular tariff policies.\n\n“We are more than friends. We’ve all become family. I think what you have assembled in your vision is a turning point, inflection point in American history. Just being a part of that is the greatest honor, so thank you for that,” Rollins said during the meeting. \n\nOrnstein responded to a clip of her remarks, writing: “Going for the Grovel Gold!”. \n\nHowever, Rollins appeared to have some competition for the “Grovel Gold.”\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick praised Trump for his work on tariffs despite his decision to roll back most of the tariffs earlier this week. This comes despite the stock market plummeting and warnings from Wall Street executives of a possible recession. \n\n“We have so many countries to talk to. It’s incredible. I’m not sure we could ever have enough time in a day because we have so many to talk to. And they come with offers that they never, ever, ever would have come with but for the moves the president has made, demanding that people treat the United States with respect. We’re getting the respect we deserve now,” Lutnick said.\n\nAnd Attorney General Pam Bondi applauded Trump’s win over former Vice President Kamala Harris in November. \n\n“You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority. Americans want you to be president because of your agenda. And the courts are ruling that you have the authority to determine how the money of this country will be spent,\" she said. \n\nTrump narrowly won the 2024 election over Harris. According to a report from The Washington Post, Trump’s margin of victory over Harris in the national popular vote was “the smallest of any president who secured a popular-vote win since Richard M. Nixon in 1968.\"\n\nTrump’s Cabinet members were mocked online for their unwavering praise of the president.\n\n“If you can watch even these short clips of Trump’s cabinet meeting without having a wave of foreboding wash over you, I’m not sure you’ve ever understood what is great about this nation. This abject fealty to one man is not American, and we overlook the insanity at our peril,” one user wrote on social media platform X.\n\nAnother user said: “These cabinet meetings under Trump look less like U.S. governance and more like a third-world loyalty parade.Everyone takes turns praising him like it’s North Korea. This isn’t leadership—it’s a cringe cult of personality.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama’s adviser, Tommy Vietor, also weighed in. \n\n“Everyone should watch these Trump admin cabinet meetings. Most modern cabinet meetings are more performance than debate or discussion, but this is some North Korea-style clapping and weeping for Dear Leader humiliation for all involved,” he wrote on X.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Murray did not just use his appearance on the popular, increasingly influential podcast to debate Smith, though. He also used it to question Rogan for his habit of inviting guests on his show who harbor “counter-historical” views.\n\n“I just feel we should get it out straight away,” Murray told Rogan. “I feel you’ve opened the door to quite a lot of people who have now got a big platform who have been throwing out counter-historical stuff of a very dangerous kind.”\n\nMurray argued that Rogan should be more careful about platforming guests who share opinions about global conflicts and global history without being experts on the matters in question. The British cultural commentator specifically called out said guests’ tendency to claim they are “just asking questions” when they are, in fact, promoting misinformation or dangerous conspiracy theories.\n\n“If you throw a lot of s—t out there, there’s some point at which ‘I’m just raising questions’ is not a valid thing anymore,” Murray argued. “You’re not asking questions. You’re telling people something.”\n\nRogan countered that he does not choose his guests based on their personal beliefs but in his interest in them. “I don’t think about it that way,” the podcast host said. “I just think, ‘I’d like to talk to that person.’”\n\nMurray is not the first to criticize Rogan for his guest selection over the years. The podcast host’s tendency to focus on conspiracy theories and interview conspiracy theorists has been called out by plenty of figures both prominent and not, particularly during America’s recent election cycles and the COVID pandemic.\n\nRogan has never shied away from wading into political matters with his guests on his podcasts. Near the end of 2024, he even famously endorsed Donald Trump over Kamala Harris for president. Murray’s comments, consequently, come at a time when many are discussing the dangers of comedians and entertainers becoming mainstream platformers for political and cultural ideas that may not always hold up to factual, historical or moral scrutiny.\n\nThe post Joe Rogan Podcast Guest Confronts Him for Platforming ‘Counter-Historical’ Views: ‘Just Raising Questions Is Not a Valid Thing’ appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/joe-rogan-podcast-guest-confronts-183811690.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gB6jtAzpDm5zFI1fJBEo9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thewrap.com/6b8b4ef6fb01859e36711f94db5cec01","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 18:38:11","author":"Alex Welch","authors":["Alex Welch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":310272358,"title":"Judge refuses to dismiss Central Park Five's defamation case against Trump","text":"A federal judge has rejected President Trump's effort to dismiss a defamation lawsuit against him filed by the men known as the Central Park Five, who were exonerated after spending more than a decade in prison for the 1989 rape and beating of a woman who was jogging. U.S. Dist. Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia denied Trump's motion to dismiss in a brief Thursday night order. The five men sued Trump in the midst of last fall's presidential election campaign, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about them during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump misstated key facts of the case when Harris brought up the matter, saying, “They admitted, they said, they pled guilty. And I said, ’well, if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty — then they pled we're not guilty,'” Trump said. The men — Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise — never pleaded guilty; they were convicted after jury trials. Also, no victim died. In a statement, their lawyer, Shanin Specter, said they are \"gratified by the Court’s ruling and thorough analysis and look forward to discovery, trial and the ultimate vindication of these five fine men.” Trump's lawyer did not immediately respond to an inquiry Friday. The men had asked for compensatory and punitive damages, saying Trump had knowingly defamed them, purposefully made false statements about them and sought to inflict severe emotional distress on them. Judge Beetlestone's order dismissed one of the claims, for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In the request to dismiss the case, Trump's lawyer had said the president's statements were protected under Pennsylvania laws that grant civil immunity over statements made on a “matter of public concern.” The request to dismiss also said Trump's statements were “substantially true,” that he didn't dispute the men were ultimately exonerated and that he had intended to portray his thinking in 1989 when, following the men having confessed, Trump purchased a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. At the time, many in New York believed Trump’s ad was akin to calling for the teens to be executed. The five men had been teenagers when they were accused of the rape and beating of a white woman jogging in New York City’s Central Park. The five, who are Black and Latino, said they confessed to the crimes under duress. They later recanted, pleading not guilty in court, and were later convicted after jury trials. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 after another person confessed to the crime. When the lawsuit was filed, Specter said Trump “defamed them in front of 67 million people, which has caused them to seek to clear their names all over again.\" A Trump campaign spokesperson attacked it at the time as a \"frivolous election interference lawsuit.” Levy writes for the Associated Press.","summary":"The five men accuse Donald Trump of making 'false and defamatory statements' about them during the Sept. 10 debate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-04-11/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-central-park-fives-defamation-case-against-president-trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b44773/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+255/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2Fa6%2Fbc01811ce6b9d31862fd48c86be1%2Fb43e3a4c81a043dca532","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 18:24:27","author":"Marc Levy","authors":["Marc Levy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":310221636,"title":"Rep.

But those occasions have rarely been routine with Donald Trump..Trump on Friday undergoes his first check-up since retaking office, with a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center — an event that puts the spotlight on the well-being of a 78-year-old president long reluctant about sharing details on his health. .The focus on presidential fitness intensified during the 2024 election, which initially pitted Trump against former President Joe Biden, the two oldest major-party candidates in US history. Mental acuity concerns amplified by a rocky debate performance eventually prompted Biden to drop out..Not just penguins on Antarctic islands hit by Trump tariffs.Trump seized on voter anxiety over his predecessor’s sharpness and vigor while the Republican’s team shared little about his own health, even after he survived an assassin’s bullet that grazed his ear..Trump in January became the oldest president ever sworn into office — a record he previously held during his first term that Biden then took upon his inauguration in 2021..The president is a fervent golfer, but he is not known to engage regularly in other forms of exercise. He is also a famed consumer of fast food, in particular McDonald’s and Diet Cokes. His health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is undertaking a massive overhaul of public health that has taken aim at soda, candy and ultraprocessed foods..Trump’s had health scares in the past, including a coronavirus infection in Oct. 2020 that saw him flown to Walter Reed aboard Marine One for a hospital stay. He has embarked on a second stint in a notoriously stressful job, in which past officeholders often visibly age at the White House..Trump pauses tariffs for 90 days but hits China harder.Friday’s visit caps a whirlwind week that saw Trump impose higher tariffs on select countries, delivering on one of his signature economic policy pledges, only to dramatically reverse course hours later following turmoil in equity and bond markets..‘Never felt better’.While presidents are not required to undergo physical health exams or release the results publicly, it’s been standard practice for decades with the results published by the White House physician. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella is serving as Trump’s personal doctor..The president cast the exam in a social media post this week as routine and unnecessary, writing: “I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!”.Trump stirred controversy with past physicals, dating back to his first campaign. In Dec. 2015, Trump released a note from then-personal doctor Harold Bornstein claiming he would be the “healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein, who has since died, later said Trump dictated the letter..The American public was able to glean more details about Trump’s health when he was in office. While then-physician Ronny Jackson gave Trump glowing reviews, exams revealed he had a common form of heart disease and was obese according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. .Jackson, now a House Republican from Texas, later became enmeshed in his own scandal over allegations he improperly dispensed prescription drugs and created a hostile work environment while White House physician — claims he denied. The allegations sunk Jackson’s nomination by Trump in 2018 to lead the Veterans Affairs Department..During his last term, Trump waited more than a year after his inauguration for his first check-up. Another visit to Walter Reed in Nov. 2019, just months after a previous checkup, spurred speculation the president was unwell, though the White House cast it as a routine exam..In 2020, then-White House physician Sean Conley reported no significant changes to the president’s health in a report that used “summarized data” from visits conducted between the Nov. 2019 visit and April 2020. There was no explanation for why Trump’s physical took six months to complete..Cognitive tests.Early in the first term, Trump’s critics questioned his fitness for office, particularly after a book by author Michael Wolff claimed that top staff believed he was mentally unwell. .Trump has touted his performance in cognitive tests, with Jackson saying in 2018 that he conducted such an exam at the president’s request and found “absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability and neurological function.”.In 2020, Trump said he had undergone a cognitive test a year earlier and in an interview hailed his own performance by proclaiming “person, woman, man, camera, TV,” to explain how he repeated certain words to demonstrate his memory. The moment went viral..Questions about how much health information those seeking the nation’s highest office should disclose became a flash point in the 2024 race. .Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who challenged Trump unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination, attacked both him and Biden by calling for mental competency tests for politicians older than 75. .Polls showed voters regularly worried about the fitness of Biden — at 82, the oldest person ever to hold the presidency. A series of recent news reports and books have detailed how those around him witnessed his decline in office. .The dynamic over age shifted after Vice President Kamala Harris, 60, entered the race. Her team often highlighted Trump’s propensity for verbal gaffes to question his fitness to serve..Trump in 2023 released a letter from a personal physician that claimed he was in “excellent” physical and mental health, without providing any supporting data.","summary":"Trump Heads to Physical, Putting Focus on 78-Year-Old’s Health","url":"https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/trump-oldest-us-president-sworn-into-office-undergoes-physical-1.500090576","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2025-03-05/098fznc1/20250305-trump?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 18:12:54","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ae","sentiment":0.331},{"id":310228810,"title":"Wait...Did Trump Want to Start a Tariff War For This Sneaky Reason All This Time??","text":"People of America, we must remember that before President Donald Trump became the most important political official in the world, he was a businessman. For this reason, following his sudden 90-day tariff pause, the Democrats are suspicious that his scheme was less about Chinese imports and more about the stock markets.\n\nTrump took to social media to celebrate his tariff tirade Wednesday writing, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” in reference to the stock market - which, at the time of his post, was performing pretty low. He had just come off the high of announcing his decision from earlier this month to raise tariffs on Chinese goods up to a whopping 145 percent. On the other hand, China decided to match his gangsta and retaliate with their own tariff spike on American goods. As of Friday, their tariff is up to 125 percent, per The New York Times.\n\nHowever, just hours after his post, Trump followed up with a shocking announcement that he would pose a 90-day tariff pause on China and lower tariffs on other countries down to 10 percent. Within seconds of his post, stocks went through the roof. For example, Nasdaq climbed nearly 12 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8 percent, CNBC’s analysis. Not to mention, stock for Trump’s media group that controls the Truth Social app shot up by 22 percent, per The Guardian.\n\nObviously, the time-out in the tariff game led to some concerns across Democratic legislators who already had their eyes peeled searching for Trump’s angle. A group of 19 Democrat House members and a group of six Senators swiftly sent letters to the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, requesting an investigation into whether the president and his buddies violated federal securities laws.\n\n“It is unconscionable that as American families are concerned about their financial security during this economic crisis entirely manufactured by the President, insiders may have actively profited from the market volatility and potentially perpetrated financial fraud on the American public,” the Senators wrote, requesting a response by April 25.\n\nWelp, former Vice President Kamala Harris did warn that Trump would pull a scheme to make his rich friends richer, ushering the rest of us into a recession by the summer. According to J.P. Morgan, our probability of going into a recession now stands at 40 percent - a ten percent increased difference from the beginning of the year. \n\nIt will be hard for Trump to deny the market manipulation allegations but not only because of his carefully timed posts. He also exposed his hand to reporters in the press conference following it. \n\n“The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” Trump told reporters Wednesday, via CNN. \n\nMeanwhile, our trading partners including several members of the European Union, India, Japan and Brazil seek to negotiate further over the tariff deals, per TIME.","summary":"People of America, we must remember that before President Donald Trump became the most important political official in the world, he was a businessman.

In the request to dismiss the case, Trump's lawyer had said the president's statements were protected under Pennsylvania laws that grant civil immunity over statements made on a “matter of public concern.” The request to dismiss also said Trump's statements were “substantially true,” that he didn't dispute the men were ultimately exonerated and that he had intended to portray his thinking in 1989 when, following the men having confessed, Trump purchased a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty.

During \"CNN News Central,\" Enten pulled up new aggregate poll numbers showing that Americans currently believe that Republicans care about U.S. citizens as much as Democratic Party figures do, a poll that has historically favored the Democrats. \"This, to me, is one of the most shocking pieces of poll data that I truly, truthfully have seen this year, or maybe in any prior year,\" he said, noting elsewhere how unexpected these numbers are after Trump unveiled his controversial tariffs earlier this month. JURY FINDS CNN COMMITTED DEFAMATION AGAINST NAVY VETERAN, SETTLEMENT REACHED ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES Enten displayed poll numbers showing that in the three previous decades, the Democratic Party smashed the GOP in the category of which party is believed to care more about Americans. In 1994, the party had a +19 majority over the GOP; in 2005, a+23; and in 2017, a +13. The post-tariffs numbers in that category – taken from a Quinnipiac poll – showed a tie between the two parties. \"And why is that so surprising? Because I want you to take a look at prior years – Democrats always lead on this question,\" Enten said. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS 'I TOLD YOU SO' WHILE SLAMMING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM IN LATEST PUBLIC APPEARANCE \"And now all of a sudden, a tie?,\" he continued. \"All of a sudden, the Democrats, who were the party of the people. No more! No more! We get a tie on this question, on a question that has traditionally overwhelmingly been a Democratic advantage… It‘s truly something I would not have expected to see, especially after this tariff war had begun.\" Anchor Kate Bolduan asked the data reporter with which demographic group the Republican Party has been making the most gains. Enten moved to a new graph which showed polling done on college-educated and non-college-educated voters in 2017 and today. \"Among those with a college degree, it’s the same score – plus 18 points for Democrats in 2017, plus 18 points for Democrats now. But look among non-college voters. Look here. It was plus seven for Democrats in 2017. And now Republicans have overwhelmingly gained plus nine points.\" Enten stated that the pro-GOP swing represented the party’s gains among the \"working class.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Bolduan then asked Enten to show any current numbers indicating whether one party has an advantage over the other if the 2026 midterm elections were held today. The data guru revealed that at this time in 2017, the Democratic Party had a plus seven advantage in that category, while today, it only has a plus one.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and \n joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have \n trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily \n Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — \n the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there \n are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that \n we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need \n revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent \n we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and \n lightning fast website you deserve.\n\nPatriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters \n and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.\n\nWe can save America together.\n\nBecome a Daily Caller Patriot today.","summary":"Reached out to universities including Stanford and Howard","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/11/kamala-harris-new-venture-institute-policy-ideas/","image":"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2162789084-scaled-e1744379719371.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 15:49:28","author":"Nick Pope","authors":["Nick Pope"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":310232410,"title":"Judge refuses to dismiss Central Park Five's defamation case against President Trump","text":"HARRISBURG, Pa.

He’s been using it for years and has even done comedy bits that involved mimicking disabled children. Last year, he announced that the word was “coming back strong” among high school kids. \n\nPresident Donald Trump’s megadonor and top adviser Elon Musk also regularly throws out the word on his social media platform X, where he has nearly 219 million followers. He’s used it against astronauts, lawyers, A-list actors, students, and even Trump’s top trade advisor. \n\nThe world’s richest man said Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro was “dumber than a sack of bricks” and called him “Peter Retardo.”\n\nAnd when Trump was running against former President Joe Biden, his aides reportedly had to stop him from nicknaming his opponent “Retarded Joe Biden.”\n\nHe eventually settled on “Sleepy Joe” instead, but after Biden dropped out of the race in July, Trump called his new opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, “r------d” during a Sept. 29 re-election campaign fundraiser. \n\nOther men, however, aren’t so ready to embrace gratuitous slurs. \n\n“Man, when they go low, they go real [low],” late-night host Jimmy Kimmel said. “Trump’s like a mole person tunneling his way to China. And when he gets there, he’s going to visit the place where they print his ‘God Bless the USA’ Trump Bible.”\n\nDuring a March appearance on Bill Maher’s Club podcast, comedian Andrew Schulz was talking about the importance of a sense of possibility when it comes to the American psyche. \n\n“You see r-----s become millionaires, like actual people who are r-----d can become millionaires,” he said without missing a beat. \n\nAs Schulz, 41, spoke, Maher doubled over laughing at how ridiculous he sounded. Picking up on his host’s reaction, Schulz was quick to offer a convoluted explanation of why he’s still a good guy. \n\n“I think the perception of comedians is that we say something, and if you’re offended by it, we’re angry,” he said. “And it’s like, ‘You can react however you want to react to things.’ I don’t police your reaction. If you’re offended, that’s okay.”\n\n“If I was talking to you, and you’re like, ‘Hey, that makes me feel uncomfortable that word,’ I just won’t say it around you,” he continued. “But that doesn’t mean I won’t continue to make a joke that might have it in it, or say something with other people. On a one-on-one level, I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable.” \n\n“Right,” Maher said. “Sure.”","summary":"Screenshot/Joe Rogan Experience/YouTubePodcaster Joe Rogan has identified the manosphere’s greatest contribution to the culture: the return of the disability slur “r----d.” \n\n“Every time I see people that disagree with any that’s happening, any gigantic world events, it’s one of these r------d shows where they’re screaming—there’s the word again,” he said, interrupting himself during Thursday’s episode of The Joe Rogan Experience. \n\n“We were just talking about that,” he added. “The word ‘r------d’ is back, and it’s one of the great culture victories that I think is spurred on, probably, by podcasts.” \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-rogan-brags-about-the-manospheres-resurrection-of-the-word-rd/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/PSGTV4ZWHNEH5HWVQYCF6BGFWM.png?smart=true&auth=c478133ac05fda8af70d309c25f83f092b1bd349a9921cdec69e611c2a08acd4&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 15:24:35","author":"Janna Brancolini","authors":["Janna Brancolini"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.035},{"id":310149128,"title":"James Carville brutally honest about identity politics after Clinton and Harris’ failed campaigns","text":"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville said the Democratic Party is done employing identity politics in elections after Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris’ failed presidential bids.\n\n“No one gives a s–t anymore in a Democratic Party what gender you are, what race you are, what ethnicity you are.

She departed the administration in 2019, just days before the phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that initiated Trump's first impeachment trial, in which she testified. Trump was later acquitted.According to Newsweek reporting, European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have already started laying the groundwork for defenses, should Russian troops set foot on alliance soil.However, Russia is not the sole possible instigator of a potential global conflict. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery and former acting Secretary of Defense for Policy James Anderson previously told Newsweek that any major war will almost certainly result from the tensions between five major players: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and the United States.What To KnowHill, who developed a reputation as a hawk on Russian policy, has been a vocal critic of Trump since she left the administration, saying that he was overly friendly with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his first term.Last month, Trump revoked Hill's security clearance, along with several other Trump critics, such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Kamala Harris.In an interview with British-based Channel 4, Hill said World War III had already begun in some form, because of the way countries were reacting to the ongoing war in Ukraine.Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago in February 2022. While the United States and the West have been a close ally, delivering Kyiv billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid, Trump's second administration has shifted Washington's policy on the conflict, saying Ukraine should be prepared to make concessions to bring an end to the conflict.\"We're already in a situation where you could describe this as World War II structurally,\" Hill said. \"Everyone immediately thinks nuclear war, nuclear Armageddon. And Trump wants Zelensky to just put up, shut up, and go away so we can get back to negotiating with Putin.\"She continued: \"We've got a hot war in Europe at this very moment that's had around a million casualties in terms of people either killed or severely wounded, millions of refugees, and all kinds of knock-on effects. That's very similar to what happened in World War I and World War II. Obviously, the scale is different, but there were system-changing conflicts, and there were also multi-vector loads of different countries involved in that.\"Hill said that important actors on the world stage were responding in a similar way to countries during the wars of the 20th century, particularly the biggest players in Asia.\"We've got China, North Korea, and Iran all supporting Russia—some, in more material ways than others obviously—and a whole host of other countries are happily fueling this war. India's been selling arms to the Russians, Iran's been building drone factories, North Korea's been sending troops.\"Trump's rhetoric on the war in Ukraine has been noticeably different from former President Joe Biden's. In a meeting with Zelensky, Trump said in late February that he was \"gambling with World War III,\" and that he needed to accept a ceasefire deal with Russia.What People Are SayingLast Friday, Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev credited Trump's diplomatic team with reducing the chance of World War III, telling Fox News: \"There is no question that President Trump's team not only stopped World War III from happening but also had already achieved sizable progress on Ukraine resolution.\"Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik said in March, in response to Trump's conversation with Zelensky: \"It breaks our hearts that our allies still don't see that the only one gambling with World War III is Putin.\"French President Emmanuel Macron made a similar statement in support for Ukraine, telling reporters in February: \"If anyone is gambling with World War III, his name is Vladimir Putin.\"What Happens Next?The war in Ukraine continues, with Russia holding large parts of the eastern regions.In negotiations to stop the Russia-Ukraine war, details of the next meeting between Russian and U.S. delegations are yet to be determined, the State Department said earlier this week.","summary":"Fiona Hill, the president's former adviser on Russia affairs, recently warned that World War III was \"structurally\" already in effect.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/world-war-3-russia-donald-trump-2058490","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2625618/trump-zelensky.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 14:53:39","author":"Theo Burman","authors":["Theo Burman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":310141296,"title":"Trump Must Face Defamation Suit From Central Park 5 Over Debate Comments","text":"A federal judge ruled that a defamation lawsuit filed against former President Donald Trump by the Central Park Five can proceed.

Many say those two words have no business being next to each other. Despite the constant criticism that Black MAGA leaders face, folks like Candace Owens and Mark Robinson continue to make their political party proud... so they say.\n\nOn the flip side, others like journalist Don Lemon, argue there’s no way in hell any person can be both Black and “rational MAGA.” The reason why? Well, he says a large part of the MAGA movement is soaking in racist ideals. From continuous attacks on immigrants to President Donald Trump’s anti-DEI agenda and verbal attacks on former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris, it’s clear there’s some discrepancies between Black MAGA supporters and the agenda they choose to follow. \n\nSo now, The Root is looking at all of the colorful and flat out racist statements previously made by Black MAGA politicians...\n\nWesley Hunt and “the Boy Who Cried Wolf”\n\nAlthough the native Texan is new to the House of Representatives, Rep. Wesley Hunt has already made his allegiance with MAGA and Trump clear. During a hearing about the crisis at the southern border, Hunt told folks that despite racism still being alive and well in the U.S, “We can’t be the boy who cried wolf and blame racism all the time.”\n\nMark Robinson Calls Obama “Sh*t”\n\nFormer N.C. Lieutenant Gov. Mark Robinson is no stranger to controversy, as the MAGA-backed politician is notorious for his divisive and borderline offensive political rhetoric. In 2012, Robinson said he’d “take Hitler over any of the sh*t that’s in Washington right now!” At the time, of course he was talking about former President Barack Obama.\n\nHerschel Walker\n\n Over the years, former NFL player Herschel Walker has expressed his love for the president, but what’s more interesting is his commitment to separating himself from his race. Walker previously said the country is fully past racism. “You’re not a racist unless you’re 185 years old in today’s world,” Walker said in October at the Memory Lane Classic Car Museum, according to NBC News. \n\nCandace Owens Calls Fani Willis A “Ghetto Superstar”\n\nConservative pundit Candace Owens has created her brand by saying the most outrageous and offensive things imaginable. Last year, Owens attacked Ga. District Attorney Fani Willis, calling her a “ghetto superstar.” Additionally, Owens said “Love and Hip Hop” should give her and her special prosecutor Wade a call before mocking Willis’ use of ebonics.\n\nBen Carson Enables Trump\n\nThe surgeon and former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development knows how to stir up trouble while also keeping his nose clean. But sometimes, endorsing foolishness is worse than spewing it. In 2020, he defended accusations claiming Trump was racist. “President Trump does not dabble in identity politics. He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage, “a rising tide lifts all boats,” Carson said. “Many on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong.”\n\n Byron Donalds Agrees VP Kamala Harris “Turned Black”\n\nRemember when MAGA began spewing that nonsense that former Vice President Kamala Harris “turned Black?” Well, Fla. Rep. Byron Donalds was one of the many MAGA supporters who perpetuated the notion. “This is really a phony controversy,” Donalds said. “I don’t really care, most people don’t, but if we’re going to be accurate, when Kamala Harris went into the United States Senate, it was AP that said she was the Indian-American United States senator. It was actually played up a lot,” citing the Associated Press.\n\nLarry Elder Claims Black Folks “Exaggerate” Racism\n\nIf you have no clue who this guy is, we don’t blame you. The radio host previously launched a bid for president but ended his campaign in 2023. Larry Elder is no stranger to controversy, however. He previously said “Blacks exaggerate the significance of racism” and “women exaggerate the problem of sexism.”\n\nCandace Owens Calls BLM a “Terrorist” Organization\n\nOf course, Owens would make another appearance on this list... During the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, Owens said BLM was a “terrorist” organization.\n\nDaniel Cameron’s “War on Woke”\n\nAfter losing his race for Kentucky Governor, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron pivoted to attacking “woke,” just as many of his MAGA colleagues do. “We will shine a bright light on those whose ideological agendas seek to dismantle American freedom and prosperity,” Cameron said in a news release. “We will stop investment management firms, elected officials and corporate interests from using other people’s money to advance their radical political agendas.”\n\nJason Whitlock Says LeBron James Is too Rich to Suffer From Racism\n\nThe former sports columnist and show host knows exactly how to offend Black folks. Back in 2017, he said NBA legend LeBron James was too rich to be a victim of racism. “LeBron James whether he likes it or not or whether people close to him are telling him or not, he has removed himself from the damages and ravages of real racism,” Whitlock said.\n\nMark Robinson Declares Himself a Nazi\n\nOf the many racially motivated comments made by Robinson, perhaps the most shocking came after CNN exposed him for allegedly having a secret account on a pornography website. According to CNN, Robinson called himself a “black NAZI” on the porn site... among other things.\n\nCandace Owens Blames George Floyd for His Death\n\nSurprise, surprise... she’s back! It’s clear the MAGA supporter will stoop low t0 get her point across. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Owens became an avid critic of the Black father. She even blamed him for his own killing. Since her insensitive comments, Floyd’s family expressed plans to sue in response.\n\nClarence Thomas’ Mistruths About Welfare\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court justice has caught flak over his conservative views, including suggesting the court reconsider past rulings on same sex marriage. But one of the most notable statements of his career came in the 1980s when he criticized his own sister for benefiting from welfare. “She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check,” Thomas said. “What’s worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check, too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.”","summary":"Black MAGA. Many say those two words have no business being next to each other.

I think, obviously, there's a number of factors in play, but you know, we're working through that right now.\" Lawler is one of three Republicans mulling a gubernatorial run. So are Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman and longtime Bethany town supervisor Carl Hyde Jr. It's been 23 years since a Republican won a gubernatorial election in heavily blue New York. You have to go all the way back to former Gov. George Pataki's second re-election victory in 2002. KATHY HOCHUL'S POLLING PROBLEMS? But Hochul's approval ratings and favorable ratings remain underwater, giving Republicans hope the losing streak will come to an end next year. The governor also faces potential primary challenges from her lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, as well as Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York City. \"There's a reason New York leads the nation in out-migration. It has nothing to do with the weather and everything to do with the high cost of living and the declining quality of life from the migrant crisis to the crime epidemic in New York to the overall cost of living,\" Lawler said. And the former political strategist and adviser-turned-politician said \"people can't afford to live in New York. They want balance and common sense, and I think that's where there is an opportunity, if you articulate the vision to New Yorkers. They're pragmatic, they're commonsense, and they understand the need for change.\" In 2022, then-Rep. Lee Zeldin had the best performance by a GOP gubernatorial candidate in New York since Pataki's 2002 victory. Zeldin, who now steers the Environmental Protection Agency in President Donald Trump's second administration, lost to Hochul by less than six and a half points. And Trump lost the state to then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in last November's presidential election, but that was a 10-point improvement from his loss margin to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS CAMPAIGN CHAIR REVEALS ELECTION BATTLE PLAN While Republicans have been more competitive statewide in New York the last two cycles, Lawler said next year's elections will \"be determined by a few things.\" \"No. 1, does the economy take off?\" he said. \"And with the tax bill, with energy production increases, you know, if the economy takes off, then I think people are going to be very willing and open to change in New York.\" \"Obviously, what we're doing at the border matters,\" Lawler said. \"New York has borne the brunt of some of the disastrous decisions of the Biden administration and Kathy Hochul, spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money on free housing, clothing, food, education and health care for illegals.\" And Lawler pointed to his push to raise the cap on the state and local tax deduction, known by its acronym SALT, which is a pressing issue for many New Yorkers. \"Do I deliver on things like SALT and lifting the cap on SALT? And so, if we get these things done, and you know, things are looking up, I think New Yorkers can be very open to a change,\" he said. Lawler grabbed attention in 2022 by narrowly defeating incumbent Sean Patrick Maloney, the then-chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But he's currently one of only three House Republicans who represent districts carried by Harris in November. Asked if he needs to keep his distance from the president if he seeks statewide office in New York, Lawler told Fox News, \"Look, he's the president of the United States, and [I] certainly would welcome his support.\" MAJORITY IN NEW YORK WANT CHALLENGER TO DEMOCRATIC GOV KATHY HOCHUL: POLL But he also said \"New Yorkers will make a determination, though, based on the choice before them\" rather than on Trump.

It requires a plan. And I think if that is presented to New Yorkers, they'll make a determination based on that.\"","summary":"It&apos;s been over 20 years since a Republican was elected governor of New York. Could Rep.

And I think the more financial literacy we have, the stronger we’re going to be.”\n\nIn September 2024, the company announced that 80 high-profile investors had pumped between $10,000 to $500,000+ into the business during its investment round.\n\nMidi Health announced that a “high-powered group of women leaders and icons spanning entertainment, professional sports, media, beauty and fashion, health and wellness, technology and business” have invested in the business.\n\nThe company noted that “top execs” from companies including OpenAI, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Universal Music Group and Warner Media, have joined the second investment round.\n\n“Reflecting Midi’s focus on this demographic and the importance of culturally responsive care, the investor group includes women aged 35 to 60+ and 40% people of color,” the firm said in a statement.\n\nMidi Health is covered in the US through a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), a type of insurance plan that offers coverage through a network of healthcare providers.\n\nAccording to its website, an initial virtual appointment boasts a price tag of $250 for “self-paying” patients, while follow-up appointments cost visitors $150 a pop.\n\nMarkle’s rumored investment adds to her ever-growing business portfolio — which boasts more than 10 investment efforts between her and husband Prince Harry.\n\nThe duo have reportedly pumped large sums of money into several US start-ups since quitting royal life and moving across the pond in 2020.\n\nMarkle’s investment pattern shows affinity for female-led businesses.\n\nThe mom of two has been a fan of coffee brand Clevr since its inception in 2016, and became its private investor in December 2020.\n\nShe also became an investor of her pal’s haircare brand Highbrow Hippie in November 2024.\n\nIn addition to her investment efforts, Markle is rolling out a series of money-making ventures of her own — including new Netflix show “With Love, Meghan” and lifestyle brand As Ever to a shiny new podcast titled “Confessions of a Female Founder” and a digital ShopMy storefront.","summary":"The Duchess of Sussex, 43, is reportedly opening her pocketbook and diving head-first into the menopause market.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/11/entertainment/meghan-markle-urges-women-to-not-be-afraid-to-talk-about-finance-as-she-invests-in-celeb-menopause-clinic-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/102374495.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XbZlVWsn-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-11 12:56:50","author":"Nika Shakhnazarova","authors":["Nika Shakhnazarova"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.453},{"id":310107166,"title":"Kamala Harris has new political ambition – NYT","text":"Former US Vice President Kamala Harris is considering a run for California governor in 2026, according to the New York Times. The newspaper noted that Harris has kept a relatively low profile since her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, and reported that she is still processing the defeat while evaluating her political future.\n\nHarris became the Democratic presidential nominee after then-President Joe Biden withdrew from the race less than four months before Election Day. Biden faced increasing pressure to step aside due to concerns over his mental and physical health and ultimately endorsed Harris as his successor. Despite the endorsement, Harris was defeated and failed to carry any battleground states.\n\nSources familiar with her thinking told the newspaper that Harris is seriously exploring a gubernatorial bid. The position will become open as current Governor Gavin Newsom is set to leave office, with the election scheduled for November 3, 2026. Harris reportedly believes that leading California – the most populous Democratic stronghold – would offer her a powerful platform to counteract Trump-era policies.\n\nHarris has recently begun to reengage with the public. At the Leading Women Defined Summit earlier this month, she spoke of a growing “sense of fear” in the US and criticized institutions for “capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats” – a thinly veiled reference to recent actions by Trump. Less than 100 days into his second term, Trump has eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, authorized widespread federal employee layoffs, and enacted broad global tariffs that have roiled financial markets.\n\nShould she enter the race for governor, Harris would likely forgo a second presidential campaign in 2028, although that possibility remains on the table, the NYT reported. Her advisers believe the Democratic primary race for the White House will be highly competitive and could include current California Governor Newsom among the contenders, according to reports.\n\nAlthough she has yet to announce a decision, polling suggests Harris would immediately become the front-runner in the California gubernatorial race.\n\n“Let her run,” Trump said in a recent interview referring to Harris’ potential candidacy for California governor. “One thing she’s going to do, she’s got to start doing interviews.” \n\nSeveral other Democratic contenders, including former US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Representative Katie Porter, have already launched their campaigns. Harris has reportedly indicated she will make her decision by the end of the summer.\n\nSome within the party have expressed frustration over Harris’ delay, arguing that early leadership is crucial in such a consequential race.","summary":"The former US vice president has kept a lower public profile since her defeat to Donald Trump in the 2024 election\n\n  \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/615599-harris-california-governor/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/67f90eaa85f5403e7e6c8f33.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 12:48:27","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.098},{"id":310112622,"title":"Michelle Obama dismisses divorce rumours","text":"Michelle Obama has spoken out against rumours that her marriage to Barack Obama might be in trouble.\n\nThe former first lady has not accompanied her husband to several high-profile events – including Donald Trump’s inauguration and the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter – fuelling speculation that they might be separating.\n\nWithout explicitly mentioning these occasions, Mrs Obama told the Work in Progress podcast hosted by actress Sophia Bush that she was now in a position to control her own calendar as a “grown woman”.\n\nShe said that people were not able to believe that she was “making a decision” for herself and instead “had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing”.\n\nMrs Obama shared that she felt some guilt for stepping back from certain duties.\n\n“That’s the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people,” she said.\n\n“I mean, so much so that this year people couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.\n\n“This couldn’t be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right?

The religious groups said this has had a chilling effect, driving down attendance by people who fear being arrested.\n\nDespite some isolated examples, Friedrich said there isn’t evidence “that places of worship are being singled out as special targets.”\n\nThe new policy implemented by the Department of Homeland Security reflects only a “modest change” and doesn’t require enforcement activities in houses of worship, Friedrich added.\n\nWhite House gives no details about facilitating return of Maryland man\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not offer any details about what steps the administration will take to comply with a Supreme Court order to bring back a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to prison in El Salvador.\n\nLeavitt said the court’s ruling made it “very clear that it’s the administration’s responsibility to facilitate the return, not to effectuate the return” of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nLeavitt did not offer any details and referred reporters to court filings made by the Justice Department.\n\nLeavitt was asked if Trump wanted El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to bring Abrego Garcia with him to the U.S. when he visits Washington on Monday, but she said Bukele will be visiting to speak about the cooperation between the two countries “that is at an all-time high.”\n\nUS says it needs more time to provide information on mistakenly deported Maryland man\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration on Friday said they’re unable to provide information on the location and status of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported last month to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe attorneys said they haven’t had enough time to review the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on Thursday that directed the administration to return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland directed the Trump administration to “take all available steps to facilitate the return” of Abrego Garcia following Thursday’s high court order.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis had also set a Friday morning deadline for a declaration from the administration addressing Abrego Garcia’s location and custodial status and what steps the administration has taken and will take to facilitate his return. An in-person status conference was set for Friday afternoon.\n\n▶ Read more about what’s next in the case\n\nFederal judge refuses to block immigration enforcement operations in houses of worship\n\nA federal judge refused on Friday to block immigration agents from conducting enforcement operations at houses of worship in a lawsuit filed by religious groups over a new policy adopted by the Trump administration.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich in Washington, D.C., handed down the ruling in a lawsuit filed by more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans.\n\nShe found that there have been few such enforcement actions and the faiths had not shown they had suffered legal harm.\n\nWhite House promises ‘readout’ on Trump’s health after his physical\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says Trump is undergoing his “routine and long scheduled physical” and promised a “readout from the White House physician.”\n\nAs Leavitt spoke to reporters during a briefing on Friday, Trump was at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nTrump’s medical records carry the same privacy protections as all citizens, so how much information he authorizes the White House to release once his physical is completed remains to be seen.\n\nThrough the years, Trump has long been reticent to release even basic information about his health.\n\nTrump announces deals with 4 more law firms\n\nThe deals require them to together provide hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services to causes championed by the administration.\n\nThe resolutions reflect Trump’s continued success in bending prominent law firms to his will as they seek to cut deals with the administration to avoid being targeted by executive orders carrying punishing sanctions.\n\nThe latest firms to reach agreements with the White House include:\n\n1. Kirkland & Ellis\n\n2. Allen Overy Shearman Sterling US\n\n3. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett\n\n4. Latham & Watkins\n\nThe White House announced a deal with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft earlier today.\n\nThe spate of executive orders directed at the legal community and top law firms over the past two months has been part of a broader effort by Trump to reshape civil society and to extract concessions from entities whose work he opposes.\n\nWhite House announces new deal with law firm\n\nThe deal with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft requires it to provide at least $100 million in free legal services to causes supported by the Trump administration.\n\nAs in other agreements, the law firm has agreed to disavow any “illegal” diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and employment practices.\n\nCadwalader is the former firm of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who resigned to take on President Donald Trump as a client.\n\nThe spate of executive orders directed at the legal community and top law firms over the past two months is part of a broader effort by Trump to reshape civil society and extract concessions from entities whose work he opposes.\n\nThe orders have threatened to upend the day-to-day business of the firms by stripping their lawyers’ security clearances, barring their employees from access to federal buildings and terminating federal contracts held by the firms or their clients.\n\nSeveral major firms — including WilmerHale, Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block — have won court rulings that have temporarily halted enforcement of most provisions of those orders.\n\nOther firms, including Cadwalader, have sought to avert punishment by striking a deal with the White House.\n\nAudits find lack of tracking of DEI spending at Wisconsin university system, state agencies\n\nRepublican-ordered audits released on Friday found that Wisconsin state agencies and the University of Wisconsin system failed to track the millions of dollars they spent on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, making it difficult to fully assess the initiatives.\n\nThe highly anticipated reports come amid a push by Trump to end federal government support for DEI programs. There have been similar efforts in Wisconsin by Republicans who control the Legislature. The reports’ findings are likely to further increase pressure from Republicans to do away with anything related to DEI.\n\nDEI practices at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in particular have come under scrutiny.\n\nThe school is one of 50 universities across the country that Trump said are under investigation for alleged racial discrimination related to DEI programs.\n\nUW-Madison also is one of 60 schools federal education officials are investigating because of accusations that they failed to protect Jewish students during campus protests last year over the war in Gaza.\n\n▶ Read more about the audits\n\nJudge refuses to dismiss Central Park Five’s defamation case against Trump\n\nU.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia denied Trump’s motion to dismiss in a brief Thursday night order.\n\nThe five men, formerly known as the Central Park Five, sued Trump during last fall’s presidential election campaign, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about them during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump misstated key facts of the case when Harris brought up the matter, saying, “They admitted, they said, they pled guilty. And I said, ‘well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty — then they pled we’re not guilty,’” Trump said.\n\nThe men were exonerated after spending more than a decade in prison for the 1989 rape and beating of a woman who was jogging.\n\n▶ Read more about their lawsuit against Trump\n\nTrump once again wants to stop the semiannual changing of clocks\n\nThe president posted on social media on Friday a call for Congress to “push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day.”\n\nTrump said it would be “Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!”\n\nThe Republican’s position calling for more daylight would push the schedule forward, keeping the country on daylight saving time.\n\nTrump in the past has called for the Republican Party to eliminate daylight saving time, but last month backed off the threat in a post on his social media network, calling it a “50-50 issue” and saying “it’s hard to get excited about it.”\n\nTrump’s Friday schedule\n\nAt 11 a.m. ET, Trump will have his annual physical appointment at Walter Reed Medical Center.\n\nAt 4 p.m., he will head to Joint Base Andrews where he will then fly to Mar-a-Lago to spend the weekend, according to the White House.\n\nAt 1 p.m., White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt will deliver a press briefing.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene bought stocks hit hard by tariffs during market meltdown\n\nAs stocks tanked on tariff fears, Marjorie Taylor Greene showed her faith in the president not just with words but with dollar bills.\n\nThe Republican congresswoman, an avid supporter of the Trump administration’s trade policies, not only bought stocks last week as others dumped them in a panic — she scooped up some of the biggest losers.\n\nLululemon, Dell Computer, Amazon, the parent of Restoration Hardware and a few others hit hard by Trump’s tariff threats were down 40% on average late last week when she pounced.\n\nData from a required three-page financial holdings document doesn’t disclose exactly how much she paid for the stocks, only ranges and dates.\n\n▶ Read more about how some of Taylor Greene’s bets are working out\n\nChina says it is standing up against the US for global interests\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China stands firm against Trump’s tariffs not only to defend its own rights and interests but also to “safeguard the common interests of the international community to ensure that humanity is not dragged back into a jungle world where might makes right.”\n\nWang made the remarks on Friday when he met with Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Beijing.\n\nWang said China will “work together with other countries to jointly resist all retrogressive actions in the world.”\n\nConsumers’ economic outlook worsens for fourth month as trade war fuels worries\n\nThe University of Michigan’s closely watched consumer sentiment index fell 11% to 50.8, the lowest since the depths of the pandemic.\n\nThe decline was “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region and political affiliation,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey.\n\nThe share of respondents expecting unemployment to rise in the coming months increased for the fifth straight month and is now the highest since 2009, during the Great Recession.\n\nAmericans also now expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month, a move that may be of particular concern for the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Fed pays close attention to inflation expectations because they can become self-fulfilling.\n\nIf people expect prices to rise, they often take steps that can push up prices, such as accelerating purchases or seeking higher wages.\n\nFalling sentiment suggests Americans will cut back on spending, though in recent years, consumers have at times kept spending despite the gloom. Whether they will do so again remains to be seen.\n\nTrump tells Russia to ‘get moving’ with ending the war\n\n“Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war — A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!” Trump wrote on social media on Friday.\n\nHis post came as his special envoy Steve Witkoff was in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he was expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWall Street opens lower as Trump’s trade war with China escalates\n\nU.S. stocks are shaky as Wall Street’s monstrous week heads toward its close.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.7% in early trading Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 306 points, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.4%.\n\nThe drops erased more of the huge gains stocks made in the middle of the week after Trump paused tariffs on many countries outside of China. The rising price of gold, falling value of the U.S. dollar and moves in other financial markets indicate more fear after China’s latest escalation in the trade war.\n\nSenate confirms Trump nominee Caine for chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff in overnight vote\n\nRetired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine was confirmed on Friday, almost two months after Trump fired Caine’s predecessor.\n\nTrump nominated Caine to become the top U.S. military officer in February after abruptly firing Gen. CQ Brown Jr., the second Black general to serve as chairman, as part of his Republican administration’s campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Caine 60-25 in an overnight vote before heading home for a two-week recess.\n\nCaine is a decorated F-16 combat pilot who served in leadership in multiple special operations commands, in some of the Pentagon’s most classified programs, and in the CIA.\n\nBut he does not meet prerequisites for the job set out in a 1986 law, such as being a combatant commander or service chief.\n\n▶ Read more about Caine’s confirmation and background\n\nTrump administration to refer Maine to DOJ over transgender participation in sports\n\nThe deadline arrived Friday for Maine officials to reach a resolution with the U.S. Education Department over a finding that the state violated antidiscrimination laws by allowing transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports.\n\nThe Education Department said in March that an investigation concluded the Maine Department of Education violated the federal Title IX law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls’ teams. The investigation followed a public disagreement between Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills and Trump at a February meeting of governors.\n\nThe U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning on March 31 telling the state it needed to comply with the law within 10 business days or face enforcement from the U.S. Justice Department. That deadline arrived Friday.\n\nMaine officials have not responded to requests for comment on the investigation.\n\nUS wholesale inflation fell last month as price pressures eased, but trade war clouds outlook\n\nThe Labor Department said on Friday that its producer price index, which tracks inflation before it hits consumers, fell 0.4% from February.\n\nCompared with a year earlier, producer prices rose 2.7% — down from a 3.2% year-over-year gain in February and much lower than the 3.3% economists had forecast.\n\nThe report comes a day after the Labor Department delivered good news on inflation at the consumer level.\n\nIts consumer price index rose just 2.4% last month from March 2024, the smallest year-over-year gain since September. Core consumer prices posted the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly four years.\n\nThe inflation outlook is muddied by Trump’s trade wars. He’s imposing a 145% tax — a tariff — on Chinese imports and is hitting most of the rest of the world’s imports with a 10% levy that might increase after 90 days.\n\nThe trade barriers are widely expected to raise prices as importers attempt to pass along their higher costs.\n\nSpace Force Base commander in Greenland fired after Vance visit\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, the U.S. Space Force said Col. Susan Meyers, who served as commander of Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, was removed due to “loss of confidence in her ability to lead.”\n\nIn a rare follow-up statement, the Space Force said, “Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties.”\n\nMilitary.com reported that Meyers sent a base-wide email following Vice President JD Vance’s March visit, defending the base’s relationship with Denmark and Greenland. The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the contents of that email.\n\n“Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a separate statement posted to the social platform X.\n\nStates sue over Trump administration’s sudden halt of pandemic relief aid for schools\n\nPublic officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Thursday to restore access to pandemic relief aid for schools, saying the Education Department’s abrupt halt of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised funding will force cuts to vital services.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a coalition of 16 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York’s Letitia James, plus Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat. It claims the administration’s refusal to release the aid violates federal law because it reversed a prior decision to allow states to access the money through March 2026.\n\nStates were notified late last month that the Education Department would not honor deadline extensions granted by the Biden administration to spend the remainder of COVID relief aid approved by Congress to help schools and students recover from the lasting impacts of the pandemic. Schools were supposed to spend the last of the relief by January but many sought, and were granted, more time.\n\n▶ Read more about the lawsuit\n\nTrump will undergo his annual physical Friday after years of reluctance\n\nTrump is undergoing his annual physical on Friday, potentially giving the public its first details in years about the health of a man who in January became the oldest in U.S. history to be sworn in as president.\n\nDespite long questioning predecessor Joe Biden’s physical and mental capacity, Trump has routinely kept basic facts about his own health shrouded in secrecy — shying away from traditional presidential transparency on medical issues.\n\nIf history is any indication, his latest physical is likely to produce a flattering report that’s scarce on details. It will be conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will be the first public information on Trump’s health since an assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July.\n\nRather than release medical records at that time, Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson — a staunch supporter who served as his White House physician and once joked in the White House briefing room that Trump could live to be 200 if he had a healthier diet — wrote a memo describing a gunshot wound to Trump’s right ear.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s upcoming annual physical\n\nWhere things stand for Trump in global tariff battle\n\nIn the aftermath of this week’s tariff whiplash, Trump is deciding exactly what he wants out of trade talks with as many as 75 nations in the coming weeks.\n\nTrump is also figuring out next steps with China. He upped his tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% after China placed retaliatory taxes of 84% on imports from the U.S. While his 90-day pause on other tariffs caused the stock market to rally on Wednesday, countries still face a baseline 10% import tax instead of the higher rates announced on April 2.\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” on Thursday that the administration already has “offers on the table from more than 15 countries.”\n\nHassett said the next step will be determining exactly what Trump wants out of the negotiations.\n\n▶ Read more about where Trump’s tariffs showdown stands\n\nChina hits back at US and will raise tariffs on American goods from 84% to 125%\n\nChina announced on Friday that it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% — the latest salvo in an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has rattled markets and raised fears of a global slowdown.\n\nWhile Trump paused import taxes this week for other countries, he raised tariffs on China and they now total 145%. China has denounced the policy as “economic bullying” and promised countermeasures. The new tariffs begin Saturday.\n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry said it would file another lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the U.S. tariffs.\n\nTrump’s on-again, off-again measures have caused alarm in stock and bond markets and led some to warn that the U.S. could be headed for a recession. There was some relief when Trump paused the tariffs for most countries, but concerns remain since the U.S. and China are the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 economies, respectively.\n\n▶ Read more about China’s retaliatory tariffs","summary":"A federal judge on Friday lambasted a government lawyer who couldn’t explain what, if anything, President Donald Trump’s administration has done to arrange for the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported last month to a notorious prison…","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/the-latest-trump-administration-offers-no-details-on-mistakenly-deported-man-after-court-ruling/article_a1de2b8f-b126-53ae-bdb6-b3e4fe7bdd8a.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/07/30753801-eab1-5a83-bb46-41be83550383/67f90c74b6e20.image.jpg?crop=1620%2C851%2C0%2C114&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 12:29:47","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":310100820,"title":"Kamala Harris stays in the game as the former VP mulls next step: Washington or Sacramento?","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris took to social media this month to cheer on the growing resistance by Democrats to President Donald Trump. \"Today in every state across our nation, Americans are standing up to the administration,\" Harris wrote. Also taking aim at Trump's most visible advisor and the world's richest person — Elon Musk — the former vice president emphasized that \"the voices of working people will always be louder than the unelected billionaires.\" Harris, in a possible tease of potential future political plans, spotlighted on social media a clip from the closing line of a speech from earlier this month. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS HER TIMETABLE ON HER NEXT POLITICAL STEPS Railing against moves by the Trump administration and vowing to remain active in the fight, Harris said, \"I'll see you out there. I'm not going anywhere.\" And earlier this year, Harris, in a video message to the Democratic National Committee as it huddled for its winter meeting, pledged to be with the party \"every step of the way.\" But five months after losing the presidential election to Trump, Harris' public appearances are still few and far between. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING AND ANALYSIS REGARDING KAMALA HARRIS And unlike her 2024 running mate — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — and other top Democrats, she has not appeared at rallies or town halls to directly address a Democratic Party base that is increasingly angry and energized over Trump's sweeping and controversial upending of the federal government during the first three months of his second tour of duty in the White House. Harris has also avoided doing any television interviews or taking part in any podcasts, ceding the spotlight to others in the party. But her every public word is quickly dissected. \"I’m not here to say I told you so,\" Harris said on April 3 in Dana Point, California, to a gathering of Black female business leaders, politicians and other prominent people, as she pointed to her warnings about Trump on the campaign trail last summer and autumn. The clip, during which both Harris and the crowd cracked up, instantly went viral. And there's intense speculation over what may be Harris' next political move. Two potential options are launching a gubernatorial run next year in her home state of California, in the race to succeed term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom, or seeking the presidency again in 2028. Extremely early polls in the next Democratic Party presidential nomination race — which are heavily reliant on name recognition at this point — indicate that the former vice president holds a significant lead over other potential White House contenders. TOP TRUMP ALLY TEASES BID FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR IF HARRIS RUNS It is very unlikely she could do both. Running and winning election in 2026 as governor of heavily blue California, the nation's most populous state and home to the world's fifth-largest economy, would likely take a 2028 White House run off the table, allies and political analysts have indicated. Harris previously served as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, and represented the Golden State in the U.S. Senate before joining former President Joe Biden's 2020 ticket and winning election as vice president. A source in the former vice president's political orbit confirmed to Fox News Digital last month that Harris has told allies she will decide by the end of summer on whether to launch a gubernatorial campaign. The news was first reported by Politico. But other California Democrats aren't waiting, as the gubernatorial field is growing. Some of the candidates are criticizing Harris for waiting until the summer to decide. Among them are former Los Angeles Mayor Anotonio Villaraigosa. \"The challenges facing California are too great for us to wait for a candidate who wants to come in late in the game,\" Villaraigosa, who launched his 2026 campaign last summer, recently told the Los Angeles Times. \"California is not a steppingstone to higher office.\" \"This will not be a coronation,\" he said in his interview. Pointing to Harris' three-and-a-half-month-long presidential campaign — she succeeded Biden as the party's nominee after he dropped his bid last July — Villaraigosa said, \"You can’t run at the end of the rainbow. We saw a 100-day campaign. Look what that brought us.\" Two other Democrats running for California governor — former Rep. Katie Porter and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra — made similar arguments. But polls indicate Harris would be the clear front-runner if she entered the 2026 race in California, and other candidates already in the field have indicated they would defer to the former vice president if she ends up running. One of those candidates who would likely drop their bid is California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a close friend and ally of the former vice president.

The vacancy was created at the start of the year when then-board chair Nora Vargas, a Democrat, stepped down with little explanation despite winning a landslide re-election in November.\n\nThe runoff will be an entirely different affair than the primary, which from the start was a competition among three Democratic elected officials to make it to July. McCann had an easy ride to the runoff.\n\nThat won’t be the case in a one-on-one race in the heavily Democratic district, where Republicans account for just over 20 percent of registered voters and are outnumbered more than 2-to-1 by Democrats.\n\nMcCann has defied partisan odds before in becoming mayor of Democratic Chula Vista and, prior to that, serving on the City Council. He finished first with 43 percent of the vote as of Thursday, as a small percentage of ballots were still being counted.\n\nAguirre received about 32 percent of the vote, with San Diego City Councilmember Vivian Moreno at 13 percent and Chula Vista Councilmember Carolina Chavez with nearly 8 percent, followed by three others. A candidate could have won the seat outright by gaining a majority of the vote in the primary, but that was never much of a consideration during the campaign.\n\nIt might seem that McCann doesn’t have far to go to get over the top in July, but the political and demographic dynamics make the hill much steeper from here. For one thing, most voters for the other Democrats may coalesce around Aguirre.\n\nHowever, it’s often been suggested that the county’s South Bay District 1 is not as liberal as other Democratic districts, in part because of its large working-class and heavily Latino population. Last November, President Donald Trump again lost big there, but he received more votes against Kamala Harris than he did against Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nBut sometimes lost in that analysis is that the bigger factor may have been a lack of enthusiasm for Harris. While Trump received 5,330 more votes than he did four years earlier in District 1, Harris received 34,125 fewer votes than Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, there may have been Democratic malaise about the Biden-Harris administration, but that pales in comparison to the current political firestorm over Trump’s spending cuts, tariffs and other legally questionable policies, all of which could significantly impact county residents.\n\nWe may not know how relevant any of that is until the July 1 election results are in. It’s tricky to graft dynamics of a presidential race – which have large turnouts – onto local special elections in off-years, where turnout is very low. Some local analysts predict the turnout for Tuesday’s primary eventually will be around 17 percent, though there’s some disagreement about whether turnout will increase a bit or drop in July.\n\nIn any case, voter participation will still be low and that would seem to work in McCann’s favor, under the notion that Republicans have stronger proportional turnout. Further, McCann, a Navy veteran, has developed a moderate, pro-business image and has proved an adept campaigner over the years who has not been wedded to the Republican brand.\n\nBut he didn’t face much scrutiny from opponents during what essentially was a rough-and-tumble Democratic primary, where Aguirre not only survived but won in a blowout with a broad coalition of labor, environmentalists and the local Democratic Party behind her.\n\nA key to the runoff may be to what degree the Aguirre campaign can identify McCann with Trump’s unpopular policies or make him answer for them. Despite last year’s election, Trump remains a key motivator for Democrats to vote.\n\nAnother key will be how well McCann burnishes his record (and fends off Aguirre’s certain efforts to poke holes in it) while questioning her accomplishments as mayor and a council member in Imperial Beach.\n\nAguirre has received praise for her efforts to seek funding and solutions to the decades-long cross-border sewage spills from Tijuana, which has been the centerpiece of her campaign. McCann may well try to turn that into a negative, noting that the situation has gotten worse since she’s been mayor.\n\nBut Moreno’s backers spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to do just that, with not much to show for it.\n\nMore broadly, McCann has raised concerns about how the county is led, contending supervisors have been ineffective on homelessness and housing while running a budget deficit. He has noted that Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer, an Aguirre ally, is considering proposals to raise taxes, something he opposes.\n\nYet McCann will be pressed to say what should be done, including what cuts he would make.\n\nParty politics have long played a role in technically nonpartisan elections like those for county supervisor. But the polarization of the country has led to more sharply partisan local politics in recent years, especially now when edicts out of Washington, D.C., seem to have more jarring local impacts than ever before.\n\nWhat both candidates say they’ll do to improve the county will be central to the campaign — but so will the presence of Trump.","summary":"Imperial Beach mayor is bringing national themes into the local race while the Chula Vista mayor seems intent on contrasting their records.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/04/11/aguirre-seeks-to-stick-mccann-with-trumps-policies-in-runoff/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SUT-L-D1-Election-1.jpg?w=1024&h=646","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 12:00:16","author":"Michael Smolens","authors":["Michael Smolens"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.018},{"id":310111602,"title":"Inside John Swinney’s secret meeting with Donald Trump’s son as SEVEN PAGES of briefing notes revealed","text":"JOHN Swinney was told by aides to heap praise on Donald Trump’s business empire in secretive talks with his son Eric - despite officials saying they couldn't back up the firm’s Scottish job claims.\n\nThe First Minister was urged to parrot a script hailing the “valuable contribution” of Trump International to Scotland’s economy and said this was “greatly appreciated”, newly released documents reveal.\n\nAnd it also emerged that Mr Swinney “reassured” Eric Trump in the March 13 summit that cops would take “seriously” the vandalism of Trump Turnberry just days before the pair met.\n\nBut details released to The Scottish Sun under freedom of information laws show how behind the scenes, Scottish Government officials said they could not verify Trump International’s claims that they employ around 600 people in Scotland - suggesting the reality appeared to be nearer 350.\n\nHowever, the Trump Organization's most senior Scottish figure, Sarah Malone, today set out a breakdown of staff figures, showing 613 people \"employed directly between Trump International Scotland, Aberdeen, and Trump Turnberry\". \n\nThe meeting last month came at a sensitive time in relations between SNP ministers and Trump family, with Eric Trump having publicly blasted the First Minister months earlier, saying it was “nasty” of the Nats leader to endorse Donald Trump’s Democrat rival Kamala Harris last year.\n\nThe fresh details show meticulous planning which went into preparing Mr Swinney for the Bute House meeting with the US President’s son.\n\nThe summit was known about at least a week in advance - but kept secret from the public.\n\nA briefing of at least seven pages long was sent to the First Minister and circulated among his aides and officials two days before Mr Trump’s arrival.\n\nThis included lines for Mr Swinney to parrot to Mr Trump including: “I recognise the valuable contribution of Trump International to Scotland’s economy and that the organisation’s commitment to continue to invest in Scotland is greatly appreciated.”\n\nThe First Minister was also primed to say: “The Scottish Government values the investment The Trump Organization has made in our Visitor Economy over many years, providing jobs and experiences.”\n\nAnd on golf - which Eric Trump later said had been discussed at the meeting - officials told Mr Swinney to say: “Golf is a connecting force for good between our natural assets, cultural ties and sport.”\n\nThere was no mention of Donald Trump in the so-called “top lines” for Mr Swinney to recite, however a further section on an unknown topic was blanked out in the freedom of information response.\n\nIn response to the briefing being circulated, two days before the meeting, a political special adviser asked civil servants for “a number for Trump International employees based in Scotland”.\n\nAn official later replied and said: “We don’t have exact figures but estimate about 340-360 employed across Trump MacLeod House & Lodge, Balmedie, Aberdeenshire and Trump Turnberry, Ayrshire, with potential for further job creation at the new MacLeod Golf Course, Aberdeenshire.”\n\nBut saying the firm’s own claims could not be backed up, the civil servant added: “Sarah Malone, Executive Vice President of Trump International Scotland stated last year that around 600 people are employed directly by Trump businesses but we are not able to verify this figure.”\n\nThe briefing for Mr Swinney also included detailed biographies on Eric Trump, Ms Malone and another Trump International boss, Larry Glick, who had been expected in Scotland.\n\nOn Ms Malone, the briefing included details of her religious beliefs, saying: “Malone, from Peterhead, 20 miles north of Aberdeen, grew up in a Christian home, although she says her own religious journey began as a young adult.\n\n\"She was studying at Glasgow School of Art when she started attending the Covenant Life Church, known today as Destiny Church.”\n\nThe briefing also said the government “has a funding relationship” with The Open organisers The R&A “to support their events in Scotland”.\n\nBut appearing to anticipate potential questions from Mr Trump about The Open returning to Turnberry for the first time since 2009 - and whether the Scottish Government could help - the briefing to Mr Swinney included an underlined passage saying: “All venue decisions are solely at the discretion of the R&A and the Scottish Government is informed of venue selection after the decision has been made. The Scottish Government is not involved in the decision-making process.”\n\nA further section of the briefing directly after this was blanked out in the freedom of information response.\n\nFew details had previously been released about the meeting.\n\nLarge sections of emailed were blanked out, but showed a team of top advisers planning for the summit which was known about at least six days in advance.\n\nUnderlining how the public would not be told of the meeting until it was over, a March 7 email from a political special adviser to various officials and fellow advisers said: “There will be no need for proactive comms.”\n\nIt added: “The discussion will focus on Mr Trump’s investment in Scotland, and he would also like to share his future plans for the golf courses in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire.”\n\nEight days after the meeting, a note from Mr Swinney’s Principal Private Secretary, John Webster, summarised the content of the discussion, and said: “You noted with concern the recent incident at the Trump Turnberry property, condemning the damage caused by vandalism and offered reassurance that the relevant authorities would continue to take the incident seriously.”\n\nVandals daubed red paint on the famous hotels and walls, with graffiti including “f*** Trump” and “Free Palestine”.\n\nThe words “GAZA IS NOT FOR SALE” were sprayed across the lawn, and the golf course’s holes were dug up during the alleged incident on March 8.\n\nThe US President later said the vandals were “terrorists”.\n\nThree people have since been charged, and two more quizzed by cops and released pending further inquiries.\n\nThe FoI response also revealed a small number of angry emails to Mr Swinney from members of the public following the Eric Trump meeting.\n\nOne said: “Why are you meeting with the dictator's son? You and your party have always been an abomination to the Scottish people and you'll be out on your keester next time around.”\n\nAnother email said: “Really, hosting Eric Trump? Have you no principles? This just encourages the Trump/ Musk reckless behaviour.”\n\nA third said: “I am making contact to inform you of my absolute disagreement with your decision to meet with Eric Trump. While I can only speculate in regard to the purpose of you meeting this person at Bute House, we are told it was nothing to do with Scottish or American politics. \n\n\"If it was then in relation to his fathers businesses in Scotland can we therefore assume you will be rolling out the red carpet for all other business leaders?”\n\nToday, Ms Malone moved to clarify any doubts over job numbers in Scotland. \n\nShe said: \"The meeting between Eric Trump and the First Minister in March was very constructive.\n\n“In terms of employment, there are 613 people employed directly between Trump International Scotland, Aberdeen, and Trump Turnberry. 485 are employed at Turnberry and 128 at Aberdeen. The number employed at Aberdeen will increase this year by approximately another 20.\n\n\"These figures do not include the 170 (self-employed) caddies engaged by Trump Turnberry and 130 caddies at Aberdeen. Nor do these figures take into account peak-tournament employment or the multitude of other businesses and suppliers which support the Trump businesses.\"\n\nFollowing the meeting on March 13, the Scottish Government released a statement which included the line: “The First Minister regularly meets with business people regarding investment in Scotland. “\n\nAnd Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, released a statement after the meeting saying: “I'm delighted to say that it was a very warm and friendly meeting and this is the first time that a First Minister has invited us to Bute House. \n\n\"The First Minister thanked me for the Trump Organization's ongoing colossal investment and commitment to Scotland. \n\n\"This is the first time that I've heard those words from the First Minister and they were hugely appreciated.”\n\nThe Trump Organization has been asked for comment on the number of people it employs in Scotland.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14626492/john-swinney-secret-meeting-eric-trump-notes/","image":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/MixCollage-11-Apr-2025-12-21-PM-4465.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 11:52:18","author":"Chris Musson","authors":["Chris Musson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":310112602,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Inside Michelle and Barack Obama's Secret Divorce Talks – Including How They Will Split $70Million in Assets Before Making Explosive Public Split Announcement","text":"Former First Couple Barack and Michelle Obama have secretly settled on a deal to divide their sprawling $70million fortune before revealing the shocking news that their decades-long marriage is coming to an end, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nIn a blockbuster revelation that is sure to roil the American political landscape, sources said lawyers for the battling titans have hammered out an agreement in which Michelle, 61, will continue her conquest of Hollywood while Barack, 63, stays mostly on the East Coast in a behind-the-scenes bid to help the shattered Democratic Party reinvent itself in the new conservative political landscape.\n\n\"She'll keep (their film business) Higher Ground Productions, the home in Chicago and the Martha's Vineyard estate,\" an insider with knowledge of the deal told us. \"He'll get the D.C. mansion and they'll split the stock portfolio, which is worth about $22.5million now.

I don’t blame the voters. I blame: What did we not do? I put my suggestions out there. If those aren’t the ones that are chosen, I work as hard as I can for the ones that were.”\n\nA popular figure when he hit the national stage last summer thanks to his attacks on Trump and Vance as “weird”, voters also responded to Walz’s folksy personal manner and relatable back story as a high school teacher and football coach – but ultimately he and Harris fell short.\n\nOn their inability to match Joe Biden’s outreach to America’s Latino citizens four years earlier, Walz reflected: “I think especially with the Latino community and an immigrant community, these are driven people to succeed, and that is the American Dream. \n\n“And I think sometimes we’re a little bit, we’re a little bit too much, you know, you should be ashamed for being successful.”\n\nOn public opposition to Israel’s military response to the events of October 7, 2023, which led to heckling at Harris’s rallies over the Biden administration’s perceived inaction to prevent the bloodshed, Walz said: “It needs to be spoken that there’s the angst over Gaza and things that needed to be addressed.\n\n“I think we have to understand: How do we articulate that we’re better for that? It’s obviously self-evident now that for folks in Gaza, Donald Trump’s not going to be the [one] to help them. We got to make sure that they believe that we would have been.”\n\nOn their campaign’s failure to engage with new media, Walz acknowledged that Trump had been astute in taking advice from his teenage son Barron Trump about appearing on Joe Rogan and Theo Von’s influential podcasts, which helped him to secure the support of their young male listenerships. \n\nWalz regretted that he and Harris had not been “looser” in their approach and revealed that he had discussed how best to reach young men via the media and platforms they enjoy with his own son Gus Walz, who suggested there is a perception among his peers that right-wing politics is more fun.\n\n“Trump doesn’t know squat about football, but he shows up at football games,” the governor said. \n\n“He doesn’t know squat about NASCAR, but he shows up at NASCAR. We do know those things, and we should be out there.\n\n“I’m not saying it’s me – send Cory Booker out to do these things. Send Elizabeth Warren; she knows basketball… We should do more of the spaces where they’re at authentically, not performance-like.”\n\nDemocrats from Walz to the progressive duo of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have increasingly taken to holding town hall events in red states since Trump’s inauguration, responding to angry scenes at equivalent Republican gatherings going viral in which constituents have been seen confronting and often berating their representatives over the administration’s actions, particularly in relation to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) instigating mass firings of federal workers. \n\n“Donald Trump did a wonderful job of articulating why these people are angry,” Walz told the Post, pointing to the crowd attending his listening tour.\n\n“He’s done nothing to improve that, and they don’t believe we have either. That’s what I’m trying to figure out.”\n\nHe admitted that he doesn’t have the answers and conceded that “the guy who got his ass kicked in the last election” may not be the right message-bearer right now but said he believed there was value in taking part in events that are effectively serving as group therapy sessions for disaffected voters.","summary":"Former vice presidential candidate on the road meeting voters already disaffected by Donald Trump’s presidency as he reflects on failure of Kamala Harris campaign","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tim-walz-election-mistakes-trump-b2731079.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/08/6/12/Minnesota-Gov--Tim-Walz-Holds-Peoples-Town-Hall-In-Youngstown-OH-n32g8ytk.jpeg?trim=1343,2808,529,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wfQpc0aF-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-11 10:37:09","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.031},{"id":310088258,"title":"Maine parent outraged after being silenced for defending girls' sports","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nFox Friends First April 11, 2025 04:40 \n\n Maine parent outraged after being silenced for defending girls' sports \n Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses a heated school board meeting in Maine over the fight to protect girls' sports and Kamala Harris' reported rejection from campaigning for a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRFOX & FRIENDS FIRSTUS","summary":"Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses a heated school board meeting in Maine over the fight to protect girls&apos; sports and Kamala Harris&apos; reported rejection from campaigning for a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371347639112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/8b2feb36-7411-4bf4-aa4f-14c37e271de9/d7838456-4496-45c6-bf8a-1c22a36b152d/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 10:32:13","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":310070870,"title":"James Carville declares identity politics dead after Clinton, Harris failures","text":"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville said the Democratic Party is done employing identity politics in elections after Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris’ failed presidential bids. \"No one gives a s--t anymore in a Democratic Party what gender you are, what race you are, what ethnicity you are. They just want to win…we’re not here to make history,\" Carville said on the Politics War Room podcast on Thursday. \"We’re here to make a win and whatever we have to do to win this f-----g election, we’re going to do that. And I think that any time that the Democratic Party has any other motive other than victory, it screws us up,\" he added. Carville, who became famous for working on former President Bill Clinton's campaign in 1992, responded to a listener's question read by co-host Al Hunt. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS 'I TOLD YOU SO' WHILE SLAMMING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM IN LATEST PUBLIC APPEARANCE The listener asked Carville, \"How do we destroy the notion that it is someone’s ‘turn’ to be the nominee - Hillary, Kamala - rather than the Democrat with the best chance of winning?\" KAMALA HARRIS WAS ‘VERY ANNOYED’ WITH OBAMA AS SHE SOUGHT HIS ENDORSEMENT, BOOK REVEALS \"Remember, that’s a big, big hangover in Biden world that Obama decided that it was Hillary’s turn, not Biden’s turn, so he couldn’t run [in 2016]. Let me tell you what the ‘turn’ is. The turn is to win,\" Carville said. Carville explained further that if there is a formidable female candidate to win the White House, then the Democratic Party will rally around her. However, the veteran strategist emphasized that the Democratic Party's priority should be simply to win elections. \"If it’s a woman candidate that has the best chance to win, for God’s sake, let’s rally behind this candidate. If it’s male, let us rally behind that. Whatever it is, the most important criteria is to win the f------g election. Nothing else counts,\" he said. \"Winning is everything, stupid.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"James Carville, a veteran strategist, said that the Democratic Party must do away with identity politics and focus on winning elections after Kamala Harris&apos; defeat.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-carville-declares-identity-politics-dead-after-clinton-harris-failures","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/11/931/523/GettyImages-110094530.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 10:30:31","author":"Joshua Nelson","authors":["Joshua Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145}]}
