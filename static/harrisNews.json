But what is the psychic cost for company?","text":"By DAVID BAUDER\n\nWith this week’s FCC approval, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher.\n\nIt has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert’s late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders.\n\nSkydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president.\n\nCBS News’ trajectory will be scrutinized\n\nAfter the merger’s Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump’s complaint that last fall’s “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal.\n\nThe appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.”\n\nDays before the FCC’s vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS’s reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.\n\nThe role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet’s work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said.\n\nHaving the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist’s work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said.\n\nCarr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America’s trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists.\n\n“They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don’t want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.”\n\nHow the merger could ripple out across Paramount properties\n\nAccording to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor’s study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday.\n\nColbert’s slow-motion firing — he’ll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television’s collapsing economics. Colbert’s relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives.\n\n“Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. “Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?”\n\nStewart’s profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year.\n\nIn an odd way, Comedy Central’s “South Park” buttresses CBS’ claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert’s show doesn’t do nearly as well.\n\nFiguring out what to do with others at Paramount’s cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\n\n“There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount’s growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.”\n\nThe merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry’s top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006.\n\nEllison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount’s market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser.\n\nTo revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content.\n\nAP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

The nod from the FCC paves the way for the imminent closure of the $8 billion deal. In the past few days, it was revealed that Skydance Media, through its lead attorney, made several concessions to the FCC to obtain the green light for the merger. This includes committing to install an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias or other concerns” at CBS News. The company also confirmed that Paramount eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\nThese concessions follow the $16 million settlement reached by Paramount Global with President Donald Trump over a lawsuit filed in 2024, which accused CBS News of “deceitful” editing during a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President and then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nFamine concern: BBC News—alongside other major news agencies including the Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse—issued a joint statement addressing a potential famine situation that could impact journalists covering the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In the joint statement, BBC News said the news organizations are “deeply concerned” about journalists in the region who are “facing the same dire circumstances as those they are covering.” The statement further added, “Journalists endure many deprivations and hardships in war zones. We are deeply alarmed that the threat of starvation is now one of them. We once again urge the Israeli authorities to allow journalists in and out of Gaza. It is essential that adequate food supplies reach the people there.”\n\n A joint statement on Gaza from AFP, AP, BBC News and Reuters pic.twitter.com/E9b1gTYDpu — BBC News Press Team (@BBCNewsPR) July 24, 2025\n\nFCC objection: Conservative-leaning news network Newsmax filed an objection with the FCC Wednesday challenging any move that would weaken or eliminate the Horizontal Ownership Cap. The filing is in response to the FCC’s issuance of a public notice in June, seeking public comment on whether to retain, revise, or do away with the cap. Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy said in the filing, “If networks like CBS, ABC, and NBC were allowed to expand their reach unchecked, they would have even less incentive to produce programming that reflects the values of local communities, particularly those in America’s heartland.”\n\nSecond sports deal: Fox Nation struck its second live sports deal, becoming the exclusive broadcast partner for the inaugural matches of new wrestling league Real American Freestyle.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).\n\nUnlike the two House Democrats, Harris chose not to give her remarks in person.\n\n“Keep building your political power, keep building community, keep building coalitions, keep challenging the status quo,” she said to the group gathered in the nation’s capital.\n\n“And born out of our love for our country, keep fighting to build a country and a nation. That works for everyone. And I look forward to continuing in the fight alongside you. You take care.”\n\nVoters of Tomorrow senior director Kaya Jones had preceded Harris in the line-up and suggested actions by the Republican-held White House and Congress had taken a toll on youth organizing.\n\n“The last few months have been really rough, and, um, yeah, let’s just pause for that,” she said, leading to a brief moment of silence.\n\nHarris struck a similar tone in her remarks, saying: “Your generation has grown up on the front lines of so many crises — from COVID and the climate crisis to gun violence and mental health.”\n\n“It is critically important that we have organizations such as this who understand that we must be intentional about lifting up our young leaders and encouraging your ambition,” she added.\n\nAfter a landslide loss to Trump in 2024, Harris pledged in her concession speech to “never give up the fight” — but has yet to indicate whether she will enter the California governor’s race next year or the presidential contest in 2028.\n\n“On the campaign, I would often say, ‘When we, fight, we win.’ But here’s the thing: Sometimes the fight takes a while.

Now what?","text":"After finally getting approval from the Federal Communications Commission, Skydance Media is just weeks away from completing its $8-billion merger with Paramount Global, leading to sweeping changes for some of the most iconic media brands. CBS, MTV Networks and Paramount Pictures are all bracing for upheaval when Larry Ellison and his son, David, take the keys from Paramount Global controlling shareholder Shari Redstone. The long-running ownership saga has played out while the rules of the media industry have been upended by streaming and, more recently, a White House unafraid to use its muscle to silence critics. Skydance and its backer, RedBird Capital Partners, have promised investors that it will find $2 billion in cost savings, which means further belt-tightening and layoffs. \"This will be the most dramatic change to the organization since its inception,\" said one longtime CBS insider who was not authorized to comment publicly. Here is what Wall Street and the media industry will be watching for once the deal closes on Aug. 7: Last year, Paramount+ added 10 million new subscribers to reach 77.5 million. Its subscriber count is now 79 million, thanks also to NFL programming, CBS shows such as “NCIS” and original hits including \"1923,\" \"Landman,\" \"Lioness\" and \"Tulsa King.\" Paramount has projected full-year U.S. profitability for Paramount+ this year, making it one of the fastest subscription services to get there. But its relatively scant resources and thinner slate has made it difficult to truly compete with Netflix and the other biggest players. One potential solution: partnering with a rival streamer to increase its reach. \"Questions around the long-term scalability of Parmamount+ continue to loom large,\" analyst firm MoffettNathanson noted in a report Friday. \"Will the new management team pursue external partnerships as a viable path forward?\" Ellison and his team have suggested that they will bring a tech-focused sensibility to Paramount. Technological prowess would help Paramount+ improve its user interface and recommendation process, which insiders acknowledge is currently underwhelming. As expected, the architect of Paramount+ original series strategy, Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy, will leave when the deal closes. Analysts also want to see Skydance will increase investment in film and TV franchises to revive assets that have been constrained by Paramount's debt. While Skydance will get a robust library of films and TV shows, it will also be faced with the slow-melting iceberg that is broadcast and cable TV, which continues to lose viewers. Streaming has surpassed broadcast and cable as the leading source of video consumption just as Skydance takes over CBS and Paramount Global's array of channels that include MTV, BET and Comedy Central. Doug Creutz, an analyst for TD Cowen, believes the merged company should consider spinning off traditional TV businesses, similar to what Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast are doing with their cable channels. Whether that will happen remains to be seen. \"There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount's growth profile by letting those assets go,\" Creutz wrote Friday. \"On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.\" A test of Skydance's commitment to broadcast may come if the FCC relaxes TV station ownership rules, which would likely lead to consolidation. CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" received a vote of confidence with the naming of Tanya Simon, a respected veteran insider to take over as executive producer. She was the choice of the program's strong-willed correspondents. Simon's appointment is expected to provide stability following the departure of longtime showrunner Bill Owens, who was forced out amid the push for a $16-million settlement over President Trump's lawsuit claiming the program deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to make her look better to voters. \"60 Minutes\" remained tough in its White House coverage as negotiations went on. The question is whether that approach will continue with new owners. Larry Ellison has a friendly relationship with the president, and the new owners agreed to appoint an ombudsman to oversee news coverage. Getting it right matters from a business perspective too, as \"60 Minutes\" remains the most profitable program on CBS. With Simon in place, new management is expected to address other areas of the news division that can use improvement. The network's revamp of the \"CBS Evening News\" has been a disappointment in the ratings and will likely see some changes. In the longer term, there has been chatter that Skydance may set its sights on acquiring CNN from Warner Bros. Discovery and combining it with the broadcast news operation, an idea that has been considered numerous times over the last few decades. CBS canceled \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" upsetting his fans, progressive Democratic legislators and other late-night hosts who make their living lampooning President Trump. The network said it was strictly a business decision, as the younger viewers who made late-night TV monstrously lucrative for decades are no longer showing up. The timing of the move made the company look as if it were capitulating to Trump, who long had the host on his enemies list. But Colbert will remain on the air through May. The show has already been sold to advertisers for next season. The host has remained unrelenting in his mockery of Trump. The season premiere of \"South Park\" only upped the ante. The animated series made references to the \"60 Minutes\" deal, showed Trump in bed with the devil and aired its own version of a Trump-mandated PSA, showing a naked president with talking genitalia. There is no question both shows will test the patience of the new owners. Pulling Colbert off or censoring the \"South Park\" creators, who just received a $1.5-billion deal to continue their show and move its library to Paramount+, would lead to a far greater backlash than what has been seen so far. Any attempt to curtail their voices will send a negative message to creative types who consider working with the company's movie and TV operations going forward. Over the last few years, Paramount Pictures — home of franchises such as “Transformers” and “Mission: Impossible” — has ranked either fifth or fourth at the domestic box office. So far this year, the lone major movie studio still located in Hollywood proper has accounted for about 7% of ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada, according to box office website the Numbers. Since the pandemic, the company has enjoyed a number of major hits, including “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 3.” It has also had some solid singles and doubles, including “Bob Marley: One Love.” But overall, the more-than-century-old studio has struggled from underinvestment in its intellectual property and movie brands. The latest “Mission: Impossible” starring Tom Cruise — the eighth and purportedly last in the series — grossed $589 million globally but cost $300 million to $400 million to make, not including marketing costs. Paramount's latest effort, an animated “Smurfs” reboot, sputtered at the box office. Next up: a reboot of “The Naked Gun.” The unit’s leader, Brian Robbins (also head of Nickelodeon at Paramount Global), is expected to leave the studio, though he has not officially announced his plans. David Ellison is a movie fan and is expected to take a particular interest in the operation, with plans to put Skydance’s chief creative officer, Dana Goldberg, in charge of film at Paramount. Skydance has worked with Paramount on movies before, producing “Maverick” and the “Missions: Impossible” films A transfer of ownership means the NFL can reopen its long-term deal with CBS, which has a Sunday package of games, the AFC Championship Game and two Super Bowls. The NFL is the lifeblood of broadcast television, providing a vast majority of the year's most-watched programs. Without the NFL, CBS would face tremendous challenges in getting fees from pay TV operators who carry its stations. Revenue from affiliates who pay the network for its programming would also dramatically decline. Although the NFL is known for taking a pound of flesh at every opportunity, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has signaled he will give careful consideration before making any changes. \"We've had a long relationship with CBS for decades and we also have a relationship outside of that with Skydance,\" Goodell told CNBC earlier this month. \"We have a two-year period to make that decision.

Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, disputed that characterisation.\n\n“There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in,” Cheung wrote on social media. “They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented.”\n\nThe back-and-forth escalated when 60 Minutes aired two different cuts from its interview with Harris.\n\nOne version, which aired on a sister programme, Face The Nation, featured more of Harris’s answer about her stance towards Israel. The other version, which aired on the 60 Minutes broadcast, was shorter.\n\nTrump called the different edits evidence of deceptive reporting tactics and filed a lawsuit against Paramount, CBS’s parent company.\n\n“CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” his court filing alleged.\n\n“That is false,” 60 Minutes responded in a statement on its website.\n\n“When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.”\n\nWhile many media experts expected Paramount to prevail on the merits of the case, the company instead sought to negotiate an end to the matter. Earlier this month, it agreed to pay $16m to Trump to go towards his future presidential library.\n\nShortly thereafter, another top CBS show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, revealed it had been cancelled, allegedly for financial reasons.\n\nBut the timing and unexpected nature of the cancellation drew speculation that it might have been an attempt to appease Trump and streamline the merger, given the fact that Colbert frequently lambasted the Republican president on his show.\n\nTrump himself posted on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nThe Late Show was consistently the top-rated late-night comedy show, and it had won a Peabody Award and multiple Emmy nods.\n\nDays later, on July 22, Trump called for more comedians to be ousted, writing, “It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!”\n\nThat same day, he confirmed he received the $16m for his 60 Minutes settlement, adding that he expected to be receive an additional $20m in free advertising and programming from the “new owners”.\n\nSouth Park TV show takes aim\n\nWithin weeks of both the 60 Minutes lawsuit settlement and the cancellation of The Late Show, the FCC gave its blessing to the merger between Paramount and Skydance.\n\nUnder the merger, Skydance founder David Ellison, the son of Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, is slated to helm operations.\n\nUpon the merger’s approval, Trump’s appointee to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, released a statement echoing some of the president’s criticisms of major news outlets.\n\nHe also hinted that the merger would result in changes to CBS’s news output.\n\n“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” he wrote. “It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcasting network.”\n\n“In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.”\n\nTo ensure compliance with that commitment, Carr said an ombudsman would be appointed to the media giant for a period of at least two years.\n\nCarr added that the merger between Skydance and Paramount would also bar the new mega-company from implementing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, which are designed to create an equal playing field for people regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion or ability.\n\nBut the merger did not put an end to the scrutiny of Trump on Paramount platforms.\n\nHours after the FCC granted its approval, the TV channel Comedy Central aired an episode of the animated series South Park that mocked President Trump and satirised its parent company’s $16m settlement.\n\nIn one scene, an animated Jesus attempts to warn the show’s characters about Trump.\n\n“The guy can do whatever he wants now that someone backed down, OK?” the animated Jesus says. “You guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert?”\n\nThe Trump administration has since blasted the show as irrelevant.","summary":"The merger has faced scrutiny for what critics view as capitulations to Donald Trump, including a $16m settlement.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/25/with-trump-go-ahead-skydance-and-paramount-to-complete-merger-in-august?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-24T225550Z_724683082_RC27RBACZYM8_RTRMADP_3_PARAMOUNT-GLOBAL-SKYDANCE-FCC-1753477479.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 22:26:36","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.336},{"id":345316966,"title":"FCC chairman assigns 'bias monitor' to CBS — who reports 'directly to the president'","text":"As part of its agreement to allow an $8 billion merger between media conglomerates Skydance and Paramount, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has assigned a government monitor to CBS (which is owned by Paramount) to rein in perceived \"bias\" against President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nTech outlet Gizmodo reported Friday on an interview FCC chairman Brendan Carr gave to far-right, pro-Trump network Newsmax, in which he gave new details on the conditions the administration imposed in its green-lighting of the merger.

While the Trump administration was considering whether to approve the proposed merger, Paramount settled Trump's lawsuit against CBS for $16 million over its \"60 Minutes\" interview with 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. \n\nSeveral days after late night host Stephen Colbert criticized the settlement, CBS announced it was cancelling his show in May of 2026, at the conclusion of the current broadcast season.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. I would like to talk a little bit about the strange, bizarre, endless, run-on, crazy interview that Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden’s son, gave with Andrew Callaghan, a so-called Generation Z internet influencer. \n\nIn this long interview, it was a spirited defense of his father, claiming that he was not demented at all, that he was in full control of his faculties, and he had a wonderful administration, and he was unfortunately aborted, kicked out, deposed by a sinister array of characters, whom he accused of being incompetent.\n\nSo he attacked George Clooney, who had written a letter about, in an op-ed about Joe Biden’s cognitive problems. He went after David Axelrod, who was also an advocate of removing Biden and putting in then-Vice President Kamala Harris, said his only claim to fame is he won one election. That’s kind of true, in the case of former President Barack Obama. And as Hunter said, Obama was the reason he was elected, not Axelrod. He went after James Carville. He went after Jake Tapper. He went after the entire Democratic establishment.\n\nBut what was very strange about what he did, he revealed himself. He attacked grifters in the Democratic Party that made a lot of money. That’s what he did. He said, “These people were unethical.” That’s what he was. \n\nRemember, he was a tax cheat. He never reported, fully, the income that he made by trading off his father’s name. He never truly gave us the full account of the Biden consortium—what his uncle, aunt, cousins, what they were actually doing to get such an enormous amount of money. He never explained why he accepted a pardon from his father. He never explained why his father actually signed his pardon, in opposition to what he did with everybody else, almost, with an autopen.\n\nAnd then it got very bizarre. He never mentioned that he had dated his brother’s widow and got her hooked on dangerous drugs. In fact, when he mentioned drugs, I thought he might refer to the cocaine that was found in a mail slot in the West Wing. He didn’t. Instead, he gave a defense of cocaine and suggested it’s not nearly as toxic as alcohol.\n\nWhen he was asked about the laptop—and remember the laptop was in the possession of the FBI for one year and they authenticated it as genuine, and they knew it was genuine. At the same time, they kept silent when “51 intelligence authorities” lied to the American people. And Joe Biden used that lie in the second debate of the 2020 campaign to say that Donald Trump was lying, that this laptop “had all the earmarks of Russian” information efforts—meaning “disinformation.” \n\nHe didn’t mention any of that. In fact, he just said about the laptop—in which he is seen using drugs, he’s in pornographic poses, but most importantly, he references his father as “the big guy” and “the 10% guy,” and he laments that he is the bagman for the family. \n\nIt’s very incriminating. But he doesn’t—as he has before—he has never denied that it was his. He never denies it’s his. He just says, “It’s irrelevant. If anybody had a laptop and you looked into it, all kinds of stuff would come out.”\n\nHe doesn’t talk about his art, that con where he was doodling and blowing paint on through his nose and then hawking that art to buyers, who wanted influence with his father. \n\nHis protestations that his father was heroic, that he was one of the best Democratic senators we’ve had, that his presidency was a smashing success are laughable.\n\nSo what am I getting at? What I’m getting at is this: It’s very dangerous to think that for four years we had a president who was mentally challenged, cognitively disabled, suffering dementia. And the close circle around them—whether they were former Obama operatives or Biden senatorial family, or his own real family—that these people were running the country. \n\nAnd the last year or two, if you look at photographs, videos of Biden giving a speech, Biden traveling, there’s one constant. It’s Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden was his eyes and his ears. And he was a close—and maybe the closest—adviser to his father.\n\nAnd after listening to that video, you can appreciate just how close we came to utter chaos and disruption, that a mentally challenged president and his addicted son had the most power of anybody in the entire world and were running this government with the help of who knows who. We have no idea.\n\nBottom line, if you listen to even a clip of that interview, it’s frightening that this man was anywhere near the presidency. And how he got near the presidency and how the president was the president is a scandal in itself of historical proportions.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see...

No, It’s Not Elon Musk.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThis week has demonstrated that the tech “broligarch” who’s most influenced President Donald Trump’s second administration isn’t Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, or Marc Andreessen—it’s Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, the 80-year-old software tycoon who recently became the second-richest man in the world.\n\nJust look at everything that’s gone his way. On Thursday evening, the Federal Communications Commission finally voted to approve Paramount’s $8.4 billion merger with fellow entertainment firm Skydance Media. The controversial, long-awaited deal only came about thanks to Paramount’s appeals to this administration: settling a baseless lawsuit that Trump brought against 60 Minutes for “deceptively” editing its Kamala Harris interview, pressuring subsidiary CBS News to shift its “balance” in a right-wing direction, and canceling presidential foe and beloved comedian Stephen Colbert’s highly rated late-night talk show.\n\nOf note: Skydance is owned by Ellison’s son, David, who personally met with both Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr to get the deal done. The elder Ellison is covering most of the cash to close the Skydance-Paramount merger, which will give him significant control over the new company and a chance to carry out, as he detailed in federal filings, a wholesale transformation of CBS in his vision—including broadcasts of complimentary PSAs for Trump administration initiatives.\n\nWhen Carr announced the merger approval, he positively affirmed “Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” including the impending hire of an “ombudsman” who’ll monitor CBS News broadcasts for “bias” as the overall company slashes its diversity, equity, and inclusion guidelines. Said Trump himself of his “friend” Larry Ellison: “I think he’s going to run CBS really well, and I think he’s making a good deal to buy it.”\n\nThrough this brazenly corrupt arrangement, the U.S. president has granted one of his pals uninhibited control over a longtime bastion of mainstream, fact-based news, which he openly intends to bend toward his conservative vision. And that’s just one of the ways Trump is helping Larry Ellison become the most powerful and not-so-secretly influential tech mogul in the country.\n\nOracle, which Larry still runs as chief technology officer and board chairman, is also in talks with David Ellison’s Skydance for a major deal that would see the latter pay the former $100 million a year to run all of Paramount’s tech through Oracle’s valuable cloud-computing software. Skydance already pays Oracle $2.2 million a year for its cloud and platform products, and the FCC explicitly signed off on David Ellison’s plan to run all of Paramount’s and Skydance’s on the same cloud tech, which will happen to be provided by Oracle. In addition, David promised to improve the recommendation algorithms on Paramount+ through artificial intelligence—a type of tech that Oracle specializes in. Larry himself even appeared at the White House in January for Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion A.I.-investment initiative known as Project Stargate, which enlists Oracle to build out masses of data centers across Texas.\n\nThere are other ways Trump is ensuring that Ellison benefits from the A.I. race. The day before the FCC approved Skydance-Paramount, the president hosted a kickoff event at the White House for his AI Action Plan, a new federal framework for tech regulation (or lack thereof). Much of the plan reads like a Christmas gift list for Larry Ellison and Oracle in particular, including overriding environmental protections to construct those Stargate-style A.I. data-center campuses, prioritizing contracts with “free speech”–focused A.I. firms like Elon Musk’s xAI (in which Ellison and Oracle are both invested), integrating A.I. infrastructure into the Pentagon, and centralizing the government’s massive data sets (a special focus of Oracle’s).\n\nFurther, the Trump administration’s plans for undermining China’s A.I. ambitions also involve kowtowing to Ellison—by using him to force some American control over TikTok.\n\nThe megapopular video app has been a motif in the Trump-Ellison relationship for a while now. In 2020, when Trump first demanded that TikTok be banned from American app stores until it found a U.S.-based buyer, Ellison placated the president by fundraising for his reelection campaign. Trump then blessed Oracle as the rightful leader of a new “TikTok Global” entity that, in partnership with Walmart and other American investors, would move the app’s infrastructure stateside and relegate TikTok’s parent company, China’s Bytedance, to minority-owner status. That was all scuttled when Joe Biden won the fall election and took a different approach to the platform.\n\nBut, ever since Trump returned to office, he’s been eager to get a TikTok deal done, even though negotiations have dragged on long past his own self-imposed deadlines. Through it all, Ellison has again remained by his side, with Oracle consistently being named as the owner-in-waiting for a U.S.-controlled TikTok, in spite of Bytedance’s denials. Such a transaction would likely force the app to divest its powerful “secret sauce” algorithm and China-based data servers—meaning that Oracle would gain control over the newly customized A.I. and data systems for American TikTok. Notably, the platform already stores a lot of user data in Oracle’s Texas-based servers, but an out-and-out sale would mean that foreign users’ TikTok data would no longer be housed with Oracle. American TikTok’s American algorithm will be trained by American user data.\n\nFrom that perspective, you can view the AI Action Plan with its emphasis on “American AI” as yet another blessing for Ellison’s TikTok ambitions. Furthermore, you can view all these developments as a direct payoff for Ellison for his longtime investment in Trump. Not least since Ellison remains Oracle’s largest shareholder—and Oracle’s stock value has been popping thanks to the Trump White House’s favorable A.I. regulations and deals. That stock jump is a big factor in why Ellison has become the second-wealthiest person in the world.\n\nIt’s also worth emphasizing that Larry Ellison’s journey to this level of wealth and power—both political and cultural—would not have happened had he not solidified his relationship with Trump long before any of these other tech CEOs came to embrace him. (Peter Thiel is perhaps the sole exception here.) After Donald Trump was first elected president in 2016, Oracle CEO Safra Catz joined the executive committee for Trump’s transition team and occasionally advised him during that first term, while still working with Ellison. In November 2020, after Ellison’s prior fundraisers failed to boost Trump to reelection, the tech titan joined a group call with Sean Hannity and Sen. Lindsey Graham, among others, to discuss how to contest the election results. After the Jan. 6 insurrection, Oracle’s political action committee pledged to no longer back the politicians who’d objected to the Electoral College’s certification of Biden’s victory—only to quickly turn on that promise during the 2022 midterms, when it backed election deniers like Reps. Steve Scalise, Jim Banks, Jim Jordan, Ralph Norman, and Darrell Issa. That same year, Ellison also invested in Musk’s far-right Twitter takeover.\n\nIn addition, the multibillionaire began positioning himself closer to Mar-a-Lago, investing amply in a small island town close to Trump’s Florida residence and transforming it into a hub for the country’s wealthiest to congregate. As such, although he initially backed Sen. Tim Scott for the 2024 GOP nomination, it was easy for Ellison to begin dining with Trump again as the ex-president’s candidacy seemed assured—and for Oracle to begin working with the Heritage Foundation to compile a database of potential Trump appointees who’d be unfailingly loyal. Ellison also joined the Silicon Valley adviser army that descended upon Mar-a-Lago when Trump won reelection, then went on to cheer Musk’s DOGE rampage and propose that all “national data” be put into a singular database that would feed an A.I. model—a vision that may be in reach thanks to the action plan, whose data-concentration goals would build upon DOGE’s addition of A.I. to various government functions.\n\nNow, just six months into Trump’s term, Ellison has procured for himself a sweeping empire, ruling over acres’ worth of A.I. infrastructure, gaining a megasized media arm for himself via Paramount-Skydance, potentially winning another powerful media apparatus with TikTok, and seeing his own ideologies and goals reflected by a friendly White House. The Trump 2.0 era has been spectacular for “one rich asshole called Larry Ellison”—mostly because he’s done so much to shape it.","summary":"With the Paramount-Skydance merger approved by the FCC, Larry Ellison just showed the world who is the real shot caller in the White House.","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2025/07/larry-ellison-donald-trump-paramount-skydance-merger.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/8ae37f84-a7db-494b-b3d0-dbc1f8dfa9ce.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 21:50:03","author":"Nitish Pahwa","authors":["Nitish Pahwa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.196},{"id":345309776,"title":"Trump Urges Europe to Take Action on Immigration","text":"President Donald Trump said Europe ‘better get your act together’ on immigration, US President Donald Trump said as he landed in Scotland.\n\nMr Trump landed in the country earlier today for a four-day visit to both of his golf clubs in Aberdeen and Ayrshire.\n\nJetting in at around 8.30pm, the president was greeted by Scottish Secretary Ian Murray before speaking to reporters.\n\nWhen questioned about illegal immigration, a long-standing issue for UK governments, Mr. Trump commented: ‘Regarding immigration, you need to sort things out. Otherwise, Europe as you know it may cease to exist. Take action now.’\n\n‘As you know, last month we had nobody entering our country – nobody, (we) shut it down.’\n\nHe added: ‘You’ve got to stop this horrible invasion that’s happening to Europe’ add that immigration was ‘killing Europe’.\n\nHe added that some European leaders have ‘prevented it from happening’ but are not being properly acknowledged for their efforts, although he did not specify who he meant.\n\nThe president then commended Sir Keir Starmer before an upcoming meeting between them at one of his venues, referring to him as a ‘good man’.\n\n‘I like your Prime Minister, he’s slightly more liberal than I am – as you probably heard – but he’s a good man. He got a trade deal done,’ he said.\n\n‘You know, they’ve been working on this deal for 12 years, he got it done – that’s a good deal, it’s a good deal for the UK.’\n\nMr Trump also suggested he would be meeting Sir Keir ‘tomorrow evening’, although it is understood the pair will not meet until Monday.\n\nAs well as the Prime Minister, Scottish First Minister John Swinney will meet with the president, as will European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who confirmed on X she will come to Scotland on Sunday in a bid to hash out a trade deal between the US and Europe.\n\nMr Trump told journalists there was a ‘good 50/50 chance’ of a deal being struck, adding that it would be the ‘biggest deal of them all’.\n\nThe president and Sir Keir are expected to discuss potential changes to the UK-US trade deal which came into force last month.\n\nMr Swinney has pledged to ‘essentially speak out for Scotland’.\n\nSpeaking as he boarded Air Force One in the US, Mr Trump said he would be having dinner with the Prime Minister at Turnberry, before ‘going to the oil capital of Europe, which is Aberdeen’.\n\nHe said: ‘We’re going to have a good time. I think the Prime Minister and I get along very well.’\n\nMr Trump added: ‘We’re going to be talking about the trade deal that we made and maybe even approve it.’\n\nHe also told journalists he was ‘looking forward’ to meeting with the ‘Scottish leader’ Mr Swinney, describing him as a ‘good man’.\n\nA huge security operation codenamed Operation Roll 2, involving police from across the UK and expected to cost £3million, is underway – with protests planned in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and at both golf courses.\n\nA 10ft-high metal barrier ‘ring of steel’ has been installed at Turnberry to protect the President. Mr Trump’s family have spoken of their excitement over his visit with Eric Trump, the executive vice-president of his father’s Trump Organization, saying the President had waited ‘years’ to come back to the country of his late mother’s birth.\n\nEric Trump told the Scottish Daily Mail: ‘We have just completed the greatest course on Earth and waited years for this day to come. I’ve never been more proud to have my father arrive in Scotland to see his original dream come to fruition.’\n\nKirsty Haigh, of the Scotland Against Trump group, told Sky News: ‘He should not be welcomed by us.’\n\nAlong with protests, Trump’ visit has been overshadowed already by the Jeffrey Epstein case, with daily revelations and new legal developments.\n\nHe chided reporters for pestering about the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, whose case has roiled his administration.\n\n‘You’re making a very big thing over something that’s not a big thing,’ he said.\n\nAsked about Ghislaine Maxwell’s meeting with a top Justice Department official, Trump responded: ‘I don’t know anything about he conversation. I haven’t really been following it.’\n\nHe isn’t ruling out a presidential pardon. ‘This is no time to be talking about pardons,’ he said. \n\nHe pushed back when asked about infrastructure issues that the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews has raised about Turnberry being able to handle a massive tournament. \n\n‘The best course anywhere in the world, is Turnberry. The players all want to be a Turnberry. Everybody wants to be a Turnberry,’ Trump said.\n\nHe said the course infrastructure ‘is good,’ and said the Royal and Ancient ‘spent a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars, or probably into the millions of dollars, and they’ve laid all the wire for television and for electricity under the holes of Turnberry.\n\n‘So when the Open gets there, they have it all done. They paid for that,’ Trump said.\n\nTrump’s windmill grudge is familiar to many Americans. He raised the issue while calling Aberdeen the ‘oil capital of Europe.’\n\n‘You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place, ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds, and if they’re stuck in the ocean, ruining your oceans,’ Trump fumed. ‘Stop the windmills.’\n\nTrump, 79, has made golf an important part of his life and his business empire – visiting courses more than 60 times in his second term. He is doing so again six months into his second term, with planned visits to both of his Scottish courses.\n\nBack in D.C., the president spoke reverentially about his Turnberry course as he left the White House – but still got hit with questions about whether he would pardon Ghislaine Maxwell, who met with top DOJ officials this week amid new scrutiny of the convicted sex offender who died in his jail cell. \n\nHe issued a new iteration of his denial of a sensational report in the Wall Street Journal that he drew a picture of a woman for Epstein as part of a special birthday volume. ‘Somebody could have written a letter and used my name,’ Trump posited. He said he has the ‘power’ to pardon Maxwell, who is serving jail time after being convicted of assisting Epstein in his sex trafficking network.\n\nHere in Scotland, Trump is set to inaugurate a new course in Aberdeenshire, on a trip where squeezing his hosts to bring the British Open to his Turnberry Course is also on tap. \n\nThe new MacLeod course in Menie is named for his late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born in Scotland and emigrated to the U.S.\n\nTrump is already predicting victory on that front. ‘I think they will do that,’ he said of bringing the Open to his Turnberry course. ‘Turnberry is rated the number one course in the world. I think they’ll do that.’\n\nBut he pushed back when asked if he was going to convince anyone of his stance on the trip. ‘No, it’s not about that,’ Trump said. \n\n‘It’s the best resort in the world, I think, Turnberry, and it’s one of the greatest courses in the world.’ \n\nTrump’s comments come after hundreds of protestors concerned about a controversial migrant hotel marched through Epping as police launched a huge operation to stop the event once again spilling over into violence.\n\nResidents walked with placards and flags from The Bell Hotel to the local council building, where a debate was being held over the future of two establishments that have been used to house asylum seekers.\n\nAs protests raged outside, councillors in Epping unanimously voted to urge the government to close The Bell Hotel and The Phoenix Hotel.\n\nA person was arrested for breaching an order in place that prevents anyone from wearing a face covering, Essex Police said.\n\nA total of 16 arrests were made following a protest outside the same hotel last week.\n\nThe Bell Hotel has become the focus of anger against migrants after one of its guests was charged with sexually assaulting two teenage girls just days after arriving in Britain.\n\nNews spread quickly on social media and Epping has endured several protests in the last fortnight, with the event on July 17 descending into violence as rioters jumped up on down on the roof of a police van and thugs smashed their windows.\n\nYesterday, metal fencing was delivered to the beleaguered Bell Hotel on the back of a flatbed truck, in a seeming drive to beef up the building’s defences.\n\nPolice in riot gear were spotted forming a barrier around The Bell, lining both sides of the road, with a canine team also present.\n\nProtesters marched from The Bell to Epping Forest District Council, which closed early today due to the protest.\n\nA message on the council’s website read: ‘Due to potential travel disruptions related to the planned demonstration at the Bell Hotel in Epping this evening, the Civic Offices will close at 4pm today to help staff and visitors travel home and reduce congestion in Epping High Street and surrounding areas.\n\n‘Please use our website to access a range of online services. We will be open as usual tomorrow morning, Friday 25 July 2025.’\n\nAt 7pm councillors began a meeting to discuss a motion calling for the immediate and permanent closure of the Bell Hotel and Phoenix Hotel.\n\nThe later was reportedly the target of an alleged arson attack on March 28. It is believed the meeting to close the two hotel’s pre-dated the protests this month.\n\nA dispersal order was also issued by police in Epping following the demonstrations outside The Bell Hotel earlier this month.\n\nA potential championship isn’t the only dealmaking on the horizon. Trump and British PM Keir Starmer, who inked a trade deal at the G7 in Canada shortly before Starmer dropped it on camera, still must negotiate substantial details.\n\nThat puts prices for cars, auto parts, chicken, beef, and digital clicks in play, after a U.S.-UK trade deal in May set only broad parameters but left many details to be worked out. \n\nTrump set off confusion before he even left the White House when he told reporters that ‘We’re meeting with the prime minister tonight’ and that ‘We’re going to be talking about the trade deal that we made and maybe even improve it.’\n\nThere was no expectation that Trump would even see Starmer until later in his visit. \n\nThere was, however, a new addition to his schedule. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would meet with Trump Sunday to ‘discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong’ – setting up another high stakes negotiation.\n\nTrump has been flouting his ability to bring other nations to heel by publicly releasing trade letters announcing what tariffs they will face. The White House said the number had reached 25 before he left Washington. \n\nTrump blasted out yet another threat Friday when he said there was a ‘fifty-fifty’ chance of a deal with the European Union, while saying the powerful trade block must ‘buy down’ the threatened 30 percent tariff. \n\nBut the lure of his upcoming State Visit and meeting with King Charles is preventing Trump from playing full hardball, one insider tells the Daily Mail. \n\nTrump’s language as he left town was very much in keeping with that stance.\n\nTrump called it ‘more fine-tuning.’\n\n‘And also we do a little celebrating together, because, you know, we got along very well. UK has been trying to make a deal with us for like 12 years, and haven’t been able to do it. We got it done.’\n\nHe called Starmer a ‘good prime minister’ and a ‘good guy’ who was ‘doing a very good job. \n\n‘So we’re going to see. We’re going to meet at Turnberry and we’re going to meet at Aberdeen. So two beautiful places.’ But he said there was ‘not a lot’ of wiggle room on steel and aluminum tariffs he has imposed using Section 232 authority.\n\nThe absence of detailed information on the weekend schedule released by the White House makes clear that there is plenty of golf in Trump’s future. He has no public events Saturday or Sunday, when he will be at Turnberry.\n\nHis Starmer meeting comes Monday, after which the pair are expected to tour Trump’s new course. \n\nTrump is also expected to meeting First Minister John Swinney, who is scoring the face time despite publicly backing Trump’s rival Kamala Harris in the election. \n\nAlso greeting Trump: protests. During his 2018 visit to Scotland during his first term, Trump was trailed by a Trump baby balloon.\n\nThis time, the Stop Trump Coalition is among groups planning to make a public statement, with protests expected at both of Trump’s courses. \n\nTrump’s former national security advisor John Bolton is among those positing that Trump’s trip is more than a weekend getaway.\n\nHe noted that Trump hadn’t been there in seven years, and said maybe it would ‘kick up a little free advertising after he comes and goes.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Europe &#8216;better get your act together&#8217; on immigration, US&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Urges Europe to Take Action on Immigration first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-urges-europe-to-take-action-on-immigration/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Get-your-act-together-on-immigration-Trump-tells-Europe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 21:40:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":345304894,"title":"Promise of ‘a little rebate’ suddenly becomes Trump’s latest gimmick to distract Americans from the Epstein fallout","text":"In the months after the 2024 presidential election — and understanding what happened with Latino voters and why they shifted to Donald Trump — I called a Democratic operative in Webb County, right in the heart of the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. \n\nShe told told me that when asking why one voter would back the once and future president, put simply, the voter told them in Spanish, “I voted for Trump because he’s going to give me money.” \n\nFamously, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump signed an economic rescue package that included a $1,200 check.

The establishment is popular with bold faced names like Tom Hanks, Bill and Hillary Clinton, George Clooney, and U2’s Bono.\n\nIts menu boasts caviar and potatoes for $145, pan-seared Dover sole for $80, and even $18 pigs in a blanket. One of its cocktails, The Family Reserve — which contains Jose Cuervo Reserva de la Familia Extra Añejo Tequila, D.O.M. Benedictine and Brandy, Crème de Cacao, and Amaro Averna — will set you back $50.\n\nNobiletti claimed he “faced terrible sexual harassment” and was fired in February 2024 after he complained human resources.\n\nSupervisors told him he was being let go “for drinking at work even though, since the Polo Bar opened in 2015, management and staff regularly drank alcohol and used illegal drugs during work hours with little to no consequences for such actions,” he said in the legal papers.\n\n“While the restaurant and its hard-working staff do everything they can to ensure that their guests have a first class experience, defendants completely failed to guarantee that their employees had a safe and legal work environment,” he said in the July 22 filing.\n\nIn a statement to The Post, Polo Bar said: “We have high standards for how employees conduct themselves and no tolerance for misconduct, so we take swift action when these standards are not met. This includes Mr. Nobiletti’s termination that was based on clear evidence of his misconduct. Because we take all employee-related concerns seriously, we thoroughly investigated Mr. Nobiletti’s allegations and determined they have no merit.”\n\nNobiletti is seeking unspecified damages. His attorneys declined to discuss the case.

So we’re taking him to court.\n\nLast September, America First Policy Institute launched a formal investigation into the people and motivations behind Bragg’s decision to prosecute Trump.\n\nOur effort had a simple goal: figuring out whether Bragg’s case was a routine legal probe — or lawfare, a politically engineered hit job orchestrated to influence the 2024 election. \n\nThe charges brought against Trump were extraordinary.\n\nNever before has a question of federal campaign-finance law — which the FEC declined to pursue, no less — been morphed into a state-level misdemeanor, already time-barred under New York law, then Frankensteined into a felony by alleging it was committed to conceal some other crime never defined by the prosecution, nor unanimously agreed upon by jury.\n\nConfusing? That’s the point. Bragg’s office thrives on obfuscation.Public records should be accessible. Criminal prosecutions should be transparent.\n\nThis case was neither — and still isn’t.\n\nWe were drawn to investigate because we saw just too many coincidences to ignore.\n\nMichael Colangelo, a top DOJ official with a focus on white-collar crime, left his Biden administration post to join Bragg’s office just months before Trump was indicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan, who presided over Bragg’s prosecution, had a history of political donations to Biden and to political groups opposed to Trump, the defendant before him. He was officially “cautioned” on that by the state ethics board.\n\nMerchan’s daughter Loren worked on Kamala Harris’ 2020 campaign and during Trump’s trial served as president of Authentic Campaigns, a progressive political consulting firm hired by the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nIt all paints a curious picture: A DA who campaigned on a promise to take down Trump, aided by a Biden DOJ veteran, bringing legally contorted charges before a judge with clear partisan connections.\n\nIf this wasn’t coordinated, it’s one lucky political pile-up.\n\nThe American people deserve answers.\n\nIn pursuit of those answers, and in defense of the public’s right to know, AFPI submitted a request to Bragg’s office under New York’s Freedom of Information Law in September 2024.\n\nWe sought any records that could shed light on whether political influence or coordination played a role in Bragg’s decision-making.\n\nOur request was specific, lawfully submitted and directly tied to one of the most consequential legal proceedings in modern American history.\n\nTen months later, no records have been produced. None. Though they apparently exist. \n\nInstead of providing transparency, the DA’s office has engaged in delay, double-talk and silence.\n\nWe’ve asked for a list of responsive documents. They won’t give one.\n\nWe’ve asked which of our specific requests the withheld documents pertain to. They won’t say.\n\nWe know, based on our investigation and his office’s limited correspondence with us, that the DA possesses hundreds of records of communications with or about political agents who should have had no influence in a “routine” prosecution, like Lauren Merchan’s Authentic Campaigns.\n\nBragg refuses to explain why the public isn’t entitled to see them.\n\nThere is no legal justification for this blackout.

You're not going to have Europe anymore, you've got to get your act together.\n\n'As you know, last month we had nobody entering our country - nobody, (we) shut it down.'\n\nHe added: 'You've got to stop this horrible invasion that's happening to Europe' add that immigration was 'killing Europe'.\n\nSome European leaders, he continued, 'have not let it happen' and are 'not getting the proper credit they should', though the president did not say who he was talking about.\n\nThe president also praised Sir Keir Starmer ahead of a meeting between the two at one of his courses in the coming days, describing him as a 'good man'.\n\n'I like your Prime Minister, he's slightly more liberal than I am - as you probably heard - but he's a good man. He got a trade deal done,' he said.\n\n'You know, they've been working on this deal for 12 years, he got it done - that's a good deal, it's a good deal for the UK.'\n\nMr Trump also suggested he would be meeting Sir Keir 'tomorrow evening', although it is understood the pair will not meet until Monday.\n\nAs well as the Prime Minister, Scottish First Minister John Swinney will meet with the president, as will European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who confirmed on X she will come to Scotland on Sunday in a bid to hash out a trade deal between the US and Europe.\n\nMr Trump told journalists there was a 'good 50/50 chance' of a deal being struck, adding that it would be the 'biggest deal of them all'.\n\nThe president and Sir Keir are expected to discuss potential changes to the UK-US trade deal which came into force last month.\n\nMr Swinney has pledged to 'essentially speak out for Scotland'.\n\nSpeaking as he boarded Air Force One in the US, Mr Trump said he would be having dinner with the Prime Minister at Turnberry, before 'going to the oil capital of Europe, which is Aberdeen'.\n\nHe said: 'We're going to have a good time. I think the Prime Minister and I get along very well.'\n\nMr Trump added: 'We're going to be talking about the trade deal that we made and maybe even approve it.'\n\nHe also told journalists he was 'looking forward' to meeting with the 'Scottish leader' Mr Swinney, describing him as a 'good man'.\n\nA huge security operation codenamed Operation Roll 2, involving police from across the UK and expected to cost £3million, is underway – with protests planned in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and at both golf courses.\n\nA 10ft-high metal barrier 'ring of steel' has been installed at Turnberry to protect the President. Mr Trump's family have spoken of their excitement over his visit with Eric Trump, the executive vice-president of his father's Trump Organization, saying the President had waited 'years' to come back to the country of his late mother's birth.\n\nEric Trump told the Scottish Daily Mail: 'We have just completed the greatest course on Earth and waited years for this day to come. I've never been more proud to have my father arrive in Scotland to see his original dream come to fruition.'\n\nKirsty Haigh, of the Scotland Against Trump group, told Sky News: 'He should not be welcomed by us.'\n\nAlong with protests, Trump' visit has been overshadowed already by the Jeffrey Epstein case, with daily revelations and new legal developments.\n\nHe chided reporters for pestering about the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, whose case has roiled his administration.\n\n'You're making a very big thing over something that's not a big thing,' he said.\n\nAsked about Ghislaine Maxwell's meeting with a top Justice Department official, Trump responded: 'I don't know anything about he conversation. I haven't really been following it.'\n\nHe isn't ruling out a presidential pardon. 'This is no time to be talking about pardons,' he said. \n\nHe pushed back when asked about infrastructure issues that the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews has raised about Turnberry being able to handle a massive tournament. \n\n'The best course anywhere in the world, is Turnberry. The players all want to be a Turnberry. Everybody wants to be a Turnberry,' Trump said.\n\nHe said the course infrastructure 'is good,' and said the Royal and Ancient 'spent a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars, or probably into the millions of dollars, and they've laid all the wire for television and for electricity under the holes of Turnberry.\n\n'So when the Open gets there, they have it all done. They paid for that,' Trump said.\n\nTrump's windmill grudge is familiar to many Americans. He raised the issue while calling Aberdeen the 'oil capital of Europe.'\n\n'You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place, ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds, and if they're stuck in the ocean, ruining your oceans,' Trump fumed. 'Stop the windmills.'\n\nTrump, 79, has made golf an important part of his life and his business empire – visiting courses more than 60 times in his second term. He is doing so again six months into his second term, with planned visits to both of his Scottish courses.\n\nBack in D.C., the president spoke reverentially about his Turnberry course as he left the White House – but still got hit with questions about whether he would pardon Ghislaine Maxwell, who met with top DOJ officials this week amid new scrutiny of the convicted sex offender who died in his jail cell. \n\nHe issued a new iteration of his denial of a sensational report in the Wall Street Journal that he drew a picture of a woman for Epstein as part of a special birthday volume. 'Somebody could have written a letter and used my name,' Trump posited. He said he has the 'power' to pardon Maxwell, who is serving jail time after being convicted of assisting Epstein in his sex trafficking network.\n\nHere in Scotland, Trump is set to inaugurate a new course in Aberdeenshire, on a trip where squeezing his hosts to bring the British Open to his Turnberry Course is also on tap. \n\nThe new MacLeod course in Menie is named for his late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born in Scotland and emigrated to the U.S.\n\nTrump is already predicting victory on that front. 'I think they will do that,' he said of bringing the Open to his Turnberry course. 'Turnberry is rated the number one course in the world. I think they'll do that.'\n\nBut he pushed back when asked if he was going to convince anyone of his stance on the trip. 'No, it's not about that,' Trump said. \n\n'It's the best resort in the world, I think, Turnberry, and it's one of the greatest courses in the world.' \n\nTrump's comments come after hundreds of protestors concerned about a controversial migrant hotel marched through Epping as police launched a huge operation to stop the event once again spilling over into violence.\n\nResidents walked with placards and flags from The Bell Hotel to the local council building, where a debate was being held over the future of two establishments that have been used to house asylum seekers.\n\nAs protests raged outside, councillors in Epping unanimously voted to urge the government to close The Bell Hotel and The Phoenix Hotel.\n\nA person was arrested for breaching an order in place that prevents anyone from wearing a face covering, Essex Police said.\n\nA total of 16 arrests were made following a protest outside the same hotel last week.\n\nThe Bell Hotel has become the focus of anger against migrants after one of its guests was charged with sexually assaulting two teenage girls just days after arriving in Britain.\n\nNews spread quickly on social media and Epping has endured several protests in the last fortnight, with the event on July 17 descending into violence as rioters jumped up on down on the roof of a police van and thugs smashed their windows.\n\nYesterday, metal fencing was delivered to the beleaguered Bell Hotel on the back of a flatbed truck, in a seeming drive to beef up the building's defences.\n\nPolice in riot gear were spotted forming a barrier around The Bell, lining both sides of the road, with a canine team also present.\n\nProtesters marched from The Bell to Epping Forest District Council, which closed early today due to the protest.\n\nA message on the council's website read: 'Due to potential travel disruptions related to the planned demonstration at the Bell Hotel in Epping this evening, the Civic Offices will close at 4pm today to help staff and visitors travel home and reduce congestion in Epping High Street and surrounding areas.\n\n'Please use our website to access a range of online services. We will be open as usual tomorrow morning, Friday 25 July 2025.'\n\nAt 7pm councillors began a meeting to discuss a motion calling for the immediate and permanent closure of the Bell Hotel and Phoenix Hotel.\n\nThe later was reportedly the target of an alleged arson attack on March 28. It is believed the meeting to close the two hotel's pre-dated the protests this month.\n\nA dispersal order was also issued by police in Epping following the demonstrations outside The Bell Hotel earlier this month.\n\nA potential championship isn't the only dealmaking on the horizon. Trump and British PM Keir Starmer, who inked a trade deal at the G7 in Canada shortly before Starmer dropped it on camera, still must negotiate substantial details.\n\nThat puts prices for cars, auto parts, chicken, beef, and digital clicks in play, after a U.S.-UK trade deal in May set only broad parameters but left many details to be worked out. \n\nTrump set off confusion before he even left the White House when he told reporters that 'We're meeting with the prime minister tonight' and that 'We're going to be talking about the trade deal that we made and maybe even improve it.'\n\nThere was no expectation that Trump would even see Starmer until later in his visit. \n\nThere was, however, a new addition to his schedule. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would meet with Trump Sunday to 'discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong' – setting up another high stakes negotiation.\n\nTrump has been flouting his ability to bring other nations to heel by publicly releasing trade letters announcing what tariffs they will face. The White House said the number had reached 25 before he left Washington. \n\nTrump blasted out yet another threat Friday when he said there was a 'fifty-fifty' chance of a deal with the European Union, while saying the powerful trade block must 'buy down' the threatened 30 percent tariff. \n\nBut the lure of his upcoming State Visit and meeting with King Charles is preventing Trump from playing full hardball, one insider tells the Daily Mail. \n\nTrump's language as he left town was very much in keeping with that stance.\n\nTrump called it 'more fine-tuning.'\n\n'And also we do a little celebrating together, because, you know, we got along very well. UK has been trying to make a deal with us for like 12 years, and haven't been able to do it. We got it done.'\n\nHe called Starmer a 'good prime minister' and a 'good guy' who was 'doing a very good job. \n\n'So we're going to see. We're going to meet at Turnberry and we're going to meet at Aberdeen. So two beautiful places.' But he said there was 'not a lot' of wiggle room on steel and aluminum tariffs he has imposed using Section 232 authority.\n\nThe absence of detailed information on the weekend schedule released by the White House makes clear that there is plenty of golf in Trump's future. He has no public events Saturday or Sunday, when he will be at Turnberry.\n\nHis Starmer meeting comes Monday, after which the pair are expected to tour Trump's new course. \n\nTrump is also expected to meeting First Minister John Swinney, who is scoring the face time despite publicly backing Trump's rival Kamala Harris in the election. \n\nAlso greeting Trump: protests. During his 2018 visit to Scotland during his first term, Trump was trailed by a Trump baby balloon.\n\nThis time, the Stop Trump Coalition is among groups planning to make a public statement, with protests expected at both of Trump's courses. \n\nTrump's former national security advisor John Bolton is among those positing that Trump's trip is more than a weekend getaway.\n\nHe noted that Trump hadn't been there in seven years, and said maybe it would 'kick up a little free advertising after he comes and goes.","summary":"Mr Trump landed in the country earlier today for a four-day visit to both of his golf clubs in Aberdeen and Ayrshire.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14941879/Get-act-Bullish-Donald-Trump-touches-Scotland-inaugurate-new-golf-course-immediately-warns-Europe-wont-exist-unless-cracks-immigration.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/20/100641123-0-image-a-25_1753471783758.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/25/5211625687523477841/1024x576_MP4_5211625687523477841.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-25 21:17:29","author":"Editor,Poppy Atkinson Gibson","authors":["Editor","Poppy Atkinson Gibson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":345292358,"title":"Who is Kerstin Emhoff?

How else can one explain why the Republican majority is continuing the blockade Reid initiated back in 2007 to prevent a Republican president (George W. Bush) from using recess appointments to get around the various roadblocks Reid put in place to delay confirming Bush’s nominees? \n\nAs of July 22, there were 256 nominations pending in the Senate. It has been six months since Donald Trump has been inaugurated and, in that time, only 86 nominees have been confirmed. Vital leadership posts in numerous government agencies remain unfilled, severely handicapping the president’s ability to make the changes that are needed—and that were supported by 77 million Americans who voted for him in the 2024 election—to reduce the size and scope of the bloated executive branch. \n\nNot a single U.S. attorney—the lawyers responsible for vital criminal prosecutions all over the country—has yet been confirmed, leading to fiascoes like Democrat-appointed federal judges refusing to reappoint Alina Habba as the temporary U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. The president has been forced to yank her nomination from the Senate so she can continue to serve as the acting U.S. attorney, all because her confirmation has been held up. \n\nThere is no justifiable reason for this situation to exist. Or for the current Senate to continue Reid’s political strategy. \n\nSo, what are we talking about? We’re talking about the pro forma sessions that Reid implemented in 2007 so that the Senate is never formally in a “recess” as outlined in the Constitution. That prevents the president from appointing federal officers—who can start serving immediately —to fill positions that otherwise require Senate confirmation (about 1,200 positions). \n\nSection 2 of Article II of the Constitution provides that “The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.” \n\nIn plain English, this means that when the Senate is not in session because senators have fled Washington to return to their home states and the Senate is unable to conduct any business—such as confirming nominees—the president can fill those open slots in the executive branch, whether it is a U.S. attorney or an assistant secretary in some cabinet position. \n\nThose appointments only last until the congressional session ends. Thus, anyone appointed now in the 119th Congress could only serve until the congressional session ends. That would give the Senate time to process the regular nomination of someone the president has recess-appointed and hold a vote on that person’s confirmation to a full term. \n\nIt is important to note, as liberal Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court in NLRB v. Canning (2014), “Presidents have made recess appointments since the beginning of the Republic,” B.R. (Before Reid). \n\nSuch appointments have occurred during both “inter-session recesses,” which are breaks between formal sessions of the Senate, and “intra-session recesses,” which are breaks in the midst of a formal session. \n\nThe first intra-session recess appointment was by President Andrew Johnson in 1867. But because, according to the court, Congress has shortened its inter-session breaks and “taken longer and more frequent intra-session breaks” since 1929, presidents have used recess appointments during intra-session breaks much more frequently in the past 100 years. \n\nWhen the current Senate takes its usual long summer break in August, for example, that will amount to an intra-session break. But not officially. \n\nWhy? Because Harry Reid implemented a process in which, during a long break like the one planned for August, a lone senator walks into the Senate chamber every three days, gavels the Senate into session, conducts no business whatsoever, and then immediately gavels the Senate out of session. Thus, the Senate is supposedly never in an intra-session recess that would allow the president to exercise his constitutional recess appointment authority. \n\nIn the Canning decision, the Supreme Court said that a three-day break was not long enough to be considered a formal recess. The court held that a minimum break of at least 10 days was required to count as a formal recess. In other words, the president can fill vacant offices with recess appointments any time the Senate stands in adjournment for 10 days or more. And that recess authority applies even if the adjournment is in the middle of a session of Congress and even if the vacancies arose before the adjournment, not during the adjournment. \n\nWhy have these pro forma sessions continued? Why is the process Harry Reid put in place to handicap a prior Republican president being supported by Republican senators currently in office? \n\nThere is no justification for this. If there is one thing we know for certain, it is this: If Democrats still controlled the Senate, Kamala Harris was the president, and a Republican minority was slowing down and obstructing confirmation of her nominees, Democrats would immediately end the pro forma sessions so Harris could exercise her recess appointment authority and get her people into key positions in the executive branch. \n\nAs Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said recently, when it comes to all of these pending nominations, senators need to either “stay & get the job done … or recess & let President Trump make recess appointments, as authorized by the Constitution. The obstruction & the Deep State rule it produces must end now.” \n\nI couldn’t have said it better myself.","summary":"Harry Reid, the former Democrat leader of the U.S. Senate, left the Senate in 2017 and died in 2021, but his ghost must still be...

PELOSI CONFIDENT ABOUT DEMS' CHANCES TO WIN HOUSE, PREDICTS JEFFRIES WILL BE SPEAKER \"We must restore a government for the people, by the people, of the people. The release of the Epstein files is not a magic cure for trust, but it is a first step. It's a first step to say we will have a new era of transparency,\" he continued. Khanna then bluntly called out his party’s establishment in his closing call to action. \"I'll end with this clear point: The old guard needs to go. The old ways have not been working. This party needs a new rebirth. This party needs a rebirth to stand for human rights,\" he said. \"This party needs a rebirth to stand for the working class. This party needs a rebirth to stand for people over the donor class.\" Former Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to give virtual remarks at the summit on Friday, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also a major speaker at the event. \"We have no doubt that we will win the election with the House of Representatives,\" Pelosi said during her speech. \"No doubt.\" I’M ONE OF THE VOTERS DEMOCRATS NEED TO WIN. 2028 IS THEIR ONLY CHANCE TO REGAIN OUR TRUST \"It's important to be strong in the year in advance, because that's when the troops line up. We have our messaging, we have our mobilization, we need the money to do it, but they go only next to a school to hold up the most important part: the candidate,\" she continued. Younger Democrats, like freshman Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari and Illinois congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, took part in panels at the summit. Khanna’s address comes as the Democratic Party is striving to navigate the second Trump administration and adapt to the major shifts that occurred across voter demographics in the 2024 election, including among Generation Z. The 2026 election is being seen as an opportunity to get more information about Gen Z voters, as many voted for the first time in 2022 and 2024. Some in the party have encouraged a more moderate direction, while others have echoed Khanna’s populist sentiment. TRUMP SUPPORTERS FIND UNLIKELY COMMON GROUND WITH BLUE STATE CONGRESSMAN AT TOWN HALL: 'I LOVE IT' \"This party needs a rebirth to find our courage in standing up for immigrant rights instead of running away when people talk about immigration. This party needs more people like you in Congress than the current people we have in Congress,\" Khanna added.

It's time to take back our party and then to take back our country,\" he continued.","summary":"Rep.

By Carr's account, the timing of that decision was entirely coincidental. But FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Joe Biden appointee, had a different take.\n\n\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" Gomez said in her dissent. \"After months of cowardly capitulation to this Administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted. Unfortunately, it is the American public who will ultimately pay the price for its actions. In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\"\n\nIn addition to its suspicious timing, the FCC's approval of the Paramount/Skydance deal was contingent on concessions regarding CBS news coverage. Those constitutionally questionable conditions confirm that Carr is determined to curb freedom of the press by asserting government control over the content of broadcast journalism.\n\n\"This has been an unconstitutional shakedown from start to finish,\" said Will Creeley, legal director at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. \"Per the First Amendment, federal law, and longstanding precedent, the FCC has no business dictating the editorial choices of media outlets or conditioning merger approval on the viewpoints a network chooses to air….No federal bureaucrat should ever be allowed to play-act as our nation's editor-in-chief.\"\n\nParamount needed the FCC's approval for the merger because it entailed the transfer of broadcast licenses held by CBS-owned stations. Under the Communications Act of 1934, the question was whether those transfers were \"consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\" As Carr sees it, that standard requires assurances that licensees will cover the news in a way that he deems fair, accurate, and balanced.\n\n\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" Carr said in a press release. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"\n\nIn particular, Carr said, \"Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company's programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum. Skydance will also adopt measures that can root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media. These commitments, if implemented, would enable CBS to operate in the public interest and focus on fair, unbiased, and fact-based coverage. Doing so would begin the process of earning back Americans' trust.\"\n\nSkydance also agreed to \"have in place an ombudsman who reports to the President of New Paramount, who will receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.\" It says \"New Paramount's executive leadership will carefully consider any such complaints in overseeing CBS's news programming.\" Carr's press release also touted that concession, which he said will \"promote transparency and increased accountability.\"\n\nCarr, in other words, thinks it is entirely appropriate for federal regulators to demand \"significant changes\" in the way news organizations operate, including what they cover, how they cover it, the sources they interview, the people they invite to comment on current events, and the way they respond to complaints of bias. He is explicitly setting the FCC up as an arbiter of good journalism.\n\nThat power grab is consistent with Carr's understanding of the government's role in the marketplace of ideas, which he thinks should include restricting the editorial discretion of social media platforms in the name of \"reining in Big Tech\" and preventing \"discrimination against core political viewpoints.\" Carr, an avowed free speech champion, presents his concerns about broadcast news bias in similar terms, saying \"a handful of national programmers\" should not \"control and dictate to the American what the narrative is, what they can say, what they can think.\" As with his vendetta against \"Big Tech,\" he perversely portrays government interference with private editorial decisions as a victory for freedom of speech.\n\nContrary to that puzzling take, FCC oversight of broadcast journalism does not protect First Amendment rights; it undermines them. Such meddling would be obviously unconstitutional in the context of print, cable, satellite, streaming, or online journalism. For reasons that make less and less sense every day, broadcasting is treated differently, supposedly because government licensing and regulation are necessary to address \"the scarcity of radio frequencies.\"\n\nThat rationale never made much sense. \"The fact that only a finite amount of spectrum use was allowed for traditional broadcasting, without more, did not require intrusive regulation,\" John W. Berresford, an attorney in the FCC's Media Bureau, noted in a 2005 paper. \"Merely an allocation system, defining and awarding exclusive rights to use certain frequencies, would have sufficed to 'choose from among the many who apply.'\"\n\nBerresford added that the scarcity rationale \"appears to be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of physics\" and \"ignores basic principles of resource allocation,\nrecent field measurements, history, the progress of technology, and economics.\" He argued that the scarcity rationale, \"if it ever had validity, is invalid in today's media marketplace,\" given \"the explosion in the number of distribution networks and channels, both via radio and other media—more traditional broadcasters, cable television, DBS, DARS, Internet, WiFi and WiMax—and in the mass of content that fills them.\"\n\nThat was 20 years ago. Although developments in technology and mass media since then have only reinforced Berresford's argument, the government still treats broadcast speech differently from speech in every other medium. But even the fiction that broadcasting is special in a constitutionally relevant way goes only so far in authorizing regulatory intervention, as the FCC itself concedes.\n\nThe agency notes that it has only \"narrow\" authority to \"take action on complaints about the accuracy or bias of news networks, stations, reporters or commentators in how they cover—or sometimes opt to not cover—events.\" Why is that? \"The agency is prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press,\" the FCC explains. \"Those protected rights include, but are not limited to, a broadcaster's selection and presentation of news or commentary.\" Yet it is precisely such decisions that Carr is avowedly trying to shape.\n\nWhy does Carr think \"the legacy national news media\" are failing to serve \"the public interest\"? The complaints that the FCC considered while mulling the Paramount/Skydance merger provide some clues.\n\nThe Center for American Rights (CAR), which the FCC describes as \"a non-profit, non-partisan, public-interest law firm that represents consumers of broadcast media,\" criticized CBS News for \"its treatment of Republican J.D. Vance during the 2024\nVice Presidential debate\" and for \"its editing of an answer by then-Vice President Harris in an interview on an important topic of foreign policy during an episode of the news program '60 Minutes.'\" Yes, that is the same interview that provoked the lawsuit in which Trump risibly averred that CBS had cost him at least $20 billion by making Harris sound slightly more cogent—the same interview that Carr thought justified an investigation of CBS for \"broadcast news distortion.\"\n\nCAR also cited a Media Research Center report \"concerning negative media coverage of the Trump administration.\" CAR said that report \"confirms that the news media generally, and CBS News in particular, is relentlessly slanted and biased.\" It argued that \"Commission action is necessary to condition the Transaction on an end to this blatant bias.\"\n\nThat is in fact what the FCC ended up doing. Although the FCC concluded that CAR was not \"a party in interest with standing to file a petition to deny the Transaction,\" Carr and CAR are on the same page. He perceives the same anti-Trump, anti-Republican, anti-conservative bias that CAR decried, and he is explicitly wielding his regulatory powers to correct it.\n\n\"The Paramount payout and this reckless approval have emboldened those who believe the government can—and should—abuse its power to extract financial and ideological concessions, demand favored treatment, and secure positive media coverage,\" Gomez complained. \"It is a dark chapter in a long and growing record of abuse that threatens press freedom in this country.\"\n\nYou might take Gomez's criticism with a grain of salt, since she is a Democrat on a Republican-controlled commission. You might also note that she was appointed by a president who had no compunction about interfering with constitutionally protected editorial decisions by demanding the suppression of online \"misinformation.\" But neither observation should obscure the point that Gomez happens to be right.","summary":"Chairman Brendan Carr thinks his agency should strive to ensure that news coverage is fair and balanced—a role precluded by the First Amendment.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/07/25/the-fccs-paramount-skydance-decision-aims-to-reshape-broadcast-journalism-by-bureaucratic-fiat/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/zumaglobaleleven201803-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 20:15:23","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.147},{"id":345312246,"title":"Iowa AG Brenna Bird Lawsuit Against Crypto ATMs Contradicts Trump Making America 'Crypto Capital of the World'","text":"Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird has sued two crypto ATM companies that some in and out of the White House say runs afoul of President Donald Trump’s mission to make America the “crypto capital of the world.”\n\nTrump campaigned on installing a pro-crypto agenda, likening it to the “steel industry of 100 years ago.” He even promised at the annual Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2024 to ensure America becomes the “crypto capital of the planet and Bitcoin superpower of the world.”\n\nHe promised to fire then-Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who often targeted crypto exchanges and other related companies.\n\nThe crypto industry embraced Trump’s candidacy.\n\nHis pro-crypto accolades even earned the backing of Gemini exchange cofounders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who donated $2 million in Bitcoin to Trump’s campaign, citing Biden’s “war on crypto.”\n\nKraken founder Jesse Powell in June 2024 donated $1 million in Ethereum to Trump’s campaign.\n\n“Despite overwhelming bipartisan Congressional efforts to put clear rules in place, the Biden White House has stood by and allowed a campaign of unchecked regulation by enforcement. This approach is diminishing US competitiveness as other major economies around the world advance clear rules to regulate digital assets. I am excited to join other leaders from our community to unite behind the only pro-crypto major party candidate in the 2024 Presidential election so the United States can continue to remain a leader in blockchain technology,” Powell wrote.\n\nBy October 2024, Trump 47 Committee, a joint fundraising committee, had raised about $7.5 million in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTrump even made history by becoming the first U.S. president to sign a Bitcoin transaction, saying it was “very easy.” The 47th president in September 2024 visited PubKey, a Manhattan, New York, bar and restaurant famous for accepting Bitcoin.\n\nIn the first days of his administration, Trump signed an executive order to strengthen American leadership in digital financial technology “in order to promote United States leadership in digital assets and financial technology while protecting economic liberty.”\n\nHe then worked with lawmakers to pass the GENIUS Act, a bill to create a light-touch regulatory environment for stablecoins, which passed through Congress with strong bipartisan support.\n\nDespite the president’s fervent support for crypto, AG Bird announced lawsuits against two crypto ATM companies — Bitcoin Depot and Coinflip — alleging that the ATM companies are responsible for those who have been scammed. This makes her the sole attorney general to target crypto ATMs.\n\nWATCH — Sec. Bessent: Trump is “Creating Assets” for Americans While Most Presidents “Created Debt”:\n\nNotably, Adam Gregg, president and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, attended the press conference where Bird announced her lawsuits against the crypto companies.\n\nDavid Bossie, the president of Citizens United and a former senior adviser to multiple Trump campaigns, wrote, “Her decision to stand with the Iowa Bankers Association in announcing these lawsuits speaks volumes about where her priorities seem to lie — alongside the very financial institutions that have worked to shut out crypto firms, conservative causes and even members of Mr. Trump’s own family.”\n\nTwo Iowa Supreme Court rulings stated that “there is no evidence in the record before us that Bitcoin Depot had reason to know that a scammer had contacted Carlson and told her that she needed to purchase Bitcoins from the Bitcoin ATM and transfer them into a specified wallet to avoid her accounts being impacted.”\n\nSupreme Court Justice Dana Oxley wrote, “Bitcoin Depot’s generalized knowledge that sometimes scammers try to defraud people into transferring Bitcoins using Bitcoin’s irreversibly encoded technology is insufficient to establish that Bitcoin Depot had ‘reason to know’ of (plaintiff’s) particular duress. (Plaintiff) attempts to turn a warning against fraud into an admission of liability. That Bitcoin Depot recognizes how its ATMs could be misused and tries to warn its customers and make them more difficult to misuse does not in and of itself undermine the validity of the contract between Bitcoin Depot and the depositing customer just because a scammer is successful.”\n\nThis has led those in and out of the White House to raise concerns about Bird’s lawsuit against the crypto companies.\n\n“The President loves crypto and wants it to be accessible to Iowans. Brenna Bird’s head-scratching move has me thinking she is listening to Ann Selzer,” a senior White House official said in a statement to Breitbart News, referring to the Iowa pollster who found that Kamala Harris led Trump shortly before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAndrew Miltenberg, a veteran trial lawyer with almost three decades in the legal profession, said that despite his inclination to lean toward consumer protection, he believes Bird’s lawsuit has little standing.\n\n“I think this is grandstanding against really, not necessarily, the crypto industry, but against the president and his allies,” Miltenberg said.\n\nAlthough many may worry about potential fraud from crypto, Miltenberg argued, “You’re at more risk using your debit card, credit card, whether, with a major bank, using your MasterCard, your Visa, trading on the stock exchange, there are so many more ways financially that a general consumer is at risk.”\n\nHe said this lawsuit against the crypto ATM companies is similar to suing gun manufacturers every time there is a shooting.\n\n“It’s easy to get people to light torches and come running with pitchforks, because it’s an issue they don’t really understand,” he remarked.\n\nMiltenberg noted that there could be regulations or safeguards that could be put in place to increase consumer protection for those using to use crypto; however, said that a lawsuit is not the best move.\n\nHe added, “The only way to reconcile what the AG is doing is that it’s headlines and it’s a direct strike against the President.”\n\nAG Bird declined an interview with Breitbart News and has yet to provide a statement on this issue.\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

Stop the windmills. You’re ruining your countries,' Trump said, after spending years fighting offshore windmills alongside his golf course. He said they were 'killing your birds' and 'ruining your oceans.'\n\nTrump, whose administration is the in the midst of a mass deportation campaign, also had a message on immigration.\n\n'You better get your act together. You’re not going to have Europe anymore,' Trump said, suggesting policies are far too permissive to foreign entrants.\n\nHe chided reporters for pestering about the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, whose case has roiled his administration.\n\n'You’re making a very big thing over something that’s not a big thing,' he said.\n\nAsked about Ghislaine Maxwell's meeting with a top Justice Department official, Trump responded: 'I don’ know anything about he conversation. I haven’t really been following it.'\n\nHe isn't ruling out a presidential pardon. 'This is no time to be talking about pardons,' he said. \n\nTrump, 79, has made golf an important part of his life and his business empire – visiting courses more than 60 times in his second term. He is doing so again six months into his second term, with planned visits to both of his Scottish courses.\n\nThe president spoke reverentially about his Turnberry course as he left the White House – but still got hit with questions about whether he would pardon Ghislaine Maxwell, who met with top DOJ officials this week amid new scrutiny of the convicted sex offender who died in his jail cell. \n\nAnd he issued a new iteration of his denial of a sensational report in the Wall Street Journal that he drew a picture of a woman for Epstein as part of a special birthday volume. 'Somebody could have written a letter and used my name,' Trump posited. He said he has the 'power' to pardon Maxwell, who is serving jail time after being convicted of assisting Epstein in his sex trafficking network.\n\nHere in Scotland, Trump is set to inaugurate a new course in Aberdeenshire, on a trip where squeezing his hosts to bring the British Open to his Turnberry Course is also on tap. \n\nThe new MacLeod course in Menie is named for his late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born in Scotland and emigrated to the U.S.\n\nTrump is already predicting victory on that front. 'I think they will do that,' he said of bringing the Open to his Turnberry course. 'Turnberry is rated the number one course in the world. I think they'll do that.'\n\nBut he pushed back when asked if he was going to convince anyone of his stance on the trip. 'No, it's not about that,' Trump said. \n\n'It's the best resort in the world, I think, Turnberry, and it's one of the greatest courses in the world.' \n\nA potential championship isn't the only dealmaking on the horizon. Trump and British PM Keir Starmer, who inked a trade deal at the G7 in Canada shortly before Starmer dropped it on camera, still must negotiate substantial details.\n\nThat puts prices for cars, auto parts, chicken, beef, and digital clicks in play, after a U.S.-UK trade deal in May set only broad parameters but left many details to be worked out. \n\nTrump set off confusion before he even left the White House when he told reporters that 'We’re meeting with the prime minister tonight' and that 'We’re going to be talking about the trade deal that we made and maybe even improve it.'\n\nThere was no expectation that Trump would even see Starmer until later in his visit. \n\nThere was, however, a new addition to his schedule. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would meet with Trump Sunday to 'discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong' – setting up another high stakes negotiation.\n\nTrump has been flouting his ability to bring other nations to heel by publicly releasing trade letters announcing what tariffs they will face. The White House said the number had reached 25 before he left Washington. \n\nTrump blasted out yet another threat Friday when he said there was a 'fifty-fifty' chance of a deal with the European Union, while saying the powerful trade block must 'buy down' the threatened 30 percent tariff. \n\nBut the lure of his upcoming State Visit and meeting with King Charles is preventing Trump from playing full hardball, one insider tells the Daily Mail. \n\nTrump's language as he left town was very much in keeping with that stance.\n\nTrump called it 'more fine-tuning.'\n\n'And also we do a little celebrating together, because, you know, we got along very well. UK has been trying to make a deal with us for like 12 years, and haven't been able to do it. We got it done.'\n\nHe called Starmer a 'good prime minister' and a 'good guy' who was 'doing a very good job. \n\n'So we're going to see. We're going to meet at Turnberry and we're going to meet at Aberdeen. So two beautiful places.' But he said there was 'not a lot' of wiggle room on steel and aluminum tariffs he has imposed using Section 232 authority.\n\nThe absence of detailed information on the weekend schedule released by the White House makes clear that there is plenty of golf in Trump's future. He has no public events Saturday or Sunday, when he will be at Turnberry.\n\nHis Starmer meeting comes Monday, after which the pair are expected to tour Trump's new course. \n\nTrump is also expected to meeting First Minister John Swinney, who is scoring the face time despite publicly backing Trump's rival Kamala Harris in the election. \n\nAlso greeting Trump: protests. During his 2018 visit to Scotland during his first term, Trump was trailed by a Trump baby balloon.\n\nThis time, the Stop Trump Coalition is among groups planning to make a public statement, with protests expected at both of Trump's courses. \n\nTrump's former national security advisor John Bolton is among those positing that Trump's trip is more than a weekend getaway.\n\nHe noted that Trump hadn't been there in seven years, and said maybe it would 'kick up a little free advertising after he comes and goes.","summary":"Trump touched down in Scotland Friday to begin a five-day golf getaway

Secretary Ian Murray.\n\nHe then headed off to his Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire.\n\nThe visit has been described as a ‘private’ trip, before he returns for an official state visit in September.\n\nHe will travel to golf courses across Scotland while also fitting in high-stakes meetings with the Prime Minister and the Scottish First Minister.\n\nTrump will then fly out of Scotland on Tuesday.\n\n Trump supporters cheer as Air Force One touches down in Scotland (Picture: Jane Barlow/PA Wire)\n\nWhy is Trump visiting the UK?\n\nThe US President has a personal connection to Scotland. \n\nHis mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump was born and raised on the Isle of Lewis before moving to New York aged 18.\n\nHe is expected to open up a new 18-hole course dedicated to his mother at his Menie resort.\n\nTrump also owns the Turnberry hotel and three linked courses in Ayrshire, which he bought for about £40million in 2014.\n\nThe US President has made several visits to Scotland in the past, often to visit his late mother’s home or to play golf on one of his courses.\n\nWhere will be he visiting?\n\n Police are preparing for Trump’s arrival at his Turnberry golf course (Picture: Robert Perry/PA Wire)\n\nOther than visiting his two golf courses in Scotland, Trump is due to meet Keir Starmer in Aberdeen on Monday.\n\nTrump’s press secretary said the meeting was intended to ‘refine the great trade deal that was brokered between the United States and the United Kingdom’.\n\nScottish First Minister John Swinney has also said he is meeting the US president.\n\nSwinney publicly backed Kamala Harris for the presidency last year, but Trump called him a ‘good man’ before embarking on the trip.\n\nHe plans to raise a number of domestic and international issues including tariffs on Scotch whisky and conflict in the Middle East.\n\nTrump is also due to meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nThe US and EU are currently locked in trade negotiations over tariffs, with agreement reportedly close to being reached.\n\n Starmer invited Trump for a second state visit when he visited the White House in February (Picture: Carl Court/PA Wire)\n\nWhat does his visit mean?\n\nTrump’s visit could strengthen the relationship between Starmer and the US president, as they look set to discuss Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nConflict in the Middle East could also take centre stage, just days after France announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nStarmer said on Thursday the Palestinian people have the ‘inalienable’ right to a state, while Trump criticised Macron’s plan, saying it ‘doesn’t carry any weight’.\n\nThe US president will also be hoping the trip brings him some time out of the spotlight back home.\n\nA political crisis has erupted over his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and seen Trump take heat from his usually loyal MAGA supporters.\n\n A message calling on the president to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein is projected onto the US Chamber of Commerce building across from the White House (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe president once promised to release the files, but the Justice Department and FBI since announced that ‘no incriminating “client list”‘ existed.\n\nIt was then sensationally reported by The Wall Street Journal that Trump’s name appears in the files.\n\nWhat protests are planned against Trump’s visit?\n\nThere will be a ‘festival of resistance’, organised by the Scottish wing of the Stop Trump Coalition.\n\nThis will kick off a day after his arrival – on Saturday – and will be held in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries.\n\nAn Ipsos poll in March found that about 70% of Scots have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, while 18% have a favorable opinion.\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n

Chair Fact-Checking Trump: 'Jerome Powell Should Sue'","text":"Fox News played video of a contentious moment between President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, but omitted the end of the exchange, when Powell fact-checked the president.\n\nTrump visited the Federal Reserve's Washington headquarters on Thursday, where renovation costs have exceeded budget. The president has been critical of the project's ballooning budget, suggesting Powell could be committing fraud. During a tour of the building, Trump confronted Powell while cameras rolled.\n\nIn the clip of the interaction, Trump presents Powell with an apparent budget sheet, claiming the cost of Fed renovations has ballooned from $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. A baffled Powell examines the sheet.\n\n\"Oh, you're including the Martin renovation...That's a third building,\" he says.\n\n\"Yeah, it's a building that's being built,\" Trump retorts.\n\nOn Fox News, the clip ends there. The Fox News banner on the video reads: \"Powell spends big, Trump brings receipts.\"\n\nHowever, the unedited exchange, which Fox News streamed live earlier that same day, reveals that Powell pushed back, clarifying that Trump had included a separate building which was completed five years earlier, during Trump's first term.\n\n\"That's a third building. It was built five years ago,\" Powell says while reviewing the sheet. We finished Martin five years ago—it's not new.\"\n\nThat portion of the conversation was omitted from Fox's broadcast, prompting accusations of deliberate editing to protect the president from public embarrassment.\n\nOnline, users who viewed both versions called out the omission, accusing Fox of bias and noting the recent $16 million settlement CBS paid to Trump after he sued the network for what he claimed was a deceptive edit of a Kamala Harris interview.\n\nTrump accused CBS of editing a November 2024 60 Minutes interview with Harris to make her appear more articulate. Critics questioned the strength of the case, with many speculating that CBS-parent company Paramount capitulated to Trump in hopes of receiving the required federal approval to complete a high-stakes merger with Skydance Media.\n\n\"So is this the time to sue for $16,000,000?\" a question read online. \"What's the difference in CBS editing out a part from Kamala's interview and this?\"\n\n\"Editing footage to make an incompetent person...look more credible...sounds like grounds for a lawsuit,\" an X user wrote pointedly.\n\nSo far, neither Powell nor the Federal Reserve has commented publicly on the matter, and Fox News has not addressed the backlash.\n\nOriginally published on Latin Times","summary":"Fox News played video omitting the moment President Trump was fact-checked by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, sparking accusations of bias and calls to sue","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/fox-news-called-out-editing-fed-chair-fact-checking-trump-jerome-powell-should-sue-3779472","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/3800046/ibtimes-logo.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 19:11:16","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":345277658,"title":"Sandra Smith Catches Former Harris Adviser Flat-Footed With Basic Question About Inflation Rate","text":"Fox News host Sandra Smith stumped former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Senior Adviser Mike Nellis by asking him what the current rate of inflation is.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.7% year-over-year in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics on July 15. However, Nellis asserted it was around 3% or 4% when Smith asked him if he knew the rate. (RELATED: ‘Greatly Exaggerated’: CNBC’s Rick Santelli Pours Cold Water On Narrative That Trump Would Doom Economy)\n\n“[W]e need to get back to basics on how we’re going to deal with inflation and other issues and telling it in a much more simple way, talking about our accomplishments. But look, it isn’t going to get fixed overnight,” Nellis said. “And right now the president of the United States is Donald Trump. Republicans are in control of Congress. They’re currently in recess rather than doing anything about inflation. Donald Trump was in front of the White House today claiming that he’s crushed inflation, which is objectively false.”\n\nHe then asserted that beef and alcohol prices were at record-highs during the July 4 weekend.\n\n“Do you know what the inflation rate is?” Smith asked.\n\n“Yeah, it’s like about three or four percent,” Nellis claimed, before Smith corrected him.\n\n“No. It’s below three. And it’s been a long time since it’s gotten there,” she said. “I mean, you’re looking at 2.5% percent inflation now.”\n\nCPI rose 2.4% on an annual basis in May, a slight uptick from a 2.3% rise in April, according to the BLS. The CPI was also 2.4% in March and 2.8% in February, according to the BLS.\n\n“Donald Trump promised to make grocery prices go down on day one,” he said, responding to Smith’s statement. “He promised to make housing prices go down on day one. We’re six months in and everything’s more expensive.”\n\n“Prices have definitely come down,” Smith said. “They can go down more. I’ll give you that.”\n\n“They haven’t come down. Inflation is still going up,” he said. “And it’s rising, according to the latest stats.”\n\n“That’s not the case. Inflation has come down,” Smith replied. “Inflation by nature is growth in prices, but the growth has slowed.”\n\nThe Democratic Party’s official X account on Thursday posted a graphic demonstrating drastic increases in grocery prices from 2021 to 2024 on, with the caption “Trump’s America,” even though former President Joe Biden and Harris were in office at the time, an archive of the now-deleted post shows. The White House responded to the mishap on X by posting a version of the graphic with the years 2021 through 2024 labeled “Biden.”\n\nInflation in the U.S. reached 9.1% in June 2022, the highest in 40 years.\n\nSummer gas prices reached a four-year low in June, according to the American Automobile Association.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

For instance, there have been ombudsmen put in place by the FCC before. We're putting a bias ombudsman in place here. We're addressing DEI.\"Carr's comments in defense of Trump were the latest example of his fealty to the president. The FCC chairman once wore a golden lapel pin of Trump's head and has opened investigations into a number of media outlets the president has criticized since he became the head of the historically independent agency.Carr continued defending the terms and conditions of the Paramount-Skydance merger during his Squawk Box interview Friday, saying the FCC is reversing the \"pro-DEI commitments\" that were made under the Biden administration.\"We're unwinding that type of approach and we're frankly taking a trust-but-verify perspective here,\" he told Faber.Carr went on to claim the media has \"undermined itself\" and took aim at CBS's The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which the network canceled last week while citing \"purely financial\" reasons.Colbert's cancellation came shortly after the longtime comedian described Paramount's $16 million settlement as a \"big, fat bribe\" on the air, and days before the FCC greenlit the $8.4 billion Paramount-Skydance merger.\"When you look at the stuff that Colbert is doing, the idea that a partisan carnival makes economic sense—these are business decisions at the end of the day,\" Carr told Squawk Box.What People Are SayingGomez said in her dissent: \"After months of cowardly capitulation to this Administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted. Unfortunately, it is the American public who will ultimately pay the price for its actions.\"In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom ... Even more alarming, it is now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.\"Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wrote on X: \"BREAKING NEWS: Trump's government just approved Paramount's merger with Skydance. Sure looks like they paid Donald Trump $36 MILLION for this merger. Bribery is illegal no matter who is president.\"Carr said on CNBC Friday: \"President Trump is fundamentally reshaping the media landscape and the way he's doing that is, when he ran for election, he ran directly at these legal broadcast media outlets ... For years government officials just allowed those entities ... to dictate the political narrative and he has fundamentally changed the game.\"What Happens NextDespite the FCC's approval, Paramount's headaches may not be quite over as it faces sharp blowback from its own TV shows over Colbert's cancellation and its dealings with the Trump administration.\"The Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart delivered a blistering monologue on Monday, ripping his corporate bosses for settling with Trump and subsequently cancelling Colbert's show. And on Wednesday night, the iconic satirical comedy show \"South Park\" premiered its 27th season with an episode that made fun of the president's genitalia while comparing him to the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.The \"South Park\" episode was particularly remarkable given that it came one day after the show's creators inked a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount.","summary":"FCC Chairman Brendan Carr was asked to respond to criticisms of the Trump administration's intervention in the free press.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-fcc-brendan-carr-reacts-paramount-merger-criticism-2104246","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2690575/brendan-carr.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b98858173fc14c5073aa62c38bc992bc","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 18:45:11","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.02},{"id":345281078,"title":"From ‘diversity of viewpoints’ to ‘cowardly capitulation,’ the Paramount/Skydance merger clears in a storm of controversy","text":"The stamp of approval from the Federal Communications Commission comes after months of turmoil revolving around President Donald Trump’s legal battle with “60 Minutes,” the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS. With the specter of the Trump administration potentially blocking the hard-fought deal with Skydance, Paramount earlier this month agreed to pay a $16 million settlement with the president.\n\nCritics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall. Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company’s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the deal’s approval, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to “once-storied” CBS.\n\n“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,” Carr said.\n\nWhile seeking approval, Skydance management assured regulators that it will carefully watch for any perceived biased at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In a Tuesday filing, the company’s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody “a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum” — and also noted that it plans to take a “comprehensive review” of CBS to make “any necessary changes.”\n\nThe FCC approved the merger by a 2-1 vote, and the regulator who opposed it expressed disdain for how it all came together.\n\n“After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,” FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez said in a statement. “Unfortunately, it is the American public who will ultimately pay the price for its actions.” Gomez was appointed by former President Joe Biden.\n\nParamount and Skydance have said they wanted to seal the deal by this September, and now appear to be on a path to make it happen by then, if not sooner.\n\nOver the past year the merger has periodically looked like it might fall apart as the two sides haggled over terms. But the two companies finally struck an accord that valued the combined company at $28 billion, with a consortium led by the family of Skydance founder David Ellison and RedBird Capital agreeing to invest $8 billion.\n\nSignaling a shakeup would accompany the changing of the guard, Ellison stressed the need to transition into a “tech hybrid” to stay competitive in today’s entertainment landscape. That includes plans to “rebuild” the Paramount+ streaming service, among wider efforts to expand direct-to-consumer offerings in a world with more entertainment options and shorter attention spans.\n\nEllison, who is poised to become CEO of the restructured Paramount, is the son of Larry Ellison, technology titan and co-founder of Oracle. Besides possessing an estimated $288 billion fortune, Larry Ellison has been described as a friend by Trump.\n\nWhile Paramount sweated out regulatory approval of the merger, one of TV’s best-known and longest-running programs turned into a political hot potato when Trump sued CBS over the handling of a “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic Party opponent in last year’s presidential election, Kamala Harris. Trump accused “60 Minutes” of editing the interview in a deceptive way designed to help Harris win the election. After initially demanding $10 billion in damages, Trump upped the ante to $20 billion while asserting he had suffered “mental anguish.”\n\nThe case quickly became a closely-watched test of whether a corporation would back its journalists and stand up to Trump. Editing for brevity’s sake is commonplace in TV journalism and CBS argued Trump’s claims had no merit. But reports of company executives exploring a potential settlement with Trump later piled up, particularly after Carr — appointed to lead the FCC by Trump — launched an investigation earlier this year.\n\nBy the start of July, Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million. The company said the money would go to Trump’s future presidential library and to pay his legal fees, but maintained that it was not apologizing or expressing regret for the story.\n\nThe settlement triggered an outcry among critics who pilloried Paramount for backing down from the legal fight to increase the chances of closing the Skydance deal. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, said that the deal “could be bribery in plain sight” — and called for an investigation and new rules to restrict donations to presidential libraries.\n\nConcerns about editorial independence at CBS had piled up even in the months before the deal was announced — with Paramount overseeing “60 Minutes” stories in new ways, as well as journalists at the network expressing frustrations about the changes on an award-winning program that has been a weekly staple for nearly 57 years\n\nIn April, then-executive producer of “60 Minutes” Bill Owens resigned — noting that it had “become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it.” Another domino fell in May when CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon also stepped down, citing disagreements with the company “on the path forward,” amid speculation of Paramount nearing a settlement with Trump. CBS has since appointed Tanya Simon as the top producer at “60 Minutes” — elevating a respected insider in a move that could be viewed as a way to calm nerves leading up to the changes that Skydance’s Ellison is expected to make.\n\nLiedtke reported from San Francisco.","summary":"“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly.

World leaders are expected to attend and there may also be a spattering of royalty as the couple tie the knot at the 12th century picture postcard St Michael and All Angels church in the village.\n\nEve, 27, and sportsman Harry, 26, got engaged last September and began dating in 2022, making their debut just a year ago at the Paris Olympic Games.\n\nThe Jobs family are said to be splashing out a staggering £5 million on the glittering four-day affair.\n\nSources have confirmed that Sir Elton John is being paid £1 million to perform on Saturday evening at the crescendo of the reception party on a specially built stage constructed over the past week within the 84-acre grounds of celebrity favourite Estelle Manor in Oxfordshire.\n\nPreparations\n\nEve's mother Laurene, who was left a widow following Jobs' passing in 2011 aged 56 from pancreatic cancer, is said to have gone 'all out' for the wedding with help from renowned society events planner, Stanlee Gatti.\n\nOn Friday, a team of 20 set designers and florists dressed the interior of the Norman church with huge orbs covered in hundreds of fresh red roses. Inside the church, roses were placed on the end of each of the pews, beech tree branches lined the nave, 101 candles were placed on the alter and two £15,000 Persian rugs run along the aisle.\n\n\"The whole wedding has been organised like a film production,\" said a source today. \"There are some big names expected. Some of them have their own security teams. It’s being planned with military precisions. I have never seen anything like it. The whole village will pretty much be on lock down tomorrow,\" said a security source at the church. \n\nCatering trucks, and lorries containing set design materials and luxury table ware have been streaming in and out of Estelle Manor's imposing black and gold wrought iron gates for the past two days.\n\nOne from a company Palmbrokers brought \"greenery hire, props and set dressing\". The company specialises in dressing venues for weddings with \"wedding blossom trees\", creating walkways lined with \"summer wedding planting\" and ‘\"wedding wisteria\" for encircling summer wedding marquees. They also offer a special \"Wedding Wishing Tree\" strewn with sparkling silver garlands.\n\nDespite the huge amount of preparation, the happy couple are understood to have paid the standard £675 fee to be married at the church. The vicar, Canon William Burke, explained: \"They paid a flat fee for the wedding. We are not allowed to charge more or less.\"\n\nSchedule for the big day\n\nOn Thursday, the couple completed a final dress rehearsal at the church ahead of their upcoming nuptials this weekend. Eve and Harry were joined by their groomsmen and bridesmaids at St Michael's and All Angels for a 90-minute run through, directed by wedding planner Mr Gatti.\n\nParents of the bride and groom – Eve's mother Laurene and Harry's parents Peter and Tara – arrived in Great Tew by private limousine.\n\nThe wedding ceremony itself is understood to be happening at around 2pm and will take around an hour tomorrow. \n\nGuests will be ferried in a fleet of blacked out limousines back to the Estelle Manor venue for a full night of entertainment and a fabulous dinner with the customary speeches, ending with Sir Elton's set and a DJ afterwards filling a dance floor into the early hours.\n\nA-list guest list\n\nFormer US Vice President Kamala Harris is tipped to be among the VIP guests, as is Princess Beatrice. Kamala hosted a dinner party ahead of the wedding at The Bull pub in nearby Charlbury on Wednesday evening. Locals spoke of their shock at the colossal security presence with US secret service personnel swarming around the venue. \n\nSources say they believe that newly-ensconced Cotswolds locals Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi will be present at the wedding because her friend Kamala is also a prominent name on the list. Also making the VIP guestlist are Kamala's daughter, Phoebe, and Bill Gates's daughter, Jennifer.\n\nThey will be joined by celebs including Arctic Monkeys star Matt Helders, Bruce Springsteen's daughter, Jessica - an equestrian, Apple designer Jony Ive, Sofia Abramovich, daughter of ex-Chelsea owner Roman. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has a country house in the village next to Great Tew is rumoured to be going.\n\nA-listers have been flown into nearby Oxford airport in their private jets, where they have been met by helicopters to transport them to the venue. \n\nEve, a model and show jumper in her own right, has two older siblings and one half-sibling. Reed Jobs, 33, and Erin Jobs, 29, will likely be at the wedding. However it's currently not known if her half sibling Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 47, will attend.\n\nOn top of Eve's impressive connections, Harry has his own entourage who will surely bring the party. His father is Peter Charles, whose team won Britain's first team jumping gold medal for 60 years at the 2012 London Summer Olympics. His Olympic teammates Scott Brash and Ben Maher may also attend, having claimed victory in team jumping together at the Paris Olympics.\n\nRelationship history\n\nEve and Harry meanwhile were first spotted in public together at last year's Olympic Games in Paris - where Harry bagged a gold medal in team jumping. The pair have kept their relationship largely private, but their shared love for equestrian sports is likely what brought them together. \n\nEve, whose mother is the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, is a rising star in both equestrian sport and fashion. She has appeared in campaigns for Louis Vuitton and posed for Vogue while maintaining a competitive showjumping career.\n\nHarry, son of former Olympic showjumper Peter Charles, has represented Great Britain internationally and is currently one of the sport's top-ranked athletes.\n\nThe couple share a passion for horses and are frequently seen supporting each other at events.","summary":"Steve Jobs' daughter, Eve, will be marrying British Olympian Harry Charles on Saturday, but their church ceremony cost a surprisingly modest amount.

Is this the new normal?","text":"Want to do business in the United States?Pay up. More specifically: Pay Donald Trump.That's a reasonable lesson to draw from the Paramount-Skydance deal, which received formal government approval Thursday and should finally close in the coming weeks — about 1.5 years after it first kicked off.We don't know how Skydance's David Ellison, who is buying Paramount with the backing of his father, Larry Ellison, will run the company. Maybe he'll be able to turn the company around, and years from now we'll note how he made a savvy purchase of a distressed asset at a fire-sale price. Maybe it continues to decline. Maybe he ends up flipping it to someone bigger in short order.But the most important thing is the thing that was clear back in January, when Donald Trump started his second term as president: If current owner Shari Redstone wanted to sell the company to Ellison, she would need to cut Trump a check.That happened on Tuesday, when Paramount's current management formally settled a lawsuit Trump filed against the company last year. They paid $16 million, most of which is ostensibly earmarked for Trump's future presidential library.And on Thursday, the deal got formal approval from the Federal Communications Commission, run by Brendan Carr, a Trump loyalist who sometimes wears a pin in the shape of Trump's head on his suit.In theory, the Trump lawsuit and Carr's approval were separate events. In reality, it would be very hard to find anyone who believes that. (I've asked Carr for comment.)This is a story that has kicked up a lot of attention in the home stretch. Some of the angles are most definitely real, and concerning. Like the fact that Carr's blessing comes with pledges from Ellison to do things like \"root out bias\" in CBS's news coverage, which sounds very much like a company promising to cover news in a way that pleases Carr and his boss.Some of the angles are much muddier: While we've yet to see any actual evidence that Paramount canceled Stephen Colbert's late-night show to get the deal done, it's reasonable for people to jump to that conclusion. (Over at The Ankler, veteran TV reporter Lesley Goldberg makes a compelling argument that the cancellation had everything to do with business, and nothing to do with Trump.)We also don't know whether the Ellisons have also agreed to give Trump $16 million or $20 million in other goodies as part of the deal, as Trump has claimed at various times. (Paramount has said it has no knowledge of extra payments; team Ellison hasn't commented.)But the main point is the main point, which we've known for many months: Last fall, Trump filed a suit against Paramount over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris. In any other world, that suit would go nowhere. But then Trump was elected, and started getting Very Big Companies like Disney and Meta to pay him to settle other suits he would normally have little chance of winning. (Like Paramount, those settlements were made directly to him, via his future library — as opposed to other settlements he is extracting from institutions like colleges and law firms, which are paying the federal government.)So it was clear that Paramount would have to do the same thing, or it couldn't do the Skydance deal.Again: In theory, the \"60 Minutes\" suit had nothing to do with Trump's role as president of the United States — he filed it as a private citizen, prior to his inauguration.In reality, the only reason Paramount settled it was because he's president of the United States — and one that's willing to use that power to insert himself into day-to-day business deals.Hard to believe this will be the last one where that happens.","summary":"Want to do business in the United States?

After researching and speaking with minority voters in typical Democratic strongholds like Milwaukee and the Bay Area of San Francisco, HoSang concluded that many of the non-White voters who now support President Donald Trump left the Democratic Party after becoming exhausted by identity politics and worsening economic conditions and crime. \"The rightward drift of minority voters is not a story of just one election. It is a phenomenon years in the making, one that is reshaping the American political landscape. And to understand this movement, you must understand the transformations in the places they are happening,\" HoSang wrote. DEMOCRATS' 'MASSIVE BLIND SPOT' ON MALE VOTERS EXPOSED BY NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, Trump has made up extensive ground with Hispanic voters, Black voters and Asian voters. The poll found that Trump significantly closed the gap on Hispanic voters, with 51% of them going to former Vice President Kamala Harris, and 48% going to Trump, a significant shift from the 2020 presidential election, when Trump fell behind with Hispanic voters to former President Joe Biden, 61%-36%. The president also made significant gains with Black and Asian voters, boosting his support among Black voters from 8% in 2020 to 15% in 2024, and among Asian voters from 30% to 40%. One former Obama voter HoSang spoke to, Orlando Owens from Milwaukee, said that he joined the Democratic Party because he was Black, but was eventually disaffected after becoming tired of the party's identity politics and empty promises. \"When you get your food stamp review, you have to go give shot records, school records, blood type. You almost have to get absolutely naked to get a $50 increase. But you have people coming to this country who have no documentation who are staying in hotels for two years, for free? How is that right?\" he questioned. \"A lot of Black people have already heard the promises from the Democrats. And nothing was delivered.\" HoSang argued that the foreclosure crisis, opioid epidemic and chronic funding shortfalls have \"created cracks in the bedrock of Democratic support\" in cities like Milwaukee, and yet, \"Democrats have largely doubled down on promising relatively modest policy reforms meant to speak to the interests of voters of color.\" DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY' \"Disappointed in the party that they saw as presiding over these profound economic shifts, nonwhite voters found that the institutions where many of them found their political identities — churches, unions, clubs — have been in decline,\" HoSang reported. With many of these typical community pillars in decline, HoSang contends that voters of color today are being influenced by new forces, such as right-wing podcasts, influencers and social media. \"The narrative emerging from this wave of new media is a compelling one to disaffected communities of color; it captures the very real struggles they experience and repackages them as proof that Democratic policies have failed them,\" he argued. In San Francisco's Bay Area, another issue has swayed their heavily Asian-American population away from the Democratic Party — crime. HoSang spoke with one Bay Area resident, Nancy Yu Law, who voiced her frustrations about the city's crime problem that has made running her four stores in Chinatown much more taxing. \"I have four stores in Chinatown. My store was broken into two times. At my gift shop, they took money and they took one tablet. My boba shop was broken into and vandalized. In those years, it was really unsafe. A criminal is a criminal. Elected officials did not stand up to say that,\" she told HoSang. \"It felt like there’s nothing you can change in California, so we were all just complaining. When I ask my friends, what do you think of President Trump? They are all pretty satisfied.\" The Yale professor visited Turning Point’s AmericaFest conference last December where he spoke with several young working-class Black women who were part of conservative influencer Candace Owen's Blexit movement. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE He noted that there was very little evidence of \"buyer's remorse\" when it came to Trump, and that many of the Blexit members he spoke with worldviews were \"far more heterodox, guided less by ideological rigidities and more by their aspirations to build lives of dignity for themselves and their communities.\" In closing, HoSang felt that many of the minority voters he spoke with were politically driven by the realities that their racial communities face, such as collapsing social structures, economic uncertainties and \"a sense that the status quo is untenable.\" \"Absent a solution to these core problems, appealing to disaffected voters of color on their racial identity alone has rung hollow. Grappling with the complexity of their frustrations, anxieties and hopes will determine the next political chapter of this country,\" he concluded.

'But a fifty-fifty chance of making a deal with the EU. And It will be a deal where they have to buy down their tariffs. Because they're right now at 30 percent,' Trump said, referencing the tariff set to take effect by the new 'doomsday' August 1 deadline unless there is an agreement. \n\n'They'll have to buy them down - maybe. Or they can leave them the way they are.'\n\nTrump, using a favorite negotiating tactic, described his counterparts as desperate. \n\n'But they want to make a deal very badly.

The poll was conducted between July 21-22 among 1,000 registered voters.Why It MattersIt comes as Trump is facing backlash from Democrats and his own supporters, who believe the state is covering up convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's links to rich and powerful individuals. This distrust threatens to weaken the president's credibility.Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.Various court documents have named people with ties to Epstein, though not accused of wrongdoing. The documents include victims of sex abuse, his employees and others with only a distant connection to the scandal. A list of Epstein's purported clients has not been released.What To KnowPresident Trump has been under pressure since July 6, when the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI released a joint statement insisting that Epstein had \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and reiterated that he died by suicide in his jail cell in August 2019.The memo contradicted comments made by Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier this year in which she claimed an Epstein \"client list\" was on her desk. But she later walked back the claim, clarifying that she was referring to the broader Epstein case file—not a specific list of clients.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal published a report alleging that Bondi informed President Donald Trump back in May that his name appears multiple times in the Epstein files.Trump denied this, claiming Bondi had not shared such information with him. The White House also disputed the report.\"The fact is that the President kicked him out of his [Mar-a-Lago] club for being a creep,\" White House Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement.\"This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about,\" Cheung continued.That same week, The Wall Street Journal uncovered a 2003 birthday card Trump allegedly sent to Epstein. The card included a drawing of a naked woman and the message: \"We have certain things in common... may every day be another wonderful secret.\"A New York Times report from this week also claimed Trump wrote Epstein a note in a signed copy of Trump's book in October 1997, calling him \"the greatest.\"The newly surfaced documents have revived longstanding allegations about Trump's ties to Epstein, despite his repeated claims that the two were never close.Trump has acknowledged knowing Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but maintains that he cut ties with him well before Epstein's 2006 arrest. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the ongoing investigations into Epstein's associates.Still, public skepticism remains high. According to a Wall Street Journal/Fabrizio, Lee & Associates poll, only 7 percent of voters say they have \"complete confidence\" in the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein case—highlighting the broader credibility crisis now facing the administration. Another 21 percent say they have little confidence, while fewer than one in four expressed any real trust in the probe.And 76 percent of voters believe the Justice Department is hiding important information about its Epstein investigation.And Trump is not the only member of his administration who is facing heat as a result of the backlash over the Epstein files.Vice President J.D. Vance is seeing a similar slide in public perception. The Napolitan News poll found that only 41 percent of voters consider Vance at least as ethical as most politicians, marking a dip since he assumed office alongside Trump in January.Vance has dismissed reporting by the Wall Street Journal, calling the report alleging that President Trump once sent a \"bawdy\" birthday card to Epstein \"bogus.\"He also alleged the Wall Street Journal was coordinating an attack to damage Trump's character, calling the report \"fake news.\"In contrast, Democrats no longer in office are experiencing a rebound in public trust. Sixty-seven percent of voters say Barack Obama is at least as ethical as most politicians, and 56 percent say the same of former Vice President Kamala Harris.Many Democrats, including members of Congress and activists, have urged the Department of Justice to release all grand jury materials and related documents to ensure the public can see the full scope of Epstein's network and any potential cover-ups.At the same time, Trump has seen his approval ratings drop to an all-time low across several polls, including Newsweek's tracker, which shows his net approval rating at -10 points.What Happens NextLawmakers continue pressing for the release of investigative files related to Epstein's associates, though federal grand jury material remains sealed.On Wednesday, July 24, a U.S. District Judge rejected the Justice Department's bid to unseal grand jury materials related to the Epstein case, citing legal precedent and concerns over grand jury secrecy.","summary":"It comes as Trump is facing backlash from Democrats and his own supporters over his alleged links to Jeffrey Epstein.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-ethical-rating-epstein-2104086","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2690447/trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=784d66bd44c738a75d3fecfef2b56fe4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 16:14:50","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":345291536,"title":"TIME Magazine Excluded Conservative Podcasts on Top 100 List","text":"TIME magazine correspondent Eliana Dockterman represented bias for the company on Wednesday when they published a list of \"The 100 Best Podcasts of All Time\" (and an accompanying article titled “How We Chose the 100 Best Podcasts of All Time”) without including a single conservative podcast.

The podcast list Dockterman constructed contained many genres, ranging from comedy to news and politics. The six podcasts under \"news and politics\" were The Daily, Embedded, The Ezra Klein Show, Longform, Plain English With Derek Thompson, and The Prince.\n\nTo give a brief overview of some of the shows, The Daily was a podcast from the liberal The New York Times, and had an episode title that whined: “Supreme Court Upholds Ban on Transgender Minors.” The summary of the show claimed, “...why the court’s decision leaves families more in the dark than ever.” And Ezra Klein was a liberal Times opinion writer.\n\nEmbedded was a podcast from NPR. The radio network got defunded last week by Congress for previous biases and partisan promotion. Derek Thompson was a writer for the left-leaning Atlantic and he co-authored a book with Klein. And The Prince was hosted by Sue-Lin Wong, who worked for The Economist.\n\nAside from news and politics, Call Her Daddy, hosted by Alex Cooper, was on the list despite the show featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris and drag queens. Making Oprah, which was also from NPR, was about Oprah Winfrey, who promoted liberal views. Dockterman boasted that the podcast \"focuses on how the daytime TV icon changed American attitudes toward race, gender, and politics.\"\n\nIn the \"society\" category, Dockterman included two NPR properties: Code Switch and Fresh Air. \"Business and tech\" included Times' Hard Work and NPR's Planet Money. \"Pop culture\" featured two shows from far-left Slate: Decoder Ring and Audio Book Club. \n\nDespite all the “decade’s worth of ‘best of’ lists” that Dockterman created for podcasts, did she forget what was currently ranked as the top podcasts for Apple and Spotify. Programs such as: The Joe Rogan Experience, The Megyn Kelly Show, or This Past Weekend with Theo Von, or does it not back up TIME’s liberal agenda? \n\nRogan invited President Trump on his podcast less than two weeks before the 2024 election and got almost 60 million views on YouTube. Von also featured Trump as a guest in August and got 17 million views, and had Vice President JD Vance on the podcast twice. Those numbers couldn't be ignored when it came to influence. \n\nWhat was hilarious about this podcast list was that TIME appointed Trump as \"Person of the Year\" for 2024. Even Dockterman admitted with a left-wing bias: \n\nThat said, we talk a lot at TIME about influence- we do publish an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world, after all. And that list increasingly includes podcasters...Remember when Maron got then-president Barack Obama on WTF, and it was a huge deal? Trump doesn’t make the rounds of the manosphere and Kamala Harris doesn’t appear on Call Her Daddy had Obama not graced Marc Maron’s garage. \n\nThere was the bias. This podcast list included shows that did not promote a “man-o-shpere” environment that Trump had been featured on. \n\nIf TIME knew about “influence,” why were some of the top-ranking podcasts that happen to be conservative, or at least right of center, with massive platforms omitted from the list? \n\nTIME chose to highlight their left-wing bias without giving credit to actual influential podcasts.\n\nWe do recommend that you check out the NewsBusters Podcast.","summary":"TIME magazine correspondent Eliana Dockterman represented bias for the company on Wednesday when they published a list of \"The 100 Best Podcasts of All Time\" (and an accompanying article titled “How We Chose the 100 Best Podcasts of All Time”) without including a single conservative podcast.

I think it's going to be difficult for her to win that job.' \n\nHarris has indicated she will make a decision about the race for governor of California this summer, but has largely removed herself from the political conversation. \n\nBrown indicated that Harris did not have the executive leadership experience to run for the office, after serving as vice president of the United States.\n\n'There’s just so many really talented people thinking about that job,' Brown said, listing other California Democrats who had already entered the race. \n\nHe singled out former Los Angeles mayoral candidate and businessman Rick Caruso, as a serious candidate. \n\n'That is a really talented guy, with great executive potential,' he said. \n\nBrown chuckled and said he had gotten into 'real trouble' in the past for giving Harris public political advice, but could not resist weighing in on her political career. \n\n'She is bold enough, tough enough, and well-informed enough that if she would utilize that talent, she would not need a person like me giving her advice, period. She would be doing what needs to be done,' he added. \n\nBrown recalled that he once recommended Harris turn down the opportunity to serve as vice president in 2020, if the then-Democratic nominee for president Joe Biden offered her the job. \n\nHe suggested her talents were more suited to the legal field, and should have chosen to serve as Biden's attorney general instead. \n\n'From the attorney generalship, you may land where you, I suspect, are most talented, and that's the Supreme Court, and you could easily become chief justice of the Supreme Court,' Brown said, recalling his advice to Harris, who was a senator from California at the time. \n\n'I think she stopped speaking to me after that,' he added wryly. \n\nBrown famously dated the 29-year-old Kamala Harris when he was 60, as he was leaving his Speaker position in the state legislature and ran for mayor of San Francisco.\n\nWhen they dated, Brown was considered the most powerful politician in California, and although he was still married, he was estranged to his wife Blanche, who lived in a separate home from him.\n\nWhile they were dating, Brown appointed Harris to two different state boards, which paid her more than $400,000 over five years.\n\nTheir romance also opened up the doors for Harris to develop relationships with the rich and powerful in the state, priming her national political career.\n\nBrown and Harris separated after he won his race for mayor, but he continued to quietly support her political endeavors as she ran for district attorney of San Francisco, attorney general of California, and then California's U.S. Senate seat in 2016.\n\nWhen Harris prepared to run for president in the 2020 presidential election, Brown addressed their relationship in a newspaper column\n\n'I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco,' Brown wrote in January 2019. 'I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.'\n\nBrown served as San Francisco’s first black mayor from 1996 to 2004.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris ' boyfriend and political mentor Willie Brown said it would be 'difficult' for her to win the race for governor of California.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14940963/kamala-harris-willie-brown-california-governor.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/16/100637175-0-image-a-5_1753457435386.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 16:13:21","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.195},{"id":345254032,"title":"‘Morning Joe’ Warns Republicans Will Suffer ‘Blowback’ for Paramount-Skydance Merger | Video","text":"“Morning Joe” co-host Joe Scarborough warned Republicans on Friday they will suffer “blowback” for the $8 billion Paramount-Skydance merger that was just approved by the FCC. \n\nScarborough said FCC Chairman Brendan Carr set a “horrible precedent” by “openly picking winners and losers” based on his political and social leanings. Another issue, the MSNBC anchor said, was CBS recently settling a lawsuit with President Trump for $16 million over its editing of a Kamala Harris interview last year — a decision that was “shocking,” Scarborough said, and contributed to the bad optics around the Paramount-Skydance merger. \n\n“For Republicans, it’s just completely stupid,” Scarborough said about the deal. “I’ve been in Washington 30 years, there’s always blowback.” \n\nRepublicans, he added, should not be surprised when a different party holds the White House in the future and has a new FCC chairman “tip the scales” in its favor. \n\nNew York Times reporter Peter Baker agreed with Scarborough, saying this “would have been a scandal” for other administrations. Baker also said legal experts viewed the “60 Minutes” lawsuit as “bogus,” but Paramount shareholders felt compelled to settle with the president to make sure the Skydance deal was approved. \n\nAnd to help increase the odds the FCC would sign off on the merger, Skydance boss David Ellison met with Carr recently to discuss the deal. Ellison told Carr that new Paramount would be focused on “American storytelling.” He then committed to the appointment of an ombudsman and the elimination of the media giant’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nCarr, soon after the $8 billion deal was given the green light on Thursday, said he was “pleased” that Skydance was going to make “serious changes” to CBS. \n\n“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” Carr said on Thursday. “It is time for a change.”\n\nScarborough scoffed at that comment on Friday morning when he read it aloud, saying “Okay, Brendan, whatever you say, buddy.”","summary":"Joe Scarborough says FCC Chairman Brendan Carr sets a \"horrible precedent\" by approving deals that suit his politics\n\n\nThe post ‘Morning Joe’ Warns Republicans Will Suffer ‘Blowback’ for Paramount-Skydance Merger | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/morning-joe-republicans-blowback-skydance-paramount-deal/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Morning-Joe-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 16:09:10","author":"Sean Burch","authors":["Sean Burch"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":345295998,"title":"‘South Park’ premiere skewers Trump, prompting White House response","text":"The season 27 premiere of “South Park” may have been delayed two weeks, but it made quite an entrance Wednesday night – so much so that even the White House took note. It is perhaps not all that surprising since President Donald Trump played a starring role.\n\nThough many of Trump’s real-world policies and actions were spotlighted in the show — such as defunding National Public Radio, implementing tariffs on Canadian goods, and expressing displeasure with a portrait of himself in the Colorado State Capitol — the animated version of the president indulged in other lewd shenanigans, like trying to have sex with Satan. As in the devil, Satan, who has been a longstanding character in the “South Park” universe.\n\nIn the episode, Satan also questioned Trump about the Epstein files and alluded to the fact that the president reminded him of his ex, Saddam Hussein. The episode ended with a deep-fake public service announcement that showed Trump walking through the desert, taking off his clothes and collapsing nude in the sand. It ended with the slogan: “Trump. His penis is teeny tiny, but his love for us is large.”\n\nIn a statement to Variety, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers addressed the cameo, lambasting “South Park” as a “fourth-rate show.”\n\n“The Left’s hypocrisy truly has no end — for years, they have come after ‘South Park’ for what they labeled as ‘offensive’ content, but suddenly they are praising the show. Just like the creators of ‘South Park,’ the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows.”\n\n“This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,” the statement continued. “President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”\n\nIn addition to skewering Trump, “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone took aim at their parent network, Paramount, which recently settled a lawsuit with the president for $16 million. The president sued CBS News for allegedly editing a “60 Minutes” interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris in a deceptive manner.\n\nLegal experts said the case had no legs, and “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert called the settlement a “big fat bribe” to persuade the government to approve Paramount’s merger with another media company called Skydance. Days later, “The Late Show,” which aired on CBS, was canceled.\n\nIn the “South Park” episode, Jesus — yes, that Jesus — comes to warn the citizens of South Park, Colorado, to stop protesting the president or they, too, may get canceled.\n\n“The guy can do whatever he wants now that someone backed down, OK?” Jesus says. “Do you really wanna end up like Colbert?”\n\nParker and Stone have been outspokenly critical of the networks’ merger, going so far as to say it’s ruining “South Park,” in much more colorful language.

We got it done.'\n\nMr Trump praised Sir Keir as a 'good Prime Minister' and 'good guy' who is doing 'a very good job', adding: 'We really get along very well.'\n\nBut, asked if there was any wiggle room on US tariffs on steel or aluminum, which is also subject to a 50 per cent levy, Mr Trump replied: 'Not a lot. \n\n'Because if I do it for one, I have to do it for all. So on that, steel and aluminum, not a lot.'\n\nMr Trump is taking a five-day private trip to Scotland with mass protests expected around his golf courses and major cities.\n\nThe US President is due to arrive on Air Force One at Glasgow Prestwick Airport this evening before heading over to his Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire.\n\nHe is expected to spend time at the course over the weekend, meet Sir Keir and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, open a new 18-hole golf course at his Menie estate in Aberdeenshire on Tuesday and then fly home.\n\nA huge security operation involving officers from across the UK is well underway - with protests planned in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and at the two courses.\n\nA 10ft-high metal barrier has been installed at Turnberry to help protect the President.\n\nMr Trump's family have spoken of their pride and excitement over his visit - with Eric Trump, the executive vice-president of his father's Trump Organization, saying the President had waited 'years' to come back to the country of his late mother's birth.\n\nEric Trump told the Scottish Daily Mail: 'We have just completed the greatest course on Earth and waited years for this day to come.\n\n'I've never been more proud to have my father arrive in Scotland to see his original dream come to fruition. We can't wait!'\n\nThe President will be welcomed at Prestwick later by Scottish Secretary Ian Murray, with the minister pledging to give the American leader a 'warm welcome'. \n\nBut Mr Trump's presence has resulted in a significant operation from Police Scotland and thousands of officers, who are expected to deal with mass protests.\n\nThe Stop Trump Coalition is planning demonstrations in Aberdeen and Edinburgh tomorrow and there is a major police operation in place amid concerns it will seriously stretch resources.\n\nKirsty Haigh, from the Scotland Against Trump group, told Sky News: 'He should not be welcomed by us, by our leaders. We want to see a Scotland that is very different than [the] America that's being created.'\n\nMr Trump's last visit as a serving President in July 2018 saw thousands of people protest in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The trip cost Police Scotland more than £3million and required mutual aid as officers were sent in from other UK forces.\n\nThe latest visit is expected to require a security operation as big as the arrangements for the late Queen Elizabeth II's funeral in September 2022 - involving up to 6,000 officers - with taxpayers again facing a bill of more than £3million for policing his stay.\n\nAround 5,000 Police Scotland officers will be needed for the 'large-scale, complex' Operation Roll 2 – the codename for policing the visit - with a further 1,000 drafted in from the rest of the UK.\n\nA 'ring of steel' has been established at Turnberry, with 10ft perimeter fencing erected as security measures are ramped up by officers with road closures in place.\n\nChinook helicopters were at Prestwick Airport earlier this week, while US military planes and helicopters gathered on Monday. A convoy of vehicles and staff were being flown in to keep him safe during his visit.\n\nOrdinarily his bullet-proof motorcade could include up to 50 vehicles, some carrying anti-aircraft guns and hi-tech radio equipment, while others are designated for family, close aides and members of the Press.\n\nSeveral black SUVs were unloaded from two US Air Force C-17 cargo planes at Prestwick on Wednesday, with another three of the aircraft arriving in the afternoon.\n\nThe helicopters that operate as Marine One when the President is on board cost between $16,700 and nearly $20,000 per hour to operate, according to Pentagon data for fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe modified Boeing 747s that serve as the iconic Air Force One cost about $200,000 per hour to fly. Military cargo aircraft also fly ahead of the President with his armoured limousines and other official vehicles.\n\nStephanie Campbell and Leanne Maxwell, who live in Turnberry and used to work at Mr Trump's resort, said the first lesson staff there are given is how to respond to a bomb threat.\n\nMs Campbell told Sky News: 'I had no issues working for him, he is a really decent boss. The last time he came there was an element of excitement, I think this time there comes with an added element of concern.\n\n'It brings a lot higher threats and security and it's much more difficult for everybody in the area.'\n\nMs Maxwell added: 'Security is obviously being bumped up. It's quite worrying. He's quite a man, ain't he?'\n\nThe President will meet with Sir Keir during his stay when the pair will discuss the UK-US trade deal, and will also meet with First Minister John Swinney 'at some point'.\n\nThe SNP leader previously said he would have the opportunity to raise various issues with Mr Trump, including tariffs, Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his arrival, Mr Swinney said the global attention the visit will receive provides Scotland with an opportunity to respectfully demonstrate the principles of freedom and justice for all, while also promoting Scotland's tourism sector and economic investment potential.\n\nHe said: 'Scotland shares a strong friendship with the United States that goes back centuries. That partnership remains steadfast through economic, cultural and ancestral links - including of course, with the President himself.\n\n'As we welcome the President of the United States, Scotland will be showcased on the world stage. This provides Scotland with a platform to make its voice heard on the issues that matter, including war and peace, justice and democracy.\n\n'It also includes the millions of Americans - many of them potential future tourists or investors in Scotland - who will watch their elected President as he visits our country.\n\n'As First Minister it is my responsibility to advance our interests, raise global and humanitarian issues of significant importance, including the unimaginable suffering we are witnessing in Gaza, and ensure Scotland's voice is heard at the highest levels of government across the world.\n\n'That is exactly what I will do when I meet with President Trump during his time in Scotland.'\n\nMr Swinney said Scotland is a 'proud democratic nation' that 'stands firm on the principles of equality and freedom for all, and a society that stands up for a fair and just world'.\n\nAhead of the expected protests, he said people had a right to 'peaceful demonstration', adding that 'everyone has the democratic right to protect and express their views in a peaceful, and democratic manner'.\n\n'That is right and proper,' he added. 'I am confident the vast majority of people protesting will do Scotland proud and demonstrate as they should - peacefully and lawfully.\n\n'I am also confident that Scotland's police service can handle the challenge of keeping all our communities safe and, as they must, in maintaining the appropriate security any US President requires.\n\n'This weekend is a landmark moment in our relationship with the United States, and I am certain it will be remembered for Scotland showing the world the very best of itself.'\n\nFormer prime minister Liz Truss was spotted at Turnberry yesterday, but it is not known whether she will meet the President. \n\nAlthough Mr Trump is in the UK on a private visit, he will face calls from both sides of the border to cut his punishing tariffs on whisky and other exports.\n\nWhisky chiefs are desperate for the President to reduce or scrap the 10 per cent duty imposed on exports of malts and blends to the US. The Prime Minister is also expected to raise the issue during planned talks on Monday.\n\nMark Kent, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: 'The President's visit to Scotland is a timely opportunity to highlight the enduringly positive relationship that has lasted between Scotland and the United States for centuries.\n\n'Scotch whisky and US whiskey embody that close and abiding relationship... and both have flourished under zero-tariff access to UK and US markets for over thirty years.'\n\nHe added: 'The visit is a critical moment for the UK Government to re-engage in discussions to remove the tariffs on Scotch whisky in the industry's largest global market.'\n\nMr Trump is also expected to hold talks with Mr Swinney, who previously called for his official state visit to be cancelled.\n\nThe First Minister was urged to hold constructive talks and put an end to 'petty posturing' which could threaten jobs and investment.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay said: 'The success of President Trump's visit to Scotland must not be jeopardised by John Swinney indulging in the SNP's usual petty posturing which we have seen so often.'\n\nMr Swinney previously backed Mr Trump's rival in the Presidential contest, Kamala Harris – and voted in favour of a motion in 2019 calling for the withdrawal of an offer of a state visit to the UK during Mr Trump's first term.\n\nBut yesterday he said the UK Government has a 'duty' to make sure it is 'welcoming foreign dignitaries to Scotland in the right way, particularly one that is our closest and nearest ally both economically and in defence and security'.\n\nHe said it was 'in the national interest to work as closely as possible with the United States' and that it was right that he is welcomed when he arrives.\n\nSix years ago, Mr Murray backed a motion tabled by Labour's Stephen Doughty in the House of Commons which called on then Prime Minister Theresa May to rescind the offer of an official state visit to Mr Trump.\n\nThe motion said the House 'deplored' Mr Trump's 'misogynism, racism and xenophobia', among other criticisms of his time in office.\n\nAsked what has changed, Mr Murray said: 'What's changed is that it is really important for both countries to work together. Governments have to work together very closely.\n\n'Given the US is our closest ally, given we have just done a trade agreement with them to remove tariffs for the benefit of UK and Scottish businesses, and given global events at the moment, it is really, really important for these historic ties to work together with our closest allies, and that is what we are intending to do.\n\n'The important thing is that what has changed is the basis of us being able to work together with our allies. Being in government gives us the responsibility to do that.'\n\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rogers called the Scotland swing a 'working trip'.\n\nBut she added that Mr Trump 'has built the best and most beautiful world-class golf courses anywhere in the world, which is why they continue to be used for prestigious tournaments and by the most elite players in the sport'.\n\nThe trip to Scotland puts physical distance between Mr Trump and the latest twists in the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier accused of sex trafficking who died in prison in 2019 before facing trial.\n\nIn his heyday, Mr Epstein was friends with Mr Trump and others in the New York jet-set, but the President is now facing backlash from his own MAGA supporters who demand access to the Epstein case files.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which published an article detailing longstanding links between Mr Trump and the sex offender, is being punished by the White House.\n\nIts reporting staff plans to travel to Scotland on its own and join the White House press pool. But it has now been denied a seat on Air Force One for the flight back home.\n\nMr Trump is expected to return to the UK in September for a state visit - his second - at the invitation of King Charles III.","summary":"As he prepared to depart the White House for his trip across the Atlantic, Mr Trump warned there was 'not a lot' of wiggle room on steel tariffs.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14940925/Blow-Keir-Starmer-Donald-Trump-dashes-hopes-UK-steel-deal-insisting-theres-not-lot-wiggle-room-tariffs-departs-Scotland.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/16/100636099-0-image-m-40_1753455712317.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 15:55:30","author":"Editor,Greg Heffer,Mark Duell","authors":["Editor","Greg Heffer","Mark Duell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":345240746,"title":"JD Vance Chances of Beating Leading Democratic Candidates in 2028—Poll","text":"Vice President JD Vance held a narrow lead over three potential Democratic presidential candidates who have led recent surveys of the 2028 primary, according to a new Emerson College poll released Friday.Newsweek reached out to Vance's office and each of the candidates for comment via email.Why It MattersVance, President Donald Trump's second-in-command, is viewed as a potential Republican front-runner in the 2028 election, when Democrats will aim to win back control of the White House.Although the Democratic primary is still years away, prospective candidates are already making early moves, such as fundraising, building national name recognition, and traveling to key primary states to meet with voters.Early polling can provide insights into how Americans view potential candidates ahead of the election, although surveys aren't always predictive this far in advance.What To KnowThe Emerson College poll found that Vance held a single-digit lead over three potential candidates: former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.The poll surveyed 1,400 U.S. voters from July 21 to July 22, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.Of those three, Buttigieg was held to the tightest margin, with 44 percent backing Vance for president and 43 percent supporting Buttigieg. Buttigieg fueled speculation that he could run for president earlier this year when he announced he would opt out of running statewide in Michigan, where he has lived since his time in President Joe Biden's administration.Newsom, who traveled to early-voting primary state South Carolina this summer, received 42 percent support against Vance's 45 percent, according to the poll.Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez, who is a favorite of many progressives, received 41 percent to Vance's 44 percent. Ocasio-Cortez hasn't signaled she plans to run for president, and is also speculated to be a potential Senate candidate against incumbent New York Democrat Chuck Schumer.It notably did not ask about former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has not said whether she plans to run again. She is also reportedly considering a bid for California governor.The poll also found that 47 percent of respondents disapproved of Trump's job performance, while 46 percent approve of him so far.An Overton Insights poll released last month showed that Harris would have a slight lead over Vance, with 45 percent of respondents backing her and 42 percent supporting Vance. That poll surveyed 1,200 registered voters from June 23 to June 26, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.77 percentage points.What People Are SayingSpencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, wrote in the polling memo: \"A key takeaway from the ballot tests is that about 13% of the electorate remains persuadable, while the other 87% have already settled on a party preference.\"Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in May: \"Democrats do not have the best brand around here or in a lot of places. There's a lot of reasons for that. Some fair, and some not fair.\"California Governor Gavin Newsom told The Wall Street Journal in June: \"I'm not thinking about running, but it's a path that I could see unfold.\"What Happens NextThe 2028 presidential race will continue to unfold over the coming years. Typically, candidates do not announce plans to run until after the midterms, which will be held next November. But speculation about who may be gearing up for a presidential run is sure to continue.","summary":"A new poll showed Vance leading three potential Democratic presidential candidates.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-chances-beating-leading-democrats-2028-poll-2104161","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2690426/jd-vance-poll.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=26eec2878e39bc0c3ea4f44801b1f274","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 15:53:57","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.059},{"id":345241262,"title":"Stephen Colbert’s Cancellation Monologue Nears 10 Million On YouTube—His Most-Watched Video In 6 Years","text":"The 12-minute monologue \"Late Night\" host Stephen Colbert delivered after the news of his show's impending end has racked up almost 10 million views on YouTube, making it the most popular video on his channel in six years and underscoring a lack of social media success that could have contributed to the show’s surprise cancellation.\n\n\"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert during Monday's July 21, 2025 show.\nCBS via Getty Images\n\nOn July 21, the opening monologue to Colbert's show—in which he promises “the gloves are off” in his commentary about President Donald Trump and tells the president to “go f— yourself”—saw him address the news CBS would cancel “Late Night” for what they said was “purely financial” reasons.\n\nThe video had been watched 9.93 million times as of Friday morning, more than any other on the show's Youtube channel since New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was a guest back in September of 2018.\n\nVideos racking up 10-million-plus views were most common for \"Late Night\" between 2015 and 2018, but the show’s YouTube popularity largely peaked then, and has dropped year over year.\n\nUntil this week, only 10 videos in the last three years had managed to cross the 4 million view mark.\n\nLate night TV has been becoming more expensive and less profitable for years—Colbert's show was reportedly losing $40 million per year despite being the top rated of the 11:30 p.m. ET hour—and his was arguably the least likely to make up for the losses with viral videos when compared to peers like NBC's Jimmy Fallon or ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who focus on pushing out click-happy clips.\n\nThe most-watched clip on Colbert's channel, for instance, has 49 million views when compared to the 507 million on Fallon's and 80 million from Kimmel.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Fallon's \"The Tonight Show\" videos average 1.4 million viewers and “Jimmy Kimmel Live” averages 1.7 million.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThough his social media viewership may lag behind, Colbert’s is the highest- rated late night show on broadcast television. \"Late Show\" averaged 2.4 million viewers for the first half of 2025, USA Today reported citing Nielsen, compared to Kimmel's 1.8 million and Fallon's 1.2 million. All three late night hosts have seen their ratings fall each year.\n\nParamount, CBS’ parent company, has said the reason for the cancellation was \"purely financial,” but viewers, industry insiders and Colbert himself have speculated political concerns could be lurking in the background. \"How could it purely be a financial decision if ‘The Late Show’ is number one in ratings?” Colbert asked Monday. The host is a staunch critic of Trump, who posted to Truth Social: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.” The cancellation announcement came shortly after Colbert called out CBS for offering “a big fat bribe” to Trump, talking about a $16 million payment Paramount said it would make to settle a lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview conducted with Kamala Harris during the last election. The settlement was announced at the same time Paramount was seeking approval from the Trump administration for an $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The FCC greenlit the deal on Thursday, a week after Colbert’s show was canceled, after Skydance said it would end diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in hiring, promotions, development and compensation.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbes‘The Gloves Are Off’: Stephen Colbert Tells Trump ‘Go F— Yourself’ After Show CanceledBy Siladitya RayForbesColbert Late Show Cancellation Blasted By Democrats And Trump CriticsBy Siladitya Ray\n\nForbesFCC Greenlights $8 Billion Paramount-Skydance Merger After Skydance Vows To End DEI ProgramsBy Antonio Pequeño IV\nFurther Viewing\n\nGot a tip?

This is why it is vital for NBC and ABC to state, loudly and clearly, that they will not allow themselves to be similarly intimidated. Now, more urgently than ever, is a time for courage, not cowardice,” Suttmann continued. “When censorship is used as a tool to quash free speech, we must stand up together. What’s happening now is not only wrong, it goes against what we must stand for as a nation.”\n\nCBS announced that it canceled “The Late Show” last Thursday, stating that the long-running late night staple started by David Letterman will come to an end with Colbert’s tenure. The series will remain on the air until May of 2026, which is when Colbert’s contract is set to end. Though Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, stated that the cancellation was financial decision, the timing of the move paired with the fact the network took no previous cost-cutting measures left many skeptical. \n\nEarlier this month, Paramount Global agreed to settle its $20 billion lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million. The lawsuit was over an episode of “60 Minutes” that featured an interview with Kamala Harris. That lawsuit and settlement also took place as Paramount was waiting for FCC approval to complete its $8 billion acquisition by Skydance. Shortly after Colbert called the settlement a “big fat bribe” on his show, CBS canceled the series. \n\nThe FCC went on to approve the Skydance acquisition on Thursday.","summary":"The president of the Local 802 American Federation of Musicians released a statement on Friday\n\n\nThe post &#8216;Late Show&#8217; Musicians Union Calls Colbert Cancellation &#8216;Censorship&#8217;: &#8216;We All Need to Take Notice&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/the-late-show-musicians-union-speaks-out/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/colbert.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 15:36:29","author":"David Letterman,Kayla Cobb","authors":["David Letterman","Kayla Cobb"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":345228948,"title":"'Bribery is still illegal': Paramount merger reeks of Trump payoff","text":"Just a few weeks after Paramount decided to pay off President Donald Trump for what legal experts described as a frivolous lawsuit, the Trump administration has approved a merger between the media giant and Skydance.

Trump praised the cancellation writing, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.”\n\nThen on Thursday the FCC said it would approve the $8 billion merger between CBS parent Paramount and Skydance.\n\nThe decision was announced by the Federal Communications Commission alongside a message from FCC chairman Brendan Carr praising concessions made by Paramount to move news coverage in a more conservative direction.\n\n“Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum,” Carr said.\n\nAmong those concessions is the decision by the combined entity to eliminate existing diversity, equity, and inclusion policies—which have been the target of the Trump administration as it seeks to erase and roll back gains made following the Civil Rights Movement, while pushing Trump’s racist agenda.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been among the most vocal critics of the apparent bribery between the media company and the administration.\n\n“Even with Donald Trump playing king, CEOs should remember that bribery is STILL ILLEGAL,” Warren wrote after the announcement.\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes” on Wednesday, Warren explained that Trump “is exercising control over our media and signaling to everybody out there: If you cross Donald Trump there is potentially a huge price to pay.”\n\nThe administration and their Republican allies in Congress have been using the power of the government to take action against outlets they perceive as hostile to the right. Congressional Republicans—following a directive from Trump—recently voted to eliminate all federal funding for public broadcasting, a longtime goal of conservatives who object to fact-based news reporting from outlets like PBS and NPR.\n\nBut despite the political and corporate machinations, the Republicans haven’t silenced everyone yet.\n\nThe decision to cancel Colbert has been criticized by lawmakers and there has been a public outpouring of support for him from fellow comedians—even his rivals in the late-night talk show space. Comedians Jimmy Fallon, Seth Myers, John Oliver, and Jon Stewart all appeared on “Late Night” following CBS’ decision.\n\nAnd on Monday the White House reacted with outrage after “South Park,” which is a Paramount property, aired an episode mocking Trump and Paramount’s decision to bow to him.\n\nThe public is also not being swayed. In a recently released Gallup poll Trump’s approval rating continued to drop, and he has particularly cratered with independent voters where his rating has fallen 25 percentage points since he was sworn in.\n\nPerhaps more bribes are needed.","summary":"Just a few weeks after Paramount decided to pay off President Donald Trump for what legal experts described as a frivolous lawsuit, the Trump administration has approved a merger between the media giant and Skydance.

Here’s a quick list…\n\nBump actually claimed Trump was wrong about the absolute fact that Democrats run America’s most violent cities.\nIn 2015, Bump claimed America had a mass shooting every week for over two years.\nBump said that in a world of over a billion Muslims, the fact that 14 percent support ISIS is good news, so we should not restrict immigration.\nNaturally, Bump deceived his dumb readers with the ludicrous claim that “Trump’s authoritarianism” was behind CBS’s firing of Stephen Colbert (who makes $15 million a year, was given ten months’ notice, and whose Late Show lost CBS $40 million per year going back to at least 2021).\nBump’s final column for the Post was more Orange Hitler, was the same column these clowns have been writing and rewriting since 2015—something the medical community now defines as Jonah Goldberg Syndrome.\n\nThese three are only the latest. Those also schlonged out of the Post this year include Ann Telnaes, David Shipley, Ruth Marcus, Eugene Robinson, Joe Davidson, and Jennifer Rubin.\n\nThe reason for this wonderful exodus is simple. These entitled crybabies believe they should be overpaid to write whatever they like, even as the Post loses $100 million a year. Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos might be worth hundreds of billions, but come on. That can’t continue just so a bunch of pampered elites can use the Post as their personal anti-Trump journal.\n\nSo after the 2024 election, Bezos announced an editorial change. Going forward, the Post will defend personal liberty and free markets. Obviously, collective-minded leftists despise personal liberty, so they all quit. When your only goal is to impose Stalinist rule over every American—force us to live in shitty cities to have sex with transvestites while illegal aliens run the police force, the medical community mutilates children who manage to escape abortion, and privileged white women expose our kids to gay porn in godless public schools — the last thing you want is personal liberty.\n\nSo they’re gone, and that is a grand and glorious thing because we know what their next stop is: a town called Obscurity as they disappear into the growing pile of Substack’s disgraced ”journalists” (or some weekend MSNBC show) never to be heard from by Normal People again.\n\nDon’t get too excited, though. The Post still employs some harridan appropriately named Karen Attiah. Karen sure loves her some Hamas and hates her some white women.\n\nAn updated list of the Trump-era schlonging…\n\nJonathan Capehart – Stomps out of WaPo in tears (I’m guessing).\nPhilip Bump – documented serial liar exits Washintgon Post.\nCatherine Rampell – Leftist WaPo columnist accepts buyout.\nTerry Moran – Self-immolated out of ABC due to TDS meltdown.\nRuth Marcus – Washington Post columnist resigns.\n538 – Disney/ABC’s wildly biased polling site shutters.\nPaul Krugman – Always-wrong New York Times columnist forced out.\nJim Acosta – CNN anchor forced out.\nNorah O’Donnell – Failed CBS anchor out.\nChuck Todd – NBC’s former Meet the Press host DEI’d out.\nAndrea Mitchell – NBC harridan ages out of job.\nChris Wallace – Son of Someone out at CNN.\nJennifer Rubin — Lunatic columnist quits Washington Post in a snit.\nJoy Reid – Racist MSNBC anchor too racist for MSNBC.

On July 2, after Comedy Central delayed the Season 27 premiere of the show because Paramount, the network’s parent company, was locked in a contentious negotiation for its streaming rights—in the midst of months-long acquisition of Paramount by David Ellison’s Skydance Media—Parker and Stone issued a statement on X.com and let it rip: “This merger is a shit show,” the duo wrote, “and it's fucking up South Park.”\n\nBoth transactions were resolved this week, as Parker and Stone agreed Monday to a five-year, $1.5 billion streaming deal that will bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. And Thursday, the FCC officially approved the Skydance acquisition. The deal cements the duo’s place as the highest-paid TV showrunners in Hollywood and made the 55-year-old Parker and the 54-year-old Stone billionaires—worth an estimated $1.2 billion each.\n\nBut the new agreement—which will pay the pair at least $250 million per year—didn’t end Paramount’s headaches. In South Park’s season premiere, which aired Wednesday, Donald Trump is depicted in bed with Satan, and Jesus is seen warning the show’s young protagonists about the dangers of provoking him. “You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount,” says the Jesus character. “You really want to end up like Colbert?”\n\nThe comedically fearless Parker and Stone now enter television’s rare billionaire creative class, joining Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Dick Wolf and Jerry Seinfeld in the three-comma club.\n\nThat astonishing amount of money is a testament to the enduring popularity of South Park, which has been a cultural phenomenon since its debut on Comedy Central in 1997, becoming, in just its second season, the highest-rated non-sports program in basic cable history, with nearly six million viewers. Over the years it became indispensable to Comedy Central, and its 300-plus episodes have now become bulk inventory that re-air dozens of times per week.\n\nKenny Money: The new deal with Paramount will pay Parker and Stone $250 million a year to create new 'South Park' episodes through 2030.\nBob Riha, Jr./Getty Images\n\nParker and Stone’s real coup came in 2007, when the creators and their lawyer and business partner, Kevin Morris, struck a deal with the network to play South Park episodes online using a rudimentary Flash video player, agreeing to split the then-non-existent digital revenues 50-50 “in perpetuity.”\n\nThen came the streaming revolution. Hulu licensed the show’s streaming rights in 2014 for $87.5 million and reupping for $110 million through 2019. HBO Max then won a bidding war over Peacock, Netflix and others to become South Park’s exclusive domestic streaming home for $550 million over five years. That deal expired in June.\n\nInstead of just pocketing their half of the HBO deal, in 2021 Parker and Stone negotiated for a new arrangement with Paramount (which owns Comedy Central) for a guaranteed $155 million a year in exchange for creating new episodes of the show and their portion of the streaming revenue. Monday’s agreement renegotiated the terms of that deal, upping the annual payout to $250 million.\n\nParker and Stone pour that wealth into Park County, not only the location of South Park’s fictional town but also the name of their production studio, which is owned almost entirely by the pair. Founded in 2012, they route all income from their TV show, movie projects and stage productions of The Book of Mormon (which they cowrote) through the company, taking only an estimated $10 million per year in salary.\n\nIt’s a common corporate structure among Hollywood’s top earners, but unlike other companies such as Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine or Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment, Park County has never taken on equity partners or investors. Instead, in 2012, Parker and Stone leveraged the existing and projected future income generated by South Park and other projects to score $60 million in convertible debt funding from media-focused merchant bank The Raine Group. As long as they paid off the loan on time, they would keep all of the equity. The bet on themselves paid off as the streaming dollars began to flow in, and in 2016 Parker and Stone bought out Raine, maintaining full ownership ever since.\n\nPark County continues to use debt to fund the company’s growth, including securing an $800 million credit line from private equity giant The Carlyle Group in 2023. Using the cost of the debt and some clever Hollywood accounting around depreciating catalog value, Park County has been able to lower and delay its tax bills considerably.\n\nThe ultimate exit plan would be to one day sell the company, settle up with creditors and tax collectors, and pocket the remaining cash.\n\nSources tell Forbes that Viacom (Comedy Central’s then-parent company) and Park County discussed doing exactly that in 2019, a deal reminiscent of Disney’s acquisition of valuable brands such as Lucasfilm or Marvel. The two sides got as far as a $1 billion valuation before talks broke down. That same year Viacom was, just as it has been lately, in the midst of a messy merger with CBS that made high-priced acquisitions difficult. When the companies returned to the negotiating table in 2021, Park County’s overall production deal rang in at $935 million over six years—nearly the same price tag as the acquisition, without ownership changing hands.\n\nGiven Park County’s guaranteed revenue and strong profitability, Forbes estimates the enterprise value of the company could now reach as much as $3 billion in a potential sale, netting Parker and Stone more than $1 billion each.\n\nParamount and Park County’s most recent round of negotiations proved to be the toughest yet, and became an early referendum on the stewardship of Skydance’s David Ellison, son of the world’s second richest man Larry Ellison. He told analysts he wants his new Paramount to be “a creativity-first studio and the first stop for best-in-class storytellers.” Where previous owners had licensed some of the company’s biggest shows, like South Park and Yellowstone, to other streaming services for a short-term cash influx, it seems Ellison is prioritizing bringing everything back under the company’s own streaming platform, Paramount+.\n\nIt hadn’t gone entirely smoothly. In late June, Park County threatened legal action against Skydance, which they believed was tampering with their talks with Netflix and Warner Bros. about potentially obtaining South Park’s streaming rights. Paramount was motivated to make a deal and eager to avoid more negative publicity, like that which followed a $16 million settlement paid to Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris and the recent cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nFacing the prospect of another season premiere delay and potential trash talking on stage at San Diego Comic-Con this week—where Parker and Stone took a rare high road—Skydance and Paramount agreed Monday to rework Park County’s production deal in conjunction with the new streaming rights agreement, a sticking point in the negotiations.\n\nWith their pockets sufficiently lined by the $1.5 billion deal, Parker and Stone will produce 10 new episodes of South Park each year until 2030, and there’s little doubt they will continue to poke fun at both their parent company and a very litigious president. When asked at during a Comic-Con panel Thursday evening what to expect from the rest of this season, Stone quipped, “no politics,” drawing laughter from the crowd.\n\nAnd Parker, when asked about Trump’s negative reaction to the first episode, answered with similar deadpan: “We’re terribly sorry.”\n\nMore from Forbes\nForbesHow This Hollywood Producer Turned Brad Pitt Into A $40 Million ‘F1’ AdBy Matt CraigForbesCan Netflix Become The Netflix Of Gaming?By Matt CraigForbesJ.K.

Common sense suggested the company’s lawyers would’ve shrugged with indifference, waiting for Trump’s conspiratorial nonsense to get thrown out of court. But that’s not what happened. Instead, Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million to settle the baseless case, while acknowledging no wrongdoing, with the money to be allocated to Trump’s future presidential library. Naturally, many observers wondered why in the world the company would agree to do this, given that the president’s civil suit was impossible to take seriously. It wasn’t long before many questioned whether the settlement was related to Paramount wanting the Trump administration to approve an unrelated merger deal. Indeed, several Democratic members of Congress characterized the settlement as a “bribe” — a word CBS’ Stephen Colbert used on the air, just days before the network announced the popular “Late Show” host’s cancellation. (In a statement last week, Paramount and CBS executives said the cancellation “is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.”) That was last week. This week, NBC News reported: Trump administration regulators have approved Skydance Media’s $8 billion bid to acquire CBS News parent company Paramount, paving the way for a tectonic shift in ownership of one of America’s three major networks. The Federal Communications Commission said Thursday that it had approved the acquisition, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr adding in a news release that the move would bring change to the company’s news coverage. Paramount owns CBS, which includes CBS News. In advance of the deal, there were a great many developments of note. Not only did Paramount agree to pay $16 million to Trump’s future library, but Skydance also made a number of concessions to the FCC, including agreeing not to prioritize diversity in employment practices — a major priority for the Trump administration. Trump’s far-right FCC chair spiked the football soon after. “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,” Carr said. “That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network. In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.” “Today’s decision also marks another step forward in the FCC’s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination,” he added. As for Commissioner Anna Gomez, the only Democrat in the FCC’s leadership, she said after the merger’s approval, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this Administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.” She added, “In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,” she added. “Once again, this agency is undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity by overstepping its authority and intervening in employment matters reserved for other government entities with proper jurisdiction on these issues. “Even more alarming, it is now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.” As for the timing of the developments, I more or less assumed that the relevant parties would prioritize more of a buffer, if only to keep up appearances. But that’s not what happened: As July began, Paramount told Trump’s lawyers it’d pay $16 million to settle a baseless presidential lawsuit, and as July neared its end, the Trump appointees on the FCC approved Paramount’s $8 billion deal.","summary":"As July began, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a Trump civil suit.
