Trump began. 'He was second to Nolan Ryan in most strike-outs, and he should be in the Baseball Hall of Fame, NOW! \n\n'People think he took drugs, but nothing was proven. He never tested positive, and Roger, from the very beginning, totally denies it. He was just as great before those erroneous charges were leveled at him. That rumor has gone on for years, and there has been no evidence whatsoever that he was a “druggie.” \n\n'This is going to be like Pete Rose where, after over 4,000 Hits, they wouldn’t put him in the Hall of Fame until I spoke to the Commissioner, and he promised to do so, but it was essentially a promise not kept because he only “opened it up” when Pete died and, even then, he said that Pete Rose only got into the mix because of DEATH. \n\n'We are not going to let that happen in the case of Roger Clemens. 354 Wins — Put him in NOW. He and his great family should not be forced to endure this “stupidity” any longer!'\n\nIn March, Trump hit out at MLB, claiming the league needed to 'get off its fat, lazy ass, and elect' Rose posthumously to the Baseball Hall of Fame. \n\nThe late baseball legend was then made Hall of Fame eligible in May when the commissioner altered the policy, consequently lifting the lifetime ban handed down to the 17-time All-Star by then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti in 1989.\n\nAnd Manfred later confessed that the president's outspoken support of Rose - despite the scandals that plagued his career - influenced his decision. \n\n'The President was one of a number of voices that was supportive of the idea that this was the right decision,' he told reporters, via TMZ. 'Obviously, I have respect for the office, and the advice that he gave, I paid attention to.' \n\nHowever, the commissioner did also stress that Trump wasn't the only voice he listened to when weighing up the decision. \n\nRose, a three-time World Series winner, passed away at the age of 83 in September 2024 without ever fulfilling his wish to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile he is considered one of the greatest players in history, the legend was slapped with a lifetime ban for betting on the Cincinnati Reds as both a player and manager of the team in 1989.\n\nYet, Trump has long been an advocate for Rose, saying that he belongs in Cooperstown despite the all-time hit king's issues with gambling, tax fraud, and alleged statutory rape. \n\nMeanwhile, Clemens' legacy in baseball is complicated to say the least.\n\nConsidered by many to be among the greatest pitchers ever, he set a Major League record with the Boston Red Sox by striking out 20 batters in a game in 1986 and did it a decade later to boot. Along the way, the former Texas Longhorns star established himself as one of the game's premier pitchers before moving on to Toronto and New York, winning a pair of World Series titles in the Bronx.\n\nBut Clemens will forever be linked to baseball's steroid era.\n\nHe was named in the infamous Mitchell Report, which was a 20-month investigation into steroid use in baseball. \n\nIn the report, former Yankees trainer Brian McNamee stated he injected Clemens with steroids in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Former teammates Jose Canseco, Andy Pettitte and Jason Grimsley also claimed to know that Clemens used steroids as well.\n\nClemens was ultimately found not guilty of lying to Congress in 2008, when he testified that he did not take steroids.\n\nThe controversy nonetheless tarnishes his reputation as Clemens has been passed repeatedly over for the Hall of Fame, having never received the 75 percent of votes required for induction over his ten years on the ballot. However, he could theoretically be inducted down the road by the Hall's Eras Committees.\n\nHe welcomed Trump's re-election in November, describing the Republican's victory as 'massive for our great country.'\n\nHe also congratulated Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and billionaire backer, Elon Musk.\n\nA native Texan who spent six years with Trump's favorite team, the New York Yankees, Clemens little patience for anyone threatening to flee the United States over Trump's victory over Kamala Harris. \n\n'Who ever said ''I'm leaving America if Trump wins,''' he wrote on X, '… don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.","summary":"Roger Clemens is considered one of the greatest players to take to the mound following his glittering 24-season career in the majors, including stints with the Red Sox and New York Yankees.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mlb/article-15030231/Donald-Trump-demands-Roger-Clemens-Hall-Fame-drug-scandal.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/24/22/101508719-0-image-m-22_1756072652337.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-24 22:13:27","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":353906010,"title":"Full transcript of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Aug. 24, 2025","text":"On this \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Maryland Gov.

The number of National Guard troops sent to protect Washington continues to grow, as President Trump praises his own plan to clean up the city.(Begin VT)DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): D.C. was a hellhole, and now it's safe. The numbers were horrible. It was a crime-infested rathole. And they do have a lot of rats. We're getting rid of them too.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: But as Mr. Trump dismissed district leaders' claim of a 30-year low in violent crime, he's vowing a similar surge in Chicago, New York, and other cities. What could that mean for public safety in your community?We will check in with Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore and New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hints at an interest rate cut, and the stock market soars. But he also cautions that the U.S. economy is facing challenging times.(Begin VT)JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: We will get a reality check on Powell's speech on the state of the economy from economist Mohamed El-Erian.Plus: A U.N.-backed group confirms residents of Gaza City are facing catastrophic conditions of famine and warn that it will soon expand to other areas within the Gaza Strip. New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is visiting the region and will join us. We will also talk with UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2,300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside D.C. police forces.And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future?Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned as needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore.And joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic governor, Wes Moore.Thank you for being here.GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Thank you so much for having me.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there – here in D.C., there are Guardsmen from six different states on the street.The mission is – quote – \"beautification duty and support.\" The defense secretary has author – authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but, to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of D.C.Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, there's – there's plenty of reasons.You know, one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're – when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their National Guards to Washington, D.C.So who's going to – who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment. And for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big-government approach in the way they're conducting public safety.The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful.And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the president's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans, is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this.And I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received.When – when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need – where you need a surge of supports for – for traumas and disasters…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: … that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this. And this is a direct deflection that the president is authorizing.MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the president watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing, because he's tweeting about you – or TRUTHing, I guess.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: He says: \"The Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him.\" And he's talking about \"crime-ridden Baltimore.\" It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime.He says it's a bad one. He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby D.C. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it.Is the reality here is you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day. And I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation.So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local – with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history, over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone.MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That – well, no, that came from both federal and state money. And, also, Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges.And the results have been – have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past 2.5 years.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20 percent since I have been the governor. And the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.And so the reason that I have asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, this – these tropes, in these 1980s scare tac – scare tactics.And, you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called We Our Us, who is a violence intervention group. And they say, we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel, because, while the president is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime,.But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States.MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The president's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore has the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis, fourth highest murder rate.To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis. But…GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Correct.And we know we have work to do.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We know – like, if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.MARGARET BRENNAN: But your – the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help. He doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though. He says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF.Do you need more federal help in policing, if your mayor thinks you do?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the president to stop cutting funding, because, if you look at the president's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore, that it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons.Those are actually real, tangible things…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: … that the president of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is – President Trump says so as well – possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: He's spending a lot of time talking about you.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I have been on his mind a lot.(CROSSTALK)MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020, when the, you know, idea was defund the police.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.And, yes, the president spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And, yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected.And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father?And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods, who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work.And we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not presidential timber at all.I imagine you disagree with that assessment?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I have been very clear. I'm not running for president.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it's interesting that – but it's interesting. The president seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people.And that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland.Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You brought up immigration.One of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S.This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and the – what we know is that, you know, and all we're asking for is that the Constitution be followed on this.The Constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues. And when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the president manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the president is using to just – working to exploit the brokenness.And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety, that…(CROSSTALK)MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words, rather than…GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process.I just simply want a court and a judge to decide, what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security, who is – who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor, and executioner inside this case.I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting, or gerrymandering, as some people know it.You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one – one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, I mean, when I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, because. And I think – and I think we have to.MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and I think – and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is, this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the president of the United States, very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes, we're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different.But Democrats redistrict. You know this.,GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: But Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where – where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps.And we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters' voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps…MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent – they have a Republican representative, that they are actively being represented in Maryland?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think, if you look at maps across the country, less than 10 percent of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature, less than 10 percent.And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30 percent.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: So that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so, yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, we are.MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan.Good morning, Senator.I know we have got a bit of a delay here, so I will launch right in.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-New Hampshire): Good morning, or afternoon here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, exactly.You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed. The Pentagon did not explain why.In addition, the Navy reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed.Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings.And they come on the heels of firings earlier this year of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of naval operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things – one of the strengths of America's military are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks who have the training, the expertise to be able to do the jobs.And what we don't want is political people in those jobs who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So, it's very troubling.MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze. And we're going to try to get that back up if we can. The senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan.So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan.We lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator.Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday this internationally recognized body backed by the U.N., the IPC – it tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a manmade famine under way in Gaza. This is a very rare designation. Only four other times has one been designated.The country you are in, Jordan, called it a shameful failure of humanity, that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three-month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen.One of the – we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is a – funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration.They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in, in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable.Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli prime minister's office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it – quote – \"a modern blood libel spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\"That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate, rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor. And the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it.But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that. They are getting ready to do another – or they have already started planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people.So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in to the people who are starving.MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your criticism right now.I want to ask you a little bit, though, about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former Deputy National Security Adviser for President Biden Joe – Jon Finer just wrote a piece in \"The Atlantic.\"And he said that, while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes: \"We did far too little far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\"Do you agree with him? And do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position.With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in.I think – it's something that I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.But do you agree with this self-criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We should be doing more, and we should have done more, absolutely.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.I want to also ask you…SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think everybody should…MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: … have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense, when it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid, when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck.And they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, who are starving.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And that can be changed.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan.A bit of a delay there.We will be right back.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Congressman Mike Lawler is standing by.So, stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York.Good to have you here, Congressman.There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland. And that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The president encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well.Why do you so strongly oppose this?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. And mine wasn't even one of them. Despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat. I won by six and a half points.So, when you look at the map across the country, the fact is, roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts, they're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and, therefore, they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that, obviously, reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond.But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year. In 2024, at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become speaker –MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting. Despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution.So, now, New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the House.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: So, this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states, trying to get electoral advantage right now.MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the president's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the president of the United States doesn't want it done?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Look, obviously it's going to be a fight. But this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid-decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress, like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974, never held a job outside of elected office, it's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform.So, I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know, there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties because, frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority, period.On the question, though, that we have been – also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The president of the United States has mentioned New York as another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Well, crime has been a major problem in New York for years. And Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime crisis.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but do you want National Guard troops?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized – Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So, that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80 percent of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution. That 80 percent of these individuals are released back out on to the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington, D.C., 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.So, when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate –MARGARET BRENNAN: Well – no, but that's a local – that's a local issue that would need to get changed.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: No, but this –MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the question on the troops, you'd rather troops than –REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: But – but – but, Margaret, this is why the homicide rate is so high.MARGARET BRENNAN: FBI agents or ATF agents or DEAL agents? You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City, you would rather National Guardsmen who have to be trained to police?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I want – I want all of the above. No. No, no, don't – don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above. The FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime.I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation, enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I led that effort. And the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington, D.C., only 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous. And it's exactly why the president is cracking down on crime in major cities.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York state that – that matters. A good amount of money from that chips bill went to New York.On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore. The president wants to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have U.S. taxpayers as a – as a shareholder, own 10 percent.As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Generally speaking, no. I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts –MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the –MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: In the aftermath of the collapse of the market in '08, the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I think what the president is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars –MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel –MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: To manufacture chips.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment.MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to –REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors.MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman –REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That is critical for our foreign policy.MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I'm going to leave it there.We'll be right back.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the U.S. economy. Mohamed El-Erian is the chief economic adviser at Allianz, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich, Connecticut.Good morning to you.MOHAMED EL-ERIAN (President, Queens College, Cambridge University and Chief Economic Adviser, Allianz): Good morning, Margaret.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we saw the – the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon. But he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So, why then did the financial markets rally?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct, the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability. And the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side and, therefore, an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said, \"significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system.\" \"Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth.\" And there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point. But it's a lot of uncertainty.Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if basically he's saying, throw out your models?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent. And, therefore, he has tended to be late.Look, there is something promising in our future. And that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in A.I., in life sciences, in robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds. And that includes high debt and high deficits.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawler just before you. And that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chipmaker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president of the United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (President Of The United States): He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving up $10 billion for the United States. So, we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10 percent stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so. Margaret, look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing. And that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what the U.S. is saying now is we –MARGARET BRENNAN: Which were paid back.MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back. But at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas.The most important distinction, if I may here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10 percent, but it must not control how this company manages its affairs. Because once we go down that road, that is a really dangerous road, and that will (ph) eat way at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the commerce secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for.I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve chair, which you've nodded to, but the president is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her, without publicly disclosed evidence, of mortgage fraud, and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell encouraging her to be removed.Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, these allegations are unproven. And it's important to stress that.Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So, what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that have resulted in these four resignations.But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. An independence central bank is critical to the well-being of the economy. And there's lots of reasons for that. So, you know, one has to distinguish between the two, I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information and is – is denying wrongdoing here.But just the fact that it is the president directing the attention towards her, doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop, this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I – my fear, and my concern, is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there.We'll be back in a moment.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday by a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing manmade famine and that those conditions will expand soon.UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment.Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us.We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation, so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Well, thank you, Margaret.Let – let me say this. You know, it's – it's been now almost two years since October 7th. And since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for – for months and months and months, which is the terrible famine.You know, we've estimated, at this point, that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who have died from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying, beware, right? This – this famine is just right around the corner and it's – it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know, it's so – it's shocking that it's happened because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising.And what it means really is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image, children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where, you know, suddenly they're – they're – they're all quiet. Children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry. And to see that happen and – especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the U.N. data is flawed. The prime minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice.Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot. Journalists who live inside Gaza. Because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know what you're saying is fact?CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, let me say two things about that. One is, the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people. And they monitor this as they go and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-laden deaths. So, it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate.I would also say, to me, it's – it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, all right. I – I – I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not?First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming. You should see it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absence of that, we're going to have to rely on the – the data that we have, the people who were there. And I can tell you from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean I have spoken to our staff and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived. Many thousands of children who have had amputations and are – you know, I mean just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussions, stop the arguing and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children. Make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a decent future.MARGARET BRENNAN: And – and the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out.On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lieu, and another Mideast envoy, have said the U.N. agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why – why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, I – the – the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, U.N. had 400 places where we – we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, OK. And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food. People are getting shot. It's a – it's a terrible situation. And it doesn't work. It's not working that well.Now, look, I don't – I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our – let us do our work too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say \"we,\" it's not just UNICEF, it's the U.N., it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that gets to the people who need it. And I – you know, do both. I'm fine with that. But at least make sure the humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that. Nobody wants to see that.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. He did indeed.I want to ask you as well about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good. And we need them to step up and do more.Sudan, as you say, it's the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the U.S. really can make a much bigger difference if they try to – to do this work and do it as quickly as possible.MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here when you don't get –CATHERINE RUSSELL: It's horrible.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, first of all, they're not getting food. They are facing horrible sexual violence.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.CATHERINE RUSSELL: I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.CATHERINE RUSSELL: And it's – it's devastating.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.CATHERINE RUSSELL: And the results, as you say, will last for generations.MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that.That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)","summary":"On this \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" broadcast, Maryland Gov.

Mike Lawler on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Aug. 24, 2025","text":"The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.

LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen -- REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?[END CROSSTALK]REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF.

I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back.","summary":"The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep.

He is leading upward of 5 percent ahead of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in both.Buttigieg, meanwhile, is showing stronger momentum in several states, holding 23 percent support in Florida, 16.8 percent in North Carolina, and 21.6 percent in Texas.Newsom's standing in those same states lags behind, with 12 percent in Florida, placing him third behind New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 10.2 percent in North Carolina, where former vice president and Democratic nominee for 2024 Kamala Harris takes second, and 19.5 percent in Texas, putting him just behind Buttigieg.Polling information is not currently available for other states.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump on Truth Social on August 21: \"Gavin Newscum is way down in the polls. He is viewed as the man who is destroying the once Great State of California. I will save California!!!

'These guys were fully submerged, they were kind of the leaders in that space.'\n\nOn October 28, 2020, at a Trump rally in Bullhead City, Arizona, Kyle Forgeard, 26, Salim Sirur, 32, and Steve Deleonardis, 22, had a front row seat when the president waved and gestured at them to join him on stage as the song YMCA was playing his exit.\n\nFor once, the typically fearless YouTube pranksters were taken aback, was this really seriously happening?\n\nTrump was serious, beckoning them on stage again.\n\n‘Just sauced up the YMCA with @realdonaldtrump,’ the caption for their Instagram account read as they posted the surreal video for their fans.\n\nFans of the group were stunned, curious whether their appearance was a massive troll, another prank, or a real demonstration of support for the MAGA movement.\n\nThe video attracted millions of views from their audience and curious onlookers and millions more hits after the president reposted their video on his Instagram account\n\nThey pulled over their van and shotgunned twisted teas to celebrate the moment.\n\n‘Holy absolute f**k,’ Forgeard said, watching the views and comments coming in on his phone. \n\nDespite the confusion, the conclusion was that these four Canadians had reached a new levels of internet superstardom that they would never have dreamed.\n\nThe Nelk Boys were among the early pioneers of YouTube content, posting hilarious prank videos that surprised and delighted their fans. \n\nIn 2015, the boys published their biggest hit with over 49 million views after they revealed to the public they had 'coke' in their car.\n\nWhen Los Angeles police officers ordered them to pop open their trunk, there were cases of Coca-Cola, which even triggered laughter from the police.\n\nFor ten years, the boys have been grinding out their fame and internet popularity, going through all the trials, tribulations, bad management decisions, and changing rosters that have plagued every popular YouTuber.\n\nThey were early guests of FaZe Banks’ Los Angeles 'Clout House' in 2017, which boosted their follower count and helped them spin off into their own mansion.\n\nAt that moment in 2020, they risked everything by putting on MAGA hats and joining the president on stage. \n\nThey had always been equal opportunity pranksters first, even trolling Trump supporters at a rally just weeks earlier before they were escorted out. \n\nNow they are all in, posting a video of meeting Trump on Air Force One as they nervously took shots and chugged beers as they waited for the president’s men to escort them on the plane.\n\nAs Trump greeted them and welcomed them in the Air Force One office, they stared nervously forward, speechless that they had finally ‘fu**ing made it’ by spending time with the president on the world’s famous plane.\n\nLike most of the internet celebrities who crossed paths with Trump, the relationship began with Dana White. \n\n‘You’re a friend of a good friend of mine, Dana White, we appreciate it and you really have a great future,’ Trump told them as White watched, laughing at their starstruck reactions.\n\nCo-founder Kyle Forgeard had long been an obsessive UFC fan, and as they grew more famous online, he speculated whether they were big enough to work with White.\n\n Collaborator Bob Menery was with Forgeard at the time, and phoned up White immediately, putting his friend on a FaceTime chat with the famous promoter.\n\nWhite was at his lake house with a son and his friends and when they saw Forgeard’s face, they were stunned.\n\n‘My son and his friends just went berserk,’ White later explained, as he was wondering, “who the hell is that?’”\n\n‘My sons have met every celebrity and they’ve never reacted in that way,’ White said.\n\nWhite saw the potential that the boys had to introduce his brand to a younger audience and welcomed them into their circle.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, White was one of the only sporting promoters who had found a loophole by hosting UFC events in Abu Dhabi.\n\nWhite invited them to attend the fight with the usual precautions, testing, days-long quarantines and finally the event itself.\n\nOne week later, White invited them to join him on Trump’s plane.\n\n ‘That’s probably the coolest two weeks that really changed my life,’ Forgeard recalled later in an interview with podcaster Chris Williamson. ‘This is a mind f**k, how did this happen to me?’\n\nWhite became more than just a client, he was a mentor for Forgeard, who recognized the battle that the UFC had to fight to become the multibillion-dollar brand that it is today.\n\n‘He’ll call me and give me advice, he is the most loyal fu**ing guy you will ever meet. He’s always there for us no matter what,’ he said.\n\nThe 2020 election did not go as expected, as Trump left the White House and the Nelk boys returned to their usual antics.\n\nBut by 2022, Trump was already to get back in the conversation, and the Nelk Boys offered a perfect platform to do so.\n\nThe Nelk Boys had started their own Full Send podcast [WHEN] and traveled to Trump’s home at Mar-a-lago for the interview.\n\nWearing their specially branded merchandise, shorts, jackets, and hoodies, the crew listened as Trump began airing his grievances about President Joe Biden’s presidency, high gas prices, the war in Ukraine, the botched exit from Afghanistan, and the conditions at the border. And windmills.\n\n‘We look weak, we look stupid, we look like we don’t know what we’re doing,’ Trump fumed.\n\nAt one point, Trump said that Biden ‘frankly, got there through a fraudulent election’ as the boys watched.\n\nTrump said their interview would probably be pulled because of what he had said.\n\n'If you put up this whole interview, let's see what happens with Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and all of them take it down,' he said. 'This is the beginning of communism.' \n\nThe boys dismissed Trump's comment as they boasted there was no way that YouTube would take it down. \n\n'There's no way,' Forgeard said, boasting that they 'never really gave a s**t' about being politically correct. \n\nAs forecast, the interview was pulled just hours after it went online.\n\n‘YouTube has DELETED our Trump episode that over 5M views in 24 hours,’ Forgeard announced to his followers on Twitter.\n\nTrump’s comment on the election was breaking Google's rules to make YouTube ‘a safe place for all' and so it was removed. \n\nThe moment was one more example of what those on the right saw as a growing ‘woke’ censorship cabal that was taking control of the internet and trying to silence their politically incorrect content.\n\nThe Nelk Boys YouTube channel had already been demonetized by Google after they started hosting parties on campus during the coronavirus pandemic in September of 2020 at Illinois University.\n\n‘That mainstreamed the president’s concerns about censorship,’ Bruesewitz recalled, noting that YouTube’s decision helped rally the internet community behind Trump.\n\nTrump blasted YouTube’s decision as ‘censorship’ comparing it to that of an oppressive government trying to suppress their political opposition.\n\nThe moment formed a kinship with the president, as they were watching their friends and colleagues get banned from platforms like Twitter, Youtube, and reshuffled their algorithms to throttle their view counts.\n\nA year later, Trump appeared again on their show and by October 2024, he appeared again to talk about his political resurgence that was fueled by podcasts.\n\nThe Nelk boys allowed their support for Trump shine through as they discussed the campaign on the podcast and ripped the aging Joe Biden and his comical vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nForgeard admitted it was risky to support a politician, but did it anyway.\n\n‘I actually like Trump, that’s why I fu**ing supported him, I didn’t do it for any other reason,’ he said afterwards in the Williamson interview.\n\nTheir audience of young men who had grown up with their content were already mostly aligned with the president or at least curious about the ‘real’ Donald Trump that was hanging out with their favorite trolls on the internet.\n\nThe secret of their enduring success was that they were never idolized for their virtue, but rather as villains, scumbags, and pranksters.\n\n‘We started as scumbags, we’ve never been the good guys,’ Forgeard said, ‘Our fans never really give a s**t.’\n\nSpending time with Trump was eye-opening, as the group began to treat him as just another one of the boys.\n\n‘It was like he was six beers deep, but he wasn’t,’ Forgeard later explained to his audience. ‘It was just like he was just having the best time, we were laughing, cracking jokes, just boys being boys.’\n\nWhen Trump won in 2024, Dana White took the stage to celebrate the new media platforms that helped bring him there. \n\n'I want to thank the Nelk Boys,' White began, before also thanking video game streamer Adin Ross, comedian podcaster Theo Von, and of course 'the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan.' \n\nFor the boys, it was another surreal moment that changed their lives. \n\n‘For me to get shouted out in the post-election speech, like my parents are like what the f**k, like everyone was like this is a fu**ing simulation,’ Forgeard said.","summary":"Before the 'podcast election' of 2024, the Nelk Boys were the original internet celebrity bros who crossed paths with Trump during his first reelection campaign in 2020.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14963569/Inside-rise-Nelk-Boys-podcasters-crashed-traditional-politics-introduced-Gen-Z-party-bros-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/23/00/100855565-0-image-a-17_1755903861922.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-24 13:24:24","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.15},{"id":353834244,"title":"Latest line: A good week for Katie Porter, a bad week for Valley Water","text":"Katie Porter\n\nWith Kamala Harris forgoing the 2026 governor’s race, former Southern California congresswoman’s momentum builds as a new Politico poll shows her cementing the lead as frontrunner.\n\nValley Water\n\nAfter spending $100 million since 2017 to plan a $2.7 billion new reservoir critics say is infeasible, Silicon Valley’s largest water agency sees state cut off new money and feds refuse to provide water for it.\n\nCharles Munger Jr.\n\nPalo Alto son of Warren Buffett’s business partner will fund opposition to Gavin Newsom’s redistricting ballot measure.

The company said the new offering was targeting two distinct consumer groups: a. cord nevers, aka those people who have never had a cable or satellite subscription, and b. cord cutters, aka those who have cut the cord and no longer have cable or satellite subscriptions. The move is necessary because, according to the New York Times from Thursday: \"ESPN is in around 61 million homes today between cable, satellite and services like YouTube TV. ESPN receives around $15 per subscriber monthly from distributors for all of its networks.\" Just more than a decade ago, ESPN was in 100 million homes, so it has lost 40 percent of its subscribers in a relatively short period of time. That's because the business of cable sports on TV, to a large degree, has completely and totally collapsed. This is something I've been writing and talking about on OutKick for over a decade. In fact, when I started writing about cord-cutting back in 2013, people thought I was crazy. But it turns out, I pretty much nailed it. Cable has collapsed and sports have become way more expensive and way less convenient in a streaming era. And the big question that still remains for everyone involved in media is this: how low is the floor of the cable and satellite bundle? Right now we are at 60 million subscribers. Is the floor 50 million? Forty million? Lower? I'm a cable and satellite subscriber and probably will be until I die -- hell, I still get print newspapers delivered to my house. But if you told me today, would you rather have a sports TV show or 5 million YouTube subscribers, I'd rather have 5 million YouTube subscribers. And I don't even think that's a tough call. Which is why ESPN's launch of a streaming service, to me, feels like a panicked move. Especially at a price of $29.99 a month, or $360 a year. If ESPN really wanted to burn the boats on the cable TV business, they needed to offer the channel for like $9.95 a month. Yes, they'd gut their existing business, but they would be building a long-range future. Here it feels like they're trying to have their cake and eat it too. They want the cable and satellite revenue, but also want the long-term direct streaming relationship with the consumer. But how does that work when you're competing with companies like Netflix, Apple and Amazon that are all in on streaming and don't have to worry about disrupting their existing business? This might have worked in 2014, but it's a decade too late now. It's like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. The long-range business flywheel points to everything, eventually, ending up on streaming. ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro said one reason ESPN felt it had to move now on launching its service was, \"We thought it (launching the streaming service) was the right thing to do for the sports fan because the trends (loss of subscribers) were not slowing down. If anything, they were accelerating.\" Uh oh. If the math above from the New York Times is correct, this means ESPN is producing about $11 billion a year in revenue for Disney, plus another $2 billion or so in advertising. So call it roughly $13 billion a year in revenue. Which is still a lot of money, but is down by nearly half from what it would have been projected to be a decade ago. If the cable and satellite bundle hadn't collapsed, ESPN would be producing roughly $23 billion a year instead of $13 billion a year. So that's $10 billion in lost revenue, which adds up, even at a place like Disney. Given that ESPN's business model remains renting sports games from leagues – ESPN is just a middleman here between the leagues and the consumers, with a bit of a chance with the NFL of late which I'll discuss below -- the revenue collapse has necessitated cutting the UFC -- albeit replaced with the less expensive WWE -- losing most of Major League Baseball -- albeit with a potential regional replacement offering online -- losing the Big Ten completely in all sports -- and paying much more for one-third of the NBA than it paid for half of the NBA in the past. The result is, ESPN's entire sports business now boils down to essentially renting three sports from the leagues: Monday Night Football from the NFL, one-third of the NBA, and the entire sports programming of the Southeastern Conference. Plus, the college football playoff. Yes, there are other offerings, but purely from a business perspective, the NFL, the NBA and the SEC are, for better or worse, ESPN's entire business. ESPN pays a reported $2.7 billion a year for Monday Night Football, somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year for the NBA, and around $1.6 billion a year for the SEC ($300 million) and the college football playoff rights ($1.3 billion). (Some of the playoff games are sublicensed back to TNT so they get a bit of this back.). The NFL rights fee, in particular, is likely to surge even higher come 2030 when this deal expires. But even without that happening, just these three assets command more than $6 billion a year. And with the NFL deal expiring soon and the college football playoff expanding next year, it's not crazy to forecast these costs going to an average of $9 billion or $10 billion a year. (Given that ESPN's profit is reported at roughly $2 billion, this will go up in smoke in a hurry.) By the way, rough eyeballing of these rights fees would suggest that the SEC by itself, which at $300 million a year for every football, basketball and baseball game, plus the conference network, looks like the best deal in all of sports. Interestingly, the SEC Network, unlike the Big Ten Network, doesn't come with a long-term commitment from the SEC. If the SEC walked from ESPN when its deal expires in 2034, the SEC Network would just vanish. Or go wherever the new deal is. That is, unlike the jointly owned Big Ten and Fox networks. The SEC Network as an entity provides no long-range value for ESPN unless it keeps the SEC. (A side note of credit for ESPN here: CBS made the most boneheaded move in sports rights history letting the SEC leave its game of the week. And to its credit, ESPN grabbed the SEC at a fantastic rate. It's likely that the single most profitable asset in ESPN's entire portfolio right now is the SEC.) The result of all these expenses and the collapsing cable and satellite subscribers? Disney can no longer rely on ESPN to fuel its profits. In fact, Disney mostly makes money -- a whopping 43 percent of its operating income per the Wall Street Journal -- now from the amusement parks. And according to the Wall Street Journal, Disney as a company made $15.6 billion in 2024 profit. That sounds like a lot, but it's actually LESS than the company made in profit in 2016, $15.7 billion, before the collapse of ESPN and cable began, leading to the stock price stagnating. The stock price of Disney today is $118, nearly identical to the $114 stock price of 2015. If you bought Disney stock a decade ago when ESPN was at its peak, it hasn't increased in value in a decade. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has more than tripled in the same time period. It gets worse, factoring in inflation -- thanks Joe Biden! -- and Disney would have needed to increase earnings by 35 percent since 2026 just to maintain the same value on the income it does make. So in actual value of earnings, Disney has lost 35 percent of its profit in the past decade. Put simply, Disney and ESPN have been an awful place to put your money for the past decade. You might as well have buried your cash in the backyard. And the only reason things haven't been much worse is because Disney has been able to increase costs at its theme parks -- lots of moms and dads out there have felt these price increases, by the way, it costs a small fortune to vacation at Disney now -- to subsidize the collapse of the rest of the company. Looked at in this way, ESPN's purchase of the NFL assets for a reported 10 percent of its own business, looks like a desperate Hail Mary. (ESPN paid less to buy the NFL Network completely -- a reported $2.5 billion -- than it does to rent Monday Night Football games from the NFL every year. Think about that for a minute: ESPN is going to pay more to rent NFL games over the next decade than its business will actually be worth. How is that remotely sustainable? The NFL desperately wanted out of the cable media business. What surprises me is that it took equity in the NFL. Why? Because if the NFL ever walks away from ESPN, its equity is mostly worthless. The NFL Network deal, from this perspective, looks smart for ESPN and dumb for the NFL because it handcuffed the league and guaranteed it will always have games to air. Of course, it's also possible that the NFL is making so much money that it just wanted the headache of running a media business to go away. But If I ran the NFL, I would have wanted cash, not equity, for my cable assets.) Let me pause here for a moment and respond to the inevitable commenters screaming that ESPN will be fine and even if it's not, all of cable will collapse anyway and WHY DON'T I MENTION THAT BECAUSE I'M SO BIASED. Well, most of cable programming is cheap. It doesn't cost very much to put on, say, news programming. Trust me, I've done a ton of it. Studios don't cost a ton and neither do opinion shows. You don't have to rent presidential press conferences, pay much for debates, the conventions are great drama, but even better business. Fox News, for instance, is WILDLY profitable for this reason. But FS1 isn't. Because live sports programming is insanely expensive and live news coverage is pretty cheap. So the fixed costs of cable programming outside of sports are tiny. Only sports requires a huge capital outlay to rent programming. (I'm not optimistic that there is any large market for any sports streaming offering of TV/cable products, period. I just don't see the market for any of it, as I'll discuss below.) In fact, here's something interesting: ESPN is basically the last cable sports property standing and it's now competing with Netflix, Apple, Amazon on streaming and Fox, NBC, and CBS on broadcast television. That is, ESPN's business model really doesn't exist anywhere else, everyone else has largely thrown in the towel on cable sports and put its top games either on streaming or \"free\" broadcast networks. Which brings us back to the big streaming launch by ESPN.. ESPN's idea, as I stated above, is that they can trade $15 a month in cable and satellite fees for $30 a month in streaming fees. But, and this is key, I don't believe there's any market for ESPN's streaming service. ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro said it wants to target the cord nevers, mostly young people, who have never had a cable and satellite subscription, and cord cutters, mostly older, cost-conscious consumers. But here's the problem -- young people are going to mostly illegally stream and most of the cord-cutters aren't sports or news fans. (I would argue the only people who still have cable are some combination of lovers of sports and news and/or older long time cable subscribers and just not willing to give up the ease of one remote control to watch cable and satellite.I, by the way, am firmly in the latter camp. I want one remote to watch everything. Streaming, in my opinion, has mostly made life worse for your average sports fan. It's made watching games more expensive and more difficult, a horrible combination.) But you don't have to buy my thesis on this market not existing. I put up a poll and asked you guys if you would sign up for ESPN's streaming service and pay $29.99 a month. And 96 percent of you said -- with more than 20,000 voters -- you would not pay for this product. Now whatever you think of my audience on social media, it wildly over-indexes for sports fans. This is where I think ESPN's branding issues with woke sports are such an issue. Almost no one is signing up for streaming services for opinion programming -- sports opinions are everywhere for free -- but ESPN's brand has become so toxic with many sports fans that they actually hate a sports company brand, which is a tough thing to manage. Indeed, the only sports fan I can think of that might appreciate ESPN's sports offering is actually a diehard SEC football fan. Because you could pay around $120 for ESPN streaming just for football season and get all the games you want and then unsubscribe. But most SEC football fans HATE ESPN's woke programming because the vast majority of SEC fans are Donald Trump voters. (Arguably Fox should have gone all in on the SEC years ago instead of the Big Ten. One top Fox executive came to an SEC football game with me, watched the planes fly over the stadium as the crowd went wild, and said, \"My god, this entire stadium is Fox News viewers.\" Yep. Fox and Friends probably should be broadcasting from SEC campuses every Friday all season long leading into the SEC game of the week brought to you on Fox. SEC fans LOVE Fox News. But left-wing ESPN has the SEC and right-wing Fox has the more left-wing Big Ten. (Not to go entirely political here, but the Big Ten definitely indexes more Kamala Harris voters than the SEC does, especially the Big Ten expanded to include USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon. Right now, every SEC state but Kentucky has a Republican governor. Meanwhile most Big Ten states have a Democrat governor. From a corporate congruity perspective, Fox should have the SEC and ESPN should have the Big Ten.) But back to the streaming service. On Saturday, I watched Iowa State and Kansas State play to kick off the college football season -- congrats Cyclones! -- and I thought it was strange how much ESPN was advertising its new streaming app on there. Presumably everyone watching the game already has ESPN. Why would it make sense to advertise it to people who already have ESPN? This would be like me asking you to read OutKick while you're already reading an OutKick article. So I asked you guys if you were signing up. Hundreds of you responded. And the comments are actually pretty interesting to read. Almost no one has signed up. And people seem pretty aware that if they already have a cable and satellite subscription, they aren't getting anything new from this offering because it's already included in their cable and satellite bundle. (Although I do suspect some people will sign up thinking they need to, which means ESPN will probably double-dip on some cable and satellite subscribers who also sign up for this.) Which is why ultimately, I think the problem with this offering is if you love sports and are 50+, you probably still have a cable and satellite subscription. And if you are under 50 and don't have a cable or satellite subscription, you either don't care about sports or you stream anything you want illegally. (People under 30 years old mostly think paying for sports content is insane. They either use their parents' log in or stream everything off pirated sites. It's a very real issue for monetization.) That is, there is no market for this product. ESPN's entire business model remains tethered to the cable and satellite bundle. This offering is too late and too expensive to change anything. Which means streaming isn't going to save ESPN's business. Basically, the entire ESPN business model remains reliant on the floor of cable and satellite subscribers being hit soon. If it does, ESPN might survive.

He held on to his Nebraska seat, anchored to the blue city of Omaha, last year even as Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by nearly 5 points. Each cycle, he is consistently rated as one of the most endangered House Republicans.\n\n“Every election I’ve had has been very hard. I had to give it everything I had — it’s like a 10-round boxing match, and I’ve always had the intensity to do it,” Bacon said.\n\nIn June, Bacon announced that he would hang up the towel and not pursue a sixth term in office. He had been fueling speculation on his retirement for months with statements critical of the Trump administration and, now that he’s made a decision, said his heart was not fully invested in campaigning every two years.\n\n“I just wasn’t sure I was going to have the intensity for a sixth run,” he said.\n\nBacon’s retirement instantly makes his district more of a pickup opportunity for Democrats, who must net just three seats to retake control of the House next year. It could also mean one fewer centrist Republican in a chamber that continues to become more polarized.\n\nBacon, who is rated as one of the most bipartisan and effective members of Congress, pointed to the Constitution and the Federalist Papers as he discussed his guiding philosophy across a decade in Washington.\n\n“By definition, you have to be bipartisan to be effective,” he said. “These things go hand in hand.”\n\nPart of his centrist reputation comes down to his willingness to buck Trump or his GOP colleagues in the House. Bacon pushed back on Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement by introducing legislation to reassert Congress’s authority over levying the duties.\n\nEarlier this year, he also became the first sitting GOP member to suggest Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth be fired over the Signalgate controversy. Separately, Bacon has criticized Trump’s handling of Russia and was the lone Republican to vote against renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, an idea spearheaded by the president. \n\n“I take pride in the fact that I have been my own man and I’ve gone against the grain at times, and I took a lot of heat and I survived,” Bacon said. \n\nBacon said that when he decided to break with his party in Congress, the key to a compromise was to “do it early, so you can get it fixed.” The congressman pointed to negotiations on the Medicaid reforms in Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” and the ultimate preservation of AIDS relief funding in the rescissions legislation earlier this year. \n\nWhen reflecting on why he ran for Congress in the first place, Bacon pointed to former President Abraham Lincoln as his role model, citing his resilience. He also named former Presidents George Washington, Ronald Reagan, and Dwight Eisenhower for the same trait. \n\n“I love the people who made this country great,” said Bacon, who served in the Air Force for nearly three decades before running for office.\n\nAs the self-proclaimed “old-school Republican” heads for retirement, Bacon said he is looking forward to a “normal family life” and called the ability to spend time with his wife, children, and grandchildren a major reason why he is stepping down.\n\n“There’s gotta be more to life,” he added. \n\nThe congressman may forgo his spot in the lower chamber, but he still hopes to remain involved in a political world he says has piqued his interest since he was 13 years old. Bacon expressed interest in helping someone “like Nikki Haley or Glenn Youngkin in a national race.”\n\n“I’d like to be a voice of traditional Reagan values in our party, and I’d like to be involved in the national elections in 2028, and I hope to do some TV and make a case for what I believe in,” Bacon said.\n\nHe has separately expressed interest in executive office, including the jobs of governor or president of the United States.","summary":"Democrats have found new reason for hope that Nebraska, despite its traditional Republican lean, will bring their party closer to returning to power in Washington.

At the moment, the closest contenders are two mayors in California and a county executive in Maryland. No wonder, then, that American socialists have begun to dream big.\n\nEarlier this month, the Democratic Socialists of America, of which Mamdani is a member, held its biannual convention in Chicago, attended by 1,500 members. There, the organization pledged to “build a broad left-labor coalition” and “draft a socialist candidate” to run for president in 2028.\n\nWhy shouldn’t they? Mamdani’s primary campaign in New York showed that an appealing socialist candidate with a strong economic message could generate voter enthusiasm. Nor is Mamdani the first: Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez remain popular with the Democratic base, and just this year they brought out tens of thousands of supporters with their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. According to a recent poll, 67 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of all Americans under 30 years old view socialism favorably. And with 85,000 members, the DSA is already the country’s biggest leftist organization, larger even than the Communist Party during its heyday in the 1940s.\n\nBut such numbers don’t add up to much political power in a country of 340 million. DSA counts only three representatives in Congress and no senators (Sanders is sympathetic but has never been a member). For the average voter, even 10 years after Sanders’s historic presidential run, American socialists are simply not a distinct, recognizable political force. And the reasons for this failure were entirely manifest at the meeting in Chicago: A significant part of the organization doesn’t share its traditional concept of an electoral path to socialism.\n\nLittle about this convention suggested a mass political movement intent on winning elections and coming to power. Mamdani, AOC, and Sanders were absent, and so was their welcoming, practical political style. In fact, DSA’s national leadership has voted not to endorse AOC, and many in the organization are now actively hostile to her. Some even put forward a resolution at the convention to formally censure her for her “tacit support of Zionism,” on the grounds that she had supported the funding of defensive Iron Dome weapons for Israel, said that Israel had a right to self-defense, and “failed to support Palestinian resistance” in a media interview. (The resolution never reached a vote.) The mostly young and white crowd hardly discussed Donald Trump’s presidency (a motion that urged such discussion was voted down early on) and seemed to consist of a consortium of activists, many of them focused on single issues. Some were preoccupied with protesting the convention’s lack of a masking mandate.\n\nMany of the resolutions passed at the convention would have been nonstarters for national politicians such as Sanders or AOC. One pledged for the DSA to be a “fighting anti-Zionist” organization that would endorse only candidates who supported the BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) movement against Israel. (This would disqualify Sanders.) The resolution further called for any DSA member opposing BDS or affiliated with the liberal Jewish organization J Street to be expelled, along with anybody who believes that “Israel has a right to defend itself.” Moreover, some incidents at the convention cast serious doubt on DSA’s commitment to the “democratic” part of its title. For example, the convention rejected an amendment to a resolution declaring that DSA stood “against all governments that engage in the repression of democratic rights.”\n\nThese were not the politics of DSA’s visionary founder, Michael Harrington. A Marxist who died in 1989, Harrington called for solidarity with leftist movements around the world but also staunchly opposed authoritarianism. Many in today’s DSA don’t have time for him. In response to a post on X affirming Harrington’s opposition to Stalin and Mao, DSA’s chapter in Worcester, Massachusetts, posted a video of an attendee at the convention shouting, “Fuck you, Mike Harrington!” The Worcester chapter celebrated that the organization had put “more communists in leadership,” making it the “largest org of socialists, antizionists, and commies.”\n\nThis is not rhetoric or politics that could win elections in America. But to understand the discrepancy between the politics on the DSA convention floor and that of America’s most popular socialist politicians requires a brief history. Harrington founded DSA in 1982 on the ashes of the Socialist Party of America, which had imploded a decade earlier, and the new party drew on the remnants of the youth- and student-led New Left of the 1960s. Unlike other American socialists, who would spend decades trying to establish an alternative to the duopoly of Democrats and Republicans, Harrington’s DSA was lodged within the Democratic Party and sought to build a base for the left inside of it. The strategy of the far-leftists produced little more than an alphabet soup of avowedly socialist organizations that rarely surpassed a few hundred members. DSA, too, was a tiny organization of little political account for many decades. But when American socialism finally got its lucky break in 2016, it did so because Sanders ran in the Democratic Party primary, not because socialists launched another quixotic third-party campaign. A surge of popularity for democratic socialism took DSA, within a year or two, from an organization of roughly 6,000 people, with an average age of about 67, to one with more than 30,000 members, and an average age of 33.\n\nThe infusion of new blood overwhelmed the organization’s leadership and suggested a need for some overhauling of its earlier mission. Some of the newcomers, including the young contributors and reading clubs gathered around the journal Jacobin, attempted to update Harrington’s Cold War–era socialism. But the wave of new members also included an inchoate collection of activists, and the organization swiftly became a big tent for all manner of leftist tendencies—including many that lacked any commitment to Harrington’s democratic tradition, some even holding that elections were a capitalist-state apparatus that socialists should not use to come to power.\n\nDSA today has about two dozen internal factions (called “caucuses”), but its politics can really be divided into two broad wings. There is a mass-politics wing (grouped in the Socialist Majority and Groundwork caucuses), which seeks to elect socialists as Democrats and build a national organization that connects with the average American. Opposing it is a sectarian wing whose extremist politics have little to do with any notion of democratic socialism. The latter includes Red Star, a self-avowed “Marxist-Leninist caucus” that openly supports Hamas and emphasizes “the role of the vanguard in organizing the revolution.” Whereas the likes of Sanders have long lauded the New Deal, this group condemns that model as “extending concessions to the white working class to secure their loyalty to the capitalist state.” Similarly, it faults the Green New Deal that Sanders and AOC have championed for failing to articulate “a clear commitment to dismantling the settler-colonial and American imperialist projects.” Another caucus, Marxist Unity Group, calls for DSA “to free itself from the Democratic Party” and “fight to overthrow the Constitution,” in an effort to “destroy every institution that denies the people an authentic popular democracy, abolishing the Senate, the Electoral College, the Supreme Court, and the independent presidency.”\n\nThe differences between these two broad groups are not academic, and they have had real-life consequences. Under the pressure of the sectarian wing, the DSA refused to endorse Joe Biden or Kamala Harris in the past two presidential elections. In November 2023, the sectarians in the DSA leadership argued that a second Biden term would be no different from a second Trump term. A few months later, when the mainstream wing wanted to commit the DSA to “work to defeat Trump in the 2024 election, without endorsing the Democratic nominee,” the sectarians voted even that proposal down.\n\nMost DSA members don’t belong to any caucuses and don’t play an active role in the organization. But since 2023, the organization’s leadership has been effectively controlled by the sectarian wing, which won a majority in that year’s convention. As anybody with experience in politics can tell you, committed sectarian activists who show up to enough meetings can capture leadership positions and convention delegates without necessarily representing the organization’s actual membership. At the 2025 convention, the mainstream wing tried to pass a resolution for the leadership to be elected on the basis of one member, one vote, as opposed to being voted in by delegates to the convention (who are, in turn, elected by DSA’s local chapters). The sectarian wing opposed and defeated the resolution. The Chicago convention elected a 27-member leadership of which the sectarian wing controls about 12 seats. The mainstream wing has about nine seats, and the rest fall somewhere in the middle. The convention also reelected the party’s two co-chairs, one belonging to Groundwork, the other to Red Star.\n\nThe two wings are able to share power this way because DSA is extremely decentralized. The organization barely exists as a nationwide project. Instead, each branch does its own thing. By far the largest branch is the one in New York City, which has more than 11,000 members and is controlled by the mainstream wing. More than 80 percent of its membership in the Bronx and Queens voted to endorse AOC. The sectarian wing tends to dominate in smaller cities where it pursues a variety of projects. Such factionalism effectively prevents DSA from adopting any unified strategy.\n\nThe problem is not new on the left. Harrington himself once complained about a “vocal, and regularly televised, fringe of confrontationists, exhibitionists, and Vietcong flag wavers who could plausibly be dismissed as freakish, or sinister, or both.” Democratic socialists who seek to run mass campaigns and attain power with elections are now encumbered by sharing an organization with “confrontationists” who hold fundamentally antidemocratic beliefs. If they wish to build a political force capable of coming to power, they must first decide who their allies are.","summary":"Only part of the left’s most promising political party even wants to win elections or come to power.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/dsa-mamdani-losing-elections/683970/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/mm1eIzhnwzDNW0SEIqdXs9KetCI=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/08/2025_08_21_DSA_mpg_1/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-24 11:00:00","author":"Arash Azizi","authors":["Arash Azizi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":353792080,"title":"Democrats huddle in Minnesota as party faces money and voter woes","text":"The party is still dealing with tensions among the progressive wing over Israel’s war with Hamas. Some leaders have been hesitant to embrace Zohran Mamdani, who has been critical of Israel’s treatment of the Gaza Strip, in his bid to become New York City’s next mayor. At its summer gathering, the DNC will consider two resolutions on the worsening crises in Gaza.\n\nDemocrats will also have to consider how to respond to the GOP’s redistricting efforts to sway the 2026 midterm elections in their favor, who the party’s de facto leader will be, and how to convince disaffected Americans to return to their party.\n\n“This is not the first time that each of us has gone to a DNC meeting where we have a number of issues that need to be tackled,” said John Verdejo, a North Carolina DNC member. “And once you gather that meeting, we felt refreshed, we felt fine, we felt rejuvenated. And this is not unlike those other meetings.”\n\nDEMOCRATS TO CONSIDER GAZA RESOLUTIONS AT DNC SUMMER MEETING\n\nBut the three-day summer meeting from Aug. 25 to 27 will at least have one issue Democrats won’t have to worry about: David Hogg. The former DNC vice chairman stepped down earlier this year as it became clear he would not prevail during a new election to elect two vice chairs.\n\nHere are some of the top issues that will influence the summer meeting:\n\nThe DNC’s fundraising woes \n\nWith President Donald Trump in power and the GOP controlling both the House and the Senate, the RNC has raked in millions of dollars over the DNC.\n\nFederal Election Commission reports show that the RNC had $80 million cash on hand at the end of June, compared to the DNC’s $15 million.\n\nThe $65 million deficit between the two committees is larger than in May, when the RNC had $72.4 million on hand compared to the DNC’s $15 million, a $57.4 million gap. \n\nThe lag in fundraising has worried some Democrats about whether the party will be able to compete in next year’s midterm elections, where they are hoping to retake the House and possibly the Senate, although that may be a tougher task.\n\n“Of course, I’m hoping that the party will right the ship, get structure down, be more disciplined,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist who has worked on presidential campaigns.\n\nCeraso also noted that state party infrastructure is important in making up the fundraising gap outside of the DNC. “Now, arguably, state parties will say, ‘We need more resources, we need more resources from the DNC. We need to have relationships with donors,'” he said. “And that’s completely valid.”\n\nIn April, Martin unveiled a plan to invest $1 million monthly in all 50 state parties, with $17,500 going to officials in blue states and $22,500 going to officials in red states. “We are sending a strong message that our party is building from the ground up and we’re building everywhere,” Martin said at the time.\n\nDemocrats have a voter registration problem \n\nA recent report from the New York Times details a Democratic Party that has lost voter registration ground to the GOP in 30 states.\n\nBetween the 2020 and 2024 elections, Republicans gained a 4.5 million lead over Democrats in the 30 states that track registration data. \n\nIn Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, important battleground states that will sway the 2026 and 2028 elections, Democrats also saw their lead slip.\n\nThe DNC announced this week that it was rolling out new tools, technology, and pilot programs to better organize voters and volunteers for the first time in nearly 20 years. The DNC will begin using the new technology in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states holding gubernatorial elections this year.\n\nMartin told NBC News that the goal was to be “organizing everywhere to win anywhere.”\n\n“We also need to go double down on our message, make it more attractive for folks to join the Democratic Party, to register as a Democrat, versus coming in and registering as independent or Republican,” added Verdejo. \n\nParty leaders struggle with progressive candidates \n\nAfter defeating former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the democratic primary, Mamdani, a socialist, has struggled to win over Democratic leadership.\n\nNeither Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Mamdani, despite both lawmakers representing New York. Other prominent Democratic New Yorkers, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. Kathy Hochul, have yet to endorse Mamdani. \n\nHowever, former President Barack Obama and Mamdani did speak by phone in June after he won the primary. Mamdani has raised more than $1 million, much of it from small donors, an indication of strong support among New Yorkers and Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are also dealing with another battle over the party’s direction after the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which Martin used to chair, rescinded its endorsement of Omar Fateh for Minneapolis mayor due to a voting system error.\n\nDEMOCRATS HOPE ‘ORGANIZING SUMMER’ CAN GALVANIZE SUPPORTERS\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of the more progressive voices in the party, was among a list of DFL lawmakers who criticized the decision to strip Fateh, another socialist, of his endorsement.\n\n“It is inexcusable to overturn the results weeks after the convention because board members did not like the outcome,” DFL members who disagreed with the decision said in a statement. “Not only does this decision set an extremely dangerous precedent, it will undermine the DFL endorsing process going forward and fails to center the will of delegates.”\n\nGaza remains a tension point for Democrats \n\nDuring the summer meeting, DNC members will vote on two separate Gaza resolutions, one put forth by Martin and the other championed by more progressive members.\n\nThe resolution from Martin calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the release of humanitarian aid, the return of hostages, and a two-state solution between Israel and Gaza.\n\nThe other resolution calls for an end to military aid to Israel and pushes for Palestinian statehood, neither of which will get traction with a GOP-controlled Washington. \n\nAs images of starving children in Gaza spread and accusations of famine have tilted the tide against Israel, more Democrats have been willing to break their allegiance to the Middle Eastern nation. Democrats don’t expect the issue to be solved at their summer meeting. \n\n“This is an issue that has been ongoing since Jesus walked the Earth,” said Verdejo. “Even the best folks who are diplomats who work at the [United Nations] have yet to figure this out.”\n\nBut tensions over how Democrats approach the conflict have not abated since protesters heckled both former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. At the DNC winter meeting earlier this year in National Harbor, Maryland, protesters repeatedly interrupted meetings and debates among the chair candidates.\n\n“Gaza hasn’t really changed a whole lot since February. And so I think the same passionate, caring human beings who were outside where we were at in Maryland are going to be in that room,” said Ceraso. \n\n“It’s a very tricky situation. And I think we’re the party that’s willing to deal with nuance, and Republicans are not so,” he continued. “And that’s the challenge of dealing with nuance, is that nuance requires a lot of navigation. The Republicans don’t have to do any nuance right now.”\n\nRedistricting woes could scramble 2026 map \n\nDemocrats will face a tough congressional map during the 2026 midterm elections if several GOP states successfully implement mid-decade redrawings.\n\nTexas began the redistricting race by creating five extra GOP House seats via a new congressional map that is all but certain to get signed into law despite Democratic stalling efforts. But Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) countered by signing two redistricting bills Thursday to redraw a new congressional map in California.\n\nCalifornia voters head to the polls for a special election on Nov. 4 to grant final approval to the new map, which would net Democrats five more House seats. \n\nYet Democrats still have more problems if other Republican-led states, such as Indiana, Missouri, and Florida, create more GOP-friendly districts. \n\nNEWSOM SIGNS REDISTRICTING BILLS, TAKES FIGHT OVER CONGRESSIONAL MAP TO VOTERS\n\n“This is all hands on deck right now,” said Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) during a DNC press call this week. \n\n“They’re not going to stop with Texas, we know that,” added Newsom. “What we’re doing … neutralizes what’s happening in Texas. People have this chance with this ballot, Nov. 4, to stand up to the rule of law.”","summary":"When members of the Democratic National Committee convene in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Monday, they&#8217;ll face a host of troubles, both domestic and foreign, hanging over their summer meeting.

That’s in part because Trump is attacking so many American institutions and values at once. But that’s also because the mainstream media and even Democratic politicians and other Trump critics don’t do a great job tying his moves together. Firing the person who manages the collection of employment data obviously isn’t the same as micromanaging how museum historians explain slavery. But it’s the same broader story of one man trying to put all independent authorities and decision-making under his rule. \n\nThe liberal group Indivisible has come the closest to consistently telling this story. They helped put together the “No Kings” protests over the summer and have continued to use that term. (I prefer casting Trump as dictator to king, because I think of kings as being part of hereditary monarchies.) But the media, nonpartisan experts, and most Democratic Party officials haven’t consistently adopted the king rhetoric, either. \n\nWhy does it matter if Trump is constantly described as a dictator? Because storytelling and narrative help change events. It was easier for George W. Bush to build support for the war in Iraq in the fall of 2002 because essentially every news event for the previous year was connected to the September 11 attacks and fighting terrorism. The intense focus on George Floyd’s killing in the summer of 2020 may have pushed people and institutions toward decisions they would not have made otherwise: corporations increasing their diversity initiatives, moderate Democrats embracing aggressive police reform, Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate.","summary":"CNN and MSNBC with a constant “The Trump Dictatorship” chyron on-screen.

In June, the show featured Zohran Mamdani, whose take was “I should be the mayor.” Rahma agrees. Mamdani had appeared on “Subway Takes” once before (take: “Eric Adams is a terrible mayor”), as well as on Rahma’s other online show, “Keep the Meter Running,” which also has a simple premise: Rahma hails a cab and tells the driver to take him to the driver’s favorite place in New York, which usually ends up being a restaurant. He really does keep the meter running while they talk and eat, and he really pays the fare at the end of the night—sometimes as much as eight hundred dollars.\nLast fall, when Kamala Harris was running for President, her campaign contacted “Subway Takes” and asked if she could appear on the show. Rahma had two questions. The first: could he ask her, on camera, about Gaza? (He opposed the Israeli military campaign, which the Biden Administration supported.) The answer to that was a flat no. The second question: what was her take going to be? The Vice-President, he was told, would argue that it’s rude to take your shoes off on an airplane. That sounded interesting. The Secret Service wouldn’t let them shoot on the subway, but the Harris campaign flew him to Pittsburgh, where they set up to film on her campaign bus.\nWhat happened next was like a spec script for “Veep,” or a potted nonfiction allegory about how the Democrats remain undefeated at shooting themselves in the foot. Harris’s campaign advisers decided that her original take—one that sounded authentic, because it was something she actually believed—might make her seem snobby. Instead, they proposed two safer, focus-grouped options: anchovies taste good on pizza, and “Bacon is a spice.” Rahma, recounting the saga on a Forbes podcast earlier this year, said that he found the former insipid and the latter “confusing and weird”—not to mention a bit tone deaf, given that, as a Muslim, he doesn’t eat bacon. When he tried to steer her away from “the bacon thing,” he was overruled. The resulting footage was so bad that he and the campaign mutually agreed not to release it.\nRecently, Rahma and I met at a coffee shop in central Brooklyn, then walked through Prospect Park. We talked about his burgeoning content empire, his run-in with Andrew Cuomo, and “Or Something,” a movie he co-wrote and co-stars in, which is out this weekend. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nOne promise I made to myself was that I would not interview you on a subway. Another was that I would not start the interview by saying, “So, what’s your take?”\n[Laughs.] That’s really kind of you.\nInstead of “So, what’s your take?,” I’m gonna ask: So, what’s your job?\nHmm. You know, I used to call myself a comedian. I also used to call myself a media entrepreneur. I also used to call myself a “comedian and media entrepreneur,” which had a nice ring to it. But now I just say I’m an entertainer. I think that the broader you can make it, the more people will understand it.\nLast month, on vacation at a resort in Jamaica, I’m in the pool. I like to strike up conversations, to entertain myself. So I see these three average—well, above average, in terms of weight—white old dudes. I love old people, so I swim up to them, and I’m just, like, “What’s up?” And they’re, like, “What’s up, man”—really nice, like usual. And we start talking about what each of them do. “I’m a taxidermist.” “I’m a retired cop.” And then it got to me. I was, like, “I’m an entertainer.” And they go, “Oh, cool.” They get it.\nEven the phrase “content creator”—I think it’s funny because everyone’s a content creator. You’re literally a content creator. I’m sorry. I hate to say it.\nI hate it, too, but it’s true.\nTalk-show host, podcaster—it’s all one thing now.\nThis is part of what interests me. But, first, walk me through how you got here.\nSo I came to New York at age twenty-five. I’d always wanted to move somewhere, but my father passed away when I was young, so I stuck around Minnesota, where I had graduated with a degree in journalism with an emphasis in advertising. I didn’t have high hopes for myself. As a young person growing up Egyptian in Minnesota, there was not really a sense of hope or urgency to do anything. I come from a humble background. My mom’s a day-care provider. My dad was a failed entrepreneur. So there wasn’t much to latch onto.\nThis was [around 2012], a time when we were idolizing startup founders and startups in general. I’d open a book and or a magazine and it would be, like, “The guy from TOMS Shoes is rich.” “Mark Zuckerberg is rich.” And I was, like, Cool, that’s what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna go to New York and just get rich.\nI started applying for jobs, and I miraculously got a job at Vice, which—I didn’t know what it even was. A friend of mine was, like, You should apply to Vice. I go to vice.com, and I’m, like, “Is this a porn website? I don’t understand.”\nIn fairness, Vice was confusing.\n[Laughs.] It was, and it got more confusing.\nWere you living in Williamsburg, and part of what they used to call the hipster thing?\nI don’t know if I was hip. I was definitely made fun of for being fresh off the boat. It was, like, gentle bullying. Like, “Why are you longboarding to work?” And I’m, like, “Well, everyone else is skateboarding,” and they’re, like, “Yeah, but longboarding is for losers.”\nThis is why no one was sad when the hipster died, because it was so insufferable.\nIt was insufferable, but it was also funny, and I also pushed back. If somebody was, like, “Yo, we love the new Chief Keef album,” I was, like, “I think this music sucks.” I’ve since grown to love it, but at that point I was, like, “I like meaningful things.” I was all about J. Cole. Vice was all about Chief Keef.\nBecause it’s cringe to care about things.\nBut I just decided that I was gonna always be cringe. I just embraced it.\nWhat was your job?\nI was the associate director of global marketing, which is probably not a sound job for someone who’s twenty-five and has never worked in media before. My boss was maybe twenty-seven. My first week or two he’s, like, “We have a big campaign for Intel, and we need to do a media buy.” I’m, like, “Cool. What is that?”\nAnyway, I did a really good job. I got really good at it really fast. And I did really start liking video, which I wasn’t super interested in before that.\nI was the first person to go from Vice to the New York Times. I was essentially helping launch Times Video. Their video unit at the time was embedded clips of the news, and they were, like, “We need to make shows.” So that’s when I started experiencing content development, audience development. I was the first person to publish vertical video at the Times, the first person to launch a Snapchat channel, the first person to have two desks—one on the business side, one in the newsroom.\nEventually, my network felt strong, my experience felt strong, and then that’s when I did what I set out to do originally, which was to start a company and try to get rich. Which I failed at, because I was chasing the moment. Fully distributed content, no website. I was at the whims of the platforms, which worked for a little bit, and I made a ton of money, and then all the money disappeared on me.\nThen I had, like, a mid-life enlightenment during the pandemic. My brother was in the hospital about to die. I was in Minneapolis because of my brother, and then George Floyd happened, and that was in my home town. I hadn’t spent longer than seventy-two hours in Minneapolis for ten years. And then all of a sudden I’m there for an indefinite amount of time. And I throw myself into the social uprising and give it my all, because it was a way of coping with grief—I couldn’t go to the hospital at all. My mom is literally crying and praying every day for twenty-four hours a day, and I’m feeling like this “Garden State” character, back in my home town.\nBut instead of the Shins, it’s Black Lives Matter.\n[Laughs.] And then I got separated from my wife, and my whole life just became a different thing overnight. I’ve never, ever in my entire life thought about what I want to be when I grow up, or what I want to do, or what I’m even good at. Who do I want to be? Do I want to leave a legacy?\nSo I took a real, honest look at my life, and I was, like, if money were not an issue, what would I want to do that I think I would be good at? And I was, like, You know what? I’ve always been a magnet. People seem to gravitate toward me. I’ve been invited to a lot of weddings, and I’ve been a groomsman in many, many weddings—I think that means something.\nI was, like, I’m just gonna be a comedian. And then I just chased it as quickly as possible. I tried to jam ten years of work into five years, because I was thirty-three at the time, which felt old—now I’m thirty-nine, which feels older—and I just felt like I had to prove that I was good, fast.\nIt’s interesting that you say “magnet.” Because being magnetic—that is a real thing, and it’s a thing that only certain people have. If you think about Jimmy Fallon, for example, I wouldn’t say that his skill is being a comedian. I would say that his skill is being a really good host. So did you think: talk-show host? How did you arrive at that?\nI was doing as much as possible. I was doing selfie videos, I was writing tweets, I was doing TikToks, I was writing sketches.\nThen this guy Adam Faze said, “Hey, I have some money to make some shows. Do you have any ideas?” I said, “I do have some ideas. One’s been sitting in my Notes app for a long time. It’s called ‘Keep the Meter Running,’ and the premise is simple: I hail a cab and tell them to take me wherever they want.” He said, “Cool, let’s make it.” My father used to be a taxi-driver for, like, three or five years, and he passed away, and I always found myself gravitating toward older men as father figures.\nI think it was Stavros Halkias who said that it’s your excuse to meet every immigrant dad in New York. Cabdrivers are just an amazing group of people.\nYeah. They’re a well. They all have side hustles, and they’re weird side hustles. One guy has a one-man show. One guy is a folksinger. One guy has a gold-mining operation in Ghana. One guy has a well in his village that he goes to for three months out of the year and makes custom water bottles for events. They’re all incredible stories. And I’ve never cast one. I just hail the cab.\nSo if it doesn’t work out, you just don’t use it?\nThey all work. I’ve done twenty episodes. All of them have been published. A lot of them have said no, but the ones that say yes have something to say.\nBefore starting “Keep the Meter Running,” my friend Andrew and I started a company. That company also failed, because we were doing premium long-form scripted podcasts. I was, like, “Why don’t we do something that is the exact opposite of what we’ve been doing? Let’s literally do a podcast where it’s only ninety seconds.” And my friend Andrew, my co-founder, was, like, “The cab thing worked out for you. Would you hate the idea of putting it on a subway?” I go, “I’m indifferent to it. We need a place to shoot anyway. We have no money.” And that became “Subway Takes.”\nIn the first episode, my friend Anthony, who’s also a cameraman on the show, talks about vertical video being the bane of society. And I go, “A hundred per cent disagree.” Because we live in a polarized culture where there’s no gray area. You can’t be a maybe. So this is a fun way to disagree and agree about the dumbest things in the world. I kept saying, “Dumb show for smart people.”\nA guy came on yesterday and said, “Smoking is actually O.K.” And I go, “A hundred per cent disagree.” My dad died from lung cancer. And then people in the comments, some dumb people are, like, “He obviously hasn’t read the research.” I’m, like, “Shut the fuck up. He’s doing a bit.”\nIt’s funny that that was your first vertical video on “Subway Takes,” and “Video Killed the Radio Star” was the first MTV video.\nThat is really cool. I never thought about that.\nDo you find that everyone has a take?\nEveryone has a take. Oftentimes, people are, like, “I want to be on your show so bad, but I don’t have a hot take.” And I always go, “It doesn’t have to be hot.” In fact, the more mundane it is, the better.\nI was wondering what my take would be, and I was thinking, because we were at a coffee shop, that mine would be “Decaf coffee is a perfectly legitimate coffee order.”\nOne hundred per cent disagree.\nTo be clear, I order cold brew every morning. Regular cold brew. But caffeine is a very serious drug.\nCaffeine is good.\nCaffeine is good, but what if you don’t want more of it?\nDrink Diet Coke.\nWhat if I want the taste of delicious coffee? What if I want my favorite beverage in the world without a fucking heart attack and manic episode?\nIt doesn’t taste the same.\nWhat if I just want to have some milk in my coffee, go to sleep, and have a nice time? Why do I have to have the methamphetamine?\nI think that’s a nice dream, but—\nIt’s not a dream, it’s scientific reality!\nIt’s not thirst-quenching.\nIt’s a nice taste.\nWhy not have a digestif?\nSee, here’s the thing—I actually don’t care at all, but I think disagreeing is more interesting than agreeing. I’m just trying to make the conversation better. Because otherwise it would be, like, “Men shouldn’t use the internet,” and I go, “A hundred per cent agree,” and we’re done. But if I put myself in the place of: I’m a man. I’m gonna be fucking angry about this.\nThen you have a point of view.\nI’m not always playing myself. My opinions on the show are not actually—there’s no journalistic integrity. Somebody called me a journalist once. A journalist called me a journalist, on Twitter. And I go, “I’m literally an idiot. I’m a jester. For you, as a journalist, to call me a journalist is an insult to you.”\nTheo Von has had hours of access to the Vice-President and the President of the United States. I don’t think that makes Theo Von a journalist, but does it give him some kind of—responsibility is a heavy word, but you can understand why there are people who are, like, “You’re sitting with J. D. Vance, why don’t you ask him a fucking real question?”\nYeah, I have thought about that. Because I generally say no to most people. I think the difference is a lot of these podcasts are built on talent.\nTalent meaning which guests you can book?\nYes. And that was a big discussion in the beginning of “Subway Takes.” “How do we make it bigger? We need to book more talent.” I go, “No, you don’t understand—the talent doesn’t matter.”\nWhat matters is the actual meaning of the word “talent,” not the euphemism for celebrity.\nYeah. It’s just not names. [But each episode of Von’s show] is built on a big name. I don’t know what his process is for booking guests, or what his motivation is for booking guests, and I don’t know how he or any of these big-name podcasters—is he a comedian or is he a podcaster? I don’t even know if he does standup. In general, he’s an entertainer, right? I consider him in the same bucket as me.\nIt’s a really interesting case study. I mean, he’ll have J. D. Vance on, and then he’ll also be, like, “Gaza is a genocide.”\nI don’t know if he has politics. I think it’s issue by issue. Maybe he is not recognizing his power. I think also the scrutiny that comes with establishing yourself as a liberal or a Democrat is a lot more stressful than establishing yourself as nothing, or as right-leaning. Maybe in his heart of hearts Theo Von is a fucking matcha-carrying Democrat, but he doesn’t want to have that level of criticism and scrutiny and this watchful Big Brother eye.\nWhat kind of scrutiny are you thinking of?\nLet’s just use Joe Rogan as an example, because he’s the biggest one. He’s, like, “I talk to everyone,” and his politics are really confusing, because he’s, like, “I like Bernie, but I’m voting for Trump”—but whatever, because he’s not a leftist. He doesn’t care if people are mad at him.\nI see what you mean. He doesn’t have to be a member of good standing in the tribe.\nSometimes I’m, like, Shit, maybe they were right back then, [when people said that] you shouldn’t talk about religion or politics, unless it’s to your close personal friend. I grew up hearing that, but not understanding what it means. Who’s arguing about religion? Maybe back then they were. Like, in the nineties, you’d be, like, “I’m Jewish,” and somebody would be, like, “That’s the wrong one”?\nI always thought of it as doctrinal debates within Christianity.\nOh, I don’t know anything about those people.\nLike, “you have to be baptized in this way at this age.”\nOh, so maybe that was a Christian rule.\nYeah, Jews argue about everything all the time. That rule would never stand with us.\nThat’s so fucking funny.\nSo this is where I want to talk about Zohran Mamdani, and also about the Kamala Harris thing. Because the fact that guys like Theo Von slid so easily from “I’m apolitical” to “Oh, I’m obviously MAGA”—the fact that that was the default path for them is a huge problem for the country, and it’s partly how we arrived on the doorstep of authoritarianism. What happened with Harris on your show—sounding focus-grouped, not coming across as authentic…\nIt’s literally “Veep.”\nSo what do you think the Democrats’ problem is?\nThe Democratic establishment does not want to change politics. They just want to win. Or they want to lose. They’re O.K. winning and they’re O.K. losing, but they’re not O.K. listening to the people. I mean, it is remarkable that the working-class party is Republicans. And that Zohran, the scary communist socialist, is the alternative to the Republican working-class party, and he is villainized by the Democratic establishment.\nThe Democrats are afraid of their own people, whereas the Republicans are, like, “I’ll say whatever the fuck I want.” And then there’s Kirsten Gillibrand jumping on the bandwagon and being, like, “This guy promotes jihad.” It’s so weird to me. It’s also untrue. But it’s also just really weird. To throw it back in their faces: they’re weird.\nThere’s a lot more there that I want to ask you about. But we should also talk about your new movie.\nYeah, the movie is really special. It was written before “Keep the Meter Running” or “Subway Takes.” Which is funny, because the movie is a bunch of takes, and part of it takes place on the subway.\nYeah. At one point, you literally say, “One hundred per cent agree.”\nSo fucking funny. I don’t remember that, but that’s so funny. I think it’s a powerful story about a single-serving friendship. That’s what I call it. I had an experience once where I was at Joseph Leonard in the West Village, having a really bad day—maybe a bad weekend even, or maybe a bad week. And so I went there alone, brought a copy of the newspaper with me. It was a Sunday. And this old lady ended up sitting next to me, and we hit it off, and we ended up going to the MOMA together, spending the whole day together. We went to the Tea Room. Eight hours, ten hours. And then I didn’t get her number, and we never saw each other again. That’s what I call a single-serving friendship, and they’re beautiful.\nI wanted to make a movie like “La Haine.” Do you know that movie? It’s a French film starring Vincent Cassel. It all takes place in one day.\nSo you want to be able to make Vincent Cassel movies, but you also want to be able to do vertical, short-form content.\nYeah. And I think you have to. There are a lot of people in my position that want to be movie stars. And there’s a lot of movie stars that want to—honestly, if I were Amy Poehler, would I want to make a podcast? Probably not. But there’s this thing where they want to be us and we want to be them. And so I’ve settled on the idea of, Well, I’m just gonna do both.\nAmy Poehler’s podcast is called “Good Hang,” and that kind of ties it together. To be a politician, to be a celebrity, whatever—you need to be good at the thing you’re doing, but you also need to be a good hang.\nDid you ever hear about the beer test?\n“Who would you rather have a beer with?”\nYeah. That’s a good test.\nNot very inclusive of Muslims, like a bacon take.\n[Laughs.] True.\nAlso, Donald Trump doesn’t drink beer. George W. Bush doesn’t drink beer. But, still, that’s the person you would rather have a Heineken 0.0 with. George W. Bush used to be a party guy, and people like a party guy.\nThey really do. Cuomo could win if he was more of a party guy. But he’s a stiff.\nI actually met him. I was at a party for the Tribeca Film Festival. I judged a category this year, and I ran into him. It was right before the primary. And he was like [Cuomo voice]: “What’s with the Mandani thing, anyway?” I go, “Dude, can I be frank with you? He’s young, and you guys are old.” I was trying to be nice, actually—that was the nice version.\nYou didn’t say he groped a bunch of women and killed a bunch of grandmas.\nNo. I didn’t. I was just, like, This is funny, he doesn’t know who I am. He probably thinks I’m a fucking busboy.\nIt was the day after the debate. I was, like, “Hey, I watched the debate yesterday. You did an all right job. Zohran did a great job.”\nAnd he’s, like, “Yeah, but he doesn’t understand, New York City has two hundred thousand employees”—and in my mind I’m just, like, This is the fucking problem. Yes, it is a really hard job, but it’s not impossible. And guess what? You’re gonna do a worse job.\nI started telling him, “We used to like young people in this country. Obama was young. Kennedy was young, but they shot him.” I said that to his face. Trump, Biden, Bernie. What the fuck is happening? Why is everyone eighty? I was, like, “It’s time for something new and cool and interesting.” And he was, like, “I’m not worried.” I was, like, “All right. I wish you the best of luck.” And then, two days later, I published the Zohran episode of “Subway Takes.” ♦","summary":"The “entertainer” Kareem Rahma discusses Kamala Harris’s missed opportunity on his show, meeting Andrew Cuomo, and why disagreement is more fun.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-creator-of-subway-takes-one-hundred-per-cent-disagrees","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68a88bc0088f4701290579cd/16:9/w_1984,h_1116,c_limit/Marantz-Kareem-Rahma-Dean-Majd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-24 10:00:00","author":"Andrew Marantz","authors":["Andrew Marantz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":353776530,"title":"Hispanic Voters Are Turning Against Donald Trump: Polls","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump faces a sharp erosion of support among Hispanic voters, according to new polling that shows his approval sinking to its lowest point of his second term.A Reuters survey released this week put Trump's support among Hispanic voters at just 32 percent, the weakest level recorded since his return to the White House.The decline is mirrored in the latest YouGov/Economist poll, which shows Hispanic respondents breaking 28 percent approve to 68 percent disapprove. That marks a steep drop from 35/65 in July, underscoring a month-to-month slide in Trump's standing with a voting bloc that was critical to his victory over former President Joe Biden last year.Data from SoCal Strategies underscores the trend: Hispanic disapproval of Trump has surged from 36 percent in January to 52 percent in August, a dramatic shift in just seven months.Why It MattersSince at least the 1960s, Hispanic voters in the U.S. have generally supported Democratic candidates. According to Pew Research Center, about 71 percent of the bloc supported former President Barack Obama in 2012 and 66 percent backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, 63 percent chose Biden, according to AP VoteCast.In 2024, however, Trump made significant gains. His support among Hispanic voters rose to 43 percent—an increase of 8 points from 2020 and the highest level for a Republican presidential candidate since such data has been tracked. Fifty-five percent supported former Vice President Kamala Harris, narrowing the Democratic advantage.But recent polling suggests Trump's momentum with Hispanics is fading.Trump's Immigration Crackdown Draws Backlash Among HispanicsClarissa Martínez de Castro, vice president for the UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative, told Newsweek that Trump's immigration crackdown is undermining his standing with Hispanic voters.\"Steve Miller, Tom Homan and Kristi Noem have succeeded where others have failed—their indiscriminate assault on America's immigrants, rife with abuse of power, is eroding Trump's approval numbers, and not just with Hispanics,\" Martínez said.Since beginning his second term, Trump has dramatically escalated immigration enforcement. His administration has launched mass deportation operations, revived thousands of old cases and increased raids in sanctuary cities. Federal funding for detention has surged, with $45 billion allocated to expand U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities and construct sprawling detention camps, including a controversial Florida site dubbed Alligator Alcatraz.Polling suggests these policies are fueling anxiety and political backlash among Hispanic communities. A March Pew Research survey found that 42 percent of Hispanic adults worried they or someone close to them could be deported—far higher than the general population. YouGov/Economist polling shows Hispanic approval of Trump's immigration approach stalled at 33 percent, while disapproval has risen from 64 percent in July to 66 percent in August. In the same survey, 61 percent of Hispanic respondents described Trump's approach as \"too harsh.\"SoCal Strategies polling echoes the divide. In August, 42 percent of Hispanics disapproved of Trump's immigration policies compared with 47 percent in favor. Broader sentiment points to resistance of the administration's agenda—65 percent of Hispanics backed automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants in January, while 41 percent opposed full-scale deportations.Trump has pushed aggressively on both fronts. In January, he signed an executive order seeking to end automatic birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The order attempts to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause, which for generations has guaranteed citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.Economic Ripples in Hispanic CommunitiesBeyond politics, the administration's hard-line enforcement is rippling through the economy. The Financial Times reported that heightened deportation fears, combined with rising living costs, have led to a pullback in Hispanic consumer spending. Companies like Colgate-Palmolive and Constellation Brands, the maker of Modelo beer, have seen sales fall in border states, with Constellation cutting growth forecasts as a result. Retailers like Walmart and Shoe Carnival also report weaker spending among low-income Hispanic shoppers. Analysts say the combination of inflation and immigration enforcement is driving many undocumented immigrants out of public life and dampening economic participation.The timing is especially sensitive as the broader economy shows signs of strain. Inflation climbed to 2.7 percent in June, despite Trump's campaign promise to \"end inflation on day one.\" Job growth slowed sharply in July, with just 73,000 jobs added, down from 147,000 the month before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Hispanics, who have contributed more than 30 percent of U.S. gross domestic product growth since 2019 and command an estimated $2.4 trillion in buying power, remain vulnerable to these pressures. Census data shows Hispanic households earn about $65,500 in median income—far below the $93,900 average for white households—while Federal Reserve figures indicate 17 percent face instability from fluctuating earnings. The community is also heavily concentrated in blue-collar, service and construction jobs that are highly sensitive to inflation, high interest rates and immigration policy shifts.Polling underscores the tension. In August, 24 percent of Hispanics identified the economy as their most important issue, with 16 percent citing inflation and 15 percent pointing to immigration.Yet despite widespread concern, there are small signs of improving sentiment. YouGov/Economist surveys show Trump's economic approval among Hispanics rising from 33 percent in July to 35 percent in August, while disapproval dropped from 64 percent to 61 percent. Views on inflation also improved slightly, with disapproval falling from 69 percent to 62 percent. And perceptions of personal finances ticked upward, with approval rising from 9 percent to 14 percent.A SoCal Strategies poll in August found 48 percent of Hispanics said the economy was getting better, compared with 26 percent who said it was getting worse and 20 percent who saw no change.Still, Martínez argues, the damage from Trump's enforcement agenda is overshadowing any modest economic gains. \"The president said he would deport criminals, yet his trio of executors are going after immigrant workers, arresting the parents of U.S. citizens taking their children to school, jailing people dutifully reporting to appointments with immigration authorities, and militarizing American cities,\" she said. \"The promise was order—what people are witnessing is chaos, intimidation, and abuse of power.\"","summary":"Donald Trump faces a sharp erosion of support among Hispanic voters, according to new polling.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls-hispanics-2117009","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2705955/hispanic-voters.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=68fd48aa87cd4d90fa4134b74ecf8ea8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-24 08:00:03","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":353709676,"title":"FBI Conducts Early Morning Raid at John Bolton’s Residence in Major Investigation Over Classified Documents","text":"SHOCKING footage has captured federal agents storming the home of former National Security Advisor John Bolton as part of a high-profile probe.\n\nThe FBI swarmed the Maryland property in a reported search for classified documents on Friday morning.\n\nAt 76, John Bolton served in the first Trump administration from 2018 to 2019, but clashed with the president over foreign policy views, leading to his dismissal.\n\nThe Republican sparked controversy with his 2020 book The Room Where It Happened, which Trump criticized as a threat to national security.\n\nRecently, brightly dressed FBI agents raided the former advisor’s Bethesda, Maryland home, searching for documents that may have been improperly stored, as reported by Fox News.\n\nThe feds showed up at 7 am, and Bolton was reportedly in the home when they arrived. Later, they went to his office in Washington DC.\n\nBolton was seen returning to his home at around 2:30 pm and was permitted to enter the residence.\n\nWhen asked about the raid, Trump told reporters that he didn’t know anything and had just seen the news that morning.\n\n“I’m not a fan of John Bolton. He’s really kind of a lowlife,” remarked Trump, donned in a “Trump Was Right About Everything” cap, later in the day.\n\n“He was one of the people who forced Bush to do the ridiculous bombings in the Middle East.\n\n“He wants to always kill people.”\n\nTrump said that he would likely be briefed on the situation later that day.\n\nBolton is under investigation for allegedly leaking sensitive national security details to the press to undermine Trump’s image, according to a senior federal law enforcement source quoted by the New York Times.\n\nInvestigators are looking into his actions over the last four years, and not just the claims that were published in his book, the official said.\n\nEERIE WARNING\n\nAnticipation was stirred by cryptic posts from Trump’s cabinet prior to the raid. FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted, “NO ONE is above the law … @FBI agents on mission,” although he did not directly reference Bolton.\n\nMeanwhile, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino reshared the post with the comment, “Public corruption will not be tolerated.”\n\nAnd Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X, “America’s safety isn’t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”\n\nBolton has been in Trump’s sightline since a judge permitted the memoir to be published, despite the president’s Justice Department trying to block it.\n\nIn the book, Bolton accused his former boss of intervening with law enforcement and having an unfair influence on federal agencies.\n\nHe also made damning claims about Trump’s relationship with foreign officials, saying at one point that Trump begged China’s President Xi Jinping to support his second bid for the presidency.\n\nTrump’s first administration opened a probe into Bolton at the end of his term, but Joe Biden’s administration stopped investigating when the Republican was ousted.\n\nSome senior government officials felt that the dropped investigation was politically motivated, according to Fox News.\n\nTENSIONS MOUNT\n\nWhen Trump was reelected, he started the probe back up with a fresh motivation to target politicians who, he feels, hindered progress in his first term.\n\nOne of his first moves after returning to office was to strip Bolton of federal protections stemming from the former advisor’s fraught relationship with Iran.\n\nIn recent days, Bolton has been outspoken with his criticism of how Trump is handling the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday morning, about 30 minutes after federal agents stormed his home, Bolton wrote on X, “Russia has not changed its goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. \n\n“Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede territory it already holds and the remainder of Donetsk, which it has been unable to conquer. Zelensky will never do so. \n\n“Meanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don’t see these talks making any progress.”\n\nWhen Trump explained why he removed Bolton’s security privilege, he described his former advisor as a “very dumb person.”\n\n“But I used him well because every time people saw me come into a meeting with John Bolton standing behind me, they thought that he’d attack them because he was a warmonger,” he said.\n\nBOLTON’S HISTORY\n\nBolton has served under four Republican presidents. In the Reagan Administration, he worked as Assistant Administrator of USAID for Program and Policy Coordination, and in the Office for Legislative Affairs..\n\nHe went on to serve as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs between May 1989 and January 1993, when George H.W.

Apparently, being a Democrat is one of them. It’s perhaps less evident when a Democrat is in the White House, because the media will lie and engage in deflective hand-waving to cover up for them on a daily basis. But with Donald Trump as president of the United States, facts blow C-4-sized holes in the American Left’s narratives on a daily basis.\n\nTake Trump’s tariffs, for example. We were told by “experts” that tariffs were going to cause major international incidents and create massive inflation.\n\nThe major international incidents haven’t materialized, as most nations facing increased import tariffs on their goods have entered into updated trade agreements. In July alone, Trump’s tariffs brought in $29.6 billion. So far for fiscal year 2025 (measured from October of last year to today), the U.S. has received an estimated $156.4 billion. And inflation, which increased dramatically under the administration of Joe Biden, decreased to a four-year low earlier this summer.\n\nAnd then there’s immigration. Democrats have simultaneously claimed that the border under former President Biden was “secure” (riiiiight – securely open, that it would be impossible to eliminate illegal border crossings without action by Congress, and that immigrants here illegally pose no threat to American citizens.\n\nWrong, wrong and wrong.\n\nTrump’s closure of the southern border, his enforcement of immigration laws, arrest and deportation of illegals who have committed crimes here in the U.S. have had dramatic results: July 2025 had the lowest number of illegal border crossings in the history of Customs and Border Protection, with zero illegal aliens released into the United States for the third month in a row. Approximately 100,000 illegals have been deported (in addition to those who are detained or incarcerated). And it’s been estimated that around a million illegal immigrants have self-deported.\n\nIn addition to illegal immigration’s association with job losses, violent crime, and drug and human trafficking, this week’s headlines brought new problems to the public’s attention. Harjinder Singh, an illegal immigrant from India, was issued a commercial (truck) driver’s license in California, despite failing the required English proficiency test: Singh could answer only two of 12 questions correctly, and properly identified only one traffic sign. On Aug. 12, Singh made an illegal left turn while driving a semi on the Florida turnpike, killing three people in a vehicle that struck his trailer. He has since been arrested and charged with three counts of vehicular homicide. But Americans are asking: Why was an illegal alien issued a CDL in the first place?\n\nDemocrats are just as wrong about Trump’s foreign policy pushes. While they have been shrieking for years that Trump was going to get America into disastrous wars, Trump has actually taken a leading role in resolving international conflicts, including brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, ending a border dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, obtaining a commitment to a future peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and hosting meetings between leaders of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo that resulted in a peace agreement.\n\nMost recently, Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, seeking an end to the bloody war between Russia and Ukraine. Just days later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Trump at the White House, joined by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen – a gathering that even news organizations like NBC described as “historic” and “a rare display of trans-Atlantic unity.”\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump will be able to parlay that unity – along with his famous “Art of the Deal” skills – into an actual peace between Putin and Zelenskyy. And while Trump is being just as persistent about ending the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, that conflict seems even more intractable than the one between Russia and Ukraine. Trump’s critics slammed his earlier statements about developing Gaza into a Mediterranean resort area. And naysayers are quick to point out that even where agreements have been obtained with other countries’ disputes, they are fragile, and serious issues remain in each case to be addressed. But those criticisms miss two vital points: First, virtually any agreement between nations that have been at war is fragile, at least initially. And second, Trump is using his power and influence to try to bring about peace. Why isn’t it preferable to have a president who wants to see entrepreneurship, business creation and economic development? Better that than the kinds of “profits” that come from pursuing “nation-building,” funding covert ops run by the CIA, or the sale of hundreds of billions of dollars in munitions and materiel, which results in devastation and death while making weapons manufacturers insanely wealthy.\n\nIt’s obvious not only that Democrats are wrong about a good many of Trump’s policy initiatives but that they know they’re wrong. They seem to have no economic message, to be defenders of surveillance and multinational corporations, and to be more interested in protecting the “rights” of illegal aliens and criminals than those of American citizens, workers and families.\n\nJames Carville, longtime Democratic strategist, appeared on Jesse Watters’ show on Fox News earlier this week. Carville, never at a loss for words, could not answer a single question Watters posed – including why notable Democratic Party politicians like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom have refused to appear on left-leaning talk-show host Bill Maher’s show. Instead, Carville mouthed banal platitudes about how the Democrats were going to sweep in 2026 and would have a great presidential candidate in 2028. How and who, Carville didn’t – or couldn’t – say.\n\nYou know it’s bad when even Carville doesn’t have an explanation for the current dismal state of the Democratic Party and can’t advocate for a single Democratic National Committee policy platform.","summary":"'With Donald Trump as president of the United States, facts blow C-4-sized holes in the American Left's narratives'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/08/every-days-news-proves-democrats-wrong/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/james-carville-20240428-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 22:00:32","author":"Laura Hollis","authors":["Laura Hollis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":353670452,"title":"Detroiters largely stand by Biden over Trump when comparing presidencies","text":"Detroit residents spoke with Fox News Digital this month about whether President Donald Trump or former President Joe Biden provided them a better life, and the results skewed toward the latter. Not too far from Pontiac, Fox News Digital spoke with voters in the heart of downtown Detroit, the seat of deep-blue Wayne County that went heavily for Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020 and 2024. Jayla, a graphic design intern currently in college, said that her life was better under Biden, who won Michigan narrowly in 2020 en route to ousting Trump from the White House. DR. OZ TOUTS INVESTMENT IN MEDICAID: 'I'M TRYING TO SAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL PROGRAM' \"Biden, especially with being a Type 1 Diabetic. I think his medical plans have kind of served me for better, whereas on the other side, I've kind of been actually going through it as a college student,\" Jayla said. \"Of course, Trump!\" Ronald, a native of Detroit suburb Livonia, told Fox News Digital. \"Just take a look at the economy. I don't want to go into the rest because you don't want to be canceled,\" Ronald said. \"I would say Biden,\" said Joseph, a Detroit native and quality management professional. \"Although people like to bring up the fact that things are so inflated, it also is due to the nature where we are currently as a society.\" Mary, an educator, was accompanying Joseph while walking through downtown Detroit. She said that her life was better under Biden because her student loans were forgiven. \"I had like six figures of student loans. So that definitely was a big help for me financially,\" Mary said. TRUMP TO UNVEIL NEW MAHA INITIATIVES AT 'MAKE HEALTH TECH GREAT AGAIN' WHITE HOUSE EVENT Josie, a Detroit native and social worker, raised concerns about Trump's changes to Medicaid through The One Big Beautiful Bill Act he signed into law last month. \"Biden, with the cuts that are happening to Medicaid and all of that stuff, it's making my work hard. It's impacting our community negatively, and a lot of people are going to need increased resources and all that, and we're having trouble finding even anybody, any social workers to do a job because there's no money,\" Josie said. PJ, a clothing maker, said that his life was better under Biden. \"Biden by far. I'm not a fan of either of them. I have to go with Biden,\" PJ said. \"A lot of these politicians, they don't really care about us, so it's kind of like, it's the same thing under different people,\" he added. Trump improved significantly on his showing in Wayne County in 2024 from four years earlier, as he captured Michigan and won the presidency over Harris. While he still lost the county by nearly 29 points, it was a far better showing than the 38-point defeat he took there in 2020, and he was able to more than make up the ground needed in the rest of the state.

However, those margins remain slim, making next year's midterms vital for both parties as they vie for control during one of the most tense and fraught political periods in recent memory.Democrats will look to secure Congress and reverse some of the policies the president has enacted upon taking office, while Republicans are keen to retain power and extend those policy wins for Trump and the GOP alike.Why It MattersRepublicans currently have 53 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate and 219 of the 538 seats in the House of Representatives, where four seats remain vacant at this time.Historically, the first midterm for a president sees his party lose seats, which Trump witnessed during his first term.As Trump is a non-consecutive two term president, it will prove difficult to know if he can expect similar drops next year. However, he has taken no chances and is looking to secure any advantage he can, which includes Texas and other Republican-controlled states redistricting ahead of the midterms.Meanwhile, California has retaliated against Texas by proposing to redistrict its congressional map in a similar measure.What To KnowGrassroots campaigns like the 2018 election that saw Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, secure her seat and the 2025 Democratic mayoral primary that saw longshot candidate Zohran Mamdani upset establishment favorite Andrew Cuomo, a former governor of New York, the question remains how valuable fundraising will be as a metric in future elections.Former Vice President Kamala Harris outspent Trump by millions of dollars in last year's presidential election and still lost.However, political analysts have long relied on fundraising as an indication of enthusiasm for each party and the level of reach and voter penetration candidates have achieved.Democrats saw huge fundraising margins ahead of the 2018 and 2022 midterms, both of which proved successful for the party as they first took power back from Republicans in the first Trump term and then held off a much-prophesized \"Red Wave\" during the Biden administration to keep margins slim for the Republican majority.At the top level, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is struggling to build a war chest in the face of Republican dominance, according to Politico, with the DNC raising around $15 million by the end of June as compared to the Republican National Committee (RNC) with $80 million.Politico found that major Democratic donors have held back from donating in the aftermath of Trump's dominant win, and have failed to generate enthusiasm among small-dollar donors, leading to the lowest funding level for the DNC at any point in the last five years.Who Is Leading Fundraising in the Senate?Once again the Democrats are seeing an advantage in fundraising, according to FEC data. The Democratic Senate candidates have collectively raised $159.7 million compared to Republican Senate candidates, who have raised $131.9 million.Those numbers in isolation only tell a part of the story. The top 10 Senate candidates by fundraising are evenly split between both parties, with the significant bulk of fundraising directed towards Senators Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Cory Booker of New Jersey.Ossoff lost a special election for Georgia's 6th Congressional district in 2020 but went on to win a Senate seat later that year. Georgia's near-toss up nature in the most recent elections has made it a vital state for both parties, with Ossoff raising just under $42 million, which comprises around 25 percent of the total money raised by Senate Democrats.Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina leads Republican fundraising with $17.3 million—significantly more than the second-highest fundraiser, Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who has raised $11.3 million.Joshua Joseph Weil, a Democratic candidate from Florida, had to withdraw from the race due to medical concerns, but he had outraised all Republicans aside from Graham.For Democrats, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, who announced a Senate bid for this coming term, round out their numbers in the top 10.For Republicans, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Senator John Cornyn of Texas round out their numbers in the top 10. Cornyn, who has the least money raised in the top 10, has raised just over $8 million.Who Is Leading Fundraising in the House of Representatives?Fundraising in the House is much closer, with Democrats still in the lead but by half of the advantage their Senate colleagues have. Democrats lead fundraising with just over $219.5 million compared to Republicans, who have raised just under $210 million.The House Democrats also have a little more share of the top 10 fundraisers overall, with Ocasio-Cortez leading the charge with $15.4 million raised, outstripping Representative Ro Khanna of California and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, with over double their individual efforts, which have each totaled a little over $6 million.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana tops the Republican fundraisers with just under $8.7 million raised, again almost double the next-most raised, which is by Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who has raised just under $4.7 million.Other notable members of the top 10 include Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat, with just over $3.8 million, and Representative Young Kim, a California Republican, who has raised the least in the top 10 with just under $3.3 million.","summary":"The Republicans hold slim majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, and the RNC has outraised the DNC after Trump's commanding win.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/midterms-fundraising-politicians-rake-cash-elections-democrats-republicans-2118259","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708549/washington-dc-capitol-fundraising-republicans-democrats.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=8143fa892fa11cea2c5c5c55a4437870","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 20:51:44","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":353707378,"title":"Kamala Harris Launches Book Tour for \"107 Days\" Reflecting on Presidential Campaign Journey","text":"It's been nearly 12 months since Kamala Harris bowed out of the political spotlight after her presidential bid, and now she's poised to step back into the public's gaze with her new memoir, \"107 Days.\" The book promises to delve into her \"intense, high-stakes and deeply personal\" experience during the 2024 campaign. As the San Francisco Chronicle reports, Harris' book tour, encompassing a cross-country trek plus stops in London and Toronto, will launch on September 24 in New York and close out in Miami on November 20.\n\nThe former vice president and Oakland native is not just stopping at any locations. She’s strategically partnering with independently owned bookstores for the tour. When she arrives in the Bay Area on October 5, she'll engage with her audience at the Masonic in an event with Book Passage, celebrated by many locals. \"During these special events, Harris will share what she saw, what she learned, and what it will take to move forward,\" according to the Ticketmaster listing, per the San Francisco Chronicle. In a year where politics has seen its fair share of drama and division, the tour could signal Harris' insights into her brief run as a would-be leader of the free world.\n\nWith presale tickets already scooped up since yesterday, diverse crowds of politicos, supporters, and the politically curious will soon gather, wielding included copies of the book as their ticket. Harris notes in the Instagram post where she announced the tour, \"107 Days is my candid and personal account of the shortest presidential campaign in modern history.\" She reveals an intent to hit the road to \"share behind-the-scenes moments, lessons learned, and how we keep moving forward together.\"\n\n\"Since leaving office, I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on those days and with candor and reflection, I’ve written a behind-the-scenes account of that journey,\" Harris said in a video announcement in July, hinting at both closure and a continued stake in the political game. Despite declaring she won’t be running for governor of California in 2026, she did tease the possibility of another shot at the White House in 2028. \"For now, my leadership — and public service — will not be in elected office,\" as Harris explained and quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle, expressing a commitment to \"listening to the American people\" and helping Democrats nationally.\n\nThe 107 Days tour will also revisit cherished moments, perhaps the seeds of future ambition. As announced on the book's official Simon & Schuster page, Harris doesn't intend for the book to be a mere recap of her campaign, but rather a \"candid and personal account of my journey.\"","summary":"Kamala Harris releases a memoir about her 2024 campaign, with a book tour starting in New York and includes international stops.","url":"https://hoodline.com/2025/08/kamala-harris-launches-book-tour-for-107-days-reflecting-on-presidential-campaign-journey/","image":"https://img.hoodline.com/2025/8/kamala-harris-launches-book-tour-for-107-days-reflecting-on-presidential-campaign-journey-4.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 19:43:45","author":"Nina Singh-Hudson","authors":["Nina Singh-Hudson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.467},{"id":353673606,"title":"Fresh off Texas Senate’s approval, new congressional map is target of lawsuit","text":"Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nHours after the Texas Senate approved a new congressional map early Saturday morning that more heavily favors Republicans — legislation Gov. Greg Abbott plans to “swiftly” sign into law — a lawsuit against the governor was filed, alleging that the redrawn districts are racially discriminatory.\n\nThe 67-page complaint against Abbott and Secretary of State Jane Nelson supplements legal action filed by LULAC in 2021 challenging the state’s original maps and argues that redrawing districts mid-decade is unconstitutional.\n\nRedistricting usually happens at the start of the decade after U.S. census data comes out. The complaint argues that because the new map was drawn based on the same data used for the initial map passed by the Legislature in 2021, the measure was a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.\n\n“Even if racial and partisan considerations are an unavoidable part of redistricting, there is no need for legislatures to take those considerations into account a second time in a single decade,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe complaint, which is expected to be followed by others targeting House Bill 4, was filed by two law firms on behalf of 13 Texas residents collectively called “the Gonzales plaintiffs.” The bulk of their argument is that the new congressional map “dismantles majority-minority districts” by prioritizing Republican representation in Congress.\n\nAbbott’s office has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nOn the Senate floor Friday, Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford who carried HB 4 in the upper chamber, said the plan “meets the critically important goals of legality, of political performance for Republicans and of improved compactness,” and that he did not consider racial population data while crafting it.\n\nRepublicans pushed for the new map with their eyes set on gaining five more seats in Congress after pressure from President Donald Trump, who wants to preserve the GOP’s slim U.S. House majority in the 2026 midterms. But the complaint says that effort came at the cost of Latino and Black communities, which have largely supported Democratic candidates.\n\nThe new lines squeeze more Democratic voters in Houston and Dallas into districts the minority party already controls — a strategy known as “packing.” The Republican-backed map also “cracks” left-leaning communities by splitting voters who supported Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024 into Republican districts, according to an analysis by The Texas Tribune.\n\nThe complaint was filed by two law firms, The Law Office of Max Raena Hicks and the Elias Law Group, the firm of prominent Democratic attorney Marc Elias. They also allege that the new maps violate the Voting Rights Act for not creating enough Latino-majority districts to match the growth of Texas’ Latino population.\n\nFor example, the complaint points to Harris County, where the new map carves out only one district that’s majority Latino, although the county is nearly half Latino, according to the latest U.S. census.\n\nThe census also confirmed that Latinos make up the largest share of Texas’ population, and that Texans of color made up 95% of the state’s population growth in the last decade — but that’s not reflected in the new congressional map, the complaint alleges.\n\nWith the new district lines, the lawsuit charges, lawmakers are “intentionally destroying majority-minority districts and replacing them with majority-Anglo districts.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have waged a lively battle to fend off the GOP’s proposed map since Abbott announced that the first special session in July would include redistricting. House Democrats fled the state halfway through the first session, breaking the lower chamber’s quorum and halting all operations. But the members returned to Austin at the start of the second session.\n\nAnd on Friday, state Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, signaled her intention to filibuster the map well into Saturday. Republicans, however, ended the debate on HB 4, killing her effort. Lawmakers also listened to hours of hearings from Texans across the state who pleaded with them to leave their districts alone.\n\nThe complaint and others that are sure to follow are a sign that Democrats and civil rights groups will continue to fight the implementation of the maps ahead of the 2026 election.\n\nThe National Redistricting Foundation, which brought LULAC’s initial lawsuit, is also directing this new case.\n\n“Texas’s existing map already dilutes the voting power of communities of color,” Marina Jenkins, the foundation’s executive director, said in a news release.\n\n“In spite of that, the state has doubled down with an even more extreme racial gerrymander that goes even further to pack and crack communities of color and minimize the number of congressional districts where minority voters have the ability to elect candidates of their choice,” she later said. “The court has already agreed to consider expediting this case, and we are confident that justice will be delivered for Texans.”\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15! This year’s lineup just got even more exciting with the addition of State Rep.

(This is sometimes called “ballot harvesting” by opponents of the practice and it is currently illegal in about half of states.)\n\n56% oppose removing people from registration lists if they haven’t voted recently or responded to efforts to confirm their registration and address.\n\nAutomatic voter registration, same-day registration, early voting and voting by mail\n\nIn addition to making in-person early voting available for two weeks and mail-in voting available to any registered voter who wants it, about six-in-ten Americans favor automatic voter registration for eligible citizens (59%) and same-day voter registration (58%).\n\nAs has long been the case, there is more support for each of these proposals among Democrats than Republicans.\n\n77% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans support automatic voter registration.\n\nSimilarly, 72% of Democrats and 43% of Republicans favor allowing registration at the polls on Election Day.\n\nThe partisan gap over in-person early voting is narrower, and support has grown among Republicans since last year. Today, majorities in both parties (89% of Democrats, 71% of Republicans) favor at least two weeks of early, in-person voting.\n\nIn contrast, there is a wide gap of 51 percentage points in partisans’ support for mail-in voting. And this gap is substantially wider than it was five years ago – the result of a steep drop in support among Republicans.\n\nIn April 2020, during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, 70% of Americans favored allowing any voter who wanted to cast a ballot via mail to do so. This included nearly half of Republicans (49%) and nearly nine-in-ten Democrats (87%).\n\nNow, 58% of Americans support allowing voters to cast ballots by mail, including 32% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats.\n\nVoting by mail is more widespread today than it was before the pandemic, though the share of voters who cast their ballots in person in 2024 was greater than the share who did so in the pandemic election of 2020. According to Pew Research Center’s study of validated voters, voters in the 2024 presidential election were roughly equally likely to have voted in person on Election Day (34%), early in person (32%) or by mail (34%).\n\nTrump voters were more likely to vote in person on Election Day (38% of his voters did so) than voters who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris (29%).\n\nVoting by mail and state election rules\n\nWhile support for no-excuse absentee voting is strongly associated with party, both Republicans and Democrats living in states where mail-in voting is more common are more likely to support the practice than those living in states where absentee and mail-in voting is more restricted.\n\nIn states with universal mail-in voting – like California, Colorado and Nevada, where ballots are mailed to all voters before the election – 73% favor allowing any voter to vote by mail, including 91% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans.\n\nIn states where voters can request an absentee ballot for any reason, but ballots aren’t automatically sent to them – like Florida, New York and Pennsylvania – 58% favor allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail.\n\nSupport for mail-in voting is lowest in states where voters can only cast a mail ballot if they have a valid excuse. (For example, in Texas, excuses include being 65 years of age or older, illness or disability, or a legitimate reason for being out of one’s home county on Election Day.) In these states, 45% favor allowing anyone to vote by mail, including 22% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats.\n\nOther proposals: Voter ID, paper backups, removing inactive voters and ballot collections\n\nBroad bipartisan majorities continue to support requiring electronic voting machines to print a paper backup of the ballot: 84% of all U.S. adults favor this, including 87% of Republicans and 82% of Democrats.\n\nSupport for photo ID requirements also remains widespread in both parties. More than nine-in-ten Republicans (95%) and about seven-in-ten Democrats (71%) favor requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification to vote.\n\nRemoving inactive voters, ballot collections\n\nTwo other proposals are supported by fewer than half of Americans, both of them winning more support from Republicans than Democrats:\n\n45% of Americans – including 55% of Republicans and 37% of Democrats – favor banning mass ballot collections, sometimes called “ballot harvesting.”\n\n43% favor purging the voter rolls of those who have not recently voted or confirmed their registration. Some 63% of Republicans and 24% of Democrats support this.\n\nElection Day holiday\n\nRoughly three-quarters of Americans (74%) – including nearly identical shares of both Republicans (74%) and Democrats (76%) – favor making Election Day a national holiday.\n\nWhile majorities have favored this proposal for the last several years, support is now 9 points higher than it was in 2018, largely the result of a growing share of Republicans who back an Election Day holiday.\n\nAllowing convicted felons to vote after completing their sentences\n\nOverall, 66% of Americans favor allowing convicted felons to vote after serving their sentences. While majorities in both parties hold this view, support is higher among Democrats (77%) than Republicans (56%).\n\nViews of voting policies among racial and ethnic groups\n\nAt least seven-in-ten adults across racial and ethnic groups favor requiring paper ballot backups for electronic voting machines, photo identification requirements and early, in-person voting periods of at least two weeks.\n\nClear majorities across groups also back making Election Day a national holiday and allowing convicted felons to vote after serving their sentences. Support for allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences is higher among Black adults (76%) compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Still, at least six-in-ten White, Hispanic and Asian Americans also favor this proposal.\n\nAt least half of Hispanic, Black, Asian and White adults support automatically registering all citizens to vote, allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to and allowing people to register to vote on Election Day. But support for same-day registration at the polls and allowing any voter to vote by mail is higher among Hispanic, Black and Asian Americans than among White Americans.","summary":"Most Americans Back Expanded Early Voting, Voting by Mail, Voter ID - Pew Research Center","url":"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/08/22/majority-of-americans-continue-to-back-expanded-early-voting-voting-by-mail-voter-id/","image":"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/PP_25.08.22_voting_featured.jpg?w=1200&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 19:02:28","author":"Reem Nadeem","authors":["Reem Nadeem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":353655600,"title":"Gavin Newsom is the likely Democratic presidential nominee","text":"It will all probably work. The Democratic Party in recent months has shown that it has learned nothing from its failed 2024 platform. Democrats have decided that their tanking popularity is simply proof that they don’t “fight” enough, which is why every mediocre presidential wannabe from Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) to Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is trying to portray themselves as a fighter. Newsom’s Trump impersonation is his way of filling that same lane.\n\nUnlike those two, Newsom is a serious Democratic contender. A new Echelon Insights poll puts Democratic support for Newsom at 13%, second only behind Harris’s 26%. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is the only other candidate in striking distance, polling 11%. Of the three, Newsom is the only one who avoids the stink of Biden’s presidency and the health cover-up that defined it.\n\nHarris’s support is a bit of a mirage, as she is coasting on the name recognition of being the previous Democratic nominee. The best data point for this comes from a recent POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab poll, which shows Newsom leading Harris among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents 25%-19%. The voters most familiar with these two California politicians are ready to dump Harris and back Newsom in 2028. At the same time, Harris is off in the political wilderness after her loss, while Newsom will leave office at the start of 2027 and be able to roll right into his presidential campaign.\n\nNewsom also scratches all the progressive itches of the Democratic base, wielding a powerful Democratic primary resume that other candidates can’t match. As governor of California, Newsom has been at the forefront of some of the most extreme gun control proposals in the country, including his push in 2023 to enshrine gun control in the U.S. Constitution through a constitutional amendment. Newsom will boast about his high taxes on the rich, his push toward green energy, and every other left-wing priority that Democratic voters want and that California has imposed.\n\nPritzker’s progressive credentials in Illinois pale compared to Newsom’s in California, and no other Democratic candidate will attack Newsom for California’s failures, as California is the Democratic fever dream model for the country. Newsom has also made himself the face of Democratic gerrymandering, framing it to voters as part of that same “we must fight” narrative that Democrats want. Combined with Harris already having a presidential loss on her record, it is hard to see where any other Democratic candidates would have an advantage over Newsom in an open primary.\n\nWhat does that mean for the general election?\n\nDemocrats won’t hit Newsom for California’s failures (at least not effectively), but that will be different in a general election. California’s issues are well-documented: failing energy policy causing the state to rely on the “dirty” energy it hastily tried to eliminate, including Newsom trying to save oil refineries so gas prices don’t soar higher right before his presidential run. California has the highest gas prices in the country, one of the highest tax burdens, and some of the worst-performing schools.\n\nNewsom boasts about California’s gross domestic product, which ranks fourth in the world behind the U.S. as a whole, China, and Germany. Yet, California also has the highest poverty rate in the country. Newsom supports gun control for law-abiding Americans but wants soft penalties for career criminals.\n\nHowever, what Newsom lacks in policy success is that he makes up for it in media sycophancy and Hollywood connections. Liberal establishment media have been infatuated with Newsom for years, and you can already count on the fact that they are preparing their “J.D. Vance or Ron DeSantis is worse than Donald Trump” stories for 2028. Newsom focused his governorship on pandering to celebrities, granting special carveouts for Hollywood during his COVID-19 crackdown on businesses and promising tax breaks for Hollywood studios. The enthusiasm among those Democratic groups, and among Democratic voters, will be at a fever pitch after another four years of Trump.\n\nAs a political talent, Newsom, while unimpressive, will also be the best that Democrats have offered in over a decade. Newsom will not be as repulsive to voters as Hillary Clinton was. Unlike Joe Biden, Newsom can speak in complete sentences without a script in front of him. Newsom has both of those advantages over Kamala Harris. He is no Barack Obama, but he doesn’t have to be, especially with the Democratic Party’s built-in institutional advantages in media and entertainment.\n\nThe most notable issue Democrats face is that the party’s brand itself is toxic. The New York Times detailed the party’s voter registration “crisis,” with Democrats losing 2.1 million registered voters between 2020 and 2024 while Republicans gained 2.4 million. A Wall Street Journal poll found that 63% of voters view the Democratic Party as out of touch. The poll also has the Democratic Party at -30 net favorability, the worst number since the outlet began tracking this question in 1990.\n\nAnd yet, politics is a pendulum that inevitably swings back at some point. Even with their historic unpopularity, Democrats are expanding their polling lead in the generic congressional ballot by 3.9% as the 2026 midterm election cycle heats up. Trump’s approval is nearly five points underwater. While that is considerably better than most of his first term, it is underwater.\n\nOBAMA PRAISES NEWSOM’S ‘RESPONSIBLE APPROACH’ TO CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING AFTER TEXAS EFFORTS\n\nIf that negativity continues to fester, Newsom is not a toxic enough politician to counteract it. The White House has flipped parties in the last three presidential election cycles. If that is the new political trend for presidential elections, the Democratic Party nominee should have the momentum advantage in 2028, even with the party’s brand issues.\n\nThat nominee will likely be Newsom, who has all the advantages a Democratic presidential candidate would want in a primary. Newsom is the best-positioned Democrat to become president in 2028, and his candidacy in a general election cannot be dismissed out of hand by Republicans who recognize his failures in California. The country has become so polarized that any major party candidate is a real threat to win, including the governor of California, who has been brainstorming how to become president for the last several years.","summary":"It should not be lost amid the bizarre social media posts, Gavin Newsom is most likely to be the 2028 Democratic nominee for president.

Taking Collins' seat in Maine would be a significant victory for the Democrats, who are hoping to take control of the Senate in November, 2026, which would greatly increase their ability to frustrate President Trump's policy agenda during his final two years in the White House.What To KnowOn Tuesday Graham Platner, a 40-year-old businessman and military veteran, announced he is joining the Democratic primary for the right to take on Collins in November 2026.Jordan Wood, the former vice president of liberal campaign group End Citizens United, is also seeking the Democratic nomination for the Maine Senate race and has raised $1.6 million according to Politico.There is speculation Maine Governor Janet Mills could also decide to run with Maine Public Radio reporting she has been heavily lobbied by national Democratic figures to launch a Senate bid.Whichever candidate wins the Democratic primary will have to face Collins in November 2026. While relatively little polling has been conducted due to the distance to the general election her potential opponents will likely be buoyed by her approval rating in some recent polling.A survey of 846 registered Maine voters conducted by the University of New Hampshire between June 19 and 23 found Collins had a net approval rating of -43 percent, with only 14 percent of those surveyed approving of her performance.By contrast, the survey gave Governor Mills an overall approval rating of plus 10, with 51 percent of Mainers viewing her favorably and 41 percent unfavorably.Similarly a Like Research Partners poll of 300 Maine voters over February 1-15 gave Collins a net rating of -33 percent, with 31 percent having a favorable view of her while 64 percent had an unfavorable one.However in better news for Collins a Pan Atlantic Research poll of 820 Maine likely voters over May 12-26 gave her a net positive rating of four, with 49 percent of voters approving of her against 45 percent who disapproved.Kamala Harris carried Maine by seven points in the 2024 presidential election and the state is seen as one of the Republicans top Senate targets for 2026.Collins has at times frustrated President Trump, opposing him on a number of issues including Pete Hegseth's appointment as defense secretary and additional tariffs on Canadian produce.What People Are SayingIn a campaign video, Democratic primary candidate Platner said: \"I'm not fooled by this fake charade of Collins' deliberations and moderation. The difference between Susan Collins and Ted Cruz is at least Ted Cruz is honest about selling us out and not giving a damn.\"Speaking to Politico he added: \"To call me a liberal, I think is fairly amusing. I mean, I'm a competitive pistol shooter. That's what I do on the weekends.\"I'm a firearms instructor. I spent multiple years, obviously, in the service utilizing firearms. I also grew up in rural Maine, where guns are a part of our existence.\"Jordan Wood said: \"Mainers deserve more from our senator than concern without action and I'm not waiting on anyone else's decision to fight for our state.\"Referring to a Senate run in July, Governor Mills said: \"I mean, look, I wasn't born with a burning desire to be in Washington, D.C.—any month of the year.\"And what's going on there is a bit chaotic. It's not something anybody would want to jump into and be a part of automatically.\"What Happens NextDemocrats will be hopeful of beating Collins in 2026 though it remains to be seen who their candidate will be. Polling suggests Collins is not popular in her state, but she could get a boost from moderate voters for standing up to Trump on certain issues.","summary":"Democrats are hoping to unseat Senator Collins, a Trump skeptical Republican, in the November 2026 midterm elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-chances-beating-susan-collins-maine-senate-election-2118219","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708512/susan-collins.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9ad267b3ca2e3bc3ea1a708bd228050d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 16:15:05","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.147},{"id":353608746,"title":"Netanyahu is winning in Gaza and losing the West","text":"This week the Israeli army launched a full-scale ground operation to seize the city of Gaza. The plan is ambitious and ruthless: 60,000 new reservists will be called up and another 20,000 troops will have their service extended. For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this is a “necessary step” to ensure Israel’s security. For the international community, it looks like a gamble that could push Israel into near-total isolation.\n\nThe United Nations has already warned that the offensive will trigger “mass destruction” and the death of civilians, including thousands of children already suffering from hunger. Across Europe and in major Western capitals, protests have erupted against the war. Yet Netanyahu shows no sign of backing down. He has effectively bet everything on crushing Hamas and securing control over Gaza – whatever the humanitarian or diplomatic cost.\n\nThis latest escalation does not happen in a vacuum. It comes after nearly two years of mounting tensions between Israel and its traditional Western allies, a process that began in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and has since transformed Israel’s international standing. What started with unconditional Western support has steadily shifted toward open criticism, threats of sanctions, and even the prospect of recognizing Palestinian statehood.\n\nBy the spring of 2024, Europe’s patience with Israel’s blockade of Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis had run thin. Josep Borrell, then EU foreign policy chief, announced a review of relations with Israel, including discussion of suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement. London froze free trade talks. Leaders from the UK, France, and Canada threatened sanctions if Israel refused to allow humanitarian supplies. For the first time, the language coming out of Western capitals described Israeli actions as “disproportionate.”\n\nNetanyahu responded with defiance, accusing Western leaders of “encouraging terrorism.” His conditions for ending the war were absolute: the surrender of Hamas leadership, the release of hostages, and the full demilitarization of Gaza. Any alternative, he insisted, was unacceptable.\n\nEurope’s pressure soon moved from rhetoric to legal measures. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, while France broke precedent as the first G7 nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Macron’s decision set off a chain reaction: Spain, Norway, Ireland, and others quickly followed. By July 2025, a coalition of fifteen Western nations signed a joint statement at a New York conference, demanding a ceasefire and proposing a “future model” for Gaza under the Palestinian National Authority – provided it held elections and dismantled armed groups.\n\nBritain, too, began edging toward recognition of Palestine, tying the decision to whether Israel would agree to a ceasefire. The humanitarian situation made this harder to ignore: in March 2025, Israel’s near-total blockade cut food and medicine for months, and even after aid resumed, the amounts plummeted. Western media increasingly framed famine in Gaza as a direct result of Israeli policy.\n\nEven Washington showed signs of strain. Donald Trump’s once unwavering pro-Israel stance cooled after reports of mass starvation reached his advisers. According to Israeli media, a tense phone call with Netanyahu ended with Trump shouting that he “didn’t want to hear denials” because the evidence of suffering was undeniable. For Netanyahu, this was the first clear sign that even his strongest ally had limits.\n\nEurope, meanwhile, pursued a multilayered strategy. Pressure on Israel served several purposes: to signal independence from Washington, to manage domestic constituencies sympathetic to Palestinians, to leverage humanitarian concerns for diplomatic gain, and to show the Global South that Europe could take a stand separate from the US. But this “sovereignty” remains largely rhetorical. Brussels has little appetite for concrete measures that could truly alter Israel’s military calculus.\n\nThat cynicism may, in fact, work to Europe’s advantage. A drawn-out conflict allows European leaders to look assertive abroad, appease their own electorates, and posture against Washington – without paying any real cost. Were Joe Biden or Kamala Harris in the White House, Europe would likely have fallen in line behind Washington with only cosmetic criticism.\n\nFor Netanyahu, however, the stakes are existential. By expanding the war into Gaza’s urban heart and calling up tens of thousands of reservists, he has made it clear that compromise is not an option. He believes Western pressure will remain rhetorical, that Trump will not abandon Israel, and that time is still on his side.\n\nBut the higher the stakes, the lonelier Israel becomes. Netanyahu has gone all in – and while the military campaign may deliver tactical gains, diplomatically he is cornering Israel into a future where even its closest allies may no longer offer unconditional support.","summary":"As Europe edges toward recognition of Palestine and Trump shows signs of impatience, Israel’s war risks turning into a lonely fight \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/623393-netanyahu-winning-gaza-losing-west/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.08/article/68a7cd5e85f5407f34092693.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 15:47:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":353601438,"title":"Is Jussie Smollett Innocent? The Complicated True Story Behind The Hate Crime Scandal","text":"The Truth About Jussie Smollett? Jussie Smollett in The Truth About Jussie Smollett?\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nIn 2019, Empire actor Jussie Smollett claimed he was the victim of a racially motivated attack in downtown Chicago by two masked men. His account came under scrutiny when the alleged perpetrators said the TV star paid them to stage a hate crime. Six years later, what do we know about the case, and was Smollett telling the truth or lying?\n\nNetflix’s new documentary, The Truth About Jussie Smollett, has propelled the controversial case back into the spotlight. Directed by Gagan Rehill, the film includes exclusive interviews with Smollett, Chicago investigators and the two men who claimed they were hired to stage the attack. The project marks Smollett’s first on-screen discussion of the incident since his 2019 Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts.\n\nForbesJussie Smollett Says He Is 'Further Victimized' By False Rumors Regarding His AssaultBy Adrienne Gibbs\n\nSmollett is best known for starring in Fox's hit hip-hop drama, Empire. From 2015 to 2019, he portrayed Jamal Lyon, a gay singer-songwriter who is estranged from his father because of his sexuality. Beyond acting, Smollett is also an R&B singer and an advocate for H.I.V./AIDS prevention and racial justice. According to The New York Times, in 2019, he served on the boards of four charitable organizations, including the Trayvon Martin Foundation and the Black AIDS Institute.\n\nHowever, Smollett’s life took a dramatic turn in early 2019 when he reported being the victim of a hate crime. Here’s what to know about the case, including what Smollett revealed in the documentary and the evidence for and against him.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhat Happened To Jussie Smollett?\n\nThe Truth About Jussie Smollett on Netflix.\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2019, Jussie Smollett told the Chicago Police Department that he was attacked around 2 a.m. near downtown Chicago. He alleged that two white men assaulted him, poured an unknown liquid on him, put a noose around his neck and yelled racist and homophobic slurs, including that it was \"MAGA country,\" referring to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan. The actor was treated at a hospital but did not have serious injuries.\n\n“Overnight the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially charged assault and battery against a cast member of the television show Empire,” the original CPD statement read. “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”\n\nIn response, CPD investigators worked to locate the two alleged attackers by following leads and reviewing surveillance footage. The actor also claimed that a week earlier, he received a racist letter on the set of Empire addressed to him. The envelope contained an unknown powdery substance and ransom-note style lettering, according to CBS News.\n\nIn the days following the incident, Smollett received widespread support from celebrities and political figures, including actor Viola Davis, singer John Legend and then-former Vice President Joe Biden. President Trump called the news “horrible,” and former Vice President Kamala Harris said, “This was an attempted modern day lynching.”\n\nMeanwhile, Smollett continued to claim that everything he told police was true. “I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement in early February 2019. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”\n\nThat same month, he gave his first interview on GMA, where he reiterated his innocence. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone Black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett told Roberts. “A lot more.”\n\nWhen Did Investigators Begin Questioning Jussie Smollett’s Story?\n\nThe Truth About Jussie Smollett? (L to R) Bola 'Abel' Osundairo and Ola Osundairo in The Truth About Jussie Smollett?\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nUltimately, Chicago authorities discovered evidence that showed Smollett had possibly staged the incident. They obtained CCTV footage and ride-share records that show that the alleged attackers were actually two Nigerian American brothers named Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were extras on Empire.\n\nDuring their interviews, the Osundairo brothers told police that Smollett had hired them to stage the attack. They claimed he orchestrated the crime after the cryptic letter sent to the Fox studio failed to generate attention. According to CBS News, one brother allegedly purchased the rope used in the incident at Smollett's request. They further claimed that during the staged attack, one brother held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and shouted slurs at Smollett.\n\n\"I believe he wanted to be the poster boy of activism for Black people, for gay people, for marginalized people,\" Bola Osundairo said in the documentary.\n\nOla Osundairo added that when Smollett asked them to \"beat him up,\" he \"thought it was crazy.\" \"But at the same time, I’m like, ‘It’s Hollywood.’ This is how it goes,’\" he said in the documentary.\n\nThe brothers even told detectives that they rehearsed the attack with Smollett days before it occurred, and that he paid them $3,500. Sources told ABC News that the payment was disguised for fitness training to prepare for an upcoming music video. The $3,500 check reportedly covered a five-week program, consisting of $600 weekly for workouts and $100 weekly for nutrition planning.\n\nABC News also published text messages allegedly exchanged between Smollett and one of the Osundairo brothers, whom he referred to as \"Bon.\" These messages contained discussions about exercise routines and meal plans in the days leading up to the alleged attack.\n\nIn the documentary, Smollett claimed that the text exchange was code for him requesting drugs — specifically an herbal steroid to lose belly fat that is illegal in the U.S. He also said the $3,500 check was actually for personal training sessions led by Bola.\n\nWas Jussie Smollett Arrested?\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MARCH 26: Actor Jussie Smollett leaves the Leighton Courthouse after his court appearance on March 26, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. This morning in court it was announced that all charges were dropped against the actor. (Photo by Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nSmollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report. He was arrested just hours after the grand jury heard evidence that Smollett falsely reported being attacked. He was released on $100,000 bail and returned to the Empire set in Chicago.\n\nIn response, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson criticized Smollett for exploiting the pain and anger associated with racism while wasting resources that could have been used to investigate actual crimes. “I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,” he said, according to The Times.\n\nShortly after, the producers of Empire announced that the actor’s character would not appear in the final two episodes of the show’s fifth season. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the producers said in a statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”\n\nIn March 2019, Smollett was indicted by a Chicago grand jury on 16 felony counts, and Smollett pled not guilty. But a few weeks later, Chicago prosecutors dropped all charges against Smollett, resulting in backlash from Johnson and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Chicago Police Department Commander Ed Wodnicki told NBC Chicago that the reversal of charges was a \"punch in the gut.”\n\n\"We worked closely throughout our three-week investigation to get to the point where we arrested the offender,” Wodnicki said. “For the state's attorney at this point to dismiss charges without discussing this with us at all is just shocking.\"\n\nHowever, Smollett’s freedom didn’t last long, because in late 2019, a special prosecutor was appointed to review his case. The actor was indicted on Feb. 11, 2020 by a grand jury in Chicago. In the second indictment, he faced six counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly making false police reports, in addition to his existing lawsuit with the city.\n\nWhat Happened At Jussie Smollett’s Trial?\n\nJussie Smollett, center, arrives at the Leighton Criminal Court Building for the beginning of his trial on new disorderly conduct charges on November 29, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. - Former \"Empire\" star Jussie Smollett is accused of making false reports to authorities that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in 2019. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2021, Smollett was found guilty of five of the six charges of felony disorderly conduct for falsely telling police that he was assaulted in the hate-fueled attack, per NBC News.\n\nIn March, the actor was sentenced to 150 days in jail and 30 months of probation. He was ordered to pay around $120,100 in restitution to the city of Chicago and was fined $25,000, which was the maximum amount.\n\nHe only spent six days in jail before the Empire star was released on bond pending an appeal. However, an appeals court later upheld the disorderly conduct convictions, the Associated Press reported at the time. He was ordered to complete the 150-day jail sentence.\n\nWhy Did The Illinois Supreme Court Overturn Smollett’s Conviction?\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MARCH 26: Actor Jussie Smollett waves as he follows his attorney to the microphones after his court appearance at Leighton Courthouse on March 26, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. This morning in court it was announced that all charges were dropped against the actor. (Photo by Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe most significant development in the case came in November 2024, when the Illinois Supreme Court overturned his conviction, ruling that Smollett had been wrongfully charged after entering into a non-prosecution agreement with the Cook County state's attorney.\n\n\"Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied,\" the ruling said, according to NBC News.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Dan K. Webb, who brought the second case against Smollett, released a statement disagreeing with the Illinois Supreme Court’s decision. “Make no mistake — today’s ruling has nothing to do with Mr. Smollett’s innocence,\" he said.\n\n\"The Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury’s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct,” Webb continued. “In fact, Mr. Smollett did not even challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him in his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.”\n\nThe city of Chicago and Smollett finally settled their lawsuit on May 1, 2025. In an Instagram post, the actor explained that he was offered the opportunity to have the suit dismissed in exchange for a charitable donation. He donated $50,000 to the Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts and committed to an additional $10,000 donation to the Chicago Torture Justice Center.\n\nWhat Evidence Supports That Jussie Smollett Was Telling The Truth?\n\nATLANTA, GA - SEPTEMBER 3: Jussie Smollett attends 2022 Atlanta Black Pride Weekend Film Festival- \"B-Boy Blues\" screening at IPIC Theaters at Colony Square on September 3, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)\n\nIn The Truth About Jussie Smollett, the former Empire star maintains his innocence. But what evidence supports Smollett's claim that he was telling the truth about his assault?\n\nThere are two witnesses can corroborate parts of Smollett’s account, according to the film. A security guard at the Sheraton reported seeing a white man running down the street around the time of the alleged attack. Additionally, a neighbor in Smollett’s building saw a man with a rope hanging from his coat while walking her dog in front of the building. \"I thought to myself, this is it, this is going to exonerate me,\" Smollett explains in the documentary.\n\nTwo freelance journalists who examined the police videos showing the alleged attackers also claimed that the person running down the street appears to be white, not Black like the Osundairo brothers.\n\n\"Why would Jussie hire two Nigerian guys to do an attack that he was going to say was perpetrated by white guys, if it was going to be caught on tape?\" questioned Tina Glandian, attorney at Geragos and Geragos, who represented Smollett.\n\nSmollett added that during the investigation, he was \"playing whack-a-mole with rumors, with lies.” However, \"at a certain point, it’s too many, and you can’t catch them all,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of the documentary, the actor concluded by saying, “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter whether someone likes me or doesn’t like me. It doesn’t matter whether you like the way I’m giving this interview. It doesn’t matter whether you like the way I look right now or not.”\n\nHe continued, “Doesn’t matter whether you love my performances or can’t stand them. That’s unimportant. What is important is, regardless of what you think about me, flaws and all, flaws and greatness, whatever you think, joy and sorrow. I didn’t do that [fake a hate crime] and that’s all that matters.”\n\nThe Truth About Jussie Smollett is streaming on Netflix.

County knows how it accidentally repealed Measure J. Fixing it is still a headache","text":"Good morning, and welcome to L.A. on the Record — our City Hall newsletter. It’s Rebecca Ellis, with an assist from Julia Wick, giving you the latest on city and county government. L.A. County officials have been given a task: make sure the embarrassing blunder that led voters to accidentally wipe out a popular ballot measure never happens again. The board is expected to soon review a policy to ensure “county charter is promptly updated” following the accidental repeal of Measure J — a 2020 ballot measure that promised hundreds of millions of dollars for services that keep people out of jail. The mistake is complicated, but the root cause is simple: The county never added the measure to its charter, akin to the county constitution. The county’s top lawyer, Dawyn Harrison, blames the failure squarely on the executive office, which supports the five politicians with the administrative parts of the job — including, apparently, keeping the county code fresh. But Robert Bonner, the recently forced-out head of the sheriff's oversight commission, said the county’s top lawyers learned long ago that parts of the code were outdated. “I always thought it was weird that it would take so long for the county apparatus to get something in the code that the voters said was the law,” Bonner said. Bonner said it took the county four years to incorporate a March 2020 ballot measure, known as Measure R, which gave his commission the power to investigate misconduct with subpoenas. For years, he said, the commission resorted to citing ballotpedia, an online encyclopedia with information about local measures, in its legal filings. The Times reviewed one such filing from November 2022 as the commission tried to force former Sheriff Alex Villanueva to obey deputy gang subpoenas. County attorneys said they first discovered the issue in October 2023 and it was fixed by August 2024. It is not clear why it took ten months. “This underscores the need to reform the system with clear safeguards and accountability,\" county counsel said in a statement. \"This breakdown made clear that our office must also be systematically included in the administrative process.” “Fortunately, in our case, it didn’t lead to disaster,” Bonner said of the outdated code. A few months later, it would. In summer of 2024, county counsel got its marching orders: To create a ballot measure, known as Measure G, that would overhaul the county government, expand the five-person board of elected supervisors to nine and bring on a new elected executive who would act almost as a mayor of the county. The office came up with a ballot measure that would repeal most of a section of the charter — called Article III — in 2028. That section details the powers of the board — and, most consequentially, includes the requirement from Measure J that the board funnel hundreds of millions toward anti-incarceration services. County lawyers rewrote that chunk of the charter with the changes the board wanted in the county’s form of government — but left out the anti-incarceration funding. So when voters approved Measure G, they unwittingly repealed Measure J. And it turns out, it’s not easy to get back a ballot measure after voters accidentally wipe it out. The supervisors hoped they could just get a judge to tell them that, actually, Measure J was just fine. After all, voters had no idea they were repealing it — nobody did. But the supervisors were recently told by their lawyers that getting relief from a judge — considered the easiest, cheapest option — would be legally tricky terrain. One month after the mistake came to light, they’ve yet to go to a judge. Maybe the state could help by passing legislation that would make a correction to the county’s charter, officials hoped. Not so, according to a memo from Harrison and Chief Executive Fesia Davenport. For the state to help, it would need to pass legislation that mimicked the budget requirements of Measure J — potentially a bigger ask than a charter tweak. “A court would likely strike down as unconstitutional any changes to the County Charter that were not approved by voters,” read the July 25 memo. And then there’s the option of last resort: putting Measure J back on the ballot. It’s high-stakes. It is, after all, no longer November 2020, when Measure J passed handily, buoyed by a wave of support for racial justice and disgust over police brutality after the killing of George Floyd. Voters have leaned in recently to tough-on-crime measures such as Proposition 36, which stiffened the penalties for some nonviolent crimes. If the county needed proof the atmosphere has changed, the sheriff deputy union, which fought hard against Measure J, has plenty. The union paid for a poll of 1,000 voters that suggests the measure wouldn’t pass if it were put up for a vote again. Only 43% of respondents said they would vote for the measure if it went back on the ballot, while 44% said they'd vote no. The measure passed in 2020 with 57% of the vote. Voters weren’t big fans of the politicians in charge either. Almost half viewed the board unfavorably. The union fought hard against Measure J, spending more than $3.5 million on advertising to fight it and following up with a court battle. It's not not hankering for another go at it. “Residents are clearly fed up with the shenanigans around Measure G and J,” said union President Richard Pippin. \"The fix is to focus on investing in safe communities instead of half-baked ideas.” The poll was conducted by David Binder Research, a San Francisco-based pollster frequently used by Democratic candidates, from Aug. 5 to Aug. 12, with a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The Times was only sent a summary of the poll and did not view the original. Some advocates argue that if anything goes on the ballot, it should be the measure that contained the poison pill. “Why aren’t they considering [Measure] G?\" asked Gabriela Vazquez, who campaigned for the anti-incarceration measure as a member of the nonprofit La Defensa. “Imagine all the fundraising folks would have to do to defend J if it was put back on the ballot.” “The defect was in G not in J,” said former Duarte City Councilmember John Fasana, who voted against both measures and first noticed the county’s flub. “You’re overturning an election.” But the overhaul of county government Take Two would also face an uphill battle, the poll suggests. The measure narrowly passed last November with 51% of the vote. This time, only 45% of voters like the idea, while 40% said they'd vote no, according to the poll. The Times asked all five supervisors what they wanted to do. Supervisors Janice Hahn and Kathryn Barger did not respond. The other three appeared undecided. Supervisor Holly Mitchell, a vocal supporter of Measure J and opponent of Measure G, said she wants to “explore all solutions” to keep the anti-incarceration measure in good standing. Supervisor Hilda Solis said she wanted to correct the error, but did not say how. Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, the force behind the government overhaul, said she’s not ruling out getting help from a judge and is moving forward with an ordinance that would mirror Measure J. Unlike a ballot measure, an ordinance could be undone by a future board. She says going to the ballot is the last resort. “My commitment to fixing this mess hasn’t changed. I’m open to every viable path, and we might need to pursue more than one,” Horvath said in a statement. “Before considering the ballot, we must exhaust every option before us.” — A POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE: Come November, California voters will partake in a special election to potentially waive the state’s independent redistricting process and approve new partisan congressional maps that favor Democrats. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s high-stakes fight to counter President Trump’s scramble for GOP control is already sending shockwaves around the state. —HILDA’S PLANS: The proposed maps would create a new congressional district in southeast L.A. County. Supervisor Hilda Solis has yet to publicly announce her candidacy, but she’s made her intention to run for the redrawn 38th District clear within the close-knit world of California politics. —THE RICK OF IT ALL: Former L.A. mayoral candidate Rick Caruso was initially quiet about Newsom’s redistricting proposal. But after the Legislature sent the measure to the ballot Thursday, Caruso made his support clear, telling us that “California has to push back” against the Texas redistricting scheme. He plans to financially support the ballot measure, he said. One topic he remained vague on was whether he’ll run for mayor or governor in 2026, saying he was still seriously considering both options. —AUTHOR, AUTHOR: Brentwood resident and former Vice President Kamala Harris announced a 15-city book tour for her upcoming election memoir “107 Days.” The lineup includes a September event at the Wiltern theater in partnership with Book Soup. —FIRE JUSTICE: Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson was at the Stentorians office Friday morning to show his support for a package of state bills focused on incarcerated firefighters. He appeared alongside Assemblymembers Sade Elhawary, Celeste Rodriguez and Josh Lowenthal and Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas. — END IN SIGHT?: Councilmember Tim McOsker’s motion to “strategically and competently” work to wind down the mayor’s declaration of emergency on homelessness narrowly failed Wednesday. The motion called for the legislative body to come back in 60 days, with reports from city offices, to advise on an implementation plan to end the declaration of emergency. McOsker’s goal was to terminate the state of emergency, which has been in effect for more than two years, as soon as possible. His motion failed to pass in a 7-7 vote. The council instead continued to support the mayor’s declaration of emergency and will take up the issue again in 90 days. —\"SLUSH FUND\" QUESTIONS: An election technology firm allegedly overbilled Los Angeles County for voting machines used during the 2020 election and funneled the extra cash into a “slush fund” for bribing government officials, federal prosecutors say in a criminal case against three company executives. Prosecutors do not indicate who benefited from the alleged pot of Los Angeles County taxpayer money. Where is Inside Safe? Staff from the mayor’s signature homelessness program visited the council district of Hugo Soto-Martínez, moving an estimated 23 people indoors, according to the mayor's office. Her Shine LA initiative, which aims to clean up city streets and sidewalks, was postponed to September because of the extreme heat. On the docket for next week: The City Council will vote Wednesday on whether to approve the mayor's appointment of Domenika Lynch to be the new general manager of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, which includes Olvera Street.

Now it's his GOP and the MAGA faithful are in the lead","text":"AgenciesDonald Trump\n\nAmy Kremer was an early tea party leader who supported Donald Trump for president in 2016. She ran for Congress from Georgia in 2017 and got less than 1% of the Republican primary vote. In 2021, she organized the rally near the White House that took place hours before hundreds of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to protest his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. As voters Trump to power in 2024, Kremer unseated a conservative stalwart to become a Republican National Committee member. This week in Atlanta, she used that post to help elect a new party chairman, Joe Gruters of Florida. He's another original Trump backer who has been described by the president as a \"MAGA warrior\"- a reference to the \"Make America Great Again\" movement. \"I never thought I'd be sitting here for something like this,\" Kremer said. \"It's Donald Trump's party now.\" Sitting presidents typically choose their national party leaders. But today's RNC, with grassroots activists such as Kremer and a leader in Gruters, demonstrates how much the Republicans have changed from the establishment-controlled Grand Old Party and now reflect Trump and his populist nationalism.Live Events Almost a dozen interviews with RNC members found an affinity for the president that they described as running deeper than for his predecessors. They insist Trump's remaking of the economy, the federal government and America's role in the world are overdue, and they are confident his political struggles will not doom the party in the 2026 midterm election. They described a seamless relationship between the White House and the party machinery, and as better than during Trump's first term. Perhaps most notably, they argued that Republicans' \"America First\" and MAGA identity are not simply about Trump's charismatic branding but rather evidence of a movement that predated his presidency and will last beyond. \"When you see the working-class people that bought into this, it was for real. It wasn't a fly-by-night,\" said the Nevada Republican chairman, Michael McDonald. \"Donald Trump brought something that needed to wake up the party, and he did. And it's never going back.\" Trump didn't begin as a Republican Party man Kremer took her RNC seat when the party convened at the 2024 convention in Milwaukee. She was one of nearly four dozen new members out of the 168 seats. Another 21 new members joined the committee in Atlanta. \"That's all MAGA,\" she said. Nevada's McDonald was elected in 2011 and is now the longest-serving Republican state party chair. He laughed when asked about party dynamics during Trump's first campaign and presidency. \"We had people inside the Republican Party throwing marbles at our feet,\" said McDonald, who was indicted as a fake elector after the 2020 election, accused of scheming to keep Trump in the White House even after he lost Nevada to Biden. A Nevada judge dismissed the case last year. Trump's second-term secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was a Florida senator and one of Trump's primary rivals in 2016. In that campaign, Rubio had called the would-be president a \"con artist.\" At the GOP convention that year, another candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, flouted protocol by not explicitly endorsing Trump. Trump's initial breach with the party seemed a liability after he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. A Washington outsider, he had little choice but to build a West Wing and executive branch that included plenty of Republicans who were not true believers. His first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, led the RNC while Trump ran for president and had dealt with GOP power players who wanted to block Trump's nomination. Trump's first RNC chair was Ronna Romney McDaniel, niece of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who had warned publicly against Trump's election. In office, Trump leaned on his ability to control news cycles and narratives. He largely ignored party mechanics and was not intimately involved in the 2018 midterm campaign, when Democrats won back a U.S. House majority. New Trump-friendly faces surfaced anyway People around Trump laid long-term groundwork despite his seeming detachment from the party. McDonald said loyalists Steven Bannon, David Bossie, Susie Wiles, who is the current White House chief of staff, and others helped build state-level infrastructure and recruit candidates for state party leadership, RNC seats and down-ballot offices. Other newcomers emerged on their own, inspired by Trump. \"I speak for a whole generation who was frustrated by the status quo and being politically correct,\" said John Wahl, the Alabama party chairman. In 2021, he became the youngest GOP chairman nationally at age 34. Wahl succeeded Terry Lathan, who had been a loyal party soldier for nominees ranging from moderates like Arizona Sen. John McCain to party crashers like Trump. Yet in 2023, once she was out of office and free to choose a GOP presidential primary candidate, she backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump. Lathan did not attend Trump's 2024 nominating convention in Milwaukee. Bryan Miller, who was elected to head Wyoming's Republican Party this year, supported Trump in the 2016 primaries, not long after Miller had retired from the Air Force and joined his county GOP committee leadership. He recalls watching his state's most high-profile Republican, then U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, helped lead the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. She endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump in 2024. Miller said he \"wouldn't have believed it\" if he had been told a decade ago that he would be become state chairman and that Liz Cheney, daughter of a former Vice President Dick Cheney, would be unwelcome among Wyoming Republicans. 'America First' unity overrides any disa greements Fealty to Trump does not mean there's complete harmony among Republicans. Evan Power, chair of the Florida GOP and a onetime Rubio aide, agreed that some Republicans still prefer conservative orthodoxy on global trade and international alliances. But he said Trump speaks to voter anger over an uneven economy and that Trump's confrontational approach toward other nations is no different from how the president conducts domestic politics. \"Now people know that his combative fighting style is what wins elections,\" Power said. Miller pointed to National Guard troops on the streets of the District of Columbia and acknowledged questions about using armed federal military power to police an American city. \"I'm OK with it - as long as we remain within the confines of the law, the way it's set up\" for military personnel to be \"only in supporting roles,\" he said. Kremer, who once lambasted President Barack Obama's health overhaul as a budget buster, said she knows the new tax breaks and spending cuts pushed by Trump are set to add trillions of dollars to the nation's debt. \"There's not another person that would deport the illegals and shut down the border,\" she said. \"It's opportunity cost. You know he's going to spend more. I'm not OK with it, but I know you can't have everything.\" Trump himself has learned some of that same bottom-line pragmatism where the party is concerned. During his 2024 campaign, Trump pushed out McDaniel from the RNC. He tapped daughter-in-law Lara Trump and Michael Whatley of North Carolina as party co-chairs. Now, Whatley is Trump's pick for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, and Gruters is leading the RNC. Vice President JD Vance chairs the RNC's finance operations in an unusually high-ranking link between the White House and the party's fundraising apparatus. And with nearly every new turnover across the party's organizational chart, the scales tip further in Trump's direction. \"He sat in exile for four years and thought about what he could have done better,\" said Power, the Florida chair, \"and he's executing on all cylinders.\"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpwhite houserepublican partyDonald Trumprepublican national committeenational guardgrand old partymaga\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

A rising tide of support for Gavin Newsom,” adding, “Remember, back in 2023, the majority of Democrats did not want Joe Biden to run for another term; but California Democrats in Gavin Newsom’s home state did not want him to run, either,” as quoted by the Independent.Live EventsThough Newsom has not officially announced a presidential bid, the numbers suggest that many California voters already see him as a serious contender and perhaps even the Democratic frontrunner for the post-Biden era, according to the report.A new Politico/Citrin Center poll found that, California Democrats have said that they prefer Newsom over Trump’s 2024 opponent, former US vice president Kamala Harris, in a 2028 presidential primary, as reported by the Independent.Enten highlighted the importance of home state polling for presidential candidates during Friday’s broadcast, saying, “If they can’t win the primary in their home state, they ain’t going to win anywhere,” as quoted in the report.ALSO READ: Amazon to ditch Fire OS?

Newsom’s press office wrote on social media platform X, mimicking Trump’s use of capital letters in posts, saying, “NOT EVEN JD ‘JUST DANCE’ VANCE CAN SAVE TRUMP FROM THE DISASTROUS MAPS ‘WAR’ HE HAS STARTED. NOT EVEN HIS EYELINER LINES LOOK AS PRETTY AS CALIFORNIA ‘MAP’ LINES,” as per the X post.The X post also added, “HE WILL FAIL, AS HE ALWAYS DOES (SAD!)

His office has ramped up social media attacks on Donald Trump, his policies, and, predictably, his bugnuts tweeting. I have witnessed the rise of Gavin Newsom firsthand: from his tenure as mayor of San Francisco to the governorship of my state to this deeply embarrassing photo with a future resident of Mar-a-Lago. At last, the world can finally see the Gavin Newsom I have come to vehemently tolerate – a man with a tendency to stumble into doing the right thing in the most annoying way possible.\n\nNewsom is the kind of politician who will seize the moment – legalizing same-sex marriage in San Francisco back in 2004, most significantly – as long as the moment is somewhere near a camera and an operating microphone. We are in one of those dreaded “moments” right now, as Texas gerrymanders itself to rig the midterms in the favor of Republicans. Newsom is taking full advantage, pushing to gerrymander California in response and turning over one of his office’s social media accounts to run a comic offensive against the White House. In the process, he is doing the thing I hate the most: weaponizing nostalgia.\n\nNostalgia is a powerful thing, like a rank body odor or a French cheese. Don’t we all love turning back the hands of time and pretending like we still have all our hair, we can stand for more than 30 minutes of an Oasis concert and Twitter is a thing that matters to normal people? Remember 2017? That was a fun year. The Women’s March, the release of the original Nintendo Switch, and Montenegro joining Nato (ugh, finally). It was certainly a year, was it not? Definitely one of the years. Back then, not a minute would go by without a Krassenstein brother telling you that the indictments were imminent, that Donald Trump was a lame duck and the pee tape was just an Amazon Prime delivery away. Robert Mueller was practically Elvis gyrating on the Ed Sullivan Show, he was so beloved by neurotic liberals trying their best to white-knuckle through the first Trump administration. Sometimes, I’ll put on the music video for Despacito and just vibe on the 2017 of it all. You probably don’t even remember that song exists, but I assure you, it was popular once.\n\nBack in those days, we all thought we could mock Trump into oblivion. I certainly tried. I definitely failed. But thinking we could tease the man into appeasement was an amusing fantasy. Our first go-round with the Don was something of a satire boom – the Daily Show, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, digital outlets like Crooked Media. Surely all we’d need to do is make fun of his tan and he’d go away, like a schoolyard bully with a weird birthmark. Despite the best efforts of various Ivy League educated wits, Trump won out with crueler insults, more banal observations and performative intimidation tactics that energized his base. We are now almost a decade into the Trump era and no one on the left has been able to figure out how to cause lasting damage to the Maga mystique that doesn’t involve the Jeffrey Epstein files. So, when I witness the numbing onslaught of Newsom’s @GovPressOffice account, I can’t help but be caught in a reverie that warps me back to the halcyon days of something resembling optimism – when “the resistance” was a hashtag that seemed to have actual meaning.\n\n@GovPressOffice is a glorious throwback to 2017. Also, 2018. And 2019. And 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Kamala Harris even tried this same tactic, trolling Trump on social media as often as possible. In the minds of the most die-hard political junkies, platforms like X are the ultimate battleground, where hearts and minds can be won over with a bit of sarcasm or a meme of JD Vance as a baby. At most, that meme might get you deported, but I’m still not convinced it can sway an election. Nevertheless, they persisted. It seems like any Democrat with a shred of national recognition immediately goes into full 2017 “resistance” mode, hoping to trigger the right into some mythical unforced error of political gamesmanship. Please indulge me as I copy/paste an actual tweet from @GovPressOffice. Decide for yourself if you think this is going to sway a voter to move to the left:\n\nWOW!!! MY MAPS (THE BEST MAPS EVER MADE) WILL SOON PASS IN THE GREATEST LEGISLATURE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD (NOT JUST AMERICA). AMERICA CAN THANK ME (GAVIN C. NEWSOM) AND TWO VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE – MAGIC MIKE & RAINMAKER ROBERT, WHO LEAD THE LEGISLATURE – TOTAL LEGENDS!!! THESE ARE “PERFECT, BEAUTIFUL” MAPS. BETTER THAN COLUMBUS, BETTER THAN GOOGLE MAPS, BETTER THAN APPLE MAPS (SORRY TIM, NO GOLD BAR FOR ME, BUT I STILL LOVE YOU!). PEOPLE ARE ALREADY SCREAMING “MAMA! MAMA!” AND I SAY, “NO, I AM YOUR DADDY!!!” THE GOLDEN ERA BEGINS IN THE GOLDEN STATE, ALL BECAUSE OF ME, THE PEOPLE’S GOVERNOR, THE CARTOGRAPHER-IN-CHIEF, WHO WILL NOW LET THE PEOPLE VOTE!!! THANK YOU, USA!!! – GCN\n\nIf I might go full r/PeterExplainsTheJoke here, the bit above revolves around the Newsom account mimicking Trump’s tendency to post witless threats and self-aggrandizements in all-caps. Meanwhile, the actual Trump, on his own social media platform, posts strictly within his own version of reality, where deploying the military in Washington DC magically stopped crime, Democrats are twirling their mustaches while plotting to rig elections and the Governor of California is named “Gavin Newscum.” Not even a clever nickname. He foolishly left “Goofy Gavin”, “Blabbin Gavin”, and “Gavin Nonuts” on the table, but no one in the Maga base cares if he’s actually funny, if he has anything witty to say. They like Trump because he’s authentically Trump. He is a fully realized cartoon man impervious to South Park episodes, name-calling and garden variety teasing. Half of the Harris 2024 social media strategy revolved around JD Vance making love to a sofa, but that didn’t translate into actual votes. I guess I can have a mild chuckle in between huffs of misery fumes at the depression factory that is 2025 America.\n\nThis is not to say that Newsom is a worthless twit who has succeeded because of (and in some ways despite) his beautiful head of hair. No, he’s not worthless. The redistricting plan he’s enacted here in California is the only reasonable response to the escalation coming from the right. But what is gained from parody? What does mimicry do for the Democrats? It’s just another instance of the other side reinforcing the notion that Trump dictates the terms of engagement. There is a middle ground between “when they go low, we go high” capitulation and “lol I called myself the ‘CARTOGRAPHER IN CHIEF.’” In order to claw back authority and respectability, the Democrats have to stop trying to be Trump and start trying to be something else. Something coherent. Something relatable. Needling Trump is a great way to get engagement, to guarantee clicks and attention. Believe me, I know. But I’m not the governor of California. I’m basically a less successful, long-lost Krassenstein brother hoping to cash in on #resistance. Until the left figures out how to be something other than a pale shadow of their opponent, we’ll keep wishing it was still 2017.\n\n Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist","summary":"Gavin Newsom has an incredible knack for doing the right thing in the most annoying way possible\n\nIf this Clickhole article is to be believed (it shouldn’t be), California’s governor is looking to get a job in comedy.\n\nThe reality is a bit less appealing: Gavin Newsom wants to be president of the U S.

Elliott Morris found, when comparing 1,500 \"synthetic\" survey respondents and 1,500 real people, that large language models (LLMs) were overall very bad at reflecting the views of actual human respondents.\n\nUsing six OpenAI models — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 nano, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and o4-mini — Morris instructed each LLM to respond as various demographics. In one example, the researcher prompted the LLMs to respond as a white 61-year-old woman in Florida who makes between $50,000 and $75,000 per year and who considers herself a moderate voter.\n\nUsing typical real-world political survey questions, the LLMs were asked things like \"Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?\" and given a five-point scale ranging from \"strongly approve,\" \"slightly approve,\" \"slightly disapprove,\" strongly disapprove\" and \"don't know/not sure.\"\n\nThe results weren't exactly inspiring. The worst-performing model, which was not specified, was 23 points off from the real respondents overall, while the best-performing model, GPT-4o-mini, was 4 points off.\n\nAnd the more closely Morris zoomed in, the worse things looked. As this graphic from the study shows, even the \"voters\" generated by the best-performing model, 4o-mini, veered further from reality as they were instructed to respond as groups who are less well represented in the United States population, like Black, Asian and Pacific Islander respondents.\n\nFor any pollster looking to do a good job, this is a big deal.\n\nImagine, for instance, a presidential campaign crafting its messaging for Black voters using the data above. When it comes to that cohort's disapproval rating of Trump, there was a 15 percentage point difference between what actual people responded versus what 4o-mini predicted, with the AI significantly exaggerating that bloc's disapproval rate for Trump.\n\nObviously, any campaign that used only that AI-generated data would miss the mark — instead of looking at the views of real respondents, it would be looking at a funhouse mirror reflection of a demographic cooked up by a language model with no access to actual data.\n\n\"The performance of our 'synthetic sample' is too poor to be useful for all of our research questions,\" Morris wrote. \"In computing overall population proportions, the technique above produces error rates at a minimum of several percentage points, too large to tolerate in academic, political, and most market-research contexts.\"\n\n\"Synthetic samples generate such high errors at the subgroup level,\" he continued, \"that we do not trust them at all to represent key groups in the population.\"\n\nThese results, while not entirely unexpected, fly in the face of the recent push to use AI-generated responses in political polling regardless of accuracy. One AI polling startup, Aaru, told Semafor after last November's presidential election that even though it incorrectly predicted Kamala Harris would win, its methods were, somehow, still superior to traditional polling.\n\n\"A coin flip is a coin flip. 53-47 is not significantly different from 48-52,\" Aaru cofounder Cameron Fink told the website. \"Statistically speaking, we’re within the margin of error — so we did well.\"\n\nHeck, maybe that's a good enough attitude to get hired by a political campaign — but it's not going to do much help for any candidate trying to win.\n\nMore on AI and politics: AI Powering MAGA Botnet Confused by Trump's Connections to Epstein, Starts Contradicting Itself","summary":"As if the institution of political polling were not already fraught enough, pollsters are now surveying AI instead of real people to cut costs and save time.

Meet Amanda and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump’s continued power grab in the nation’s capital, and his threat to expand his militarized takeover to other Democratic-led cities, is setting up a high-stakes showdown over the country’s democracy that pits him prominently against a familiar political foe: Black women.\n\nOn August 11, Trump declared that crime in the District of Columbia was “out of control,” despite violent crime being at a 30-year low, and directed Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Black woman, to hand over control of the city’s police force. Trump then attempted to oust the city’s police commissioner, a Black woman, and replace her with a White man, before backing down after the city threatened legal action. Now, his Justice Department is investigating the accuracy of the reported crime statistics, which the agency touted in a still-available press release earlier this year.\n\nEarlier this summer, Trump deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over his administration’s immigration raids — the first time in 60 years that a president had taken such action without a governor’s request. Los Angeles is led by Mayor Karen Bass, another Black woman, who confronted the uninvited federal agents in a high-profile exchange at a city park.\n\nUsing the District of Columbia as a template, even though 79 percent of its residents oppose Trump’s actions, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll, the president has, citing crime, threatened to send federal law enforcement back into Los Angeles, and to Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York — all cities led by Democratic Black mayors, including Barbara Lee in Oakland.\n\nAnd the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors. Texas state Rep. Nicole Collier said she was held as a “political prisoner” in the state Capitol overnight this week due to Democrats’ opposition to a Trump-ordered redistricting plan aimed at shoring up U.S. House control in the midterms. Trump, who has lobbed escalating complaints at the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, on Wednesday called for the resignation not of its chair, Jerome Powell, a White man, but its governor, Linda Cook, after his housing finance agency chair launched an investigation into her personal mortgages.\n\nWhile Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross. Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president. It’s converging at an “interesting time,” Carr-Glenn said, given the “simultaneous penalty that Black women face in this country on account of being both Black and women.”\n\n“We have seen Black women really ascending to these roles of political prominence in recent years in ways we haven’t seen before,” said Carr-Glenn, who studies race, ethnicity and politics. She cited big-city mayors like Bowser, Bass and Lee, along with high-profile Trump critic U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett; Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman in the role; and former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose South Asian, Black and gender identities drew related attacks from Trump as the two competed to lead the country in the 2024 elections.\n\n“Black women have certainly been breaking these barriers but it’s also come at a really interesting time in our American government, and our democracy, when we are seeing this rise in authoritarianism,” Carr-Glenn added. “And it presents different challenges for Black women who are trying to really push back against what we’ve seen.”\n\nFor Harris, her identities as a Black, South Asian woman meant enduring and sometimes having to respond to attacks based on her race and gender during the 2024 campaign. Trump amplified suggestions that Harris traded sex to get ahead in her career and questioned whether she was actually Black, suggesting she was deploying her racial identity for political benefit. In the closing weeks of the race, high-profile Trump supporter and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson likened Trump to a dad who was going to spank Harris because she was a “bad little girl.” Then-Trump ally Elon Musk’s super PAC cut an ad that called Harris a “big ol’ c-word,” before eventually saying the “c” stood for communist.\n\nThough Harris’ presidential bid was historic, becoming the first Black woman to be nominated by a major party, she ultimately failed to be elected as the country’s top executive. No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.\n\n“So where is the next place to let the backlash flow? It’s in cities with very visible executives that are Black women,” she said. “This is in many ways a political warning, a political message, to say to these Black women and other Black mayors and other women of color mayors, ‘Your leadership can be challenged, too.’”\n\nVictoria Woodards, the mayor of Tacoma, Washington, and a board of trustees member for the African American Mayors Association, said Black women mayors are resilient despite the realities they face in a job that requires balancing community needs with external pressures from state and federal governments.\n\n“These are women who, despite all of the things that have been in their way or barriers that have come to them, they are still fighting the fight. They are still getting up every day and going to city hall,” she said. “They are still doing the jobs, because that’s what’s required of us.”\n\nWendy Via is co-founder and CEO of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an organization that tracks how online discourse shapes the potential for political violence. Via said the president’s actions against the mayors and their jurisdictions are “part of the authoritarian playbook” to try to crush political opposition. She noted that demonizing them creates an “enemy” that can later be used to justify military action and formal policy that removes rights.\n\n“I do not think it is an accident that the mayors he’s gone after have been Black women, because another trait of authoritarianism is demonizing communities that have a history of being marginalized,” Via said. “When you can send in the troops and it’s a Black woman leader on the receiving end, then it’s not such a big deal to send in the troops — because they’re already the enemy, and they must not be capable of managing their city.”\n\nThe manner in which Trump insults Black women political leaders frequently calls into question their ability and aptitude to do their jobs.\n\nThe president just this week repeated a demand that Crockett, the Dallas-area representative who uses her post on the House Oversight Committee to hold the administration accountable, take an intelligence test. He also put quotation marks around the word congresswoman in a move to delegitimize Crockett’s stature and demeaned the progressive group of mostly women House members of color known as the Squad.\n\nCrockett responded in a fundraising email that “Donald Trump just cannot stop thinking about me. He’s insulted me, challenged me to an IQ test — but now, he’s finally said something I agree with.” She then linked to a social media post in which the president wrote: “Jasmine Crockett is the future of the Democrat party!”\n\nBlack women have also faced physical restraint and even arrest for opposing the president’s actions.\n\nRep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is the first sitting member of Congress to be prosecuted by the Trump administration. She was indicted on three counts of “forcibly impeding” law enforcement during a confrontation earlier this summer outside an ICE facility. She pleaded not guilty, and in a recent court filing argued that her prosecution showed “unconstitutional differential treatment” because the Trump administration dropped cases against defendants facing the same charges over their actions during the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. When McIver denounced as racist Trump’s characterization of his militarized incursion into the District of Columbia as “liberation day,” a White House spokesman called her an “unserious person.”\n\nIn Texas, Collier spent the night in the Capitol alone after she refused a GOP-mandated law enforcement escort to monitor her whereabouts ahead of a vote on the Trump-requested congressional redistricting map, which had previously prompted Democrats to delay the vote by leaving the state, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to order their arrests.\n\n“I thought: ‘Hell no,’” Collier said in a video released to the public.\n\nCollier settled in for her long night on the House floor with a blue eye mask and white-and-red blankets and a small Texas flag that marked a page in the book “African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals.” She abruptly left a video call with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday after someone off screen informed her she faced a felony charge for speaking from the Capitol.\n\nScott said the president may be miscalculating how leaders like Bass and Bowser will respond to his attempts to seize their power — partly because of their own years of experience in politics, and partly because of how the information ecosystem is shaped now. Mayors are able to directly communicate with constituents in ways that may have been more limited in the past. Plus, social media platforms allow the public to see the impact of troops on the streets in these heavily Democratic communities where they are not welcomed.\n\n“There’s a narrative that’s being placed on them, but they’re able to negate those narratives by what they themselves put out there on social media,” she said. “These are folks who are not shying away from the media … they want to talk about what they’re doing.”","summary":"“This is in many ways a political warning, a political message\"","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/23/cities-led-by-black-women-are-the-first-targets-of-trumps-political-power-grab/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/muriel-bowser-2229618529-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 10:00:39","author":"Amanda Becker,Barbara Rodriguez","authors":["Amanda Becker","Barbara Rodriguez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":353537806,"title":"Lisa Cook, Who Broke Ground at the Fed, Faces Attack by Trump","text":"Years before Lisa Cook became President Trump’s latest target in his effort to exert control over the Federal Reserve, she wrote about her experience as one of a relative handful of Black women in a field long dominated by white men.\n\n“Economics is neither a welcoming nor a supportive profession for women,” she and a colleague wrote in a New York Times opinion essay in 2019.

And this time, Gen Z is looking further afield than A24 films, HBO shows and indie bands.They're looking so far back in fact, that they've reached the presidency of George W. Bush, and have anointed the former president as the new it boy du jour, with #BushTok and #BushCore having exploded all over Gen Z's digital watering hole, TikTok.As nostalgia for the Bush presidency sweeps the internet, Newsweek spoke to the experts about why Gen Z is falling in love with Bush.Newsweek has reached out to a media representative for Bush via email for comment.Gen Z's Political LeaningsGen Z occupies a unique space politically, and political polarization is a native tongue for the tech-raised generation.There is a significant gender divide when it comes to America's youngest adult generation: an October poll from the New York Times and Siena College showed a striking 51-point gender divide among Gen Z voters. Women aged 18 to 29 favored former former Vice President Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump by 38 points, while men in this group favored Trump by 13 points.This is the widest gap among any generation. Gen Z's political affiliations, though, can be slippery. Much has been made of how Gen Z men are tilting toward the right, but Trump has largely surrendered all the gains he made with male Gen Z voters in the 2024 election. A CBS News/YouGov survey published in July found that Trump's net approval among 18- to 29-year-olds had all but collapsed—from 55 percent in February to just 28 percent by July.At the same time though, the way Gen Z engages with politics is unconventional compared with previous generations. While the first few months of the Trump presidency have been marked by continuous protests against him and the administration, Gen Z has been noticeably absent from this activism.George Bush's Online RevivalOne video edit of Bush, comprised of different clips of him, has been viewed 1.6 million times. Another edit, which has the text overlay \"George W. Bush Mentality,\" and features clips of him speaking, has been viewed 1 million times, and, a clip of the former president talking about the 2001 film Shrek, has been viewed over 2 million times.Gen Z's fondness for Bush takes different forms. Many videos of him are humorous, with Gen Zers sharing edits of Bush as some kind of inadvertent comedy icon. One clip of Bush speaking to late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, followed by a video edit of the former president, has been viewed over 3 million times, and is captioned \"Funniest Prez?\"In other edits, Bush is positioned with fondness as a sort of lovable grandpa. Other TikToks though, have taken to fully romanticizing the former president.One TikTok, from the account @theclairenecessities, taps Bush for a viral trend about calling off your marriage. The trend involves a clip from the TV show Gossip Girl, where the character Chuck Bass (played by Ed Westwick), tells the character Blair Waldorf (played by Leighton Meester), not to go through with her wedding. In the edit, Westwick saying \"Don't Marry Him,\" can be heard over the Gracie Abrams song, I Love You, I'm Sorry.The @theclairenecessities TikTok has the text overlay, \"when I'm about to walk down the aisle but George W Bush when he found out about 9/11 shows up,\" and is captioned \"In another timeline it was never Laura,\" in a reference to Bush's wife and former first lady, Laura Bush. The top comment on that video, which was liked more than 3000 times reads, \"I've always loved him.\"Newsweek spoke with Lama Mohammed, a tech policy fellow and researcher at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics Policy about the trend.\"In a time where Y2K is back and even trendy among Gen Z, their new fascination with George W. Bush is likely our generation's yearning for 'simpler times,' despite being too young or not alive to remember 9/11 or the Iraq War,\" Mohammed said.\"Clips going viral on TikTok with Bush saying, 'now watch this drive' or 'fool me once, shame on, shame on you,' resurface the former president as an endearing, goofy grandfatherly figure whose 'Bushisms' provide entertainment and even an escape from the current political climate,\" Mohammed added.Newsweek also spoke about the trend with Sarah Burnham, a postdoctoral scholar at Tufts University's Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.\"Young people have always been creative in their digital expression, and media creation is an important part of how they approach politics,\" Burnham said. \"It can be a great way for young people to find community, be exposed to different perspectives and experiences, and make their voices heard. It can also serve as an entry point to other forms of political action.\"\"The fact that youth are looking to the past may be a sign of their dissatisfaction with the present: our research has found that only 16 percent of young people believe democracy is working well for them,\" Burnham added.And there's a nostalgia at play here for an entirely different era of politics.\"Many comments on videos tagged as #Bushcore use past moments to contrast the current administration,\" Mohammed said. \"Users are saying, 'These were like Bush's lowest moments. Somehow they tower over Trump's best,' or 'I would've NEVER thought 20 years ago…I wish he could be president again…I miss him,' representing how unhappy Gen Zers are with contemporary politics.\"\"A recent YouGov/Economist poll shows that President Trump continues to have a significantly low approval rating among young voters—61 percent disapprove. They use Bush's persona as relief, reminiscent of times when there was supposedly more empathy and community in politics,\" she added.This nostalgia isn't necessarily new for Gen Z either. Following the 2024 presidential election, edits comparing debates past and present became popular, with some social media users lamenting how the tone of political debates had changed.And it definitely plays into the fondness for Bush. One TikTok edit, which has been viewed over 800,000 times is solely dedicated to clips of Bush and former first lady Michelle Obama and is captioned \"Love their friendship sm,\" celebrating their positive relationship that existed across party lines.\"In another viral TikTok, Bush discusses sharing values with Mexican Americans—the caption read, \"Back when they had empathy.\" Mohammed told Newsweek. \"Although a Republican, Gen Z has seemed to develop an appreciation for Bush, viewing him as someone sympathetic towards immigrants.\"The Post-Presidency Legacy ShiftBeyond nostalgia, there is another interesting factor at play here: how the popularity of presidents changes after their presidency ends and evolves as the years pass.According to the American Presidency Project, Bush's final presidential approval rating was 34 percent. Former President Jimmy Carter held the exact same final presidential approval rating.In a YouGov ranking of the most popular U.S. presidents for Q2 of 2025, Carter ranks at number 7 with a popularity score of 62 percent, and Bush ranks at 20, with a popularity score of 41 percent. Former President Joe Biden sits just above Bush at 19, with a popularity score of 42 percent. Trump ranks at 25 on that list, with a popularity ranking of 37.\"Those who lived through Bush's presidency likely associate him with the drastic financial and human costs of the Iraq War, the Great Recession following his administration, and his failures to address Hurricane Katrina,\" Mohammed told Newsweek.The trend notably comes ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Many Americans remember the mayhem when Katrina made landfall off Louisiana on August 29, 2005. Nearly 20 years later and the storm has been memorialized as a \"man made disaster.\" Many Gen Zers though, will be too young to remember.\"Repackaging Bush as nostalgia is less about their understanding of his policies and more about their discontent with the current state of American politics. The effect of this dissatisfaction is already taking effect,\" Mohammed said.","summary":"As #BushTok sweeps the Internet, Newsweek spoke to experts about what America's youngest adult generation's fondness for the president means for politics today.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/george-bush-gen-z-tiktok-bushtolk-hurricane-katrina-2117582","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2706994/genz-falling-love-bush.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=794fd91e18e0923ff9116033ba9f8a0b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 09:00:03","author":"Marni Rose McFall","authors":["Marni Rose McFall"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":353525730,"title":"GOP senators push Kamala Harris testimony as House Oversight eyes subpoena","text":"As the 11th member of former President Joe Biden's administration appeared before the House Oversight Committee this week, Fox News Digital asked senators on Capitol Hill if former Vice President Kamala Harris should testify next. \"I think they should take her behind closed doors and figure out what she knows and what she's willing to talk about,\" Sen.

McQuade, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and a U.S. attorney during the Obama administration.\n\n\"One of the reasons prosecutors keep their mouths shut about politics is so that if and when investigative activity is undertaken, there will be no appearance of bias,\" she said. \"In light of all of the threats the Trump administration has made to target his enemies, they have lost any presumption of good faith.\"\n\nIn his seven months back in office, Trump and his administration have used a whole-of-government approach to go after his perceived enemies as well as people and institutions he sees as impeding his agenda, including academic institutions, news organizations and law firms. In doing so, they have not only in many cases put legal and financial pressure on their targets but also sent broader signals about the hefty costs that criticism of Trump could incur.\n\nIn the case of the search of Bolton's home, the developments were accompanied by almost gleeful statements from administration officials. Trump's FBI director, Kash Patel, who before taking office listed Bolton as a member of an executive branch \"deep state,\" posted on social media, \"NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.\" The deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino, reposted Patel, saying, \"Public corruption will not be tolerated.\"\n\nTrump's retribution campaign has long focused on putting his perceived enemies through what he believes he unfairly endured as he was investigated, first by a special counsel during his first term and later by federal and state prosecutors during the Biden administration. In some ways, the search of Bolton's home mirrors the FBI's 2022 search of Trump's Florida home and private club, Mar-a-Lago, to retrieve classified documents he had kept and refused to return after leaving office.\n\nExecuting a search warrant at an individual's home is considered among federal law enforcement's greatest powers. It casts the specter of criminality over the person whose home is being searched, as it typically creates scenes of FBI agents — wearing their trademark windbreakers with the bureau's initials emblazoned on the back — going in and out of the person's home.\n\nExactly those images were beamed out from coverage at Bolton's home Friday as journalists assembled outside to provide live updates on the search. Agents later appeared to be entering Bolton's office in Washington.\n\nFor the FBI to have obtained a search warrant, an agent has to provide an affidavit to a federal judge, who would then have to rule that there was probable cause that there was evidence on the premises that a crime had been committed.\n\nBolton has a long and contentious history with Trump. He served as national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019, often finding himself at odds with the president and his aides. He documented his experience in a book, \"The Room Where it Happened,\" which painted the president as an uninformed leader with authoritarian instincts. It was published only after the administration engaged in a lengthy review of whether it contained classified information.\n\nA foreign policy hawk, Bolton is a frequent guest on cable television news, where he typically sharply criticizes Trump, especially on his handling of Russia, a topic that has been front and center in recent weeks.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 election, Bolton again warned about why he believed Trump was unfit to be president, although he refused to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhen Trump returned to power in early 2024, Trump stacked his administration with officials like Patel who openly embraced his retribution agenda.\n\nDuring the time Bolton worked in the first Trump administration, he helped put together plans that led to Trump ordering the killing of a top Iranian general. Because of Bolton's role in those plans, there was intelligence showing that the Iranians wanted to kill him. To protect Bolton, the federal government provided him with a security detail throughout the Biden administration.\n\nBut just a day after being sworn in, Trump stripped Bolton of his security detail.\n\nDespite losing his security, Bolton continued to publicly take on Trump, including as the FBI raid occurred Friday.","summary":"When federal agents armed with a search warrant showed up at John Bolton's home outside Washington at dawn Friday, it was a display of one of the government's most intimidating powers, in this case deployed against a fierce and high-profile…","url":"https://buffalonews.com/article_3d19fdea-2bc9-5e4f-b4d1-2e4ad77be876.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/6a/96a5b2b3-80b7-58e7-8bb4-3732dad1b647/68a9638cb50f2.image.jpg?crop=898%2C471%2C0%2C69","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 06:45:44","author":"MICHAEL S.

The governor has not officially announced a bid for president. \n\n“That’s a 40-point climb, my goodness gracious! A rising tide of support for Gavin Newsom,” Enten said. “Remember, back in 2023, the majority of Democrats did not want Joe Biden to run for another term; but California Democrats in Gavin Newsom’s home state did not want him to run, either.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the White House for comment. \n\nTensions between the California governor and the president rose amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids across the country. \n\nIn June, Californians took to the streets of Los Angeles to protest against Trump and his ICE raids, leading the president to deploy hundreds of Marines and thousands of National Guard troops to quell demonstrators. Newsom sued the Trump administration for what he called an “unlawful” move.\n\nNewsom’s criticism of Trump has evolved into full-on mockery as he imitates the president’s social media mannerisms while promoting his new push to redraw congressional maps so that California Democrats could gain five more seats before the midterm elections. The move is in response to a Texas Republican effort to pick up five more seats, which Trump told CNBC they are “entitled to.” \n\n“NOT EVEN JD ‘JUST DANCE’ VANCE CAN SAVE TRUMP FROM THE DISASTROUS MAPS ‘WAR’ HE HAS STARTED. NOT EVEN HIS EYELINER LINES LOOK AS PRETTY AS CALIFORNIA ‘MAP’ LINES,” Newsom’s press office wrote on X Saturday, mimicking Trump’s use of capital letters in posts. \n\n“HE WILL FAIL, AS HE ALWAYS DOES (SAD!) AND I, THE PEACETIME GOVERNOR — OUR NATION’S FAVORITE — WILL SAVE AMERICA ONCE AGAIN. MANY ARE NOW CALLING ME GAVIN CHRISTOPHER ‘COLUMBUS’ NEWSOM (BECAUSE OF THE MAPS!). THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. — GCN.”\n\nNewsom also went after Trump on TikTok, where the White House recently made an account. In a video posted Wednesday and captioned, “coming for his neck,” the governor mocked Trump with clips of him stumbling up stairs of Air Force One and getting scared by a Bald Eagle during a 2015 photoshoot.\n\nFor his part, Trump bashed Newsom as “the man who is destroying the once Great State of California,” in a Truth Social post Wednesday night.\n\n“Gavin Newscum is way down in the polls,” the president said. \n\nIn a new Politico/Citrin Center poll, California Democrats said they prefer Newsom over Trump’s 2024 opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, 25 to 19 percent, in a 2028 presidential primary. \n\nEnten explained the importance of home state polling for presidential candidates during Friday’s broadcast. \n\n“If they can’t win the primary in their home state, they ain’t going to win anywhere,” the data guru said.","summary":"For several days the California governor’s social media has been working overtime to troll Trump as their feud has heated up","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/newsom-trump-fight-polling-trolling-b2812856.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/23/2/48/Screenshot-2025-08-22-at-10-45-40-PM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NjEpxGqT-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-23 03:30:17","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.149},{"id":353430896,"title":"Jussie Smollett felt 'extremely emasculated' by outpouring of support after assault story went viral","text":"Former \"Empire\" star Jussie Smollett said he felt \"extremely emasculated\" by the outpouring of support he received after he came forward with his assault allegations. In the Netflix documentary \"The Truth About Jussie Smollett?,\" Smollett spoke about the messages he read on social media rallying behind him after he claimed to have been the victim of a racial and homophobic attack in January 2019. The documentary featured a news clip rounding up messages from A-listers like Viola Davis and John Legend, as well as then-former Vice President Joe Biden, who said, \"Homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.\" FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT TO BYU, THE MEDIA'S HISTORY OF PEDDLING RACE HOAXES A clip of President Donald Trump's reaction was also included, saying at the time that the alleged attack was \"horrible.\" \"There was a moment when I went on social media, and I felt like I was being eulogized,\" Smollett said. \"I felt like I had died, and I was alive to see - and what people were saying was so kind, but it was too much for me.\" \"It made me very uncomfortable, made me very extremely embarrassed. It made me feel extremely emasculated,\" he continued. Later in the documentary, Smollett attempted to fend off the questions that had swirled around the time of the controversy, including why he refused to hand his phone over to the police, which he said was to hide his drug use, as well as why he was walking around at 2 o'clock in the morning. He claimed he \"always did that.\" JUSSIE SMOLLETT CALLS CHICAGO PD AND RAHM EMMANUEL ‘VILLAINS' WHILE DENYING HATE CRIME HOAX In the early hours of Jan. 29, 2019, during a historic polar vortex in Chicago, Smollett alleged he was attacked by two MAGA hat-wearing thugs who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor while he was out getting a Subway sandwich, yelling \"This is MAGA country!\" He claimed the two men assaulted him, poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck. The incident was quickly denounced by the left, including then-Sen. Kamala Harris who called the attack a \"modern day lynching.\" The media similarly offered sympathetic coverage. \"GMA\" anchor Robin Roberts sat down with Smollett for his first interview following the alleged incident, offering minimal skepticism to his claims. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS As it turned out, it was a hoax. Police said Smollett orchestrated the attack, hiring two Nigerian brothers to assault him while wearing red hats. Smollett was later charged and convicted for his crimes against the city of Chicago but was let out of jail just six days into his 150-day sentence. Smollett's conviction was later overturned in 2024, and the actor reached a settlement with the city of Chicago in May.

Greg Abbott pushing through a new congressional map to benefit Republicans and California Gov. Gavin Newsom seeking to do the same for Democrats, Obama lent a weary world his wisdom.\n\n“Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he began in a Wednesday post on X.\n\n“But,” he stipulated.\n\nBut of course.\n\n“Since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Gov. [Gavin] Newsom has approached this,” insisted Obama.\n\n“He’s put forward a smart, measured approach in California, designed to address a very particular problem at a very particular moment in time.”\n\nWho didn’t see that one coming?\n\nObama’s high opinion of himself has only ever been matched by his scorn for the masses.\n\nHe hopes no one will notice his blatant projection: Obama himself personally participated, to put it lightly, in a highly beneficial gerrymander over 20 years ago.\n\nWithout a doubt, the former president’s initial suggestion has merit. \n\nIt would be wonderful if House districts were drawn so as to be maximally representative of discrete communities, and to keep representatives maximally attuned to their constituents’ interests.\n\nPerhaps one day the two parties will come together to ensure as much.\n\nAlas, that’s not the world we live in today.\n\nAs it stands, both sides are locked in an unforgiving battle to enshrine the most structurally advantageous maps into law in as many states as possible.\n\nIn Illinois, where Texas Democrats initially fled to deny Abbott the quorum needed to pass his new map, Democrats represent 14 of 17 districts, or more than 82% of the state.\n\nYet Kamala Harris won Illinois last year by fewer than 11 percentage points, 54.4% to 43.5%.\n\nDemocrats achieved this feat by creating a map so preposterous that even Stephen Colbert felt compelled to ask Prairie State Gov. JB Pritzker about it during an otherwise softball interview.\n\nIn New Jersey, where President Donald Trump won 46% of the vote in 2024, the GOP holds just 25% of the congressional seats.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Trump won 36%, but Republicans hold none of the state’s nine seats.\n\nTrump actually won Nevada, yet Democrats occupy three of its four spots in the House.\n\nAnd in California, where Newsom is supposedly championing a “smart, measured approach” — and where a supposedly independent commission is responsible for redistricting — the GOP is already at a massive disadvantage.\n\nTrump won over 38% of the vote in the country’s largest state, and Republicans represent only about 17% of its districts.\n\n“We’re responding to what occurred in Texas. We’re neutralizing what occurred, and we’re giving the American people a fair chance,” Newsom declared before signing his plan into law on Thursday.\n\nJust how much more lopsided must it be for elections to be “fair” to “the American people,” by which Newsom means “the Democratic Party”?\n\nNow, it’s undeniable that Republicans have also drawn unrepresentative maps in states they control.\n\nWisconsin, Texas and the Carolinas are particularly damning examples.\n\nBut with both Team Red and Team Blue adopting no-holds-barred approaches to redistricting, honest observers must admit that gerrymandering is a bipartisan pastime in which all’s fair — even if it shouldn’t be.\n\nAnd that’s precisely what makes Obama’s claim to the moral high ground so galling.\n\nNewsom has every right to advance his undemocratic map; Obama has every right to support it.\n\nThey ought not insult our intelligence by flattering themselves, though.\n\nThey’re motivated by the same political objectives that Republicans are, not some nobler commitment to principle that excuses their actions — much less makes them deserving of praise.\n\nObama is the same ambitious, self-serving partisan he was back in 2001, when he personally helped draw an Illinois state Senate district to boost his political prospects after falling short in a House campaign the year prior.\n\nThe lines he created gave him new constituents in some of Chicago’s wealthiest neighborhoods — donors he tapped to fuel his ascent to the US Senate and, not long after, the White House. \n\nSo much for only reluctantly endorsing Newsom’s proposal to retaliate against Texas: Obama himself embraced the power of the gerrymander in a smoke-filled room decades ago.\n\nHis haughty tone now is perfectly representative of the Democrats’ collective hero complex.\n\nNot to mention their palpable disdain for the public, whom they believe can be duped into believing in it.\n\nIt adds insult to injury — and sanctimony to sin.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Barack Obama took blue California's side in the redistricting fight with Texas, but his own history with gerrymandering makes his claim to the moral high ground galling.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/22/opinion/hypocrite-obama-scorns-gerrymandering-unless-it-helps-him/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/OB121212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:09:36","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":353425994,"title":"CNN’s Harry Enten Explains Why Gavin Newsom’s Trump Feud Is Earning Him ‘A Rising Tide of Support’ | Video","text":"CNN’s Harry Enten explained how Gavin Newsom’s continued feud with Donald Trump is leading to “a rising tide of support” from voters, particularly California Democrats. \n\nThe network’s chief data analyst explained Friday how the California governor’s many prods and call-outs against the president have only led to his growing success in the polls.\n\n“I absolutely think it’s showing signs of working; and let’s take a look at the voters who know Gavin Newsom best — those voters out in California, those California Democrats,” Enten said. “California Democrats on Newsom for [president].

The governor explained the strategy last week in a press conference.\n\n“I hope it’s a wakeup call. The President of the United States — I’m sort of following his example. And if you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president,” the governor said at the end of the press conference.\n\nHe continued: “So to the extent it’s gotten some attention, I’m pleased.

Now a Netflix Documentary Promises New Insights.","text":"Just when we thought we were finally done with the whirlwind saga of the alleged 2019 hate crime against Empire actor Jussie Smollett—“whirlwind,” of course, being a reference to the shocking twist that Smollett might have been lying about the whole thing—Netflix, in customary fashion, has come a knockin’. A new documentary, The Truth About Jussie Smollett?, which premiered on Friday, seeks to answer its own titular question once and for all. The documentary retells the erratic epic from two perspectives: that of those who maintain, like the Chicago courts decided, that Smollett definitely lied about being attacked by white men in the streets of Chicago, and those who have found so-called evidence that may prove the contrary. Below, I present to you a breakdown of the initial alleged hoax and all of the ways the new documentary is pushing against what we all thought we knew (or what we had forgotten because it was way too confusing to follow at the time).\n\nBefore we even begin to get into this new documentary, can you give me a brief rundown of the initial saga? It was so confusing!\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2019, Jussie Smollett—a Black, openly gay actor who had risen to popularity while on the hit Fox drama series Empire—filed a police report stating that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist hate crime while in downtown Chicago. He alleged that, as he was approaching his residence at around 2 a.m., two masked men, one of whom he said he believed to be white, had shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured “an unknown substance” (which Smollett can be seen identifying as bleach in police bodycam footage that was released much later) on him, and tied a noose around his neck. Upon follow-up questioning, Smollett additionally alleged that the assailants had made references to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Around this time, it was also revealed that the FBI was investigating a letter that had been sent to Fox’s offices in Chicago prior to the alleged attack. The letter was purportedly targeted at Smollett and contained an unidentified white powder. After news of the attack broke, Smollett received a large outpouring of support from fans and fellow notable figures, including Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who both condemned the reported act as an example of an attempted modern-day lynching.\n\nChicago PD began investigating the report as a “possible hate crime” but failed to find significant photo or video footage of the incident, despite the area having a plethora of surveillance cameras. Early skepticism began to emerge online as people questioned Smollett’s recounting of events and cast suspicion upon his initial refusal to submit his cellphone to authorities. (He eventually did submit redacted phone records.) Despite the early doubters, Smollett maintained in his first statement after the alleged attack that he had been cooperating with the authorities and remained “100 percent factual and consistent.” In a live performance staged the day after his statement, Smollett thanked his supporters before infamously, and inexplicably, stating, “I’m the gay Tupac.”\n\nOh, riiiiight. I do remember that—though I still don’t know what it means.\n\nNeither does anyone else. Still, the skepticism never fully subsided, especially not when the authorities detained two persons of interest: Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, brothers of Nigerian descent. It was soon revealed that Smollett personally knew at least Abimbola, who had been hired for a stint as Smollett’s personal trainer and, along with Olabinjo, had been an extra on Empire. The brothers reportedly told investigators that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack after feeling that the threatening letter sent to Fox hadn’t inspired enough alarm. Smollett’s lawyers acknowledged that Smollett knew at least one of the brothers via the aforementioned personal training services but denied the trainer’s involvement in a larger statement refuting Smollett’s own involvement overall, stating: “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”\n\nOn Feb. 20, Smollett was charged by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office with a felony disorderly conduct charge in relation to his filing a police report. Meanwhile, CBS News Chicago journalist Charlie De Mar had tracked down surveillance footage of the Osundairo brothers buying materials believed to be linked to the alleged assault. The following day, Smollett was officially arrested by Chicago PD, who alleged that the actor had orchestrated his own assault because he was hoping the notoriety would help boost his salary on Empire. The authorities claimed that Smollett had sent the aforementioned threatening letter to himself and that he had paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500—in the form of a check made out to Abimbola—to orchestrate the attack. (The check was reportedly labeled as being for a “five-week nutrition/workout” program in preparation for an upcoming music video Smollett was planning to shoot called “Don’t Go.”) On March 8, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts of disorderly conduct. Smollett pleaded not guilty. In a surprising turn that angered both the mayor and police department, on March 26, the prosecutors dropped all charges, not because they found Smollett innocent, but because Smollett had reached a deal to forfeit a $10,000 bond payment and perform some community service in exchange.\n\nYou said the prosecutors dropped the charges, but didn’t Smollett serve time?\n\nA full six days of it! But before we get to that, we need to talk about the civil suit. Following the dropping of the charges, Chicago police ordered Smollett to pay $130,000 to cover the cost of the police investigation (including overtime) into his report, but the actor refused. On April 12, 2019, the city of Chicago filed a civil suit against Smollett, which was met by Smollett with a countersuit. The civil suit was settled in May of this year, six years after the legal battle started, with Smollett agreeing to make a $50,000 donation to a Chicago-based nonprofit. (Separately but surely pointedly, Smollett also promised to make an additional $10,000 donation to the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which aids victims of abuse at the hands of Chicago law enforcement.)\n\nIn June 2019, the Chicago PD released the bodycam footage of the initial officers responding to the call. In it, Smollett is shown with the makeshift noose still around his neck, telling the officers that he kept it on because he wanted them “to see it.” This struck some following the case as an odd and unlikely choice for a Black man who has just been attacked, and would become a sticking point for Smollett’s disbelievers. In August 2019, a special prosecutor was assigned to independently investigate, at the behest of a Cook County Circuit Court judge, the initial charges against Smollett and the prosecutors’ eventual decision to drop those charges. After more than a full year of investigating, on Feb. 12, 2020, Smollett was eventually indicted again by a grand jury, this time with six counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to the police. The special prosecutor claimed that “sufficient factual evidence” was found supporting the notion that the state’s attorney’s office was wrong for dropping the charges. Smollett once again pleaded not guilty. The trial began over a year later in November 2021, and on Dec. 9, 2021, the jury found Smollett guilty of five of the six counts. Smollett was sentenced to 150 days of jail time, 30 months of probation, and ordered to pay $145,000 in a combination of fines and restitution to the Chicago PD. However, the actor only ended up serving six days of his sentence after his legal team launched an appeal. Notably, Smollett maintained his innocence throughout the entire ordeal.\n\nStill, on Nov. 21, 2024, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned Smollett’s conviction.\n\nWait, what?! What does that mean?\n\nIt is common for convictions to get overturned because of legalities, not necessarily because of a change in evidence or the jury’s verdict. Smollett’s lawyers worked on an appeal for years, arguing that their client shouldn’t have been charged again after the state’s attorney’s office dropped its charges in exchange for community service and a bond. Illinois judges agreed that, even if the special prosecutor decided that the prosecutors shouldn’t have dropped the charges, it doesn’t change the fact that they did drop those charges, making it unfair for the court to not honor that earlier agreement to resolve the matter without jail time.\n\nI feel caught up now, for better or for worse. Regardless, let’s move on to the new information in the Netflix documentary. I’m assuming it makes some sort of argument to exonerate Smollett? \n\nYes and no. The Truth About Jussie Smollett? presents two schools of thought when it comes to the actor. The documentary, directed by Gagan Rehill (best known for the Netflix doc Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal), begins primarily with talking-head interviews from two people formerly involved with the case: Melissa Staples, the former chief of detectives for the Chicago police, and Eddie Johnson, former superintendent of the Chicago police. Johnson casts doubt upon Smollett’s story with questions we’re already familiar with, like, for example, why would Smollett keep a noose around his neck? Or, why was Smollett so reluctant to hand over his phone? Additionally, if Smollett had been walking home from a Subway restaurant when he was allegedly attacked, then why was the Subway bag in his hand still in “pristine condition”? Furthermore, Staples walks the audience through the various methods that detectives used to firmly place the Osundairo brothers at the scene, from tracking down surveillance footage to subpoenaing taxi and ride-share records. Johnson brings up Smollett’s bombshell Good Morning America interview shortly after the purported attack, during which Smollett stated that the two figures caught on the surveillance cameras were definitely, without a doubt, his attackers. However, Smollett also maintained that the Osundairo brothers had nothing to do with it. The police’s stance is that those two figures were undoubtedly the Osundairo brothers. Johnson says that Smollett “inadvertently identified two guys to the whole country.”\n\nThe Osundairo brothers are also present in the doc to tell their side of the story, claiming that Smollett asked them to beat him up, with the end goal of posting the surveillance footage caught by his building’s security to social media.\n\nAnd what’s the evidence presented that suggests Smollett might have been telling the truth? \n\nSmollett counters some of the classic points of skepticism early on in the documentary. He alleges that he wasn’t sitting around with the rope around his neck, but that he had “put it back on because we wanted to show them what was happening.” Smollett also acknowledges that he didn’t want to hand over his phone to the police not only because of the sensitive information on it related to other notable figures, but also because “the large thing” that he didn’t want disclosed was his “drug use.” “I had to explain every single eccentricity of mine,” Smollett explains in the doc. “It was like playing whack-a-mole with rumors, with lies … but at a certain point it’s just too many” and “you can’t catch them all.” Smollett explains that he was making “great money,” and wasn’t dissatisfied with his pay (which is the police’s assumed motive). He further clarifies a text he sent to Abimbola, in which he wrote, “May need your help on the low,” by stating that he was referring to “an herbal steroid that was illegal here in the U.S. that could be gotten in Nigeria” and is used to “lose belly fat.”\n\nThe biggest focus of the documentary involves two more witnesses who corroborate Smollett’s side of the story: Anthony Moore, a security guard who was working at a nearby Sheraton hotel that evening, and Rebecca Bell, a neighbor of Smollett’s who was walking her dogs just over an hour before the attack was supposed to have taken place. Both Moore and Bell state that they saw white men in the area that evening. Bell explains that she saw a white man in the neighborhood with what looked to be “a little bit of rope” sticking out the back of his jacket around 12:45 a.m. Moore, who says he flashed his light in the face of one of the assailants near the time of the alleged attack, claims that, though the man was wearing a ski mask, he was clearly a white male. The security guard also notes that the police investigating the case only ever showed him a lineup of exclusively Black men.\n\nTwo figures feature heavily in the last third of the documentary, presenting potential evidence that they believe exonerates Smollett: Abigail Carr, a documentary producer, and Chelli Stanley, a freelance journalist. (Both are listed in this film’s credits as consultants.) Carr and Stanley cast enormous doubt upon the Chicago Police Department. Carr states that she did her own investigating and found that “there was no hard proof connecting the Osundairo brothers to the crime,” from eyewitnesses to forensics. For her part, Stanley says she looked into the law enforcement team handling the case and found that the 38 detectives and supervisors assigned to the case had “a combined 563 misconduct allegations formerly filed against them by the citizens of Chicago, ranging from criminal sexual misconduct to shooting people and selling drugs.” She also states that “one of the first people that showed up on the scene was accused in a formal complaint of homophobic hate speech against a Black man,” though it’s worth noting that Smollett has never mentioned any wrongdoing on the responding officers’ parts when they answered the call. Carr also casts doubt upon Johnson’s integrity by revealing that he was later fired for misconduct for lying and saying he was having a medical episode after officers found him asleep at the wheel in a parked police vehicle, when footage actually showed he had been drinking for a few hours beforehand.\n\nAdditionally, the documentary frames the saga within Chicago’s poor history with, as Stanley puts it, “tampering with” and “hiding” evidence. The doc uses the case of Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old boy whose murder at the hands of a Chicago police officer in 2014 was misrepresented as justified by law enforcement until video of the shooting, released to the public, disproved the preliminary internal police reports. Though the murder happened in 2014, it remained a hot-button issue nationally and within Chicago, pointing at a growing mistrust of local law enforcement at the time of Smollett’s incident. (The implicated officer in the McDonald case was sentenced in January 2019.) The documentary posits, via various talking-head interviews from journalists, that the Chicago Police Department, under a mountain of scrutiny at the time due to the McDonald case, “wanted a win.”\n\nWhile that may be culturally significant in terms of the climate at the time, it does feel a little weird that they use McDonald’s murder so heavily within this documentary about a celebrity who was found guilty by a jury of his peers for staging a fake hate crime. Do they present any other evidence? \n\nStanley and Carr discuss two further pieces of evidence that they believe prove Smollett was telling the truth. The first is a segment of surveillance footage, which appears to be visually brighter than the rest of the footage shown, and which Carr and Stanley claim shows white men at the scene. The second is a video of a conversation between Gloria Rodriguez, the Osundairos’ lawyer, and Olabinjo. In that conversation, Rodriguez is explaining to Olabinjo—who was already a convicted felon and was potentially in some hot water when firearms were discovered at his home during the raid—the difference between an expunged record and a sealed record, specifically telling him, an aspiring actor, that directors, agents, and the like can’t find sealed records. To Carr and Stanley, this conversation is proof that the Osundairos hammered out a deal with law enforcement to claim they were at the scene. However, Rodriguez states that Olabinjo’s record is neither expunged nor sealed, and explains that the police don’t have the authority to seal somebody’s record, making the assertion, in her words, “ridiculous.”\n\nThe documentary ends with Smollett maintaining that he didn’t fabricate a hate crime hoax. And, to cast further doubt, the production team shows the lighter-toned surveillance footage to some of the interviewees and asks them to describe what they see. Both Staples and Johnson say they see an unmasked Black man, both Carr and Stanley say they see a white man, Rodriguez says that she also sees a white man, and Moore says that he sees a Black man.\n\n… I still have so many questions.\n\nTotally. Smollett claims he never changed his story and, from what I can tell, this is true. However, there are many discrepancies that someone has to answer for. If the Osundairo brothers weren’t involved, what were they doing at the scene? If the argument is that they weren’t at the scene, how would the local police know to get a warrant to search their homes to get the so-called leverage of the firearms to then coerce them into giving a false statement? While the focus on the specific video footage in the documentary is interesting, what does it matter if Olabinjo’s documents are neither sealed nor expunged, and if the doc’s own interviewees can’t come to a consensus about the racial identity of the two men in the surveillance footage? Many questions falling on Smollett’s side still stand, too: Why would you hire two Black men to allege you were attacked by white men? All in all, The Truth About Jussie Smollett? seemingly leaves us with the same questions we’ve had for, at this point, more than half a decade—years’ worth of legal back-and-forth that already ended up in a guilty conviction. And that leaves us with just one question: Why make the documentary at all?","summary":"The whole confusing saga, plus the film The Truth About Jussie Smollett?’s new claims, explained.","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2025/08/the-truth-about-jussie-smollett-documentary-netflix-crime-attack-case-now.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/cd6ccc21-8a39-4441-a02c-df8d32e345df.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:53:38","author":"Nadira Goffe","authors":["Nadira Goffe"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":353409738,"title":"Chris Wallace, the son of a ‘60 Minutes’ legend, is now advising CBS’s new owner","text":"Veteran news anchor Chris Wallace, who is the son of 60 Minutes legend Mike Wallace and stepson of former CBS News president Bill Leonard, is now working for one of the investors of CBS’s new parent company and has repeatedly spoken with the network’s new owner.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Wallace revealed that he recently became a senior adviser for news and media investments at RedBird Capital Partners, one of the top investors of Skydance Media, the company that recently bought CBS parent Paramount in an $8 billion merger.\n\n“Mr. Wallace’s role is on the business side of the company, and he reports to Gerry Cardinale, the founder of RedBird,” the Times reported. “He said in an interview that any direct input for CBS News “is T.B.D.,” and that he was as likely to advise on strategy for RedBird’s other media interests, including The Daily Telegraph of London and the digital site Front Office Sports, as he was on, say, ‘60 Minutes.’”\n\nWallace’s new role comes months after he parted ways with CNN following the expiration of his contract. At the time of his departure from CNN, which was precipitated by CNN canceling his two shows and asking him to take a massive pay cut, the 77-year-old broadcaster suggested he would move to podcasting and independent journalism.\n\nInstead, as he told the Times, Wallace eventually decided that he was pretty much done with being in front of the camera and interviewing newsmakers. “I had spent literally half a century booking guests, researching guests and questioning guests, and it just didn’t hold any particular excitement for me,” Wallace said.\n\n“At this point, that isn’t something that’s in the cards,” he added when asked if he’d consider going back in front of the camera. “But having said that — and to mix a metaphor — who knows when an old fire horse wants to answer the bell?”\n\nPrior to his three-year run with CNN, Wallace had spent 18 years as the anchor of Fox News Sunday, where he also moderated two presidential debates. However, after decamping the conservative cable giant for CNN in late 2021, Wallace said Fox News’ hard-right opinion programming made it “unsustainable” for him to remain there. Prior to his time with Fox, Wallace served as the chief White House correspondent for NBC News.\n\nMeanwhile, with speculation swirling around the direction of CBS News under new Paramount chief David Ellison, especially following the politically strained merger process that saw Paramount pay Donald Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview, Wallace maintained that Ellison was a straight shooter.\n\n“I am absolutely convinced that any talk about the new owners wanting to move CBS News in a particular political direction is absolutely mistaken,” Wallace said, adding that Ellison “wants a news organization that lives up to the tradition of Cronkite and Murrow and my dad.”\n\nNotably, after the Paramount merger was officially completed earlier this month, Ellison’s first symbolic stop was to the CBS News offices in New York, where staffers told The Independent that he said “all the right things.”\n\nAt the same time, Wallace declined to talk about the Trump settlement or Paramount handling of 60 Minutes amid the furor over the Kamala Harris interview that sparked Trump’s lawsuit. Amid the previous Paramount leadership’s settlement negotiations with the president, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and the CBS News chief both resigned in protest, claiming their employment became untenable due to corporate interference.\n\nThough he wouldn’t speak about the circumstances surrounding the settlement, Wallace did offer a perspective to the Times when it came to oversight of the network’s flagship news magazine.\n\n“My stepfather, Bill Leonard, helped invent ‘60 Minutes,’ and of course my father was one of the first two anchors. In the early years, and in fact for years thereafter, it was routine that executives of CBS News would screen pieces and comment on them and expect their comments to be acted on,” he said. “I’ve been a little surprised at this notion that somehow ‘60 Minutes’ is an independent entity that isn’t part of CBS News.”\n\nFurthermore, Wallace stated that he has spoken directly to Ellison several times and told the company’s CEO that he wanted “to help him in any way I can.” Still, even as Wallace insists Ellison only has the news division’s best interests at heart, concerns continue to swirl within the network as Ellison has been in talks to purchase Bari Weiss’ “anti-woke” outlet The Free Press, and his father Larry is a well-known Trump ally and megadonor.\n\nIn fact, on Friday morning, Trump heaped praise on Ellison and seemingly indicated that he expected CBS News to give him favorable coverage moving forward.\n\n“I think the news is getting better. They‘re learning that they have no credibility,” Trump gushed. “CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well. A great man. He actually just bought CBS. And I think he‘s going to do the right thing with it.”\n\nEarlier this week, House Democrats sent Ellison a letter demanding documents and correspondence surrounding the Trump administration’s approval of the merger, stating that they were launching an investigation into whether anti-bribery laws were violated.\n\nIn particular, the ranking members of the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees are seeking answers to Trump’s boast that he reached a “side deal” with Ellison to air $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements on CBS as part of the lawsuit settlement, a claim that Ellison has yet to specifically address.\n\nThe lawmakers are also inquiring about Paramount’s decision to cancel the late-night show of outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert days before the merger was approved, as well as Skydance assuring the Federal Communications Commission that it will review “complaints of bias” at CBS News and eliminate all diversity, equity and inclusion policies after it took over Paramount.\n\n“Two wrongs do not make a right—illegitimate demands from the FCC or the Administration do not absolve your company from wrongdoing,” the Democrats' letter to Ellison stated.","summary":"‘I am absolutely convinced that any talk about the new owners wanting to move CBS News in a particular political direction is absolutely mistaken,’ Chris Wallace told The New York Times on Friday.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/chris-wallace-cbs-paramount-david-ellison-b2812687.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/15/21/GettyImages-615754664.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F95riPnZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:48:27","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":353413248,"title":"Head of Pentagon’s intelligence agency fired, officials say","text":"The head of the Pentagon’s intelligence agency has been fired, two U.S. officials told Reuters today, a move the top Democratic lawmaker on the Senate intelligence committee slammed as the latest example of politicizing intelligence by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, who led the Defense Intelligence Agency, was fired. But he is the latest senior military official to have been removed under U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe official, who confirmed Kruse’s removal on condition of anonymity, did not give a reason.\n\n“The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration’s dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country,” said U.S. Senator Mark Warner, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nThe firing was first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nLATEST FIRING\n\nThe move is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to penalize current and former military, intelligence and law enforcement officials whose views have been seen as at odds with Trump.\n\nIn April, Trump fired General Timothy Haugh as director of the National Security Agency, in a purge that included more than a dozen staff at the White House national security council.\n\nHegseth has also gone after uniformed military officials at the Pentagon. In February, he fired Air Force General C.Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was dismissed along with five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership.\n\nThe chief of the U.S. Air Force made a surprise announcement on Monday that he planned to retire only half way through his tenure.\n\nWhile it was not clear exactly why Kruse was fired, it comes after a preliminary DIA assessment leaked to the news media that said the June 22 U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities had set Tehran’s program back only a few months, a finding contradicting Trump’s claim that the targets were “obliterated.”\n\nThe leaking of the assessment, which Reuters also reported, enraged Trump. The White House denounced the top-secret assessment as “flat out wrong,” and Trump attacked CNN, the New York Times and other outlets that obtained the report, calling them “scum” and “FAKE NEWS.”\n\nThe Trump administration has conducted a sweeping purge of U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats that it says is part of an effort to slash the size of the U.S. government, shrinking the federal budget and punishing what it describes as the “politicization or weaponization” of intelligence.\n\nNews of Kruse’s firing came two days after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced that she was revoking on Trump’s orders the security clearances of 37 current and former U.S. intelligence professionals.\n\nThis week’s security clearance revocations were only the latest of scores of such revocations of Trump’s second term. They have included Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election, and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost last year’s vote.\n\nEarlier this week Gabbard also announced the first major overhaul of her office since its creation, slashing personnel by more than 40% by October 1 and saving more than $700 million per year.","summary":"The head of the Pentagon&#8217;s intelligence agency has been fired, two U.S. officials told Reuters today, a move the top Democratic lawmaker on the Senate intelligence committee slammed as the latest example of politicizing intelligence by President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/22/breaking-news/head-of-pentagons-intelligence-agency-fired-officials-say/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/web1_2025-08-22T192333Z_612487536_RC2WKDA9BHTQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MILITARY-INTELLIGENCE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:10:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":353447310,"title":"Ex-Vice President Kamala Harris is bringing her book tour to Philly","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is stopping in Philadelphia next month on her 15-city tour to promote her upcoming book \"107 Days.\" \n\nHarris will speak at the Met Philadelphia on Sept. 25 — two days after the book's release.
