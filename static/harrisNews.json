Last night, I informed @WWE talent relations that I would not be making any appearances for the company as long as this man remains in office. \n\n'Additionally, I will not be signing a new Legends deal when my current one expires in June. I love WWE, will always treasure my time with them, and I am deeply appreciative for all the opportunities they afforded me. \n\n'But, in the words of Popeye the sailor, 'I stands all I can stands, and I can't stands no more.'\n\nOn Tuesday, a source close to the investigation claimed to the Daily Mail that Reiner and his wife Michele were found in bed with their throats cut and may have been asleep when they were murdered.\n\nFoley, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, has been a fixture of the company for decades, portraying characters Mankind, Cactus Jack and Dude Love. \n\nHowever, he has also been increasingly vocal about his political stances, frequently clashing with the wrestling giant's known support for the Trump administration. \n\nFoley was a contributor to Barack Obama's campaign for US presidency back in 2008 and also endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nJust recently, he took to Instagram to heap praise on musician Jack White, who has also been a longstanding Trump critic, about his remarks against the president. \n\nWhite had shared a picture of Trump's comments on Reiner and labelled the president as 'disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child'.\n\nSharing White's post, Foley said: 'What @officialjackwhite said here is spot on.\n\n'How any of my @wwe colleagues can stand by, let alone stand next to this man is beyond me'.\n\nFoley's decision comes in response to a series of attacks launched by President Trump against Reiner just hours after the director and his wife were found dead.\n\n'Well, I wasn't a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person. As far as Trump was concerned,' Trump told a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday.\n\n'I think he hurt himself, career-wise, he became like a deranged person, [with] Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.'\n\nPrior to that, Trump had wrote that Reiner, a 'once very talented movie director and comedy star,' passed away, 'reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease' known as TDS - or Trump Derangement Syndrome. The term is used by conservatives to describe disdain for the Republican President.\n\nTrump's post continued: 'He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness.'\n\nThe vicious statement about the couple's death highlighted Trump's tendency to attack public figures following their passing. The Republican has also ridiculed the late Senator John McCain and General Colin Powell after they died. \n\nReiner famously supported liberal causes and Democratic candidates, even downplaying concerns over Joe Biden's age. 'Look, he's old!' the 78-year-old director explained in a February 2024 interview before Biden dropped out. \n\nReiner also loudly opposed Trump, calling him 'mentally unfit' and repeatedly claiming the Republican is an autocrat in interviews over the years. \n\n'Donald Trump is the single most unqualified human being to ever assume the presidency of the United States,' Reiner told Variety in a 2017 interview. \n\nThe couple's son Nick, 32, is in custody and has been booked for murder after Reiner and Michele were found knifed to death.\n\nThey allegedly had their throats slit after a heated argument with a relative, understood to be Nick, turned deadly at their $13.5 million Los Angeles mansion on Sunday afternoon.\n\nReiner made many of the best-known movies of the 1980s and 1990s, including Stand By Me and The Princess Bride, legal thriller A Few Good Men, and romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally.","summary":"Trump doubled down on his attacks on Reiner, after the Hollywood star and his wife were apparently murdered, and appeared to blame the killings on the liberal director's 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/wwe/article-15389407/mick-foley-cuts-ties-wwe-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/16/16/104777827-0-image-m-20_1765902643275.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 19:18:47","author":"Editor,James Cohen","authors":["Editor","James Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":387320580,"title":"Jennifer Lopez laments over being misunderstood and reveals dream to become a director","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Dec 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRob Reiner's grieving family members seen for first time since director and wife's murder and son's arrest\n\nThe full story of Nick Reiner and these murders is so much more unbearable than everyone thinks.

Democratic state officials, overseeing one of the most generous welfare regimes in the country, are asleep at the switch. And the media, duty-bound by progressive pieties, refuse to connect the dots.”\n\nNow we know why the Democrat governor and the Democrats in power in the state didn’t stop it: They feared offending a “core voting bloc,” the Somalian immigrant community that was perpetrating the fraud.\n\nEvidence shows so far that just one of the frauds was the many child-care facilities set up by the community, and their subsequent claims to have distributed many, many more daycare services or meals than they actually did, inflating their government checks.\n\nEstimates that the schemes cost Minnesota taxpayers at least a billion dollars, much of which was sent by the Somali community back to Somalia, where it found its way into the checkbooks of al-Shabaab terrorists.\n\nAlready, the U.S. Treasury, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Housing and Urban Development are investigating.\n\nNow, an online organization has revealed U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., reading a memo from that Democrat administration about why an investigation was not pursued.\n\n“Here’s what a fraud investigator in the [Minnesota] attorney general’s office said. She said, ‘There is a perception that, I’m quoting now, that forcefully tackling this issue would cause political backlash from the Somali community, which is a core voting bloc for Democrats.”\n\nSenator John Kennedy reads an internal memo from the Minnesota Attorney General’s office\nThey openly say they did not stop the Somalia immigrant fraud because Democrats would lose votes\n“Here’s what a fraud investigator in the Attorney General’s office said. She said, There is… pic.twitter.com/sw9CMBIhUE\n— Wall Street Apes (@WallStreetApes) December 14, 2025\n\nThe reporting organization said, “Seriously, how are Democrats not getting raided and thrown in prison?”\n\nThe Gateway Pundit said the memo, “makes the situation pretty clear.”\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon also documented that 79% of Minnesota voters “think fraud in state programs is either the biggest or a major problem in their state, and just 14 percent think Gov. Tim Walz did enough to stop the fraud, according to a Monday KSTP and Survey USA poll.”\n\n“In total 92 percent of respondents identified the fraud as a problem.

The lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida accused the BBC of interfering with the 2024 presidential election by airing an episode of “Panorama” featuring doctored video of Trump’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, to make it appear he incited the riot at the Capitol building.\n\n“The Panorama Documentary falsely depicted President Trump telling supporters: ‘We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.’ (Falsely depicted at 33:53 of the Documentary),” the complaint says. “President Trump never uttered this sequence of words.”\n\nTelegraph associate editor Gordon Rayner broke down how the video was edited to present the appearance that Trump endorsed the riot in a video posted by the newspaper on YouTube Nov. 3, which was similar to a description of the events in the complaint.\n\n“Moreover, the BBC purposefully omitted President Trump stating, less than one minute after urging supporters to cheer for their senators and congressmen, ‘I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard’ (Remarks made on January 6, 2021, 12:13 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 15:48 into the Speech),” the complaint states.\n\nThe BBC apologized to Trump on Nov. 13 in a letter from chairman Samir Shah after the two top BBC officials resigned following the Prescott dossier’s release, saying the program would not air again.\n\nTrump has won settlements from media outlets over their coverage of him. He secured a $15 million settlement with ABC in December 2024 after he sued the outlet on March 19, 2024, for defamation over “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely saying Trump was found “liable for rape” during a contentious March 10, 2024, appearance by Republican Rep.

The BBC’s director-general and news CEO both stepped down last month. BBC chairman Samir Shah described the edit as an “error of judgment.”\n\nThe controversial documentary featured an edited clip of Trump telling rally-goers: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore.”\n\nBut that clip was an edit of three different sections of Trump’s speech and cut out a nearly hour-long gap to make all that appear as one sentence. Among the portions left out was Trump’s plea to fight “peacefully.”\n\nAdditionally, the BBC documentary took footage of the Proud Boys en route to the Capitol before Trump’s address and made it appear that they were inspired to march over after his remarks at the White House Ellipse.\n\nTrump’s team is seeking a jury trial.\n\nThe BBC has countered that its documentary did not air in the US and is not on any of its streaming services. Trump’s team claims to have standing to sue because US subscribers to BritBox or Americans who use virtual private networks (VPNs) might have seen it.\n\nTrump has fired off lawsuits against multiple media outlets over recent months, such as the Wall Street Journal, over its publication of a birthday card it alleged he wrote to late sex predator Jeffrey Epstein, and a $15 billion suit against the New York Times over its coverage of his 2024 campaign. \n\nThe president enjoyed a lucrative $16 million settlement from CBS News over his lawsuit contending the outlet’s marquee “60 Minutes” program made an unfair edit of former Vice President Kamala Harris to improve her public image.\n\nThe president also notched a $15 million settlement with ABC News over his complaint that anchor George Stephanopoulos wrongly stated he was found liable for rape, when the jury in the E. Jean Carroll case concluded he was liable for sexual abuse.\n\nThe Post contacted the BBC for comment.","summary":"\"I'm suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth, literally,\" Trump said. \"They actually put terrible words in my mouth having to do with January 6th that I didn't say.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/15/us-news/president-trump-slaps-bbc-with-eye-watering-10b-suit-for-alleged-defamatory-editing-of-jan-6-speech/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-1yk4sld5m-1765853890912.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765835921&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eZscbDk7-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-16 03:27:06","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":387304146,"title":"Trump files 'powerhouse' $10 billion lawsuit against BBC over documentary editing his Jan 6 remarks","text":"FIRST ON FOX – President Donald Trump filed a monster $10 billion lawsuit on Monday against the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for its 2024 \"Panorama\" documentary that distorted his Jan. 6 remarks. Trump sued the BBC for both defamation and for a violation of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act for $5 billion apiece, as the president is seeking $10 billion total. The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida Federal Court, was filed in a personal capacity and names BBC and BBC studios productions as defendants. \"The formerly respected and now disgraced BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively doctoring his speech in a brazen attempt to interfere in the 2024 Presidential Election. The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda. President Trump’s powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing,\" a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital. Trump is represented by attorneys Alejandro Brito, Edward Paltzik and Daniel Epstein. The BBC has come under intense scrutiny over the documentary about Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech delivered before the riot at the U.S. Capitol. Critics claim the documentary was wildly misleading because it omitted Trump's call for supporters to protest peacefully. The lawsuit states: \"The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses.\" The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The BBC previously issued an apology for the erroneous edit and said it had pulled the program from its platforms, but a spokesperson for the broadcaster added, \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\" The controversy began with a bombshell report from The Telegraph that featured excerpts from a whistleblower dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, a communications advisor hired by the BBC to review its editorial standards. The whistleblower revealed that a BBC Panorama documentary released last year had a misleading edit of comments Trump made during a rally speech given on Jan. 6, 2021, as he protested the results of the 2020 presidential election. The documentary omitted Trump urging his supporters to protest \"peacefully\" and instead spliced two separate comments made nearly an hour apart, making him appear he was calling for violence. LEGAL ANALYST PREDICTS TRUMP COULD WIN 'CONSIDERABLE' DAMAGES FROM BBC DOCUMENTARY LAWSUIT \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And I'll be there with you. And we fight — we fight like hell,\" the documentary showed Trump saying. In reality, Trump said, \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\" It wasn't until 54 minutes later that Trump called on his supporters to \"fight like hell\" for election integrity. The New York Times referred to the ordeal as \"one of the worst crises in its 103-year history\" of the BBC. The blunder led to the resignations of BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and BBC director-general Tim Davie. The 46-page court filing states that the documentary \"has gained substantial traction and republication across various media in the United States and elsewhere globally\" and the BBC \"used their false and defamatory publications to maliciously disparage and damage President Trump and impugn his reputation.\" Trump’s legal team suggested the defendants \"timed the publication of the Panorama Documentary to be close in time to the 2024 Presidential Election\" and the value of the president’s \"personal brand alone is reasonably estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars.\" \"Business ventures bearing his name generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual revenue. Moreover, the injury to President Trump’s business and personal reputation inflicted by these Defendants, and their efforts to falsely, maliciously, and defamatorily portray President Trump as a violent insurrectionist, continue into the present, thereby causing massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage and injury to his future financial prospects, in addition to continuing to harm his reputation as President of the United States of America,\" the suit states. Trump is seeking a jury trial. EX-BBC DIRECTOR GENERAL TELLS NETWORK THEY SHOULDN'T AGREE TO PAY TRUMP ANY MONEY Trump's lawsuit against the BBC is the latest in a string of legal battles he has had with news organizations. In December 2024, ABC News made a $16 million settlement with Trump and issued an apology after anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely claimed that Trump was found \"liable for rape\" in the president's civil court case against columnist E. Jean Carroll, when in fact, a New York jury found him liable for sexual abuse. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In July, Paramount made a multimillion-dollar settlement with Trump after he accused CBS News of \"election interference\" over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the lead-up to the 2024 election. While CBS News offered no apology or admitted to any wrongdoing, it did implement editorial reforms requiring the raw transcript of all presidential candidates to be released. Trump also reached settlements with Meta, X and YouTube (owned by Google) and has pending lawsuits against The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Des Moines Register and veteran pollster Ann Selzer.","summary":"The BBC has come under intense scrutiny over the documentary about President Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech delivered before the attack on the U.S. Capitol.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-files-powerhouse-10-billion-lawsuit-against-bbc-over-documentary-editing-his-jan-6-remarks","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/trump-bbc-lawsuit-fox-news-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 00:15:45","author":"Brian Flood,Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Brian Flood","Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":387303730,"title":"Rob Reiner, his wife killed in apparent homicide - USA Today","text":"Rob Reiner, the acclaimed Hollywood director and actor, was killed alongside his wife, Michele Singer, in their California home, according to police.\n\nReiner and his wife were found dead in their Brentwood home Sunday afternoon, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said in a Monday press conference.

Expel unassimilated foreigners? Teach Australian police to, I don't know, shoot back right away instead of standing around with their thumbs up their you-know-whats?\"\n\nNah. According to Albanese, what Australia really needs is more gun laws.\n\nThose poor, overworked gun laws — never accomplishing what sensible government and responsible citizens are supposed to do, and always called upon to do even more. \n\n\"People can be radicalized over a period of time,\" Albanese said to the press before Monday's cabinet meeting, without specifying which people. \"[Gun] licenses should not be in perpetuity.”\n\nRevoking a slip of paper from a terrorist... yeah, that ought to get a terrorist to turn in his rifle to the proper authorities.\n\nAustralia's gun laws are already among the strictest in the world, following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania. Automatic and most semiautomatic firearms and shotguns were banned under the National Firearms Agreement passed that year. The NFA based licensing on the premise that gun ownership is a privilege, not a right.\n\nLicenses are granted based on \"genuine reason,\" and self-defense is not among them. Applicants must jump through several hoops including genuine police checks, a 28-day cooling-off period, safety training, and secure storage mandates. Licenses are denied for criminal history, domestic violence, or mental health risks.\n\nOne of the gunman somehow cleared all those hoops, even though, as PJ Media's own Catherine Salgado reported on Sunday, \"was known to police before the attack, though allegedly not as an immediate threat.\"\n\nAnd Another Thing: Remember when lefties prattled on endlessly about addressing the \"root causes\" of crime so they could avoid addressing actual criminals? Now they don't even do that much, with the exception of that time Vice President Kamala Harris toured South America to study the root causes of illegal immigration so the Biden administration could avoid addressing the border they left wide open.\n\nCatherine also reported today that authorities also knew that one of the terrorists \"had ties to an ISIS terror cell.\" Like Catherine, I have trouble squaring that away with those same authorities dismissing any \"immediate threat.\"\n\nHow about a medium-term threat, mate? Is that soon enough?\n\nUnder current Australian gun laws, those \"genuine reasons\" for getting a gun license include recreational hunting, sport shooting, farming and pest control, or occupational needs. Which one of those did either of our terrorists qualify for?\n\nSo Australia has an ISIS cell in Sydney that they don't seem to know what to do with. They had a licensed gun-owner affiliated with that cell who wasn't seen as a threat. They had the police respond at first like Keystone Kops to terror-shooting target at legally disarmed Jews...\n\n...and the solution, of course, is more gun laws.\n\nRecommended: Everything Is Going to Hell — Cheer Up!","url":"https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2025/12/15/ignoring-islamic-threat-aussie-pm-vows-tougher-gun-laws-after-bondi-beach-n4947095","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/349/7b57883e-fd66-42e4-86b2-6232489f22e3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 19:32:00","author":"Stephen Green","authors":["Stephen Green"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":387275340,"title":"The Guardian view on combating Europe’s national populists: protect the less well-off from the winds of change | Editorial","text":"More than a year after the election that handed Donald Trump a decisive comeback victory, the Democratic party has still not released its postmortem analysis.

The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “patriotic” parties in Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) lead the polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters. But among mainstream leaders and parties, it is hard to discern a response that is adequate to troubling times.\n\nThe challenges Europe faces are expensive and era-defining. They include the war in Ukraine, maintaining the momentum of the green transition, addressing demographic change and developing economies that are less vulnerable to bullying by Mr Trump and China. According to the Brussels-based Breugel thinktank, the new age of geopolitical insecurity could require an additional €250bn in annual EU defence spending. Mario Draghi’s report last year on European economic competitiveness demanded massive investment in public goods and infrastructure, to be partly funded by jointly held EU debt.\n\nSuch a fiscal paradigm shift would boost growth figures that have flatlined for years. But at both the pan-European and national levels, there continues to be a lack of boldness when it comes to revenue raising. The EU’s so-called “frugal” nations oppose the idea of collective borrowing, and Brussels’ budget proposals for the next seven years are deeply unambitious. In France, the idea of a wealth tax on the super-rich is overwhelmingly popular with voters. But Emmanuel Macron’s beleaguered centrist government – though desperate to cut its budget deficit – refuses to contemplate such a move.\n\nThe reality is that in the absence of such measures, the less well-off will pay the price of financial adjustment through austerity budgets and greater inequality. Bitter recent disputes over pension cutbacks in both France and Germany testify to a developing struggle over the future of the European social model – a phenomenon that the RN and the AfD have happily exploited to promote a politics of welfare chauvinism. Ms Le Pen’s party, for example, has opposed moves to raise the retirement age and has said that it would target any benefit cuts at non-French nationals.\n\nIn the US, Mr Trump’s pledges to protect blue‑collar interests were deeply disingenuous, as subsequent Medicaid cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy underlined. But in the absence of a convincing progressive counteroffer from the Harris campaign, they worked on the campaign trail. Without a fundamental change in economic approach, social contracts across the continent risk being ripped up. Governments must avoid handing this political gift to the Trumpian forces already on the march in Europe.","summary":"As EU countries face multiple challenges in a new era, they must fight to preserve the continent’s social model.

Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness,” the president posted.\n\n– A beloved director –\n\nDemocratic politicians and Hollywood figures expressed shock over the deaths. \n\nFormer US vice president Kamala Harris was friends with the couple and said on X she was “devastated to learn of their passing,” while former president Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were “heartbroken.”\n\nReiner gave television and movie viewers “some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people,” Obama said on X.\n\nMovie heavyweight John Cusack said he was “at a loss for any words that make sense” about the deaths.\n\nHorror and thriller writer Stephen King, whose novella “The Body” was the basis for Reiner’s 1986 coming-of-age classic “Stand By Me,” lauded a “wonderful friend.”\n\nReiner rose to acting fame as the oafish son-in-law Michael “Meathead” Stivic on groundbreaking 1970s sitcom “All in the Family,” before transitioning to directing. Even as a force behind the camera, he often appeared in cameo roles in his own films.\n\nHe directed the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally,” starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, and famously cast his real-life mother Estelle Reiner to utter the line “I’ll have what she’s having” after Ryan’s classic fake orgasm scene in Katz’s Delicatessen.\n\nHis 1992 thriller “A Few Good Men,” starring Hollywood heavyweights Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.\n\nReiner backed efforts to secure equal marriage rights for LGBTQ people and create California’s First 5 program, which provides child development programs funded by taxes on tobacco products.\n\nHe also helped fundraise for Democratic presidential candidates including Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe was the son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, who won 11 Emmy Awards for his television performances and wrote screenplays with movie greats Mel Brooks and Neil Simon.","summary":"Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife were found dead in their Los Angeles home.

Gallego dejó atrás a algunos de sus colaboradores al buscar apoyo para una compañera demócrata que se postulaba a la alcaldía de la ciudad de mayoría hispana.\n\n“Mucho gusto”, dijo a los feligreses. “Soy Ruben Gallego, de Arizona”, dijo al presentarse sin mencionar que es senador federal.\n\nEl demócrata de Arizona se perfila como una figura crucial para un partido que busca desesperadamente recuperar el apoyo latino que se desvaneció en 2024 con la elección del presidente Donald Trump. Sus viajes en otoño incluyeron Nueva Jersey, Virginia y Florida, donde hizo campaña por los demócratas que posteriormente ganaron sus elecciones. Los estrategas dicen que Gallego demuestra su fuerza como estrella emergente del partido, a la vez que sienta las bases para una candidatura presidencial en 2028, a pesar de no ser tan conocido como Gavin Newsom, el gobernador de California, o Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, legisladora federal.\n\nEs un rol que se cree que Gallego mantendrá el próximo año, cuando los demócratas esperan poner fin al control republicano en el Congreso y contrarrestar la agenda de Trump.\n\n“Ruben Gallego va a ser nuestra arma secreta, no tan secreta”, dijo Maria Cardona, una operadora demócrata de larga trayectoria y miembro del Comité Nacional Demócrata.\n\nUna figura muy solicitada\n\nGallego se encuentra entre los demócratas nombrados como posibles contendientes para 2028 que tuvieron la agenda de viajes más apretada en 2025. Hizo campaña por las candidatas demócratas en las contiendas para el gobierno estatal de Nueva Jersey y Virginia, y para la alcaldía de Miami.\n\n“Ruben les brinda una validación instantánea, no sólo porque su apellido es Gallego”, dijo Chuck Rocha, quien movilizó a los latinos en la candidatura presidencial del senador Bernie Sanders, en 2020, y la de Gallego, en 2024. “Ha sacrificado su vida por su país, creció en un hogar de inmigrantes sin recursos, y ahora es senador federal. Ese es el tipo de persona que quieres a tu lado hablando con los latinos sobre por qué deberían votar por esta mujer blanca”.\n\nEn las elecciones presidenciales de 2024, Trump logró avances en zonas predominantemente puertorriqueñas del este de Pensilvania; transformó el valle del Río Grande, en el sur de Texas; y mejoró sus cifras a lo largo del corredor de la carretera Interestatal 4 de Florida. Lo hizo al centrarse con fuerza en la economía y la seguridad fronteriza.\n\nNo obstante, los resultados de las elecciones recientes han dado indicios de que grupos clave de votantes —incluidos los hispanos—, se alejan de los republicanos. Y en Miami, Eileen Higgins se convirtió en la primera persona demócrata en ser elegida para la alcaldía de la ciudad en casi 30 años.\n\n“Vamos a lugares donde hay una gran población latina”, dijo Gallego a The Associated Press en Miami. “Obviamente, se inclinaron demasiado por Trump la última vez, en nuestra opinión, y queremos hablar con los demócratas, y queremos hablar con los latinos y queremos hablar con los candidatos sobre cómo volver a tener a esa población en nuestra esquina”.\n\nEl propio Gallego superó a la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris en 2024, cuando ganó por más de 2 puntos un escaño en el Senado por Arizona y Trump se alzó con el triunfo en el estado por casi 6 puntos. Y reconoce el mérito del presidente republicano por sus medidas de seguridad fronteriza y, en ocasiones, elogia el estilo directo de Trump de no darle demasiadas vueltas a las propuestas económicas al elaborar su mensaje populista con ideas como “sin impuestos a las propinas”.\n\n“Necesitamos que nos identifiquen como alguien que apoya a la clase trabajadora”, expresó Gallego en un evento reciente.\n\nCómo la asequibilidad es personal\n\nGallego creció en la pobreza en Evergreen Park, un suburbio del área metropolitana de Chicago, y frecuentaba la zona de Little Village, un barrio predominantemente mexicano en el sudoeste de la ciudad. Fue criado por una madre soltera luego que su padre abandonara a la familia y fuera encarcelado por narcotráfico. Gallego trabajó en varios empleos para ayudar a pagar las facturas cuando aún estaba en la preparatoria. Fue aceptado en la Universidad de Harvard, se unió a la infantería de Marina y combatió en Irak con una unidad que sufrió numerosas bajas.\n\n“Todos los demócratas hablan ahora de asequibilidad, asequibilidad, asequibilidad”, dijo Jesse Lehrich, estratega demócrata. “¿Pero cuántos de ellos saben realmente lo que se siente no saber de dónde saldrá el próximo cheque para el alquiler? ¿O no saber cómo van a pagar los comestibles esta semana?”.\n\nLehrich, quien sigue de cerca los viajes y las apariciones en los medios de los contendientes para las elecciones de 2028, agregó que no hay muchos demócratas de alto nivel que hablen como personas comunes, y agregó que, en contraste, Gallego puede “carecer de modales pulidos”.\n\nAl senador, quien anteriormente sirvió en la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos, le gusta alardear de que no escuchó a la clase dirigente de Washington cuando decidió realizar fiestas para ver peleas de box y organizó un rodeo y una exhibición de autos lowrider —clásicos de la cultura chicana—, con lo que desestimó las preocupaciones de que eso será percibido como condescendiente con los partidarios hispanos.\n\nNo da la impresión de ser tan refinado como otros —como Josh Shapiro, el gobernador de Pensilvania, o Pete Buttigieg, exsecretario de Transporte—, pero Lehrich opina que eso podría beneficiar a Gallego porque la gente anhela lo directo.\n\n“Como que se siente que él es perfecto para este momento”, añadió Lehrich.\n\nUn latino en el Partido Republicano\n\nAlgunos estrategas y comentaristas afirman que el Partido Demócrata no ha hecho un buen trabajo a la hora de impulsar a candidatos hispanos a nivel nacional. Les preocupa que los republicanos apoyen a otro exsenador latino, Marco Rubio, el actual secretario de Estado, quien se postuló a la presidencia en 2016 y a quien Trump menciona con frecuencia cuando habla de 2028.\n\nXochitl Hinojosa, comentarista política, dijo que ve la fortaleza de Gallego no sólo en lo atractivo que resulta para los votantes latinos, sino también en un electorado más amplio en áreas en disputa, y enfatiza lo difícil que es para un candidato cruzar la meta cuando el candidato presidencial no lo logra en ese estado.\n\n“Creo que el haber ganado un escaño muy difícil lo ha catapultado a la cima”, dijo Hinojosa. “Los demócratas deben reflexionar que debemos pensar en los latinos si los republicanos tienen a un latino en su papeleta electoral y los demócratas no”.\n\nAl preguntarle sobre una posible candidatura presidencial para 2028, Gallego indicó que es demasiado pronto para responder.\n\n“Pienso en que tengo tres hijos. Y tengo seis años en el Senado”, dilucidó. “Nos vamos a centrar en eso y estamos aquí para ayudar a los demócratas de todo el país. Y veremos qué sucede en el futuro”.","summary":"Por ADRIANA G&#211;MEZ LIC&#211;N MIAMI (AP) &#8212; En una c&#225;lida ma&#241;ana de domingo en Miami, el congresista Ruben Gallego se baj&#243; de un auto y se acerc&#243; a los feligreses que sal&#237;an de una iglesia bajo las palmeras para repartir volantes en este barrio dominicano.

Trump Library Foundation. \n\nPart of that headway was the state of Florida, somewhat controversially, giving Trump a parcel of land appraised at $60 million, but that real estate investors have said could be worth closer to $300 million. \n\nThe land, which had been used as a parking lot for Miami Dade College, is located next to the Freedom Tower, a recently restored landmark on Biscayne Boulevard that represents 'freedom of the press,' having formerly housed the Miami News. \n\nIt's also called the 'Ellis Island of the South,' as the building was used by the federal government to process Cuban refugees in the 1960s, fleeing Communism. \n\nBuilding a Trump library next door to the Freedom Tower has been met with opposition by some groups, who point to the president's hardline immigration policies. \n\nIncluding a 'fake news wing' in a high-rise adjacent to a press freedom monument could also ruffle some feathers. \n\nIt was conservative podcast host Benny Johnson, a former BuzzFeed News reporter who was fired for plagiarism, who gave Eric Trump the idea for a 'fake news wing.' \n\nJohnson pointed to the millions of dollars President Trump has received in settlements from media companies and suggested that those funds could be used to create the wing.\n\n'Please, for the love of God, make the fake news wing of the library sponsored by ABC News and CBS and 60 Minutes and put their logos right up there,' Johnson told Eric Trump during a podcast interview in late October. 'And just show everyone who paid for the fake news of the library.' \n\nEric Trump called Johnson's suggestion 'beautiful.' \n\nThe president's son suggested the wing would be a floor of the planned high-rise building, which Politico reported earlier this month could stretch to 47 stories, as Trump is the 45th and 47th president.\n\nThe high-rise could also include a hotel, restaurant and office space, making it stand out from other presidential library projects. \n\nEric Trump said 'fake news' exhibits could include former Vice President Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interview played on repeat, which Trump's team claimed was deceptively edited ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nCBS said Harris' interview was edited for time, as is customary for most taped television interviews. \n\nStill, Paramount, CBS' parent company, paid Trump a $16 million settlement in July, as the company was trying to finalize an $8 billion sale to Skydance Media, which Trump's FCC approved. \n\nThe settlement was paid specifically to the Trump Library Foundation. \n\nEric Trump also suggested there be an exhibit on Charlottesville, arguing that his father's 'very fine people on both sides' comments got twisted by the mainstream media.\n\n'We can remind people who all these people are,' he continued. 'The fact that Stephanopoulos literally ran the Clinton war room but now they have to fairly moderate debates,' Eric Trump said.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos worked in President Bill Clinton's White House before working for ABC News. \n\n'I will do an entire floor dedicated to the fake news, and I'll have a little trademark in your honor, Benny,' Eric Trump told Johnson.","summary":"President Donald Trump could include a 'fake news wing' as part of his high-rise presidential library that he wants to build in downtown Miami.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15385535/donald-trump-presidential-library-fake-news-wing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/15/17/104742463-0-image-m-13_1765818327336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 18:47:20","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":387311042,"title":"HUD joins other federal authorities investigating $1 billion fraud in Minnesota’s Somali community","text":"The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has joined U.S. Treasury, U.S. Customs and Immigration and other federal authorities investigating what apparently is a massive fraud scheme in the Somali community that has established itself in Minnesota, and has cost American taxpayers a billion dollars or more.\n\nA recent City Journal investigation found that fraud in the Somali immigrant community in Minnesota was taking hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars from taxpayers, and much of it was going to Somalia, where it was delivered into the hands of al-Shabaab terrorists.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, whose investigators already were looking into the scandal, recently confirmed the organizations that shift money from one part of the world to another, from the U.S. to Somalia, for example, are being investigated.\n\nEgregious fraud in Minnesota has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, including funds sent to Somalia through money services businesses (MSBs), which provide financial services outside a formal bank.\nUnder @POTUS’ leadership, the @USTreasury will not stop until we…\n— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) December 12, 2025\n\nNow a report at the Washington Examiner confirms the Department of Housing and Urban Development is joining the project.\n\nIt has sent federal investigators to Minnesota, mainly St. Paul and Minneapolis where resides a huge, as in tens of thousands, community of Somali immigrants.\n\nHUD officials said, in the report, the agency is putting Minnesota “on notice, that we are taking enforcement and fiscal oversight seriously given the rampant fraud.”\n\nThe review will include a look, by officials at its headquarters, of money that has gone through Minnesota’s public housing authorities, in order to make certain there is no fraud going on in federal housing aid.\n\nThe report said the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority spends $108 million annually on housing choice vouchers and public housing, while St. Paul spends $46 million.\n\nThe report explained the main scandal involves Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit group that claims it gave millions of meals to children during the pandemic, and cashed in on payments of $300 million.\n\nAnd HUD Secretary Scott Turner has revealed the department has cut funding for Somalis who have temporary protected status.

Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home in what police described as an apparent homicide. Police said Monday that their son Nick Reiner has been arrested on murder charges.With a career that spanned multiple genres over more than five decades, Rob Reiner is considered a legend by many in the film and television industry. He rose to fame as a comedic actor in the CBS sitcom \"All in the Family,\" and his directing credits include classic titles like \"A Few Good Men,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\"Stephen King said he was \"horrified and saddened\" by the news of the Reiners' deaths in a post shared on X. Reiner's coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me\" was based on King's novella \"The Body,\" and he also went on to direct the 1990 screen adaptation of the author's thriller \"Misery,\" both of which won acclaim. \"Wonderful friend, political ally, and brilliant filmmaker,\" King said. \"Rest in peace, Rob. You always stood by me.\"The actor and television host Jerry O'Connell, who was one of the young co-stars in \"Stand By Me,\" shared an photo on Instagram of himself and Reiner on the set of the 1986 movie. In its caption, he wrote: \"Love you Rob. Sincerely.\"In an interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" O'Connell described Reiner's death as \"surreal\" and reflected on the formative role that Reiner played in his life. \"Rob was like a father to me,\" he said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. ... It's just a sad, shocking day.\"\"What a huge loss,\" wrote Ben Stiller, who said Reiner was one of his favorite directors and praised his \"incredible run of movies.\"\"He made some of the most formative movies for my generation,\" Stiller posted on X. \"'Spinal Tap' is one of the best comedies ever made — and the list goes on. He was a kind caring person who was really really funny. I didn't know him well but was always a fan and I feel a real sadness for those who did, and his family.\"\"Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11,\" actor Virginia Madsen, who appeared in Reiner's 1996 film \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" wrote on Instagram. James Woods, who starred in the same film, said in a post on X that Reiner had fought for him to play that part, and they \"remained good friends ever since.\"Actor Josh Gad called Reiner \"one of the greatest directors of our time.\" His Instagram post included several photos of them together.\"He was a friend. He was simply a beautiful person,\" Gad captioned it. \"Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle were two of the most kind and caring souls you could ever imagine. He cared so much for those who had no voices. This loss is devastating. I cannot express how much this hurts. Love you Rob and Michelle. Thank you for all you gave us.\"Fellow director Joe Russo said he \"can't handle the truth that one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live is gone\" in a post on X, referencing the iconic line from \"A Few Good Men.\"\"We lost one of the few good men. RIP, Rob Reiner,\" Russo added.Actor and Screen Actors Guild president Sean Astin said in a news release that Reiner was \"one of those most significant figures in the history of film and television,\" whose cultural influence \"simply can't be overstated.\"\"All in the Family\" creator Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at age 101, \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary,\" Lear's family said in a statement. The family said they were \"devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner.\"\"Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends,\" the family said.Politicians from California and beyond have spoken out to express their condolences and celebrate Reiner's accomplishments in cinema as well as political activism. Reiner was a vocal advocate for Democratic campaigns and, in California, led initiatives for LGBTQ rights and early childhood development.Former Vice President Kamala Harris said Reiner and his wife \"were dear friends,\" and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, \"are devastated to learn of their passing.\" Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, said Reiner's work \"has impacted generations of Americans.\" \"The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,\" Harris wrote on X. \"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.\" Former House Speaker and current Rep. Nancy Pelosi, of California, described Reiner as \"creative, funny, and beloved\" and said in a statement that she and her family were mourning \"the loss of our very dear friends.\"California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that he's \"heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner,\" while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the Reiners' deaths \"a devastating loss for our city and our country.\"\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass said in a statement.Former President Barack Obama also shared a statement on X, saying, \"Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.

Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues.

One year into his second presidency Trump is facing possibly his most brutal midterms beatdown yet, as economic conditions have complicated his ability to tout the success of his tariff agenda and issues such as the Jeffrey Epstein investigation have allowed Democrats and even his own conservative critics to paint him as increasingly out of touch with regular Americans.\n\nBut there are other parts of the MAGA coalition whose support Trump can seek to turn out even as he works to repair his image among swing voters who backed him over Kamala Harris. Those working class, often rural voters who joined the Trump train in 2016 and swung parts of battleground states such as Pennsylvania to the reddest they’d been in decades could still bolster the MAGA coalition next year. The problem? Experience proves that those voters don’t typically turn out for Republicans unless Trump is on the ballot, too.\n\nEnter the president’s midterm strategy: Near-weekly rallies, two White House insiders told The Washington Post, throughout 2026 to energize the MAGA coalition to the levels of excitement and fervor currently felt by many of the president’s opponents.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of the key minds behind Trump’s 2024 return to power, hinted at the strategy in a podcast interview this month.\n\n\"I haven't quite broken it to him yet, but he's going to campaign like it's 2024 again,” Wiles said on a show run by the right-wing group Moms for America.\n\n“Typically, in the midterms, it’s not about who's sitting at the White House; you localize the election. And you keep the federal officials out of it. We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot,” she continued.\n\nWhile some are questioning the GOP’s strategy for winning an election on behalf of a party whose president is recovering from some of his worst approval ratings ever, it could work in the party’s overall favor. Generating support among low-propensity members of the MAGA coalition may seem to the White House to be Trump’s best option, given the bleeding occurring among his strongest supporters. \n\nThe strategy could be key to saving Senate seats for his party in states such as Ohio, North Carolina and Georgia, which Trump won last year but are the sites of three pitched battles that could decide the upper chamber’s majority next year.\n\nAt the same time, it could put frontline House Republican members in a tight spot. Republicans have been warning for months that members in states such as New York, California and purple states across the country are in danger if the president doesn’t course-correct and refocus on an economic agenda that addresses cost of living issues that are now ranked No. 1 in importance for millions of people. \n\nThe Post reported that advisers including Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Reports have made this argument to Trump personally in recent days.\n\n“To the extent to which we were talking about the economic populism message, he wasn’t as interested as I would have hoped,” Mitchell told the paper.\n\nIn the months immediately ahead, the president’s ability to reform his coalition will likely be decided on two main economic factors: His ability to address cost of living, including grocery, energy and housing prices, and the broader Republican Party’s bid to address an imminent spike in health care premiums for millions of Americans who purchase insurance plans from the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) public exchanges.\n\nSubsidies passed as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act expire at the end of the month, and twin Republican majorities in the House and Senate are scrambling to come up with a plan that can win enough support from the factional House GOP majority as well as win enough Democratic votes to pass the Senate, where it will need votes from seven Democrats to pass the 60-vote filibuster threshold.\n\nThose imminent premium spikes could be the nail in the coffin for Trump’s efforts to repair his image among both low-income and middle-income voters, many of whom will be priced out of their plans entirely as annual costs are expected to double or more in January.","summary":"White House chief of staff says Trump will try and rally his MAGA base to do what it has never done before: Deliver Republicans a midterm wave, John Bowden writes.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rallies-midterms-2026-republicans-b2884917.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/10/0/58/SEI277467341.jpg?crop=5733,3822,x0.5,y0&trim=0,1,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xZ0rVfjz-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-15 17:22:28","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":387289472,"title":"Son arrested after Rob Reiner and wife found dead: U.S. media","text":"Police took Rob Reiner’s son into custody after the Hollywood director of hits including “When Harry Met Sally” and his wife were found dead in their Los Angeles home, U.S. media reported on Monday (December 15, 2025). \n\nNetworks CBS and ABC said Nick Reiner was arrested, and the Los Angeles Times reported he was booked into the Los Angeles County jail on suspicion of murder, citing jail records. \n\nLos Angeles deputy police chief Alan Hamilton had said earlier they were seeking to interview “every family member” of the 78-year-old actor-director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner. \n\nThe bodies were discovered on Sunday (December 14) and police said they were treating the case as an “apparent homicide.” \n\nAs tributes poured in for Reiner, Donald Trump unleashed a crude broadside on the Hollywood icon, appearing to blame the deaths on the director’s “raging” criticism of the U.S. President. \n\nSeveral U.S. news media cited police sources as saying the couple were stabbed, while celebrity news website TMZ, which first broke the story, reported that their throats had been cut by a family member during an argument. \n\nReiner directed classic films including 1984’s rock music mockumentary “This is Spinal Tap,” fantasy gem “The Princess Bride” from 1987, and the 1992 courtroom drama “A Few Good Men.” \n\nHis films spanned everything from laugh-out-loud comedy to searing drama and earned him a global following. \n\nReiner was politically active and an outspoken supporter of progressive causes — potentially a reason for the extraordinary statement by Mr. Trump on Monday (December 15), less than a day after the killings. \n\nWhile movie fans around the world grieved, Mr. Trump claimed Reiner died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” \n\n“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness,” the President posted. \n\nA beloved director \n\nDemocratic politicians and Hollywood figures expressed shock over the deaths. \n\nFormer U.S. vice-president Kamala Harris was friends with the couple and said on X she was “devastated to learn of their passing,” while former president Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were “heartbroken.” \n\nReiner gave television and movie viewers “some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people,” Mr. Obama said on X. \n\nMovie heavyweight John Cusack said he was “at a loss for any words that make sense” about the deaths. \n\nHorror and thriller writer Stephen King, whose novella “The Body” was the basis for Reiner’s 1986 coming-of-age classic “Stand By Me,” lauded a “wonderful friend.” \n\nReiner rose to acting fame as the oafish son-in-law Michael “Meathead” Stivic on groundbreaking 1970s sitcom “All in the Family,” before transitioning to directing. Even as a force behind the camera, he often appeared in cameo roles in his own films. \n\nHe directed the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally,” starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, and famously cast his real-life mother Estelle Reiner to utter the line “I’ll have what she’s having” after Ryan’s classic fake orgasm scene in Katz’s Delicatessen. \n\nHis 1992 thriller “A Few Good Men,” starring Hollywood heavyweights Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. \n\nReiner backed efforts to secure equal marriage rights for LGBTQ people and create California’s First 5 program, which provides child development programs funded by taxes on tobacco products. \n\nHe also helped fundraise for Democratic presidential candidates including Hillary Clinton. \n\nHe was the son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, who won 11 Emmy Awards for his television performances and wrote screenplays with movie greats Mel Brooks and Neil Simon.","summary":"Reiner was politically active and an outspoken supporter of progressive causes — potentially a reason for the extraordinary statement by Donald Trump on Monday (December 15), less than a day after the killings","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/son-arrested-after-rob-reiner-and-wife-found-dead-us-media/article70400277.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/imlz50/article70400301.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-12-15T163154Z_1843222209_RC24HIAK0UMT_RTRMADP_3_PEOPLE-ROB-REINER.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 16:51:21","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.125},{"id":387229566,"title":"Pelosi reveals she and Biden still haven't spoken, rejects premise that she told him to drop out","text":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed in an interview released Saturday that she and former President Joe Biden still have not spoken after she played a role in encouraging him to drop out of the 2024 election.

My conversations with the president were more about let's make sure we're understanding what the polls say, and there are certain attitudes that the public had, had they been taken into consideration. If they had sat down with more pollsters, it might have come to a place where we said, ‘This is it, the president should go,’ but they just decided that their polls were right and that was that.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer after then-President Joe Biden exited the race, showcased an edgier stump speech as she railed against both major parties and the political status quo in an address at the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) winter meeting this past weekend. And California Gov. Gavin Newsom landed the red carpet treatment, as he mingled with delegates during the opening day of the DNC's confab, which was held this year in Los Angeles, home turf to both Harris and Newsom. The main focus for the hundreds of committee members and party officials who attended the summit was reviewing the party's decisive victories in last month's 2025 elections and better than expected performances in this year's special elections, and training sessions to prepare for next year's crucial midterm contests. 21 DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 But with the unofficial start of the next White House race less than a year away, and what's likely to be a bruising battle among Democrats over the party's presidential nominating calendar getting underway, 2028 was also in the spotlight. \"Obviously, we must focus on the midterms,\" Harris said in her Friday speech. \"But Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms. And then after Trump. We need to answer the question. We need to answer the question: what comes next for our party and our democracy?\" Harris argued that \"both parties have failed to hold the public's trust\" and that \"people are done with the status quo, and they're ready to break things to force change.\" 2028 LOOMS LARGE: HARRIS, NEWSOM, PRITZKER CONVERGE AT MAJOR DNC MEETING And Harris, who was swept by President Donald Trump in all key battleground states in the 2024 election, said that Trump is representative of a bigger problem plaguing the nation's politics. \"He and the rise of the MAGA movement, I believe, are a symptom of a failed system that is the result of years of outsourcing and offshoring, financial deregulation, growing income inequality, a broken campaign finance system and endless partisan gridlock all contributing to how we got here today,\" she emphasized. \"The vice president received a very warm and enthusiastic reception,\" a committee member told Fox News Digital. And when she alluded to who would be in contention for the 2028 nomination, some in the room shouted, \"You.\" According to those in the room, Harris also landed a warm welcome less than 24 hours earlier as she spoke at the United Farm Workers annual gala. Expect to see more of Harris in the new year, helping Democrats from coast to coast as the party works to win back congressional majorities in the midterms. And Harris has added more 2026 stops to her book tour promoting \"107 Days,\" her reflections on her abbreviated 2024 presidential campaign. Among the stops is one in South Carolina, a crucial early-voting primary state in the Democratic Party's presidential nominating calendar. SUCCEEDING TRUMP IN 2028: SIX REPUBLICANS TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON While Newsom didn't address the delegates at Friday's general session, he was treated like a VIP on Thursday as he held meetings and mingled with delegates during the opening day of the winter meeting. A DNC committee member who witnessed the commotion told Fox News Digital, \"Newsom received a rock star reception as he was mobbed by party leaders and activists alike while he attempted to walk from meeting to meeting.\" Newsom on Thursday met with the Democratic Party chairs from New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, and Nevada, another crucial early voting state. \"We had a great discussion on a wide range of issues,\" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told Fox News Digital. Newsom's stature in his own party has soared this year, thanks to his very vocal and visual pushback against the president, including his viral social media trolling of Trump and his successful California push to counter the Republican congressional redistricting effort. \"Newsom has shown an ability to stand up to Trump in a bold and highly effective manner without shying away from core democratic values,\" veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital. While both Newsom and Harris made a splash at the DNC winter meeting, they both have plenty of detractors who worry that neither would be electable in 2028 when the Democrats try to win back the White House. And if one or both of them launch presidential campaigns, they'll likely be joined by a large crowd of other contenders. One of those possible White House hopefuls is Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who was also making the rounds during the opening day of the DNC meeting. Fox News Digital confirmed that the billionaire governor helped raise over $1 million for the DNC at a fundraiser Thursday night. A DNC insider said the appearances by Harris, Newsom and Pritzker gave \"them an opportunity to start honing in on a winning message for Democrats in 2028.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP There are more than a dozen other Democrats thought to be potential 2028 White House contenders. And most of them have also been paying visits to the early voting states, as well as parachuting onto the 2025 campaign trail. Among them are Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Wes Moore of Maryland and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan; Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut; progressive superstar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rep. Ro Khanna of California, another leading progressive; and two moderate Democrats, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and former Chicago mayor and former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.","summary":"Early 2028 Democratic presidential race heats up as Kamala Harris delivers edgy speech while Gavin Newsom receives star treatment at DNC meeting.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-heavyweights-harris-newsom-turn-heads-fuel-2028-speculation","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/gavin-newsom-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 16:20:30","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.369},{"id":387294760,"title":"In Wake of Islamic Terror Attack, Australian PM Albanese Warns of Rising Threat of What?","text":"Is anyone surprised that the Left is blaming everything and anything other than the people and ideology responsible for yesterday's Islamic terror attack in Sydney, Australia?

He has also said he spent stretches of his life homeless.\n\nThe entertainment industry was stunned, as the Reiners’ Brentwood home is in a wealthy area where many celebrities live. It’s also the same area where O.J. Simpson was charged with murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.\n\nHere’s what we know about the incident so far.\n\nHow did the Reiners die?\n\nPolice found two bodies at the Reiners’ home around 3:40 p.m. on Sunday after responding to a death investigation. The Los Angeles Police Department called the couple’s death an “apparent homicide.”\n\nAuthorities blocked off the street with yellow tape as police cars and news vans crowded around the Reiners’ home.\n\nAlan Hamilton, LAPD deputy police chief, said authorities were trying to obtain a search warrant for the home. The victims were not initially identified, but Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass confirmed the couple’s deaths. Reiner was 78, and Singer Reiner was 68.\n\n“This is a devastating loss for our city and our country,” Bass wrote on X. “Rob Reiner’s contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice.”\n\nA family member found the couple with their throats cut, TMZ reported, and told police a different family member murdered them.\n\nReiner’s family and major Democrats mourn couple’s death\n\n“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,” they said in a statement.\n\nHamilton said the LAPD will speak to each family member to gather more information on what transpired.\n\n“We’re going to try to speak to every family member that we can to get to the facts of this investigation,” he said.\n\nSeveral major Democrats also mourned Reiner, a large donor to liberal causes.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), and former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed their sorrow on social media.\n\nReiner donated to Democrats as recently as last year, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. He backed Harris in the 2024 presidential election and contributed more than $12,000 to her campaign. His largest donations came in 2020, when he backed former President Joe Biden with more than $100,000 in donations.\n\nHe also supported Obama in 2012 with a $40,000 donation.\n\n“Michelle and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele,” Obama wrote on X.\n\n“Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” he added. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”\n\nNewsom and his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, said they are “heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner,” with the governor adding, “Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.”\n\nHarris, a possible 2028 presidential nominee, said Reiner “has impacted generations of Americans.”\n\n“The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture. Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America’s democracy,” she wrote on X.\n\nWhat was the couple known for?\n\nReiner directed entertainment hits in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Stand by Me, This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride.\n\nHe earned nominations at the Golden Globe Awards for three of those movies, as well as one for 1995’s The American President. Reiner never won a Golden Globe, but was widely acclaimed as a star director.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times said his work had an “astonishing versatility,” as he directed everything from an intense courtroom drama to a romantic comedy.\n\nReiner also worked as an actor, making his mark as Mike “Meathead” Stivic on CBS’s All in the Family, which ran from 1971 to 1979.

On his social media platform of choice, Trump sent insincere condolences while furthering his own agenda, positioning himself as a victim. “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote. “He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\nHowever, the director has received several sincere tributes from friends and past collaborators. Guest and his wife, Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis, released a statement about the Reiners: “Christopher and I are numb and sad and shocked about the violent, tragic deaths of our dear friends Rob and Michele Singer Reiner and our ONLY focus and care right now is for their children and immediate families, and we will offer all support possible to help them,” it read. “There will be plenty of time later to discuss the creative lives we shared and the great political and social impact they both had on the entertainment industry, early childhood development, the fight for gay marriage, and their global care for a world in crisis. We have lost great friends. Please give us time to grieve.”\nThe son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner began his long and varied career in Hollywood as an actor, winning two Primetime Emmys for his role as Meathead (a.k.a. Michael) on Lear’s classic sitcom All in the Family. In the 1980s, Reiner would focus his sights on directing; his first film was the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, starring himself, Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean. Reiner went on to direct a string of critically acclaimed, widely beloved films in a number of genres: coming-of-age (Stand by Me, 1986); fantasy-adventure (The Princess Bride, 1987); romantic comedy (When Harry Met Sally…, 1989); psychological horror (Misery, 1990); and courtroom drama (A Few Good Men, 1992).\nStars of the late filmmaker’s past projects came out in droves to honor him. Elwes, Reiner’s Princess Bride star, posted on Instagram a photo showing two director’s chairs on the set of the movie. “No words,” Elwes wrote in the caption. Jerry O’Connell, who starred in Reiner’s Stand by Me as a child, posted a photo on X of himself and Reiner on the set of that film, adding the simple caption, “Love you, Rob. Sincerely.” Elijah Wood, who starred in Reiner’s much-maligned 1994 film, North, wrote on X that he was “horrified to hear of the passing of Rob Reiner and his wonderful wife Michelle [sic]. So much love to their kids and family.” John Cusack, who starred in Reiner’s 1985 film, The Sure Thing, wrote on X, “Shocked by the death of Rob Reiner - a great man,” while Virginia Madsen, who starred in his 1996 drama, Ghosts of Mississippi, paid tribute to Reiner on Instagram, posting a photo of the two together. “Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11,” she wrote.\nIt wasn’t just former collaborators who paid tribute to Reiner and his wife. Ben Stiller—who, like Reiner, had a famously funny father (that would be Jerry Stiller)—paid tribute to Reiner on X. Although Stiller said he “didn’t know him well,” he expressed “what a huge loss” Reiner’s death was for the entertainment industry.\n“Rob Reiner was one of my favorite directors. He made some of the most formative movies for my generation,” Stiller wrote. “He came out form [sic] behind a huge comedic shadow of the great Carl Reiner and being a tv actor to being a great director who made an incredible run of movies. Spinal Tap is one of the best comedies ever made - and the list goes on. He was a kind caring person who was really really funny.” Bridesmaids director Paul Feig posted a photo of himself with Reiner at Comic-Con in San Diego, saying it was one of his “most cherished pictures.”\n“Rob was my true hero,” Feig continued. “A true visionary titan and a lovely lovely person. One never knows if it’s proper to post during something as tragic as this. But I just want the world to know what so many of us know in the industry. Rob was the best.”\nFellow sitcom actor turned director Ron Howard also expressed his condolences on X. “Our careers and lives intersected often over the decades from Rob writing the pilot script for Happy Days and then as we each shifted from acting careers into directing and producing,” Howard wrote. “He proved to be a superlative filmmaker, a supportive colleague and at all times a dedicated citizen. Rob will be missed on so many levels. My heart goes out to his family and his many close friends.”\nAs Trump was well aware, Reiner was a vocal Democrat—and as such, prominent figures in the Democratic Party have also expressed their condolences. On X, former president Barack Obama wrote that he and Michelle were “heartbroken by the tragic passing” of the Reiners. “Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” he continued. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”\nFormer Speaker of the House and current California congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said she was devastated by the “deadly assault” against Reiner and his wife. “Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities — whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,” she shared on X. “Civically, he was a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.” Former vice president and California senator Kamala Harris also expressed her condolences to the “loved ones” of her “dear friends” the Reiners. “Rob Reiner’s work has impacted generations of Americans. The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,” she wrote on X. “Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America’s democracy.”\nLegendary producer Norman Lear, who created All in the Family and, in the process, gave Reiner his breakthrough role, died at the age of 101 in 2023. Still, his estate released a heartfelt statement on the occasion of Reiner’s death. “The Lear family is devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner,” began the statement. “Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world. Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends. Lyn Lear had remained very close with them and said, ‘The world is unmistakably darker tonight, and we are left bereft.’”","summary":"After Rob Reiner and his wife Michele’s sudden, tragic deaths, celebrities and politicians are posting remembrances of the late filmmaker—while President Trump offers snide condolences to a liberal afflicted with “TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/rob-and-michele-reiner-remembered-hollywood-pays-tribute-to-their-dear-friends","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69402b4d5eb7a1a578dbb360/16:9/w_2256,h_1269,c_limit/450937953","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 15:40:23","author":"Chris Murphy","authors":["Chris Murphy"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.358},{"id":387216936,"title":"Hollywood Director Rob Reiner, Wife’s Deaths Investigated As Homicide","text":"Police were conducting a homicide investigation Monday after Hollywood giant Rob Reiner — director of a string of hits including “When Harry Met Sally” — and his wife, Michele Reiner, were found dead in their Los Angeles home.\n\nAs tributes poured in for Reiner, 78, Los Angeles deputy police chief Alan Hamilton said they were seeking to interview “every family member” of the actor-director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.\n\nThe bodies were discovered Sunday, and police said they were treating the case as an “apparent homicide.”\n\nREAD ALSO: Saudi Sets New Death Penalty Record After Executing 340 In 2025\n\nSeveral US news media cited police sources as saying the couple were stabbed, while celebrity news website TMZ, which first broke the story, reported Monday that their throats had been cut by a family member during an argument.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that a source with knowledge of the investigation said there was no sign of forced entry into the home.\n\nHamilton said no arrests have been made and did not publicly identify any potential suspect or even person of interest.\n\n“I’m not going to confirm whether someone’s being interviewed at this time or not.

Fox News Digital has reached out to several members of the Biden administration with roles directly or tangentially related to the Afghanistan withdrawal and the resettlement of Afghan refugees. SENATOR RENEWS PUSH TO MANDATE VETTING FOR AFGHAN EVACUEES AFTER NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING Inquiries to former President Joe Biden’s office, former Vice President Kamala Harris and a second request to an individual listed as Harris’ literary agent were not returned within a week. Messages sent to former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley [Ret.], as well as via an official at the Princeton University School of Public and International Affairs – where he is listed as a visiting professor – also went unanswered. Milley, though a general, was not in a command position – as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is an advisory role. In that regard, he did not make any operational decisions, but instead was in the president's ear when it came to military advice. Milley later told senators on Capitol Hill that he recommended maintaining a small, 2,500-troop force in Afghanistan. Fox News Digital also reached out to former Central Command (CENTCOM) commander, Gen. Kenneth \"Frank\" McKenzie via his new role at the University of South Florida, for comment – which was not returned. AFGHAN EVACUEE ARRESTED BEFORE DC SHOOTING FEDERALLY CHARGED WITH THREATENING TERROR ATTACK CENTCOM covers the Middle East and was tasked with overseeing security and evacuation operations out of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Messages sent to addresses listed for National Security Adviser Jacob Sullivan and Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer were not returned. Finer is now a visiting fellow at Columbia University’s School of Public and International Affairs, and Sullivan’s wife – Rep. Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., is in her first term in Congress. Sullivan was a key adviser to Biden during the withdrawal and was later pressed by CNN whether he feels \"personally responsible for the failures\" therein. He replied that the \"strategic call President Biden made, looking back three years, history has judged well and will continue to judge well. From the point of view that, if we were still in Afghanistan today, Americans would be fighting and dying; Russia would have more leverage over us; we would be less able to respond to the major strategic challenges we face.\" A woman who answered a line listed for former Secretary of State Antony Blinken redirected Fox News Digital to a press liaison. That request was not returned. Blinken, as leader of the State Department, was the point person for the diplomatic aspect of the withdrawal. He advised Biden on what to do about the Taliban's \"Doha Agreement\" that was forged by the previous Trump administration, while the department coordinated overflight rights, temporary housing and other issues regarding the refugee outflow from Kabul.

Now, many feel they can't afford it.","text":"FEASTERVILLE, Pa. — Fishing through his wallet, David Teeling pulls out a wrinkled newspaper clip showing Donald Trump working the drive-thru of a local McDonald's — this McDonald’s, the very same one where he and a few friends routinely meet to talk politics and sports. Teeling keeps the picture as verifiable proof for those who don’t believe him when he explains what happened: The once and future president turned up in suburban Philadelphia toward the end of the 2024 campaign and scooped French fries for the customers pulling up to the window. “Some people believe me and some don’t, so I keep that,” says Teeling, 70, over a cup of coffee. A year ago, Trump visited this site to make the point that he was attuned to everyday people who felt overlooked in the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris economy. These days, it’s Trump who’s in danger of appearing out of touch. Ahead of midterm elections next year, voters are feeling squeezed by high prices and blaming Trump for not doing enough to ease the cost of living, polling shows. A new NBC News Decision Desk survey shows that 53% of adults have changed their grocery-buying habits to stay within budget, while 55% have cut back on entertainment and “extras” so that they can afford life’s necessities. A sampling of grocery prices shows the price of eggs has dropped 29% since Trump was sworn in, though beef prices are up nearly 13%, chicken prices are up 2% and bread is up 4%. Orange juice prices have climbed 28% since the start of Trump's term, according to Nieslen IQ data in the NBC News grocery price tracker. Overall, an AP-NORC poll found that just 31% of adults approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, the lowest rating he’s notched in either his first or second term. “We can improve those numbers,” John McLaughlin, a Trump pollster, said in an interview. “We did it in 2023 and 2024 and we can do it again. In an election year, Trump will be able to spend more time with voters outside the Beltway.” “The White House doesn’t have a choice but to have President Trump campaign in the midterm elections,” McLaughlin added. “Without Trump on the ballot, it’s hard to get his voters to turn out. If you can’t motivate the Trump voters, we’re not going to win in the midterms.” The White House seems to agree. Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, said in a podcast interview that the idea is to put Trump “on the ballot\" by having him campaign as if it’s 2024 all over again. For Trump, the question is whether he can muster the discipline to consistently deliver a two-part message. He needs to show he grasps that people are struggling while also hammering the point that he’s committed to making their lives better, political strategists say. That’s a tricky balance requiring some humility on Trump’s part, a recognition that “the golden age” he promised at the start of his term is still unrealized. Thus far, Trump blames lingering inflation on Biden, a bogeyman he continues to bash even as the economy bears his imprint with each passing day. He says there is much for voters to cheer, including gas prices, which have fallen from $3.03 a gallon one year ago to $2.92 now; the stock market, where the S&P 500 index is up 16% this year; and new foreign investment in the U.S. totaling trillions of dollars. As for the affordability issue, he calls it a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. On his social media site last week, Trump wrote that “affordability, just 13 months ago, was a disaster for the American people, but now, it’s totally different! Prices are coming down fast.\" Still, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that Trump’s tariffs are pushing inflation higher than the rate would be otherwise. After falling to a low this year of 2.3% in April, inflation rose to 3% in September for the first time since January. September was the last month data was available. Even members of Trump’s own party have said that prices are too high and Republicans can't ignore them. “People aren’t dumb. They know when they go to the grocery store what it costs and what it doesn’t,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told NBC News last week. Michael DuHaime, former political director at the Republican National Committee, put it this way: \"You can continue to talk about Biden or even Obama or Jimmy Carter if you want. The voters will only tolerate it for so long.” Past presidents faced a similar conundrum, with uneven results. No sitting president wants to concede that their economic policies haven’t delivered. Yet a president risks appearing callous by denying what’s obvious to people who can’t afford to buy ground beef at the supermarket. “One of the mistakes we made as part of the Biden team was not leading with more empathy,” Sam Cornale, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee, said in an interview. “We jumped right into trying to explain away the numbers, but voters weren’t feeling it.” An early look at Trump's midterm campaign message unfolded last week when he traveled to a casino resort in the Poconos for a rally devoted to the economy. He showed slides and talked up his record, saying his tariffs are sparking a wave of AI, auto and other types of factory construction. But true to form, he also veered off topic, trashing Biden, Powell, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel, windmills and the African nation of Somalia. “We’re a little behind the 8-ball going into the 2026 election,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, in an interview. “The bottom line on the Republican side is we need to focus on what voters are most concerned about: the economy and the cost of living,\" he said, adding that people don't care \"what happens in Somalia or the Middle East or other places. For the most part, they’re focused on their pocketbooks. So that’s what we need to be focused on.” Back at McDonald’s, there is no sign that Trump once traded his suit jacket for an apron in one of his most memorable campaign stops. In the wake of Trump's visit, Yelp disabled its reviews of the restaurant because of caustic write-ups. On occasion, customers will take pictures of the drive-thru window where Trump made his appearance. The staff has turned over since that time; none of the employees at work on a recent weekday were there when Trump showed up. As a company, McDonald's has faced pressures from what its CEO called a \"two-tier economy.\" A steep drop in traffic from lower-income customers played a part in the company's decision to revive its \"Extra Value Meal\" combos this fall, according to chief executive Chris Kempczinski. Teeling said he’s prepared to be patient while Trump’s economic policies kick in. “It has gone up,” he said of the cost of living. “No question about that. But Trump is a CEO. He can turn these things around. It’s going to take a year, maybe two.” Janice Hall, 72, a retired Philadelphia city employee who was eating a cheeseburger and French fries, agrees. “It’s going to slowly go down,” she said. “We haven’t given it any time yet. It’s not even been a year.” She said she’d vote for Trump again if she could. “I think he’s funny; he’s hysterical. He has a personality,” she said. William Sanginiti, 72, a retired engineer, said over a hamburger and a Coke: “There’s always someone who’s going to complain about something. I’m not. I try to live within my means.” A dissenting note came from one of the regulars. Drinking a coffee, a 76-year-old retired truck driver said he doubts Trump will succeed in reducing prices. He said he’s had to alter his spending habits to make ends meet. “I used to eat a lot of beef; I can’t afford that,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Even when I see reduced prices at different supermarkets, they’re still on the expensive side.” He mentioned the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.4% in September, the highest it has been in the last four years. “A lot of the people who voted for him, they didn’t vote for the layoffs,” he said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-served-mcdonalds-connect-voters-affordability-economy-polling-rcna248821","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251118-donald-trump-mcdonalds-2-es-f3921d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 10:00:40","author":"Peter Nicholas","authors":["Peter Nicholas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":387275460,"title":"Nancy Pelosi calls female US president in her lifetime unlikely: ‘Marble ceiling’","text":"Nancy Pelosi, the outgoing congresswoman and former House speaker, has conceded that she may not see a woman be elected US president in her lifetime.\n\nThe California Democrat said as much in a USA Today interview published on Sunday with her retirement looming after four decades in Congress – and invoked a turn of phrase referring to a metaphorical barrier impeding advancement in a profession that often confronts women and racial minorities.\n\n“It’s not a glass ceiling. It’s a marble ceiling,” Pelosi told the publication while discussing the defeats her party colleagues Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris respectively endured against Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections – as well as institutional resistance she met during her own rise on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I thought certainly the American people are far ahead of the Congress in terms of their acceptance or their enthusiasm for a woman to be president of the United States.”\n\nShe added: “I always thought that a woman would be president of the United States long before a woman would be speaker of the House.”\n\nWith that not occurring, USA Today reported that Pelosi had adjusted her timetable – and even “tempered” her optimism – for when a woman may assume the Oval Office.\n\n“I think it’s … maybe not in my lifetime,” Pelosi, who turns 86 in March, said to the outlet. But she made it a point to predict “within this next generation, there’ll be a woman” serving as US president.\n\nPelosi’s comments in some ways mirror ones delivered by former first lady Michelle Obama in November about whether the US could soon join its North American neighbors Mexico and Canada in having a female chief executive.\n\n“Sadly, we ain’t ready,” the attorney, author and wife of Barack Obama – the US president between 2009 and 2017 – said during a conversation posted on her YouTube page.\n\n“That’s why I’m like: ‘Don’t look at me about running ‘cause you all are lying – you are not ready for a woman.’ We got a lot of growing up to do and there’s still … a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\nNonetheless, Harris, the former US vice-president, has been leading or placing highly in polls of potential 2028 Democratic candidates for the White House. As Axios noted, she also expanded a tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir 107 Days and appeared before the Democratic National Committee in moves interpreted by many as signs that she is potentially gearing up for another presidential run.\n\nPelosi joined Congress in 1988 to represent San Francisco. She won election to the post 20 times and was the first woman to serve as US House speaker, a role she held from 2007 to 2011 and 2019 to 2023.\n\nIn the USA Today interview, she revisited her role in convincing Joe Biden, her fellow Democrat and longtime political friend, to drop out of seeking re-election to the White House in 2024. She said she and Biden have not spoken ever since he shelved his 2024 campaign before Trump – whom he defeated four years earlier – won a second term.\n\n“I’m saddened by it because I love him and I respect him,” Pelosi told USA Today of her estrangement from Biden. “But I respect his decision in that regard.”\n\nPelosi did say that she was grateful Biden issued a statement declaring her “the best speaker of the House in American history” when she announced in November that she would retire at the end of her final term in January 2027.\n\nOf her decision to retire as an octogenarian, Pelosi said to the publication, “It was time. I mean – I’ve been ready for a while.”\n\nPelosi also reportedly said, with an exasperated tone, that she is commonly asked: “What are you going to do next?”\n\nPelosi told USA Today she mostly replies with something to the effect of: “I don’t have to do anything – I’m old!”","summary":"Former House speaker, 85, expects woman to assume Oval Office this generation but concedes she may not live to see it\n\nNancy Pelosi, the outgoing congresswoman and former House speaker, has conceded that she may not see a woman be elected US president in her lifetime.\n\nThe California Democrat said as much in a USA Today interview published on Sunday with her retirement looming after four decades in Congress – and invoked a turn of phrase referring to a metaphorical barrier impeding advancement in a profession that often confronts women and racial minorities.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac809c2c649abb38a17a9fc0f7f1432010e553e1/397_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 10:00:29","author":"Ramon Antonio Vargas","authors":["Ramon Antonio Vargas"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.179},{"id":387168258,"title":"Former Israeli hostage: Trump’s election instilled fear in Hamas captors","text":"Omer Shem Tov, a 20-year-old Israeli who was held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip for 505 days, has recounted how Donald Trump’s election as U.S. President dramatically altered the behavior of his captors. \n\nKidnapped during the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, Shem Tov shared his experiences in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n“As soon as Trump was elected, I saw the fear in their eyes,” he said. “They knew the situation was going to change… they were very frightened.” According to Shem Tov, this fear led to noticeable changes in his treatment and daily life in captivity after Trump’s victory on November 5, 2024.\n\nDuring the final five months of his detention, Shem Tov was forced to dig, clean, and move explosives in Hamas tunnels, while also carrying food. He described significant stockpiles of supplies kept by his captors, contrasted with the meager rations he received, often only a few biscuits.\n\nShem Tov learned the results of the American election from his captors, who had a television in the tunnels and primarily watched Al Jazeera. He overheard discussions expressing their hope that Kamala Harris would win. “After the election, everything changed,” he said. “The amount of food, their behavior—everything indicated they were preparing for something bigger.” He also described enduring his 21st birthday in captivity, a day marked by fear, extreme hunger, and mistreatment.\n\nReleased in February 2025 under a hostage agreement, Shem Tov later traveled to Washington and met with Donald Trump at the White House. “I told him that many in Israel believed he had been sent by God to help bring back the hostages,” he said.

Gavin Newsom – the current Democratic frontrunner – would figure to have a slightly easier path to the Oval Office, assuming he wins the nomination.\n\nThat being said, while Newsom has very successfully built his national profile, it would be a mistake to overlook his numerous vulnerabilities, any of which could derail his presidential ambitions.\n\nCertainly, the biggest risk to Newsom is his own record in California. \n\nIndeed, the Golden State ranks #50 in affordability according to a US News & World Report ranking at a time when that issue is paramount. \n\nMoreover, despite having the nation’s top-ranked business environment, an economy bigger than India or the United Kingdom, and the benefit of being the home of Silicon Valley, California ranks near the bottom on economic growth (45th). \n\nWorse still, even with California’s tax rate among the highest in the country, the state ranks 42nd in terms of its fiscal stability.\n\nTo be sure, mismanaging California’s finances has been a feature – rather than a bug – of Newsom’s tenure. \n\nFrom FY 2018-2019 – the year before Newsom took office – California’s budget has grown by roughly 61%, a staggering figure.\n\nCalifornia’s $18 billion shortfall – the fourth consecutive year with a deficit – is set to nearly double to $35 billion by FY 2027-2028 according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst Office.\n\nTo that end, it’s not simply that Newsom oversaw massive spending and government expansion that makes him particularly vulnerable on his record. \n\nRather, it’s that despite significant spending, Newsom has not delivered solutions to the real problems facing the state.\n\nHomelessness – which California has spent $24 billion combatting since 2019 per analysis from the Hoover Institution – continues to plague the state. \n\nIn fact, from 2019 to 2024, the homeless population increased by “about 30,000, to more than 181,000….California spent the equivalent of about $160,000 per person (based on the 2019 figure)” over five years, yet the situation has only gotten worse.\n\nGoing hand in hand with homelessness is the crime situation. Ranking just 43rd on public safety is not a record to stand on when Americans are concerned about the safety of our streets.\n\nThe same goes for immigration, where Newsom took center stage pushing back on Trump.\n\nAmericans may dislike Trump’s heavy-handedness when it comes to deportations, but they do not want candidates advocating for open borders and amnesty for all.\n\nIt’s easy to imagine Newsom’s Republican – or Democrat – opponents seizing on perceptions of him as weak on crime and too far-left on immigration to hammer him in swing states.\n\nTo be clear, this is not to say Newsom has no shot. \n\nRight now, he’d likely win the Democratic nomination and then could very well win the general election. \n\nFresh off a high profile Proposition 50 win, Newsom’s popularity has soared at home, reaching 56% favorability in polling from the Public Policy Institute of California – up 10-points from June. \n\nSimilarly, he remains the top choice among Democrats for their party’s 2028 nominee, leading Kamala Harris by 6-points (26% to 20%) per RealClearPolitics.\n\nNewsom has also emerged as the most vocal Democratic leader at a time when the party has a large leadership vacuum. \n\nFurther, he is an extremely savvy politician who has taken steps to shift perceptions that he is too far-left. \n\nThis much was on display when Democrats were shunning anyone opposed to their platform, yet Newsom hosted right-wing stalwarts Steve Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk on his podcast. \n\nHe’s also gone on Fox News for debates with conservative hosts, and – vocally at least – come out against some far-left policies as a way of trying to remedy his vulnerabilities.\n\nConversely, California is not remotely representative of the country as a whole.\n\nThus, Newsom’s popularity is unlikely to translate, and it’s dubious whether his rhetoric will make up for his record.\n\nPut another way, Newsom has an uphill challenge convincing voters across the country that his leadership of California qualifies him to lead the country. \n\nWith that in mind, consider California’s problems rebuilding following the Palisades fire.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported, “reminders are everywhere that public officials failed to prepare, failed to respond, and have spent much of the time since…failing to allow homeowners to rebuild.”\n\nEven after the state government – with Newsom’s urging – took steps to cut regulations, the first home in the Palisades was just rebuilt. \n\nThe house cannot be occupied – it’s a show home – yet the fact that just one of the 6,837 structures to be destroyed has been rebuilt is hardly an endorsement of Newsom’s management skills.\n\nFinally, Newsom’s full-throated defense of former President Biden during the 2024 campaign may come back to haunt him.\n\nWhen concerns were growing louder over Biden’s competency, Newsom was one of his staunchest allies, setting up uncomfortable questions over whether Newsom lied to the American people or could not see what millions of voters clearly saw. \n\nUltimately, in spite of these vulnerabilities, Newsom must be considered Democrats’ most likely nominee. He has a larger national profile than virtually any other Democrat, and his ambitions have been obvious for years. \n\nIf he’s successful in the primary, he very well may win a general election if voters are desperate for change from a Trump administration that’s increasingly unpopular.\n\nBut make no mistake, a Gavin Newsom presidency is certainly not a foregone conclusion. Polished as he is, Newsom’s record will come back to bite. And, popular as he may be among Democrats, swing voters in purple states will decide the 2028 election – and they may be more hesitant to buy what he is selling.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Polished as he is, Newsom’s record will come back to bite.

The bodies of the acclaimed actor and director, 78, and his 68-year-old spouse were found at their Brentwood property on Sunday (December 14), with Los Angeles Police confirming they are probing an \"apparent homicide\". As new details emerges from the disturbing case and the devastated family confirmed \"the tragic passing\" of their beloved ones, the Daily Star uncovers everything that we know so far about their deaths. On Sunday night, People magazine reported that Nick Reiner was allegedly involved. The New York Post identified the 32-year-old as a person of interest in the case. However, authorities have not yet verified these claims. The family’s struggles were previously depicted in a film that Rob and Nick co-created a decade ago. Nick Reiner has reportedly battled addiction for many years, a struggle that became the focus of the family’s semi-autobiographical 2015 drama, Being Charlie, The Hollywood Reporter reported. Being Charlie, co-written by Nick Reiner and directed by dad Rob, was a brutally honest look at their family’s battle with Nick’s addiction, with Cary Elwes and Nick Robinson playing their on-screen stand-ins. The film, which debuted at TIFF in 2015, didn’t sugarcoat the chaos as Rob admitted, “When Nick would tell us that it wasn’t working for him, we wouldn’t listen… we listened to [the experts] when we should have been listening to our son.” Michele added: “We were so influenced by these people. They would tell us he’s a liar… and we believed them.” Nick, reflecting on his lowest point, shared: “I got sick of it… I’m not supposed to be out there on the streets and in homeless shelters doing all these … things.” At a Q&A, Rob confessed: “we didn’t set out for it to be cathartic or for it to be therapeutic, but it turned out to be that,” though Nick admitted: “Sometimes it would get overwhelming for me.” Critics said the film exposed “two warring agendas”, a son desperate to show recovery isn’t simple, and a dad hoping for happy endings that aren’t so easy to find. Law enforcement insiders revealed to TMZ.com that the victims at the Brentwood residence sustained wounds \"consistent with a knife [attack]\", though LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton stressed that officers have not yet pinpointed a suspect. At a press briefing, he stated: \"We have not identified a suspect at this time. No one has been detained.\" PEOPLE confirmed the Los Angeles Fire Department rushed to the couple's residence at approximately 3:30 p. m. on Sunday afternoon to deliver medical assistance, but discovered the pair had already died. The Los Angeles Police Department subsequently verified that the inquiry into this tragedy is being spearheaded by the robbery homicide division, who are handling the deaths as an \"apparent homicide\". A post on X (formerly known as Twitter) from LA Police Department's media relations division read: \"On December 14th, at 3:40 pm, LAPD officers responded to a death investigation in the 200 block of S. Chadbourne Ave. Inside the residence, officers discovered 2 decedents. \"The identity of the decedents has not yet been confirmed. Robbery Homicide Division (RHD) responded to the residence, which has been identified as the home of Rob Reiner. \"At this time, no further details are available as this is an ongoing RHD investigation, into an apparent homicide.\" LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said investigators need to get a search warrant to conduct a “full crime scene investigation” at Rob Reiner’s home, CNN reported. He told media: “We’re waiting for the legal process to move forward. \"We have to obtain a search warrant for the residence. Once that is complied with, we will be conducting a full crime scene investigation on the interior and exterior of the residence and the surrounding neighborhood.” The house is in the exact same state as it was when the officers arrived, Hamilton said, as per CNN. Former US President Barack Obama wrote on X that he and his wife, Michelle, are “heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele”. He said: “Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. \"But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.” Former US Vice President Kamala Harris described Rob and Michele Reiner as “dear friends” on X, as she wrote: “Rob Reiner’s work has impacted generations of Americans. \"The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture. Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America’s democracy. “Rob and his wife Michele loved each other very much. They were dear friends, and Doug and I are devastated to learn of their passing. \"Our thoughts are with their loved ones during this tragic time.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has since paid her respects to the couple, stating: \"This is a devastating loss for our city and our country. \"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice. An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others. \"Personally, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob and his wife Michele. I knew Rob and have tremendous respect for him.\" She continued: \"I want to thank all of the first responders who were called to this tragic event. The investigation is ongoing. \"I'm holding all who loved Rob and Michele in my heart.\" California Governor Gavin Newsom also expressed his condolences, saying: \"Rob was the big-hearted genius behind so many of the classic stories we love, with projects as wide-ranging as The Princess Bride to A Few Good Men. \"His boundless empathy made his stories timeless, teaching generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others – and encouraging us to dream bigger. That empathy extended well beyond his films. Rob was a passionate advocate for children and for civil rights - from taking on Big Tobacco to fighting for marriage equality to serving as a powerful voice in early education. \"He made California a better place through his good works. Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.\" Michele Singer Reiner, who tragically died alongside her husband of over 30 years, was a multi-talented creative force in Hollywood. She launched her career as a photographer, contributing to projects like the “MysteryDisc” video game series and the acclaimed thriller “Misery”, directed by Rob Reiner. Michele also stepped in front of the camera, appearing in Nora Ephron’s holiday comedy “Mixed Nuts”. As a producer, she played a key role in several of her husband’s films, including “Shock and Awe” and the recently released “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues”. Her work on the documentary “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,” which Rob directed, earned her an Emmy nomination. Michele’s producing credits also include “God & Country,” a documentary exploring Christian nationalism in America. Reiner, the son of actor/director Carl Reiner and actress/singer Estelle Reiner, launched his Hollywood career as an actor, portraying Mike 'Meathead' Stivic in the popular sitcom All in the Family from 1971 to 1979. This role bagged him two Primetime Emmy Awards. His acting portfolio also includes roles in the 1993 rom-com Sleepless in Seattle, The First Wives Club in 1996, the 1998 thriller Primary Colors, and the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. However, he is most renowned for his directing work, which began in the early 1980s with the 1984 music mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap. He then directed Stand by Me (1986), the 1987 fantasy adventure The Princess Bride, and the 1989 rom-com When Harry Met Sally... It was during this time that he met his wife Michele. Reiner continued his directorial journey with the Stephen King adaptation Misery in 1990 and the courtroom drama A Few Good Men in 1992, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. His other films include 1995's The American President, And So It Goes in 2014, and 2017's Shock and Awe. His final film saw him return to his roots, bringing Spinal Tap back to the big screen for a sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, which premiered earlier this year. Reiner was wedded to Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981, during which time he adopted her daughter from a previous relationship, the actress Tracy Reiner. Subsequently, he tied the knot with photographer Michele, whom he met while filming When Harry Met Sally... The couple went on to have three children together, Jake, Nick and Romy.

The official could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Investigators believe they suffered stab wounds and a family member is being questioned. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3.30pm on Sunday (local time) and found a 78-year-old man and 68-year-old woman dead inside. Detectives with the Robbery Homicide Division were investigating an \"apparent homicide\" at Reiner&apos;s home, said captain Mike Bland of the Los Angeles Police Department. A spokesperson for the Reiner family confirmed their deaths in a statement to media on Sunday evening. \"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,\" the family spokesperson said in a statement reported by the Guardian. \"We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.\" Los Angeles police have not confirmed the identities of the people found dead at the residence in the upscale Brentwood neighbourhood. There was an outpouring of grief on social media, including from former US president Barack Obama, who said he and his wife Michelle were \"heartbroken\" by the news. \"They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,\" Obama wrote. Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass said Reiner’s death was a \"devastating loss for our city and country\". \"Rob Reiner’s contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" she said. Former US vice president Kamala Harris said Reiner&apos;s \"work has impacted generations of Americans\", saying the director \"fought for America&apos;s democracy\". Reiner is one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, and his work includes some of the most memorable movies of the 1980s and &apos;90s, including This is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride. His role as Meathead in the 1970s TV classic All in the Family, alongside Carol O&apos;Connor&apos;s Archie Bunker, catapulted him to fame. Reiner turned 78 in March. The son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner has been married to photographer Michele Singer Reiner since 1989. The two met while he was directing When Harry Met Sally and have three children together. Reiner was previously married to actor-director Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981. He adopted her daughter, Tracy Reiner. Carl Reiner died in 2020 at age 98 and Marshall died in 2018. Killings are rare in the Brentwood neighbourhood. The scene is about 2km from the home where O.J.

'Just a really special man. A terrible day'","text":"Rob Reiner was known to millions as a TV actor and film director. But the Brentwood resident, known for the classic films \"Stand by Me\" and \"When Harry Met Sally,\" was also a political force, an outspoken supporter of progressive causes and a Democratic Party activist who went beyond the typical role of celebrities who host glitzy fundraisers. Reiner was deeply involved in issues that he cared about, such as early childhood education and the legalization of gay marriage. Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michelle Singer Reiner, were found dead inside his home Sunday, sparking an outpouring of grief from those who worked with him on a variety of causes. Ace Smith — a veteran Democratic strategist to former Vice President Kamala Harris, Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Gov. Jerry Brown and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — had known Reiner for decades. Reiner, he said, approached politics differently than most celebrities. \"Here's this unique human being who really did make the leap between entertainment and politics,\" Smith said. \"And he really spent the time to understand policy, really, in its true depth, and to make a huge impact in California.\" Reiner was a co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, the organization that successfully led the fight to overturn Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage. He was active in children's issues through the years, having led the campaign to pass Proposition 10, the California Children and Families Initiative, which created an ambitious program of early childhood development services. Proposition 10 was considered landmark policy. Reiner enlisted help in that effort from Steven Spielberg, Robin Williams, and his own father, comedy legend Carl Reiner. \"He wanted to make a difference. And he did, and he did profoundly,” Smith said. After Proposition 10 passed, Reiner was named the chair of the California Children and Families Commission, also known as First 5 California. He resigned from the post in early 2006 after the commission ran $23 million in ads touting the importance of preschool as Reiner was gathering support for Proposition 82. The measure, which was unsuccessful, would have taxed the wealthy to create universal preschool in California. The filmmaker and his wife spent more than $6 million on the failed proposition. They also donated significant sums to support national Democratic Party groups and candidates including Jerry Brown, Gray Davis, Ed Rendell and Andrew Cuomo. Bruce Fuller, a UC Berkeley professor of education and public policy, called Reiner \"a caring and vigilant advocate for children. He added cachet and cash to California's movement to open preschools for tens of thousands of young families over the past quarter-century.\" Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who had known Reiner since he was a state lawmaker in the 1990s, worked with him on Proposition 10 and was impressed with how Reiner embraced the cause. \"He was a man with a good answer. It wasn't politics as much as he was always focused on the humanity among us,\" Villaraigosa said. 'When he got behind an issue, he knew everything about it.\" \"Just a really special man.

Ruben Gallego stepped out of a car and approached parishioners exiting a church beneath palm trees, handing out flyers in this Dominican neighborhood. Gallego left some of his staff members behind as he drummed up support for a fellow Democrat running to be the next mayor of the majority-Hispanic city.\n\n“Mucho gusto,” he told the churchgoers, Spanish for “nice to meet you.”\n\n“Soy Ruben Gallego de Arizona,” he said, introducing himself without mentioning he is a U.S. senator.\n\nThe Arizona Democrat is emerging as a crucial surrogate for a party desperately seeking to win back the Latino support that slipped in 2024 with the election of President Donald Trump. His fall travels have included trips to New Jersey, Virginia and Florida, where he campaigned for Democrats who went on to win their elections. Strategists say Gallego is flexing his muscle as a rising star for the party while also laying the groundwork for a 2028 presidential run despite not being a household name like California Gov. Gavin Newsom or U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIt’s a role Gallego is expected to continue next year, when Democrats hope to break Republicans’ hold on Congress and counter Trump’s agenda.\n\n“Ruben Gallego is going to be our not-so-secret, secret weapon,” said Maria Cardona, a longtime Democratic operative and member of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nA surrogate in high demand\n\nGallego is among the Democrats named as possible 2028 contenders who had the busiest travel calendar in 2025. He stumped for Democratic female candidates in New Jersey’s and Virginia’s gubernatorial races and Miami’s mayoral race.\n\n“Ruben brings instant validation to them not only because his last name is Gallego,” said Chuck Rocha, who mobilized Latinos for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid in 2020 and for Gallego in 2024. “He’s risked his life for his country, he grew up in an immigrant household from nothing, and now he’s a U.S. senator. That’s the kind of guy you want standing beside you talking to Latinos about why they should vote for this white woman.”\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Trump made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of eastern Pennsylvania, turned South Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and improved his numbers along Florida’s Interstate 4 corridor by focusing heavily on the economy and border security.\n\nBut results from recent elections have shown signs that key voting groups, including Hispanics, were shifting away from Republicans. And in Miami, Eileen Higgins became the first Democratic mayor to be elected in nearly 30 years.\n\n“We’re going to places where there’s big Latino populations,” Gallego told The Associated Press in Miami. “Obviously, they swung a little too much in our opinion toward Trump last time, and we wanna talk to Democrats and we wanna talk to Latinos, we wanna talk to candidates about how to get that population back into our corner.”\n\nGallego himself outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, when he won a Senate seat in Arizona by more than 2 points while Trump carried the state by nearly 6 points.

He was accepted to Harvard University, joined the Marines and fought in Iraq with a unit that sustained heavy casualties.\n\n“All of the Democrats are now talking about affordability, affordability, affordability,” said Jesse Lehrich, a Democratic strategist. “But how many of those actually know what it feels like to not know where the next rent check is going to come from? Or not know how they’re going to pay for groceries this week?”\n\nLehrich, who is closely tracking the 2028 contenders’ travels and media appearances, said there are not very many top-tier Democrats who sound like regular people, adding that, in contrast, Gallego can be “rough around the edges.”\n\nThe senator, who previously served in the U.S. House, likes boasting that he did not listen to the Washington establishment when he decided to host watch parties for boxing matches and organized a rodeo and a low rider car show, dismissing concerns that it would be perceived as condescending to Hispanic supporters.\n\nHe does not come across as polished as others like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but Lehrich says that may work in Gallego’s favor because people are craving rawness.\n\n“He kind of feels perfect for the moment,” Lehrich said.\n\nA Latino on the GOP side\n\nSome strategists and commentators say the Democratic Party has not done a good job at elevating Hispanic candidates at a national level. They worry Republicans are propping up another former Latino senator, now Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who ran for president in 2016 and is often mentioned by Trump when talking about 2028.\n\nXochitl Hinojosa, a political commentator, said she sees Gallego’s strength not only in appealing to Latino voters, but also in the broader electorate in battleground areas, emphasizing how hard it is for a candidate to pull himself over the finish line when the presidential candidate does not do it in that state.\n\n“I think him winning a very tough seat has catapulted him to the top,” Hinojosa said. “Democrats need to think through how we need to think about Latinos if Republicans have a Latino on the ticket and Democrats don’t.”\n\nAsked about a possible 2028 presidential bid, Gallego indicated it was too early to say.\n\n“My calculation is I have three kids.

Ruben Gallego stepped out of a car and approached parishioners exiting a church beneath palm trees, handing out flyers in this Dominican neighborhood. Gallego left some of his staff members behind as he drummed up support for a fellow Democrat running to be the next mayor of the majority-Hispanic city. \n\n“Mucho gusto,” he told the churchgoers, Spanish for “nice to meet you.”\n\n“Soy Ruben Gallego de Arizona,” he said, introducing himself without mentioning he is a U.S. senator. \n\nThe Arizona Democrat is emerging as a crucial surrogate for a party desperately seeking to win back the Latino support that slipped in 2024 with the election of President Donald Trump. His fall travels have included trips to New Jersey, Virginia and Florida, where he campaigned for Democrats who went on to win their elections. Strategists say Gallego is flexing his muscle as a rising star for the party while also laying the groundwork for a 2028 presidential run despite not being a household name like California Gov. Gavin Newsom or U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIt’s a role Gallego is expected to continue next year, when Democrats hope to break Republicans’ hold on Congress and counter Trump’s agenda. \n\n“Ruben Gallego is going to be our not-so-secret, secret weapon,” said Maria Cardona, a longtime Democratic operative and member of the Democratic National Committee. \n\nA surrogate in high demand\n\nGallego is among the Democrats named as possible 2028 contenders who had the busiest travel calendar in 2025. He stumped for Democratic female candidates in New Jersey’s and Virginia’s gubernatorial races and Miami’s mayoral race.\n\n“Ruben brings instant validation to them not only because his last name is Gallego,” said Chuck Rocha, who mobilized Latinos for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid in 2020 and for Gallego in 2024. “He’s risked his life for his country, he grew up in an immigrant household from nothing, and now he’s a U.S. senator. That’s the kind of guy you want standing beside you talking to Latinos about why they should vote for this white woman.”\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Trump made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of eastern Pennsylvania, turned South Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and improved his numbers along Florida’s Interstate 4 corridor by focusing heavily on the economy and border security. \n\nBut results from recent elections have shown signs that key voting groups, including Hispanics, were shifting away from Republicans.

On paper, the bald phallus model has the ideal life. He was a fighter pilot, he was an astronaut and the attempted murder of his wife by a crazed leftist brings in a lot of sympathy too. But his character made him lose out to being chosen as running mate for Kamala Harris to a guy who lied about his military service and his even his high school football coaching job.\n\nHow big a scumbag do you have to be to lose out to a guy who lied about his rank and serving in combat? As you might imagine, it involves his fidelity to something important, and it isn’t the truth.\n\nThese are just rumors, of course, as far as the general public knows. The Harris campaign paid people to dig beneath the rumors; what they found remains their little secret. It is, however, worthy of note that while they have expressed disappointment over picking Fraudie Murphy, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, no one has ever expressed regret about NOT picking Mark Kelly. It’s the difference between being upset over your fantasy football quarterback being injured in week one and using your first round draft pick to choose Arron Hernandez.\n\nKelly might be the only person I’ve ever heard brag about their service in the first Gulf War. Not that there wasn’t danger or it is something those who served shouldn’t be proud of, but it was very short and the Iraqi military turned out to be significantly less a threat than was publicly thought prior to the war.\n\nStill, Kelly did fly his planes and drop his bombs, so there’s that. Still, he talks about it like it was Midway.\n\nThen he went to space, which is cool. He delivered a lot of cargo as a Space Shuttle pilot. I’ve never heard any other Space Shuttle pilot talk about their service like they’d cured a disease like Kelly does, they downplay it. It’s not like being an intergalactic Door Dasher, but still…\n\nKelly then retired from NASA to focus on his family, especially since his wife had been horribly injured when a lunatic tried to kill her at a public event. He wanted to help her write her book and focus on spending time with his family, according to him at the time.\n\nAfter a few years, Kelly made a bunch of money off China and had had enough of his family, so he decided to run for the Senate on his biography and the attack on his wife. He won because his biography, on paper, is impressive, and the attack on his wife was horrible.\n\nSince winning, Mark Kelly has served without distinction. A few self-serving laws regarding Arizona Indian tribes and “co-sponsoring” bills that became law – which is literally the least a Member of Congress can do – and that’s about all he’s done.\n\nHe is still milking his military service, only this time in an attempt to undermine the chain of command. It’s gross, really.\n\nMark Kelly now spends his days kissing the asses of wealthy Democrat donors, sucking up to celebrities and trying to bilk poor people out of what remains on their high-interest credit cards in the hope of running for president in 2028. See, while being a sketchy guy with low character is a disqualifying trait as a running mate, there is no background check when it comes to winning a party’s nomination.\n\nAll the while, he ducks behind his disabled wife every time righteous and justified criticism is hurled his way. It’s gross. He’s gross. He’s also the most frequent emailer to fundraising lists on the left.\n\nHe has sent 13 emails begging for money since December 2nd, with subject lines like “I will not give up on our country” and “President Trump is calling for me to be hanged.” The bald bag of douche is desperate to exploit his popularity among the hate America crowd. It’s hard to feel bad for morons being conned out of their money, but it does add a level of scumbagery when the guy doing it spends his time insisting he’s a hero, a sentiment no person not on his payroll appears to share.\n\nMark Kelly is the perfect Democrat: a shameless self-promoter, perfectly willing to take money from anyone, shady and sleazy business and personal history and quick to duck behind his wife when anyone calls him out on any of it. I’d peg Kelly’s chances of securing the Democratic nomination at this point at about 27 percent.\n\nDerek Hunter is the host of the Derek Hunter Show on WMAL in Washington, DC, and has a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses, and host of the weekly “Week in F*cking Review” podcast where the news is spoken about the way it deserves to be.

His work took a dramatic turn when he directed the 1986 adaptation of Stephen King’s novella Stand by Me.\nReiner was nominated for an Academy Award for 1993’s A Few Good Men, which starred Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise, though the movie lost to Clint Eastwood’s western Unforgiven.\nReiner, a native of New York City and son of the late comedy writer and actor Carl Reiner, was also well known for his political activism.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, he backed Democratic candidate John Kerry and featured in advertisements taking aim at incumbent President George W. Bush. Reiner also supported Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.\nReiner was married to Penny Marshall, star of Laverne & Shirley, from 1971 to 1981. He met Michele Singer on the set of When Harry Met Sally and the two married in 1989, the year the movie came out.\nMichele began producing films over the last decade, including Shock and Awe, Albert Brooks: Defending My Life and Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, all directed by her husband. She also produced God & Country, a look at Christian nationalism in the US.\nBefore her production career, she was a photographer who captured the image of Donald Trump that appears on the cover of his book Trump: The Art of the Deal.\nThe deaths drew condolences from political heavyweights like California Governor Newsom, former US Vice-President Kamala Harris and former US President Barack Obama, as well as entertainment industry figures.\n“Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity,” Newsom said on X, adding he was “heartbroken by the tragic loss”.\nKillings are rare in the Brentwood neighbourhood. The scene is a short distance from the home where O.J. Simpson’s wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were killed in 1994.\nBy Sunday evening, law enforcement had swarmed Reiner’s sprawling estate, though an eerie quiet hung over Chadbourne Avenue, which had been sealed from the public with yellow crime scene tape.\nPolice cars were stationed at either end of the block where the Reiner residence is located while a helicopter circled overhead.\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse","summary":"Rob Reiner’s son, Nick Reiner, has been taken into custody after the deaths of the director-writer and his wife Michele, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press.\nThe official confirmed the 32-year-old was in police custody on Monday.
