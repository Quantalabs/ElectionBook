'But it should have been called Everyone Sucks But Me. 107 Days is a victim's title, because get it, she only had 107 days to win.\n\n'Yeah, and a billion and a half dollars, and a built-in army of about 75 million people who'd vote for any human-adjacent life form that wasn't Trump,' he continued.\n\nHe also pointed out that she heaps blame on former President Joe Biden for not dropping out of the race soon enough.\n\nThe then-81-year-old made the official call to step aside on July 21, 2024, and Harris was named the Democratic nominee just over two weeks later on August 5.\n\nMaher also joked about a passage in Harris's book that accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of not answering her call when she was asking for her endorsement.\n\nNewsom texted back, 'Hiking. Will call back.' According to Harris, he never did.\n\n'Gavin Newsom, he was asked for his endorsement, but texted, hiking, we'll call back. But then never did. And then he didn't even ask her to prom,' Maher said.\n\nOf course, Newsom did end up endorsing Harris later on that day and explained that he didn't realize it was Harris calling him.\n\nMaher then tackled the controversy that was Harris not picking Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because he is gay and that would have been 'asking a lot of America'.\n\n'America, America itself, lets Kamala down by not being ready for the running mate she really wanted, Pete Buttigieg. So she's stuck with the Home Depot paint salesman, and the rest is herstory. Poor Kamala,' Maher said, referring to her ultimate choice, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\n'We made her the star of a rom-com and didn't even give her a gay best friend, he added. \n\n'Kamala writes that on election night, when it was clear she'd lost, an aide peeled the words, Madam President, off the cupcakes before handing them out. Oh, jeez, that's like a scene from Bridget Jones Runs for President, for Christ's sake,' he said.\n\nHarris did find fault with herself on her messaging, or lack thereof, on the issue of whether transgender athletes should be allowed to play in female sports.\n\nIn the book, she appeared to acknowledge that her lack of a clear message on trans issues allowed Trump to define her however he wanted, even conceding that the ads he ran amounted to a 'winning message'.\n\n'I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,' she wrote in the book.\n\n'With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying and demonizing children,' she added.\n\nStill, Harris claimed Trump and the Republicans misrepresented her position on youth sports by running an ad campaign last fall with the tagline 'Kamala is for they/them. I am for you'.\n\nHer rhetorical pivot comes after many national Democrats, including Newsom, have said it is unfair for trans girls to play high school sports.","summary":"Bill Maher slammed Kamala Harris for not taking responsibility for her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

In the official trailer, he jokes about how much shoplifting has changed since he were a kid.\n\nWhat Comedy Specials Will It Remind You Of?: His onstage confidence may draw favorable comparisons to the late great Bernie Mac, and when you notice how Earthquake loves to slap the microphone on his leg to punctuate his own enjoyment at a punchline, you can see how his mannerisms have influenced Chappelle.\n\nMemorable Jokes: While he opens by reminding the crowd that Atlanta “is my comedy home,” he makes his actual home in Los Angeles, which means friends and fans alike wondered whether his place survived the fires from this January. \n\nIf only?!? “Divorce took my house!” he jokes, adding he wishes the fires had claimed his former property.“Give me the justice that the courts refused to do.”\n\nYou likely haven’t heard rationale for releasing R. Kelly from prison like you’ll hear from Earthquake. He not only cites Sean “Puffy” Combs in his peculiar defense, but also suggests that he’d never befall the same fate as those infamous hip-hoppers. “I’m confident because I paid for all my pussy,” he cracks.\n\nHe also defends LeBron James as a great father for getting his son, Bronny, on the Los Angeles Lakers to play alongside him, comparing it to how he treated his own son when he was attending and then graduating from college.\n\nAnd he name-drops Jamie Foxx and his recent health scare as proof to bolster his case that every man needs a reliable woman by his side in case everything goes away, whether it be financially or physically.\n\nOur Take: You’re not likely to see too many comedy specials that double as both life advice and financial planning, but perhaps that’s testament to Earthquake’s elder status now. He can still get down and dirty describing his sexual exploits. And yet he now finds himself wondering whether he should be saving up for an unknown amount of years ahead of him, or going balls-to-the-wall and enjoying whatever time he has left.\n\nThough he doesn’t quite go after Trump and make this an explicitly political performance, race and politics is always connected to his observations.\n\nHe does advise Latinos in America to go into hiding for the next few years, joking: “I think I speak for all black people right now: Good luck.” But he’s not really joking, noting that he knows that cruel injustice is always just around the corner for black Americans.\n\nOf the current president, Earthquake claims: “he ain’t playing.” His diagnosis of the 2024 election results isn’t so much an indictment of the Democrats, as it is befuddlement over what happened to the expected wave of support from women’s groups, from sororities to the Swifties and the Beyhive, who were supposed to sweep Vice President Kamala Harris into the Oval Office? He believes they were no match for the white man, saying there’s no such thing in America as an unqualified white man: “His pigmentation is his qualification.” \n\nHow deep does white privilege still run in these streets in 2025? In a bit much earlier in his set, Earthquake suggests he has seen it even while walking the streets of Portland, Ore., and remarking on how many unhoused white folks he saw there. Somehow he wasn’t worried about their welfare as he still was about his own.\n\n“You could just tell they had mothers and fathers and dreams,” he jokes of them, adding: “All you need is a shower and a suit and you’ll be my supervisor by tomorrow.”\n\nOur Call: STREAM IT. His catchphrase of a refrain has long been “these ain’t jokes.” Somehow that feels truer now more than ever. \n\nSean L. McCarthy works the comedy beat.

'In the United States, President Donald Trump launched more than 100 verbal attacks on the media during his election campaign.'\n\nSuch sentiments might be expected from a liberal speaking in Scandinavia but the man's words will reverberate at the White House.\n\nThey were spoken by Jørgen Watne Frydnes who, above all others, will determine whether President Trump is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nFrydnes, a human rights advocate, is the Secretary General of PEN Norway, a charity defending freedom of expression, and was appointed by the country's parliament as the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAt 11am local time on October 10, he will make the announcement at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.\n\nThe winner is decided by Frydnes and four other members of the committee, also appointed by parliament. If they cannot reach a consensus, it will be decided by a majority vote.\n\nAn analysis of past statements by the five voters suggests three are likely to be against Trump.\n\nHowever, despite that, there is still a chance it could go his way.\n\nThe vice chair of the committee has previously expressed sentiments that could be viewed as sympathetic by the White House.\n\nAnd where the fifth vote stands is unclear, but it is held by an anti-EU former politician who is not considered a liberal in Norway.\n\nAccording to the prediction website Kalshi the current favorite for the prize, with a 24 percent chance, is Sudan's Emergeny Response Rooms, which has provided humanitarian aid during the civil war.\n\nOther top contenders include Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the International Court of Justice, and Doctors Without Borders.\n\nPresident Trump is the joint fifth favorite, roughly tied with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThis week, Thunberg, 22, was arrested when Israel intercepted a flotilla of 40 boats on the way to Gaza. She is expected to be deported back to Europe.\n\nTrump has previously mocked Thunberg as a 'strange person' who should 'go to an anger management class.'\n\nAdding spice to the mix, in the background, an extraordinary war of words has been going on between the influential left-wing husband of one of the committee members, and the vice chair.\n\nThe anti-Trump sentiment on the committee is perhaps not surprising, considering the president's lack of popularity in Norway.\n\nResearch by Statista shows only 10 percent of Norwegians would have cast a ballot for Trump over Kamala Harris in the 2024 election if they had been eligible to vote.\n\nA Nobel committee vote not expected to go to Trump belongs to Gry Larsen, the former leader of the Norwegian Labour Party's Workers' Youth League.\n\nOn November 2, 2020, the day before the US election, Larsen posted a picture of herself on Facebook wearing a Trump-style red hat, but emblazoned with the words 'Make Human Rights Great Again.'\n\nEarlier, in 2017, writing on X about Trump's abortion policies, she said: 'Trump is putting millions of lives at risk.'\n\nA third vote considered unlikely is Kristin Clemet who, even though she has been a prominent figure in Norway's Conservative Party, seems to have made her opinion of Trump clear on social media.\n\nThe day after the January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S, Capitol she wrote on social media: 'Strange to hear that no one has understood that Trump is dangerous.'\n\nIn 2022 she posted that an 18-year-old had said: 'I'm happier that we can have a king and queen than that we could have such presidents who can suddenly wreck the country.'\n\nIn May this year she wrote: 'After just over 100 days as president (Trump) is well underway in dismantling American democracy and he is doing everything he can to tear down the liberal and rules-based world order.'\n\nBut there is hope for Trump yet.\n\nIn 2017 Asle Toje, an academic now the vice chair of the committee, wrote an article headlined: 'Trump is no Hitler.'\n\nIn it, he said: 'The American president is part of a broader change. It is the liberal order that is falling.'\n\nSince then he has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from Clemet's husband, Michael Tetzschner, a major figure in the Conservative Party and the former mayor of Oslo.\n\nIn April, Tetzschner savaged Toje in an article in Norway's biggest newspaper, Aftenposten, suggesting he would 'thrive well' in right wing European movements like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) or with French politician Marine Le Pen.\n\n'The anxiety of America's allies and best friends that the values ​​that the United States and the rest of the West have built on are now being attacked daily by Trump and his circle,' Tetzschner wrote.\n\n'When Toje is silent about this, I perceive him as a supporter of a political direction that the Americans themselves will distance themselves from when the dust has settled, as they also did after the McCarthy era.'\n\nTetzschner went on: 'True friends of the United States should be concerned that the United States...has been given a leadership that undermines its own institutions.\n\n'It treats allies as enemies, endangers the economy and people's savings, and strengthens the enemies of the United States and the rest of the West. That Toje is not worried speaks for itself.'\n\nA month earlier, at the Conservative Party's national conference, Tetzschner called Trump 'frighteningly incompetent.'\n\nBut there remain signs that Trump is not out of the running.\n\nLast month, Toje said the ultimate winner ends up being 'very rarely anyone's first choice.'\n\nAsked by a newspaper in Dubai about the prospects of a 'political figure' getting the prize, he pointed out that one of the first Nobel Peace Prizes was awarded to President Theodore Roosevelt for brokering peace between Russia and Japan in 1905, and that it had been 'hugely controversial.'\n\nToje added: 'Even then there was so much tension about the dangers of giving the Nobel Peace Prize to politicians. But ultimately, it is practicing politicians who have the power to bring about change.\n\n'It is one of the challenges we are always facing. You would be right in saying the prizes awarded to practicing politicians have been most controversial but also most important.'\n\nToje did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Mail. \n\nThe fifth vote on the committee belongs to Anne Enger, 75, a former acting Prime Minister of Norway.\n\nShe previously led the Centre Party which, as its name suggests, is in the political middle and also particularly represents the interests of farmers.\n\nEnger also led the 'No to EU' campaign against Norway joining Europe in a referendum in 1994.\n\nShe appears to have never made any public comments about Trump. President Trump himself has spoken many times about the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nPrevious US Presidents who have won it are Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter, Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nBut Trump. perhaps having been made aware of the makeup of the committee, seems resigned to not winning.\n\nOn Tuesday he said he had solved eight wars in eight months, including a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\n'That's pretty good. Nobody's ever done that. Would you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,' he said.\n\n'They'll give it to some guy that didn't do a damn thing, they'll give it to a guy that wrote a book about the mind of Donald Trump and what it took to solve the war.\n\n'But we'll see what happens. But it's be a big insult to our country. I don't want it. I want the country to get it, should get it.'\n\nThere are 338 nominees for the prize in 2025, consisting of 244 individuals nd 94 organizations\n\nAccording to the 1895 will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel the prize should go to 'whoever 'has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.\n\nKristian Berg Harpviken, the committee's secretary, who takes part in the deliberations but does not vote, said: 'They will look at the world, see what is happening, what are the global trends, what are the main concerns, what are the most promising processes that we see.\n\n'And processes here can mean anything from a specific peace process to a new type of international agreement that is under development or that has recently been adopted.'\n\nAccording to the prediction website Kalshi the current favorite for the prize, with a 24 percent chance, is Sudan's Emergeny Response Rooms, which has provided humanitarian aid during the civil war.\n\nOther top contenders include Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the International Court of Justice, and Doctors Without Borders.\n\nPresident Trump is the joint fifth favorite alongside Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, but ahead of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.","summary":"Five Norwegians will decide if Trump wins the Nobel Peace Prize and what they really think about him is astonishing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15148761/trump-nobel-peace-prize.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/30/18/102579571-0-image-a-18_1759251819547.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/02/666598203428224801/1024x576_MP4_666598203428224801.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-04 20:44:12","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.007},{"id":366223332,"title":"In Every Government Shutdown, the Media Are Eager Democrat Helpers","text":"If the national media can be counted on to spin anything dramatically toward the Democrats, it’s a government shutdown. They feel passionately that the Democrats are the party of government, and the Republicans are the haters of government, so who naturally favors shutting it all down?\n\nEven before the shutdown occurred, NPR and PBS issued their poll warning Republicans would get more of the blame than Democrats. That’s why those partisan hacks deserved defunding. A substantial minority would blame both parties, because the independents told NPR, “They’re just fighting like two little kids.”\n\nBut pinning blame on Republicans is the perennial goal of press coverage. During the 1995-1996 shutdown, ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts (and CNN’s World News) ran 48 stories in which reporters assigned blame: 23 blaming Republicans, and 25 blaming both Republicans and then-President Bill Clinton. Not one single story blamed Clinton alone.\n\nBroadcast networks blamed Republicans in the 2013 shutdown under Barack Obama, and the 2019 shutdown under Donald Trump. It was’’t just there. In 2013, Republicans were “putting on their suicide vests,” said British journalist Tina Brown on CNN. They’re called “the suicide caucus,” proclaimed NBC anchor Brian Williams on David Letterman’s show. It’s “economic terrorism,’ insisted MSNBC blowhard Ed Schultz.\n\nThey don’t hide whose side they are taking. CNN anchor Pamela Brown—whose dad was a Democrat governor of Kentucky—tried to “fact-check” Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday morning.\n\n“All right, we’re listening here to Speaker Johnson. He’s trying to frame the shutdown as a Democratic shutdown. He also falsely claimed that Democrats want to give health care, extend health care to illegal immigrants. That is not true. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for federal health care programs.”\n\nHours later, after House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke on the Capitol steps, CNN turned to repeater-not-reporter Arlette Saenz on the Hill, and she merely regurgitated all the Democrat talking points. No one “fact-checked” anything.\n\nThe “independent fact-checkers,” including CNN’s Daniel Dale, pounced on any claims that the Democrats shut down the government over their favoritism toward illegal aliens. PolitiFact threw a “False” flag at Vice President JD Vance. Actually, it is true that the federal government currently pays for health care for “noncitizens.” Democrats object to Trump’s moves to stop it.\n\nRepublicans posted video of a 2019 Democrat presidential debate where Savannah Guthrie nudged: “Raise your hand if your government plan would provide health insurance for undocumented immigrants.” Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and everyone else on that stage raised their hand.\n\nRepublicans also posted the state government of New York—home of Jeffries and Senate Democrat Leader Charles Schumer—advertised that it has an insurance program through “Medicaid Managed Care” that gives health insurance to illegal immigrants over 65. They promoted “a more comprehensive benefit package for this population. … The new insurance adds preventive and primary care benefits, including routine doctor visits, recommended screenings, lab tests, wellness services, prescription drugs and supplies, and more.”\n\nThe actual details over the trend of federal spending—always rising dramatically —are treated as boring. How many journalists fixate on the annual deficit, or the accumulated national debt? That’s not a serious question. Don’t be a nerd. Reporters just want to cover this like it’s a rhetorical boxing match that Republicans are always going to lose.\n\nDemocrat politicians feel the media bias enables them to be self-righteous holdouts in a shutdown, knowing they have a protection racket in the press corps. They pose as the reasonable moderates facing extremist “terrorists.” Then they wonder why the media’s trust ratings are in the toilet.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Mikie Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign is imploding","text":"Quantus Polling, which was the most accurate of the 2024 presidential election, nailing the exact number of electoral votes President Donald Trump would receive (312), shows Sherrill and Ciattarelli in a dead heat. That same polling firm showed Sherrill with a 10-point lead back in early September. Emerson’s most recent poll also has the candidates tied. \n\nLIVE UPDATES: GOVERNMENT ENTERS SHUTDOWN WITH NO DEAL IN SIGHT\n\nSo why is the race tightening? Three factors are in play, and none are good for Sherill. \n\nFirst, Sherrill had a patently horrible debate against Ciattarelli last month, with the lowlight coming when Sherrill, after voting for a House resolution honoring Charlie Kirk‘s legacy, proceeded to lie about the slain activist while dumping on his memory in one of the most disgusting displays we’ve seen out of any politician lately. \n\n“Charlie Kirk was advocating for a Christian nationalist government and to roll back the rights of women and Black people — this flies in the face of every value I hold dear and that I fight for,” she declared. \n\nRoll back the rights for women and Black people? When did he even remotely advocate for anything like that? She said this just one week after Charlie was executed in front of his family. She then took the opportunity to criticize Trump.\n\n“On one hand, he denounced Kirk’s politically motivated killing, while on the other hand, he is instigating a witch hunt worthy of Joseph McCarthy to shut down the free speech rights of anyone who disagrees with Kirk’s racist, anti-American views,” she said.\n\nAnti-American. \n\nCharlie Kirk was arguably the biggest advocate of the First Amendment and the free exchange of ideas. Sherrill has yet to offer even one example of racist or anti-American rhetoric from Kirk, because there aren’t any. \n\nProblem No. 2 for the Democrat is her Kamala Harris-like explanation about how exactly she made $7 million in stock trades in recent years after being elected to Congress seven years ago. “I also don’t trade individual stocks,” she said in a radio interview with Charlamagne Tha God. “It’s been widely reported, [but] we don’t trade individual stocks. I don’t think anybody in Congress should quite frankly.”\n\nThat also is a lie. In 2021, Sherrill paid a $400 fine for violating the federal STOCK Act by failing to disclose stock sales. \n\nCharlamagne followed up by asking her to explain the $7 million she made in the market. “I haven’t. I don’t believe I did, but I would have to go and see what that [report] was alluding to…”\n\nTRUMP ADVISES THAT ANYONE BURNING AMERICAN FLAG WILL BE IMPRISONED FOR A YEAR \n\nYou don’t believe you did? Not exactly a strong defense. This is also a devastating development when considering most polls show about 90% of registered voters do not think Congress should trade stocks. Sherrill made her boatload already, hence why she would have no problem voting for such a resolution now because there’s an election that needs to be done. \n\nA New York Times investigation in 2022 found that Sherrill had 12 potential conflicts with the stock trades she claims she never made. “Ms. Sherrill reported both buying and selling shares of several defense contractors while she was a member of the House Armed Services Committee. She also sold shares of Alphabet and Meta in 2019 while she was the chairwoman of the oversight subcommittee of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, which has held hearings about online disinformation,” the report reads. \n\nOverall, Sherrill bought and sold several major defense stocks during her time on the Armed Services Committee, including Raytheon, Honeywell, and General Dynamics. And given the amount of money she made in such a short period of time, it’s fair to question if she simply has the stock picking prowess of Gordon Gekko-meets-Paul Pelosi, or if something nefarious happened here. \n\nProblem No. 3 for Sherrill is the fact that she wasn’t allowed to participate in her own graduation ceremony due to a cheating scandal, nor was her husband. “I didn’t turn in some of my classmates, so I didn’t walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor,” Sherrill explained after a report in the New Jersey Globe called her out on it.\n\nUntil the report came out, Sherrill never talked about the scandal publicly. \n\nWhen asked if she would release her disciplinary records publicly to show that her explanation around not ratting out her classmates checked out, she refused to do so. \n\n“What we learned today is that she was part of it in some way, shape or form. Come clean, release the records. Tell us what’s in your disciplinary records. I think the people of New Jersey deserve that,” Ciattatrelli said on Fox News this week. \n\nAnd he’s right. \n\nAttacking Charlie Kirk and lying in the process. \n\nShady stock trades of defense and technology companies while on the Armed Services Committee. \n\nA cheating scandal that isn’t going away, while Sherrill is acting like someone with something to hide. \n\nIt’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. \n\nAnd as the race in this blue state heads to the finish, Ciattarelli has all the momentum while his opponent is barely hanging on. \n\nAnd she has no one to blame but herself.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

People who prioritize abortion now appear more conservative than Americans generally.\n\n“If there is a candidate who is not for protecting life — which is the very basic foundation of everything, is life — then I cannot support that person and could not vote for that person,” said Lisa Gormont, 58, who lives outside of State College, Pennsylvania, and said abortion is her top issue.\n\nHistorically, voters who prioritized abortion wanted politicians to outlaw it. But the 2022 Supreme Court decision ending federal abortion rights — which ushered in near-total bans in conservative-led states across the country — inverted that trend.\n\nRelated | Anti-abortion groups have a new strategy to end telehealth abortion\n\nFor the past two years, most voters who made abortion their top issue said they believed it should be legal in most or all cases. Last year, the 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll found that 59 percent of voters who said abortion was their top issue wanted it legal in all cases, and another 22 said it should be legal in most cases. In 2023, 48 percent of those abortion-prioritizing voters said it should be legal always, and another 20 percent said it should be in most cases.\n\nDemocrats campaigned furiously on abortion rights, with many candidates highlighting the issue in the 2022 midterms and then-Vice President Kamala Harris making abortion protections a centerpiece of her 2024 presidential bid. Republicans, by contrast, largely avoided the issue, with President Donald Trump distancing himself from conservative calls for national abortion restrictions.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has spoken little about abortion. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has indicated some openness to limiting access to the procedure, most recently in a September 19 letter saying that the federal government is reviewing the approval for a key abortion drug and may restrict when it can be used.\n\nAbout 56 percent of Americans who called abortion their top issue said they approve of Trump, compared with only 43 percent of the general public, the poll found. But some, like Gormont, expressed some dissatisfaction with his approach to abortion. In general, she said, Trump appears less focused on abortion than on other issues — and as a result has done less to restrict it than she would like.\n\n“There are so many other things that take his attention, and I don’t think that is something he ever really put on his platform as a top-tier concern,” she said.\n\nRelated | RFK Jr. is coming for abortion pills\n\nAnd beyond abortion, she voiced particular concern over Trump’s comments on in vitro fertilization, which she opposes. Trump has said he might support expanding the availability of IVF, even campaigning on the issue, though that has not translated into actual policies. Because IVF generally involves the creation of multiple embryos — not all of which will necessarily be implanted in someone’s uterus — it has attracted the ire of some abortion opponents, who believe the discarding of excess embryos is immoral.\n\nVoters prioritizing abortion now appear to be more conservative on issues of gender. Of people who said abortion was their top priority, 57 percent also said society would be better served by reverting to “traditional gender roles,” seven percentage points above the general population. The same share also said they believe a fetus has rights starting at conception — a conservative philosophy known as “fetal personhood,” compared with 43 percent of the general population. And 55 percent said they believe transgender adults shouldn’t be able to get gender-affirming care, compared with 42 percent of Americans at large.\n\nSurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1 percentage point.\n\nOverall, most voters still support abortion rights. About 62 percent of voters said abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Majorities of Democrats and independents said they support abortion rights. So did most men and most women. Abortion also retained majority support across education and income levels.\n\nEven if abortion rights supporters did not name it as a singular top issue, some may still struggle to vote for a candidate who is not committed to protecting reproductive rights.\n\n“If somebody came in and was saying we needed to ban abortions across the map, that would totally not be something I’m in for,” said Tiegan Paulson, a 22-year-old student living in Portland, Maine, who voted for Harris last fall.\n\nAbortion wasn’t his main concern in the past election; foreign policy was, and in particular effective plans to resolve international conflicts. But moving forward, he said, “personal freedoms” — a category in which he includes abortion rights, free speech and LGBTQ+ rights — are on a short list of non-negotiables for a candidate to win his support.\n\n“It would need to be a fairly high priority,” he said. “I would want to see some sort of action plan for abortion and just for personal freedoms more generally: the right to choose what you do with your voice, with your body, with your life, at the very least to the extent that it doesn’t impact anybody else. That seems like a pretty fundamental right that people in this country should have.”","summary":"A 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll suggests that abortion rights supporters are now less likely to prioritize the issue.\n\n\n\nBy Shefali Luthra for The 19th\n\n\n\n\nAmericans who call abortion their top voting issue are now more likely to support banning it, a reversal from the energized reproductive rights supporters who turned abortion into a key election issue after Roe v.

Some fear Trump’s cuts may change that","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has embraced the federal shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to slash spending and shrink government, but new rounds of targeted spending cuts from the White House aimed at Democratic states and priorities are raising concerns among Republicans that they may be at risk of ceding their political advantage.\n\nRepublicans in Congress believe they hold the upper hand in four-day-old stalemate, as Democrats voted against measures to keep the government open because they want to attach additional policy measures. But the sweeping cuts to home-state projects — and the threat of mass federal firings — have some in the GOP worried the White House may be going too far and potentially give Democrats a way out of their tight spot.\n\n“This is certainly the most moral high ground Republicans have had in a moment like this that I can recall, and I just don’t like squandering that political capital when you have that kind of high ground,” GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters this week.\n\nAs hopes faded Friday for a quick end to the shutdown — with Democrats holding firm in a key Senate vote — the White House signaled more layoffs and agency cuts could follow. Trump shared a video Thursday night portraying budget director Russ Vought as the grim reaper. The cuts are raising fresh questions about whether voters want a government that uses discretionary power to punish political opponents — and whether Republicans may face electoral consequences for the White House’s actions.\n\n“There’s the political ramifications that could cause backlash,” Cramer said in another interview. “It makes everything going forward more difficult for us.”\n\nSince the shutdown began, Trump has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. On Friday, the administration announced an additional $2 billion cut, this time to a major public transit project in Chicago. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is also reviewing funding to Portland, Oregon.\n\n“He’s just literally took out the map and pointed to all the blue states,” Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, told The Associated Press.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the shutdown and cuts as evidence of Trump’s overreach. There could be near-term fallout, including in next month’s governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. Democratic candidates in both states have linked their GOP opponents to Trump’s policies and criticized them for not standing up to his latest moves.\n\nIn New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill blasted Republican Jack Ciattarelli over Trump’s move to block funding for a long-delayed rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, saying it will hurt commuters and put thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk.\n\n“What’s wrong with this guy?” Sherrill said Friday.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger noted the state already has been hit hard by job cuts made by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. She said Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is “refusing to stand up for our workforce and our economy.”\n\nEarle-Sears said Democrats are to blame for the shutdown, and said Spanberger did nothing to encourage the state’s Democratic senators to stop it.\n\nThe administration’s targeting of blue states has already begun to ripple through states like California, where $1.2 billion in funding for the state’s hydrogen hub was scrapped. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said it threatens more than 200,000 jobs.\n\nThough Harris won California handily in 2024, the state includes several competitive House districts that could decide control of the chamber in 2026. Similar districts exist in other states affected by the cuts, including New York and New Hampshire, which also has key gubernatorial and Senate races.\n\nDemocratic groups have moved quickly to tie local Republicans to the fallout. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic group, has highlighted swing-district Republicans in states where cuts have occurred, accusing them of having “sat by and let it happen.”\n\n“The cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol.\n\nThe cuts are also complicating Senate negotiations, prolonging a shutdown that could leave thousands of federal workers without pay and halt key programs. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat whom Republicans have tried to sway, said “there’s no question” the cuts have damaged talks.\n\n“If you’re trying to get people to come together and try to find common ground, that’s the absolute wrong way to do it,” said Peters.\n\nSen. Angus King, a Maine independent, broke from Democrats earlier this week to support the GOP funding bill. He called the cuts “so utterly partisan as to be almost laughable.”\n\n“If they overreach, which is entirely possible, I think they’re going to be in trouble with Republicans as well,” said King.\n\nMany Senate Republicans have not endorsed Vought’s approach directly, instead blaming Democrats for rejecting funding bills and opening the door to the White House’s more aggressive moves.\n\n“It’s the reason why Republicans have continued to support a continuation,” said GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. “If you’ve noticed, Republicans have solidly supported this short-term continuing resolution because we do not want to see this.”\n\n“It’s not like we promoted it,” said Rounds. “We’ve done everything we can right now to try to avoid it.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The d-word","text":"I could be wrong, but JB Pritzker may be the first Democrat to apply the d-word to Donald Trump. More importantly, the Illinois governor may be the first to link his criminality to his dementia. And! He may be the first to explain America’s existential crisis in context of a remedy.\n\nA threefer! He said:\n\n\"It appears that Donald Trump not only has dementia set in, but he's copying tactics of Vladimir Putin. Sending troops into cities, thinking that that's some sort of proving ground for war, or that indeed there's some sort of internal war going on in the United States is just, frankly, inane, and I'm concerned for his health. There is something genuinely wrong with this man, and the 25th Amendment ought to be invoked.\"\n\nLike I said, I could be wrong. California Governor Gavin Newsom came close to saying it. Last month, his social media account mocked one of Trump’s Truth Social posts, parsing all the lives, with a zinger on top: “Take your dementia meds, Grandpa. You are making things up again.” (Newsom has also said there’s something wrong with Trump. He suggested his cognition has decayed dramatically since his first term.)\n\nBut that’s as close as Newsom got, and as far as I can tell, no Democrat as high as Pritzker has said outright that Donald Trump is demented.\n\nThis is not to say no one has been talking about it directly. I have. USA Today’s Rex Huppke has. The New Republic’s Greg Sargent has. The Hill’s Chris Truax has. There are dozens more examples. (There’s also a repertoire of wink-wink-nudge-nudge that the Democrats have used since Joe Biden dropped out of the campaign. Kamala Harris talked a lot about Trump’s “stamina” and “weakness.” Others followed her lead.)\n\nBut that’s pretty much the extent of it. Despite wall-to-wall coverage of Joe Biden’s mental state, now to the point where some respectable journalists are claiming there was a vast conspiracy to cover it up, the Washington press corps seemed to have priced into their coverage of Trump his obvious deterioration. There’s barely a hint of anything about it. Absolutely no one has used the d-word in their reporting. It’s enough to make you wonder if there’s a vast conspiracy to cover it up.\n\nI will say that something changed this week, at least in terms of coverage by the New York Times, which tends to be a bellwether for newspeople. A piece on his gathering of top military brass resulted in this reaction from a seasoned Times-watcher: “I assert that The New York Times has changed its approach to writing about Trump.”\n\nThe article, headlined “Trump Gave the Military’s Brass a Rehashed Speech. Until Minute 44,” was about how difficult it is to pick out the newsworthy bits from Trump’s speeches, as they tend to be retreads of the same things he’s always going on about. Despite addressing elites of the American military, Trump twaddled on about Biden and the “infamous autopen”; about the unfair media; about tariffs; about the border; about “the time he went to a restaurant in Washington to eat dinner”; and even the “Nobel Peace Prize he felt he had earned.”\n\nAs Times reporter Shawn McCreesh said: “These were pretty much the same things he talked about a day earlier while standing next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in the State Dining Room at the White House, which were the same things he talked about at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service in Arizona, which were the same things he talked about at Windsor Castle and at Chequers in England.”\n\nBut then, out of that miasma of mangled words, broken thoughts and disconnections arose “something new. Something different,” McCreesh wrote. The president of the United States said that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nTo make sure you don’t miss it, McCreesh repeats those words in italics. “‘We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,’ the president of the United States said.”\n\nMcCreesh is reporting, not commenting. He’s not saying directly that Trump looks like an old man whose brain is so broken he can’t stop perseverating on the same five topics or that out of that word salad, he sometimes spews the pristine proclamations of a dictator. Instead, he takes a reportorial approach toward arriving at a similar conclusion. He’s showing, in other words, not telling, and the showing is clear.\n\n“It has become harder to perceive the occasionally revealing things the president says … because of the way he sometimes says them,” McCreesh wrote. “For a 79-year-old, he’s often shown a great deal of energy, but he seemed a bit sapped Tuesday. As his remarks went on and on, his voice took on a more monotonous quality. A day earlier, when he spoke … Mr. Trump sounded out of breath at times.”\n\nMcCreesh could have taken a different reportorial approach.\n\nHe could have backgrounded the word salad and focused on how the “training ground” remark is in keeping with all the other dictatorial things Trump has said, which altogether are in keeping with Project 2025, published prior to the election. McCreesh could have focused on how, with each of these statements, the president seems to be coming around to publicly embracing that manifesto, after having renounced it. Indeed, such an approach would have gone viral. Just today, Trump said, in essence, he lied when he said he had nothing to do with it.\n\nIn short, McCreesh could have set aside the word salad to establish continuity between, say, the president who led an attempted insurrection and the president who said, years later, “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nInstead, McCreesh foregrounds Trump’s word salad to suggest that something has changed, and that such change could itself suggest that his dictatorial statements are the exception to the rule. “Thousands of words pour forth from the president’s mouth,” he wrote. “Sometimes, he tucks in a wild insight about the direction he is taking the country.”\n\nWhich brings me back to JB Pritzker. He’s why I’m dwelling on this piece and the way Shawn McCreesh wrote it. In being the first leading Democrat to use the word “dementia,” he’s doing something similar – foregrounding Trump’s deteriorated mental state such that all the crazy things that he’s doing in defiance of reason, morality, the Constitution and the law are downstream from there. (McCreesh’s foregrounding is, of course, implicit while Pritzker’s is explicit).\n\nWhile other Democrats are making what seem to be ideological or policy-based arguments against the president – he’s a threat to your freedoms or he’s failing to protect your health care – Pritzker can take what you might call a position of big-hearted centrism. He can stand against Trump’s tyranny while at the same time genuinely lament that his disease has turned him into a despot. Now the dementia has set in, Pritzker said, Trump is copying Putin. “I'm concerned for his health.”\n\nThis won’t be fully convincing to a lot of people, myself included, but its effectiveness with independent voters might bring us around in time. Pritzker, or another ambitious Democrat, could easily pivot this framing to include all those things that swing voters thought he was going to do but didn’t. Why is food still so expensive? Why did my electric bill go up? Why didn’t Trump do what he said he was going to do? You could, as liberals often do, say that he lied, or that he actually wants to immiserate the middle class. But that would require changing swing voters’ minds. It would require them to admit they were wrong. Probably more effective to say, well, he’s gone mad with the dementia.\n\nIt’s the difference between the patient and his sickness. He isn’t saying “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds,” because he’s a fascist. He’s saying it because he’s sick. While the symptoms are the same, the diagnosis is politically what matters.\n\nConsider comments made by Jack Cocchiarella.

Last month, his social media account mocked one of Trump’s Truth Social posts, parsing all the lives, with a zinger on top: “Take your dementia meds, Grandpa. You are making things up again.” (Newsom has also said there’s something wrong with Trump. He suggested his cognition has decayed dramatically since his first term.)\n\nBut that’s as close as Newsom got, and as far as I can tell, no Democrat as high as Pritzker has said outright that Donald Trump is demented.\n\nThis is not to say no one has been talking about it directly. I have. USA Today’s Rex Huppke has. The New Republic’s Greg Sargent has. The Hill’s Chris Truax has. There are dozens more examples. (There’s also a repertoire of wink-wink-nudge-nudge that the Democrats have used since Joe Biden dropped out of the campaign. Kamala Harris talked a lot about Trump’s “stamina” and “weakness.” Others followed her lead.)\n\nBut that’s pretty much the extent of it. Despite wall-to-wall coverage of Joe Biden’s mental state, now to the point where some respectable journalists are claiming there was a vast conspiracy to cover it up, the Washington press corps seemed to have priced into their coverage of Trump his obvious deterioration. There’s barely a hint of anything about it. Absolutely no one has used the d-word in their reporting. It’s enough to make you wonder if there’s a vast conspiracy to cover it up.\n\nI will say that something changed this week, at least in terms of coverage by the New York Times, which tends to be a bellwether for newspeople. A piece on his gathering of top military brass resulted in this reaction from a seasoned Times-watcher: “I assert that The New York Times has changed its approach to writing about Trump.”\n\nThe article, headlined “Trump Gave the Military’s Brass a Rehashed Speech. Until Minute 44,” was about how difficult it is to pick out the newsworthy bits from Trump’s speeches, as they tend to be retreads of the same things he’s always going on about. Despite addressing elites of the American military, Trump twaddled on about Biden and the “infamous autopen”; about the unfair media; about tariffs; about the border; about “the time he went to a restaurant in Washington to eat dinner”; and even the “Nobel Peace Prize he felt he had earned.”\n\nAs Times reporter Shawn McCreesh said: “These were pretty much the same things he talked about a day earlier while standing next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in the State Dining Room at the White House, which were the same things he talked about at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service in Arizona, which were the same things he talked about at Windsor Castle and at Chequers in England.”\n\nBut then, out of that miasma of mangled words, broken thoughts and disconnections arose “something new. Something different,” McCreesh wrote. The president of the United States said that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nTo make sure you don’t miss it, McCreesh repeats those words in italics. “‘We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,’ the president of the United States said.”\n\nMcCreesh is reporting, not commenting. He’s not saying directly that Trump looks like an old man whose brain is so broken he can’t stop perseverating on the same five topics or that out of that word salad, he sometimes spews the pristine proclamations of a dictator. Instead, he takes a reportorial approach toward arriving at a similar conclusion. He’s showing, in other words, not telling, and the showing is clear.\n\n“It has become harder to perceive the occasionally revealing things the president says … because of the way he sometimes says them,” McCreesh wrote. “For a 79-year-old, he’s often shown a great deal of energy, but he seemed a bit sapped Tuesday. As his remarks went on and on, his voice took on a more monotonous quality. A day earlier, when he spoke … Mr. Trump sounded out of breath at times.”\n\nMcCreesh could have taken a different reportorial approach.\n\nHe could have backgrounded the word salad and focused on how the “training ground” remark is in keeping with all the other dictatorial things Trump has said, which altogether are in keeping with Project 2025, published prior to the election. McCreesh could have focused on how, with each of these statements, the president seems to be coming around to publicly embracing that manifesto, after having renounced it. Indeed, such an approach would have gone viral. Just today, Trump said, in essence, he lied when he said he had nothing to do with it.\n\nIn short, McCreesh could have set aside the word salad to establish continuity between, say, the president who led an attempted insurrection and the president who said, years later, “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nInstead, McCreesh foregrounds Trump’s word salad to suggest that something has changed, and that such change could itself suggest that his dictatorial statements are the exception to the rule. “Thousands of words pour forth from the president’s mouth,” he wrote. “Sometimes, he tucks in a wild insight about the direction he is taking the country.”\n\nWhich brings me back to JB Pritzker. He’s why I’m dwelling on this piece and the way Shawn McCreesh wrote it. In being the first leading Democrat to use the word “dementia,” he’s doing something similar – foregrounding Trump’s deteriorated mental state such that all the crazy things that he’s doing in defiance of reason, morality, the Constitution and the law are downstream from there. (McCreesh’s foregrounding is, of course, implicit while Pritzker’s is explicit).\n\nWhile other Democrats are making what seem to be ideological or policy-based arguments against the president – he’s a threat to your freedoms or he’s failing to protect your health care – Pritzker can take what you might call a position of big-hearted centrism. He can stand against Trump’s tyranny while at the same time genuinely lament that his disease has turned him into a despot. Now the dementia has set in, Pritzker said, Trump is copying Putin. “I'm concerned for his health.”\n\nThis won’t be fully convincing to a lot of people, myself included, but its effectiveness with independent voters might bring us around in time. Pritzker, or another ambitious Democrat, could easily pivot this framing to include all those things that swing voters thought he was going to do but didn’t. Why is food still so expensive? Why did my electric bill go up? Why didn’t Trump do what he said he was going to do? You could, as liberals often do, say that he lied, or that he actually wants to immiserate the middle class. But that would require changing swing voters’ minds. It would require them to admit they were wrong. Probably more effective to say, well, he’s gone mad with the dementia.\n\nIt’s the difference between the patient and his sickness. He isn’t saying “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds,” because he’s a fascist. He’s saying it because he’s sick. While the symptoms are the same, the diagnosis is politically what matters.\n\nConsider comments made by Jack Cocchiarella. A CNN host asked the young YouTube influencer for his thoughts on the government shutdown. “Trump to me is kind of this dementia-addled nursing home patient in the White House right now,” he said. “He’s leaning on [budget director Russell] Vought, he’s leaning on [Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller, because he doesn’t want to get the job done.\n\n“He just doesn’t seem interested in negotiating.

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: In the days after President Donald Trump took office in 2017 during his first term, George Orwell’s 1984 came a best-seller in the U.S. The classic 1949 dystopian work introduced the world to the terms “Big Brother,” “thought police,” “newspeak” and “doublethink.” Orwell wrote 1984 as a cautionary tale more than 75 years ago, and some say it has even greater relevance now in Trump’s second term and around the world.\n\nNow a new film by the Oscar-nominated director Raoul Peck is opening Friday in theaters, that explores the life and legacy of George Orwell. It’s called Orwell: 2+2=5. This is the trailer.\n\n GEORGE ORWELL: [voiced by Damian Lewis] When I sit down to write a book, I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose. \n\n O’CONNOR: [played by Michael Redgrave] Again, how many fingers? \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: My starting point is always a feeling of injustice. The very concept of objective truth is fading out of this world. \n\n WINSTON SMITH: [played by Edmond O’Brien] I’m going to set down what I dare not say aloud to anyone. \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: This prospect frightens me much more than bombs. The words “democracy,” “freedom,” “justice” have, each of them, several different meanings, which cannot be reconciled with one another. Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful. \n\n PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The love in the air, I’ve never seen anything like it. \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: And murder respectable. Freedom is slavery. War is peace. Ignorance is strength. Totalitarianism, if not fought against, could triumph anywhere. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? \n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: That’s the trailer for the new film, Orwell: 2+2=5. And this is a clip that features the voices of President George W. Bush’s Secretary of State General Colin Powell and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It begins with the words of Orwell as read in a 1956 British film adaptation of his novel 1984.\n\n BIG BROTHER: [voiced by John Vernon] We’re at war with the people of Eurasia, the vile and ruthless aggressors who have committed countless atrocities and who are guilty of every bestial crime a human being can commit. They’ve laid waster our land, destroyed our factories, looted our homes, massacred our children and raped our women! \n\n SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL: When Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit, about this amount, this is just about… \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: [voiced by Damian Lewis] This kind of thing happens everywhere. But it is clearly likelier to lead to outright falsification in societies where only one opinion is permissible at any given moment. \n\n PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN: [translated] I’ve made the decision to conduct a special military operation. Its aim will be to protect those who have been persecuted in the Kyiv region’s genocide these past eight years. Our goal, therefore, will be to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine. \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: The organized lying practiced by totalitarian states is not, as is sometimes claimed, a temporary expedient of the same nature as military deception. It is something integral to totalitarianism, something that would still continue even if concentration camps and secret police forces had ceased to be necessary. Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth. \n\n VICTOR OTTO: [translated] Had we not engaged in our special military operation, they would have attacked Russia. They, the Nazis, had long been preparing an attack. \n\n O’BRIEN: [played by Lorne Greene] How many fingers am I holding up, Winston? \n\n WINSTON SMITH: [played by Eddie Albert] Four. \n\n O’BRIEN: And if Big Brother were to say not four, but five, then how many? \n\n WINSTON SMITH: Four. \n\n O’BRIEN: How many fingers, Winston? \n\n WINSTON SMITH: Stop it. Anything. Five. \n\n O’BRIEN: No, no, Winston. \n\n WINSTON SMITH: Stop the pain! \n\n O’BRIEN: Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think you see four. \n\n WINSTON SMITH: How can I help, when it’s — five! \n\n O’BRIEN: Two and two do not always make four, Winston. Sometimes they make five. Again, how many fingers am I holding up? \n\nAMY GOODMAN: That’s a clip from the new documentary Orwell: 2+2=5. That last part is from a 1953 film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984.\n\nFor more, we are joined by Academy Award-winning director Alex Gibney, producer of Orwell: 2+2=5, and by the film’s director, Raoul Peck, the acclaimed Haitian filmmaker. His past films include Exterminate All the Brutes, I Am Not Your Negro — that’s one of my favorite documentaries of all time — The Young Karl Marx, Lumumba: Death of a Prophet and Haiti: The Silence of the Dogs. Raoul Peck served as Haiti’s culture minister in the 1990s.\n\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Raoul, talk about the origins of this film, why you decided to make this.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, Alex is better to answer that first question. You want to tell it?\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Well, no, I got a call from a man who had assembled all the rights to Orwell’s works and wondered if I wanted to executive produce it. I said, “Yes, on one condition: if we can get Raoul Peck to direct it.” And so, I turned to Raoul. And luckily, he answered my call and said yes. So, that’s how it started. But it also seemed like a film — I mean, it began some years ago. It was like two or three years ago we started on this project. It was relevant then. We had no idea how relevant it was to become.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yeah, and I remember when we start working on it. For me, Kamala Harris was going to be president, so — and despite that, I knew that this country and many other countries around the world needed Orwell to come back and — because he had been one of the incredibly analyzer of how a totalitarian regime, but also any type of abuse of power function. You know, he teached how the signs — how to recognize the signs. And, you know, coming from Haiti as a young man and young boy, I also recognize the signs — you know, the attack on the press, the attack on justice, the attack on academia, the attack on any institution that can be a bulwark against totalitarian. And we are living again and again — not only in the United States, but in many other countries, including in Europe, in Latin America, in Africa — the same playbook playing again and again.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: So, Raoul, you’ve said in another interview, “I don’t make biographies. I choose a moment in the life of a character that allows me to tell the bigger story. For Orwell, I found that moment quite rapidly.” So, if you could elaborate on that? So, Alex comes to you with the idea of this film, and what do you think of Orwell?\n\nRAOUL PECK: An idea to which I say “yes” immediately. I don’t know why, but that happened. But you’re not offered every day to be able to immerse yourself in the whole body of work of an author that that you revere and that is important, like James Baldwin was important for me, too. But I know that before going, plunging into it, I had to find a story. I had to find — indeed, I don’t do biography. I try to find a story with a character, with emotions, with contradictions, and a story that allows you to see a film multiple times, not just for what is happening now currently, but also that you can watch in 30 years, and you will learn as much.\n\nSo, the story for me was Orwell in the last year of his life, where he’s struggling to finish 1984. And he will finally finish it, but will die four months later. And he’s only 49. So, the drama of that, you know, and the struggle to finish that, you know, for an author, I thought, was — would give me the fine line of the story and allow me to revisit all his body of work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Writing through dealing with tuberculosis before he died. But for especially the younger generation, who he was, why he came to have this view, this warning to the world about totalitarianism, authoritarianism?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, because it’s — you know, people have thought, including myself, you know, reading Orwell when I was young, always thought of him of a sort of dystopian and science fiction author. But in fact, he was writing about things that he went through in his life, being born in India, and that’s why I use that photo of Orwell as a baby in the hand of a Black nanny. And then he went to Myanmar today, you know.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Burma, yeah.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Burma at the time, which was a British colony. And he went there as a 19-year-old, as a soldier there, and he realized the price of colonialism. He was himself the bully. He was on the wrong side. And that experience, I think, shaped his whole thinking. And he wrote about it in a very candid and open way and self-critical way.\n\nAnd then the Spanish War, again, as a young man in his thirties, to volunteer to fight with the republic against the putschists, Franco, etc. So, all those moments shaped his mind. And, you know, there is a phrase where he said, you know, “After the Spanish Civil War, I knew where I stand.” And that was the turning point for him and of — as well, for the film, to establish who he actually was, and his whole writing, saying that “I want to — you know, to write about politics and art together.” It was never a contradiction for him.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And indeed, he said the decision not to make art about politics is itself a political decision —\n\nRAOUL PECK: Of course.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: — which you —\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yeah, and, as he said, neutrality cannot be — is also a political position. You know, you can’t be neutral. Neutral of what? You know.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: But the other — you talked a little bit about his time in — he was born in India, but I think he was just a few months old when his mother brought him back to England. But then he spends, as you said, from 1922 to '27, five years working as a policeman in, at the time, British-colonized Burma. And as a policeman, he says that he was part of the actual machinery of despotism, and as a result of which — another quote from the film — that he operates, quote, “on a simple theory that the oppressed are always right and the oppressors wrong: a mistaken theory, but the direct result of being one of the oppressors yourself.” So, if you could talk about that? And then, also we'll get into, you know, the extent to which, of course, this experience with colonialism, a direct one, as one of the colonizers, but then also the question of class. Throughout the film, he explains his own formation by his position, as he calls it, being lower-upper-middle class.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yes. Well, the first part of the question, you know, I have — I had a very good friend, the writer Russell Banks, and we had had that discussion many times. And he said the real story of racism in America can only be told by somebody who was a member of the Klan. And it’s a little bit the same way. If you have been in the belly of the beast, you have learned how the beasts think. You have no — you know all the instruments. You know how they function, etc. And that’s what Orwell was able to do. You know, he was doing things that he would come to regret, but he knew them intimately. And about the second part of your question, I forgot. It’s about —\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: About class.\n\nRAOUL PECK: About class. You know, that’s — I was thinking recently about how every politician in this country is using prominently the middle class, as if it’s like something — you have the middle class, and then you have the very rich and the very poor. And so, every citizen wants to be in that middle class. But it’s a way also to erase all class distinction, all the nuance of being in one or the other, is to erasing the working class, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Let’s go to a clip, again, from your film, Orwell: 2+2=5.\n\n GEORGE ORWELL: [voiced by Damian Lewis] I do not think one can assess a writer’s motives without knowing something of his early development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in. At least this is true in tumultuous, revolutionary ages like our own. \n\n When I was not yet 20, I went to Burma in the Indian Imperial Police. In an outpost of empire like Burma, the class question appeared at first sight to have been shelved. Most of the white men in Burma were not of the type who in England would be called “gentlemen.” But they were “white men,” in contradistinction to the other and inferior class, the “natives.” \n\n In the free air of England, that kind of thing is not fully intelligible. In order to hate imperialism, you have got to be part of it. But it is not possible to be part of such a system without recognizing it as an unjustifiable tyranny. Even the thickest-skinned Anglo-Indian is aware of this. Every “native” face he sees in the street brings home to him his monstrous intrusion. But I was in the police, which is to say that I was part of the actual machinery of despotism. \n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: So, that’s a clip from Orwell: 2+2=5. And there, we hear about Orwell’s experience with colonialism and how that shaped his ideological formation, so — which Raoul just talked about. So, Alex, I’d like you to talk a little bit about, you know, a comment that — an Orwell quote that’s also in the film, the fact that leaders can claim that something that happened didn’t happen, or that two and two is five. This fact scares me “more than bombs,” and this is not a “frivolous statement.” So, if you could elaborate on the significance of and the importance of this in our present moment?\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Well, I think that what Orwell was talking about was the idea of authoritarian leaders’ assault on common sense. In other words, what you instinctively know to be true is upended by the authoritarian leader, so that everything flows from him — usually “him.” And that’s the — that’s what we’re experiencing in this moment. We have a president who you can’t even say that he’s a liar, because he just invents things on the spot, but he expects them to be revered as true. Two plus two equals five. That is the the effective —\n\nRAOUL PECK: Slogan.\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Well, it’s a slogan, but that’s how he impresses us with his power, that he can make us rudder against our own common sense. That is — and that’s the danger we must all, you know, rise up against. That’s the problem at this moment.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And also, he makes — I mean, the point that also you have in the film, Orwell saying, “To be corrupted by totalitarianism, one does not have to live in a totalitarian country.”\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Right. And I think also — you know, the other thing to remember, I think, that’s important here is that what we’re living through in this country is not unique, and it’s kind of a playbook that authoritarian leaders go through throughout the world. But also, you know, one of the geniuses — one of the things that’s great about Raoul’s film is that there’s a juxtaposition of present and past, and also country to country, and you can see these same patterns emerge over and over and over again. And it’s a kind of a simple playbook to make us all believe that two plus two equals five, or at least to assert that the — that’s the pledge of allegiance, “two plus two equals five.” But it’s not unique to Donald Trump. And I think that it’s one of the great triumphs of the film.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Raoul Peck, you told Variety, “We are in the hands of a bunch of crazy people who have an agenda totally written out in Project 2025, the same way that Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.” And you also — I mean, just talking about Orwell saying, “Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth.”\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, exactly. And I think everybody remembers when Ms. Conway came with the phrase “alternative facts,” you know, and everybody started laughing about that. But that was what we call the beginning of newspeak, you know, and where you’re actually saying one thing and doing the contrary, the same when Netanyahu at the U.N. said Israel wants peace, while they are bombarding Gaza. So, the absurdity and the contradiction of this is — have invaded our lives. And I know, as — again, coming from Haiti, I remember as a young boy hearing Kennedy and other presidents talking about democracy. And at the same time, they were financing and supporting the dictatorship in my country, or in Congo supporting Mobutu, when we were there, and at the same time talking about peace, talking about the good thing that democracy was bringing. So, that double language have always existed for the imperialist countries and colonialism. You know, there is the talk, and there is the reality. And Orwell, if we can learn something from him, is that he wrote about the reality, not some dystopian future, you know. And we can relate to that, and we can understand how this machine functions.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And so, Raoul, you mentioned newspeak. And in the film, you give several examples from the contemporary moment: “special military operation,” which includes — which equals “invasion of Ukraine”; “vocational training center,” which equals “concentration camp,” a reference to the Uyghurs in China; “legal use of force,” “police brutality”; “antisemitism,” 2024, equals “weaponized term to silence critics of the Israeli military.” Now, if you could talk about, in particular — because you do include it in the film — the proliferation of these terms through a totally new form, social media?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Absolutely. It multiplied that by the million. And we are being bombarded by so-called information, which are absolutely not information. And there is no checking about that. And there is this sequence with Ocasio-Cortez, as well, criticizing or asking Zuckerberg, you know: What is his fact-checking department doing on Facebook? So, it’s such an enormous problem. Like, Orwell tells us that at the moment where you cannot trust language anymore, you’re not in a democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Did you leave this film more hopeful or less?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, it’s — “hopeful” is not a word I can function with. For me, it’s about what do you do once you see that something is not functioning. And I think about what response should we make, what alliance should — \n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And what is the response?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yes, well, that will be the responsibility of each one of us, you know, wherever we are, journalists, as well politicians, but also the civil society. The response, you know, like Orwell said, 84% of Oceania, you know, they are the one who has — or, he calls them the proles, and they are the one who has to bring a response, like the civil rights movement. You know, it was a coalition of very different people, very different movements, and they succeeded in changing this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, I encourage everyone to see this film. It’s at IFC, opening tomorrow night here in New York, and then moving on to Los Angeles and then to the rest of the country. Raoul Peck, director of Orwell: 2+2=5. Alex Gibney produced the film.

And he was not going to run without the DSA.”\n\n“We weren’t even planning to run someone for mayor,” he added, answering a question whether it was Mamdani who came to the DSA seeking an endorsement – or the other way around.\n\nOne leader at the meeting trumpeted the endorsement as “one of the most important moves in modern American history.”\n\nIn fact, power-mad party leaders gloated about their newfound influence.\n\n“We’re getting more power!” exalted Goldner. “People are asking us what we want for things – that doesn’t happen all the time, and that’s really important. There are lots of other left organizations, they aren’t necessarily building power in the same way.”\n\nThe NYC chapter – the DSA’s largest and fastest growing – has ballooned to nearly 11,000 dues-paying members from 8,000 earlier this year, mostly Brooklyn-living Gen Zs and Millennials, and the occasional Boomer – with Mamdani’s campaign fueling the surge in recruits. Mamdani himself proudly announced the 10,000th member in July.\n\nThe meeting, in a small and dingy ground-floor room on Jefferson Street where walls were painted communist red, started with distribution of nametags that included pronouns, featured references to Karl Marx — the “OG communist,” and ended with new recruits given “Zohran for mayor NYC DSA” buttons if they scanned a QR code to join the party.\n\nAround 50 people showed up, which was all the room could handle. The “101” meetings are held several times a month, and leaders noted how they’ve outgrown the space and are looking for a new HQ.\n\nIt was revealed at the gathering that Mamdani will be expected to meet weekly with party elders if he’s elected.\n\nThrough what it calls its “Socialists in Office Committee,” the NYC DSA regulalry meets endorsed lawmakers to “coordinate on what the DSA elected officials should be doing and how they should vote,” according to documents handed out at Wednesday night’s gathering.\n\nThe weekly directives have been given to Mamdani in his capacity as a Queens state assembly member since 2021.\n\nAs a state politician he has pushed their extreme agenda. He’s personally introduced several bills featured on the NYC DSA legislative platform, like Cecila’s act, a bill to decriminalize prostitution; legislation to shut down ICE facilities in the state, and a bill to authorized more “supervised injection” sites.\n\nThe speakers on Wednesday blasted the Democratic Party for being out of touch, admitting to using the Democratic line on the ballot only as a means to an end, the only way to get a socialist elected.\n\n“In New York State, it’s very difficult to get a party line that is not the Democratic Party,” Goldner said, answering a question about the DSA’s position on running candidates as independents instead of Democrats. \n\n“It’s just not something that’s feasible for us in New York at this time,” he added, calling running as a Democrat “favorable.”\n\nHe pointed to the DSA’s failed attempt at electing Jabari Brisport to the City Council in 2017 as a Green Party candidate and then endorsing his 2021 comeback for state Senate as a Democrat.\n\nIt’s been a contentious point for the left’s growing socialist base, with Long Island Dem Rep. Tom Suozzi recently saying they should leave the Democratic Party to create their own.\n\nMany attendees Wednesday made it clear they didn’t necessarily see themselves as Democrats.\n\n“For me, why I left the Democratic Party to come to the DSA, is this insistence on a class-based analysis of everything first – which I think is missing from the Democratic Party,” said one comrade.\n\n“I’m here because I come from a very Democratic family, and I guess I’ve had a growing sense of disillusionment with the establishment Democrats and was very inspired by Zohran’s campaign,” added another new DSA member.\n\nMembers blasted the Dems for “throwing their trans and immigrant comrades under the bus” to please the more moderate elements of the party – and blamed Kamala Harris’ failed presidential bid on a campaign based on what they called “imagery” rather than “material issues.”\n\nThe NYC DSA and Mamdani’s campaign did not return The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani is expected to be a party apparatchik who will follow the radical agenda of the Democratic Socialists of America, power mad members of its NYC chapter declared at a meeting infiltrated by The Post this week.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/04/us-news/mamdani-expected-to-follow-will-of-nyc-dsa-membership-if-elected-groups-leaders-say/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/www-instagram-com-p-dcpibe-112665110.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/t6E4uwmO-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-04 12:34:44","author":"Gabrielle Fahmy","authors":["Gabrielle Fahmy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.195},{"id":366144192,"title":"Trump is reviving large sales of coal from public lands. Will anyone want it?","text":"U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.\n\nThe sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows. \n\nThree other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.\n\nThose market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?\n\nThe question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.\n\n Rushing to approve projects \n\nThe upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields. \n\nOfficials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.\n\nTrump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful\" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.\n\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.\n\nThe administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.\n\n“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”\n\n Coal demand plummets \n\nThe AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007. \n\nEnergy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands. \n\nBut it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\n“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”\n\nThe coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.\n\nTwenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.\n\nIn filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000. \n\nThat is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.\n\nNTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.\n\n“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said. \n\nIn central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.\n\nAmong them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.\n\n Aging plants and optimism \n\nThe largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.\n\nPeabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years. \n\n\"U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,\" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”\n\nNo large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.\n\nThat leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.\n\n“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,\" Kumar said.\n\nGruver reported from Wellington, Colorado.

Despite the fact that as many as 140 people who’d worked in his first administration—including Paul Dans, Heritage’s director of Project 2025—had a hand in its creation, Trump said: “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.”\n\nThis was demonstrably untrue, even at the time. Media Matters for America dug up a clip from as far back as May 2023 of Dans stating that “President Trump’s very bought in with this,” speaking of the program.\n\nProject 2025 was almost inconceivably unpopular. An NBC News poll from September 2024 showed that while 57% of registered voters viewed the plan negatively, just 4% viewed it positively.\n\nBut in the critical months leading up to the election, many media outlets took Trump’s denial at face value, publishing fact checks and other commentary that painted Democrats’ warnings about his connection to the plan as alarmist or misleading.\n\nResponding to a social media post in July stating that “Trump has made his authoritarian intentions quite clear with his Project 2025 plan,” a fact check by USA Today rated the statement “false,” because, as the headline said, “Project 2025 is an effort by the Heritage Foundation, not Donald Trump.”\n\nIn September, after Harris confronted Trump about Project 2025 at the first and only debate between the two, the paper published another fact-check with the headline: “Harris repeats claim that Project 2025 is Trump’s plan. That’s still not right.”\n\nIn response to Harris’ claim during the debate that Project 2025 was “a detailed and dangerous plan... that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected,” Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, whose coverage received a fair bit of criticism during the 2024 cycle, reported in bold text that “Project 2025 is not an official campaign document.”\n\nA CNN fact check of the Harris campaign’s social media in September remarked that one account “frequently invokes Project 2025,” before caveating that “Project 2025 is not Trump’s initiative, and he has said he disagrees with some of its proposals.”\n\nIn an October interview on CBS‘s “Face the Nation,” anchor Norah O’Donnell, Harris attempted to warn about Project 2025, before O’Donnell responded: “You know that Donald Trump has disavowed Project 2025. He says that is not his campaign plan.” \n\nAfter nine months back in power, the website Project 2025 Tracker estimates that Trump has already implemented approximately 48% of the objectives outlined in the policy document.\n\nIn addition to his key campaign promises many of his second administration’s policies are highly specific to Project 2025, such as his pledge to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), his efforts to privatize the National Weather Service (NWS), his reconfiguration of Title X funding to promote pregnancy, and his elimination of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\n\nTrump is no longer hiding his connection to Project 2025, having brought in many of its hiring picks and authors to staff his administration almost immediately after his victory last November.\n\nThis week, he began to boast about it openly. As his Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director, Russ Vought, one of Project 2025’s architects, began using the current government shutdown to unilaterally cut off funding to infrastructure projects in blue states and cities, Trump lauded him as “he of PROJECT 2025 Fame.”\n\n“This was always the plan,” Harris responded on social media.\n\nWhile many commentators expressed outrage that Trump blatantly lied about his connections to Project 2025, others dredged up old clips of newspapers and anchors taking him at his word.\n\n“All those 2024 media fact checks that said, ‘Donald Trump and the Trump campaign deny any connection to Project 2025’ look pretty ridiculous right now,” said MeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski. “A Trump denial is not a fact. You just used his lies to ‘debunk’ a reality that was obvious to anyone paying attention.”\n\nMehdi Hasan, the founder of the independent media company Zeteo, highlighted the CBS interview, saying Trump’s embrace of Project 2025 was “embarrassing not just for Norah O’Donnell but a whole host of leading American anchors and reporters who echoed Trump’s false denials.”\n\n“Nothing showed the difference between mainstream and independent media better than the response to Trump’s obvious lie about not knowing anything about Project 2025,” said David Pepper, author of the book Saving Democracy: A User’s Manual. “Most mainstream media started fact-checking those who claimed a connection to be somehow false. Others ‘both sides’ed’ it. Far more in independent media called it out as a whopping lie.”","summary":"As President Donald Trump openly embraces Project 2025, mainstream media outlets are facing criticism for their role in helping him downplay his ties to the wildly unpopular far-right governing playbook in the lead-up to his reelection last year.\n\nAfter she became the Democratic nominee in July, former Vice President Kamala Harris made the Heritage Foundation’s over 900-page manifesto for “the next conservative president” central to her case against Trump during the 2024 election, often referring to it as “Trump’s Project 2025.”\n\n\nShe and other Democrats warned that if he retook power, he would swiftly enact many of its most extreme and unpopular proposals and dramatically expand executive power while doing it.\n\nAmong those proposals were steep cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the “mass deportations” of millions of immigrants, the elimination of the Department of Education, new restrictions on abortions, the gutting of climate protectio","url":"https://www.alternet.org/trump-lie-project-2025/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61617884&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C295%2C0%2C296","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 11:16:14","author":"Stephen Prager","authors":["Stephen Prager"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.382},{"id":366125076,"title":"How Donald Trump’s Approval Rating Has Changed Since Government Shutdown","text":"President Donald Trump‘s approval rating is creeping back up amid the first government shutdown in six years, polling shows.\n\nAn RMG Research poll of 3,000 registered voters, conducted September 23 through October 1—the day the government shutdown began—found that 51 percent of respondents approved of Trump’s job performance, with 48 percent disapproving. \n\nThe net of +3 points marks a one-point uptick from the previous week, though the results largely reflect opinions collected before the shutdown took effect. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.\n\nNewsweek‘s tracker also showed an improvement in Trump’s approval rating, with his net approval now standing at -8 points—44 approving and 52 disapproving. That is up from -11 points on October 1.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe slight rebound suggests Trump’s standing with voters remains resilient despite ongoing political turbulence.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe federal government shut down this week after Congress failed to break a funding deadlock and pass a measure to keep agencies running.\n\nThe government funding dispute largely centers on whether to include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies in the spending bill. Democrats say health care protections must be preserved, while Republicans say funding and policy should be handled separately.\n\nWith funding lapsed, agencies must furlough all “nonexcepted” employees, while those deemed essential to protecting life and property continue working without pay until the shutdown ends. \n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 750,000 federal workers could be sidelined each day, with daily lost compensation amounting to about $400 million.\n\nTrump has also threatened to use the shutdown to slash government spending and carry out mass firings instead of furloughing federal workers, as is the usual practice during a shutdown.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that layoffs were imminent.\n\n“If they don’t want further harm on their constituents back home, then they need to reopen the government,” Leavitt said of Democrats on Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks from Marine One after arriving on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on September 30. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nAccording to a YouGov survey of 3,376 U.S. adults, conducted on October 1, 36 percent said they would be personally affected by the shutdown.\n\nPolls have also shown that Americans think Republicans would be more to blame than Democrats for the shutdown.\n\nA PBS News/NPR/Marist poll of 1,477 U.S. adults found that 38 percent said Republicans would be most to blame for a shutdown, while 27 percent said Democrats would be to blame.\n\nYouGov polling showed that 45 percent of Americans said Trump was very responsible for the shutdown, 45 percent blamed congressional Republicans, and 36 percent said congressional Democrats were responsible.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have sought to blame the opposing side for the shutdown.\n\n“Democrats have officially voted to CLOSE the government,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X.\n\nHe added: “Democrats could have worked with us. Instead they prioritized taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.”\n\nLeavitt said, “Democrats put us in this position.”\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X: “President Trump and Congressional Republicans just shut down the government because they refused to stop your health care costs from rising. Let me be clear: Republicans are in charge of the White House, House, and Senate. This is their shutdown.”\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said the shutdown amounted to “the clearest sign yet that Republicans are inept, incompetent, and lack any respect for the American people.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, there appears to be little hope the shutdown will end anytime soon.\n\n“There’s nothing to negotiate. There’s nothing we can pull out of this bill to make it any leaner or cleaner than it is,” Johnson said on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, Republicans and Democrats failed for a third time to reach an agreement on legislation to fund the government.\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nWhether Trump’s approval holds up in the coming weeks will depend on how long the shutdown lasts, how much it disrupts the economy, and whether voters ultimately blame him, Republicans or Democrats.\n\nThe shutdown is expected to continue into next week. Johnson has designated next week as a district work period, meaning no votes are scheduled.","summary":"President Donald Trump&#039;s approval rating has crept back up amid the first government shutdown in six years, according to polling.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-donald-trump-approval-rating-has-changed-since-government-shutdown-10828337","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25273554960231-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 11:06:22","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.548},{"id":366122632,"title":"Amid national glare, Broadview mayor keeps focus on her 8,000 residents: ‘I can’t be afraid’","text":"Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson starts her day in the western suburb at 4 a.m. with silent meditation and prayer, but she ends the more stressful days belting out an Ice Cube diss track on her way home from the Village Hall. There’s been a lot of Ice Cube lately.\n\n“It just charges me up when the attacks come and I know I don’t deserve that,” she says in her office near Tupac and Snoop Dogg prayer candles, both given to her by a constituent as a nod to her West Coast roots and love for hip-hop.\n\nThe morning meditation, the car karaoke, a strict 9:30 p.m. bedtime are all part of a regimen she’s keeping to help navigate a new national spotlight as President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively responds to protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center tucked into Broadview’s industrial corridor.\n\nOn Friday, Thompson almost came face-to-face with U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who appeared unannounced at Village Hall asking for a meeting. In turn, Thompson went to the ICE center looking for Noem, but was told she was unavailable. Top U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino also visited the Broadview site on Friday.\n\nStanding just 5 feet 3 inches tall, Thompson comes off as sturdy as the water tower outside her office bearing the town’s unofficial slogan, “Broadview Strong.”\n\n“We are the strongest in the state. And I mean it,” she said in a lengthy interview Thursday with WBEZ. “We don’t fold. Broadview’s not scared. … Leave Broadview alone.”\n\nAs immigration enforcement has ramped up in the Chicago area, federal agents have shot pepper balls, deployed tear gas and used physical force to quell repeated demonstrations outside the Broadview facility. The town’s own police chief, Thomas Mills, says he was verbally accosted by an ICE officer. The department has opened three criminal investigations into federal agents’ actions.\n\nThe confrontations are the highest profile set of episodes to shake the 8,000-resident village and its mayor.\n\nBut in a morning spent with WBEZ at a coffee shop and in her office, Thompson remained unflappable, adamant that she is prepared to protect Broadview from aggressive federal tactics, even if it means going toe-to-toe with President Trump.\n\n“I feel comfortable wherever I am, because I’m Katrina first. That means I know who I am,” says Thompson, first elected mayor of the majority-Black, working class village in 2017. “I can’t be afraid, because I have so many people relying on me.\n\n“The residents, our business[es], all of the visitors — we’re responsible for them,” says the native Californian. “We’re responsible for the protesters, their well-being, their safety. We are responsible for the journalists that come to our town.”\n\nFor guidance, Thompson, 55, has leaned on other local leaders, including Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, County Commissioner Tara Stamps, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, neighboring mayors and State Rep. La Shawn Ford, whom she’s known for 15 years.\n\n“She’s the caregiver of Broadview,” Ford says. “Her focus has always been on the residents of Broadview. And I think that what’s happening to her is going to test her ability to lead, and she’s doing a great job.”\n\nFord describes Thompson as “not political” and focused solely on hyperlocal, constituent needs. That shows in an early spar she had with Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who protested at Broadview in his capacity as a congressional candidate.\n\n“Broadview would be better served by the presence of Evanston police officers helping to bolster our small force to protect demonstrators rather than a candidate … boosting his campaign,” she said in a statement. Biss refuted the accusation.\n\n A lifetime of preparation\n\nThompson was built for this moment in key ways. She was raised in Inglewood, Calif., by a single mom who taught her to be fiercely self-assured, and grandparents who grew up in the 1930s American South.\n\nThemes of resiliency and resistance were woven into the fabric of the childhood she shared with her now-late sister.\n\n“We learned Black history at home,” Thompson says.\n\nThompson’s office is lined with testaments to her heritage, along with cherished mementos from constituents: a portrait of a Black woman running her hands through her Afro, a chain necklace with the outline of Africa in the red, yellow and green colors that symbolize Black identity. On display are the kinds of Black history children’s books Trump has sought to excise from American education, like “The 1619 Project: Born on the Water” and “Black is a Rainbow Color.”\n\nThompson sees a direct tie between the experiences of immigrants being detained or deported, and those of Black Americans who lived through Jim Crow, redlining and other facets of modern-day systemic racism.\n\n“We’ve been here before, and what has changed? Now it’s just immigrants, but prior to this, it was Black people,” she says.\n\nBroadview is 63% Black, 21% Latino, 11% white, firmly working class and deeply blue. In the voting precincts that cover Broadview, 88% of the 2024 presidential vote went to former Vice President Kamala Harris, with 10% for Trump, according to an analysis by WBEZ. A high school diploma is the highest degree for about 40% of the town, and another 20% take some college classes while 10% earn a bachelor’s. The median income is $60,000, according to a 2025 snapshot of U.S. Census data from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.\n\nThe town is a third industrial, a third commercial and a third residential, a mix is reflected in the town’s official slogan: “A balanced community.”\n\nAlong the industrial 25th Avenue, the squeaks and roars of semi-trucks dominate. The commercial strip is peppered with a few vacant storefronts, along with signs of new retail life and community anchors. “View,” a fancy new restaurant, serves up “elevated comfort food.” A block down on Roosevelt Road a school uniform and trophy supplier, once a full-scale sporting goods store, has been open since 1952.\n\nA community of neighbors, and opinions\n\nResidential streets are lined with trees and two-story brick homes. People know their neighbors — and their mayor. One evening last week a WBEZ reporter knocked on doors to hear from residents. One man answered his intercom, but said he couldn’t talk. The man then called the mayor to tell her a reporter was sniffing around.\n\n“That’s Broadview,” Thompson says with a laugh. “We don’t let anybody come and not say nothing” about it.\n\nIn the same neighborhood, a woman named Georgia had her front door open to let the breeze in.\n\n“It’ll be 30 years next year” in Broadview, says Georgia, declining to share her last name. “And it was clean when I moved here, and it’s clean now, and it’s quiet here.”\n\nShe likes how Thompson is speaking out. She saw her first news conference about the immigration protests earlier that week. The mayor urged the Trump administration to “stop unprovoked chemical arms attacks on peaceful protesters and on journalists.” \n\nThompson has spoken out strongly about the effect of tear gas and other aggressive tactics on residents, cops, firefighters and paramedics. She called on ICE to dismantle a fence it had constructed outside the facility, which the fire department said could impede emergency responders. State and Cook County agencies set up new barricades on Thursday at the request of the Broadview police to clear the roadway and to create “designated protest areas.”\n\nBut resident Arnettra Westbrooks wants her mayor to do more. She would like Thompson to institute a curfew on protesters “because there’s a lot of senior citizens living around there.”\n\n“On Fridays they are there until 10 or 11 o’clock and all that’s doing is pissing ICE off. Go home,” she says.\n\nThe criticism is mild compared to some of the insults cropping up from across the country from Trump supporters and other critics on Thompson’s Facebook page.\n\nFinding solace and inspiration\n\nThe last few weeks have brought “real heavy days,” the mayor says, and she worries that escalated violence at the facility will lead to severe injuries or worse.\n\nBut as Thompson continues to find her footing on a bigger stage, the faithful Baptist says she has seen signs of encouragement from guardian angels — her sister, who died in 2011, and her grandparents.\n\nThe other day an orange and black butterfly flew across 25th Avenue, “something I’ve never seen across a major street,” Thompson says, adding that she “likes butterflies, because it’s a real birth to freedom.”\n\nShe thanked her sister, Rolisha, for what she saw as “confirmation that I’m gonna be OK.” She also heard her grandma’s voice in her head.\n\n“My grandmother was like ‘Just stand. Don’t take sh-t … from nobody.’”\n\nContributing: Bob Chiarito","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/04/broadview-mayor-katrina-thompson-ice-detention-center-arrests-kristi-noem-gregory-bovino","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a03939/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5458x3639+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F9e%2F7a58b34a4e1c991215acbbd86d54%2Fbroad","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 11:00:00","author":"Mariah Woelfel | WBEZ","authors":["Mariah Woelfel | WBEZ"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.07},{"id":366140276,"title":"Trump slashed $8 billion for energy projects in blue states. In California, that could be felt in red areas as well","text":"The Trump administration this week escalated its efforts against renewable energy when it announced the cancellation of $7.56 billion in funding for projects in 16 states, including California. The U.S. Department of Energy said the 223 canceled projects — all of which are in states that favored Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election — were terminated because they \"did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.\" But while the cuts took aim at blue states, they will affect Trump's base as well: The terminated projects span districts represented by 108 Democratic members of Congress and 28 Republicans. In California, that includes large swaths of the Central Valley and Inland Empire, which largely leaned toward Trump in 2024. Russell Vought, director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget and a top Trump administration official, said in a post on X that the canceled projects were using \"Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda.\" The biggest cut was $1.2 billion for California's ambitious project to develop clean hydrogen known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. It was awarded by the Biden administration as part of a competitive nationwide effort to develop hydrogen projects. The idea is that the hydrogen, which burns at a very high temperature, will be able to replace planet-warming fossil fuels in some industry and transportation uses. The ARCHES project is a public-private partnership that would create at least 10 hydrogen production sites around the state, primarily in the Central Valley. It would also help transition two large gas-fired power plants — Scattergood in Los Angeles and the Lodi Energy Center in San Joaquin County — to 100% renewable hydrogen, and develop more than 60 hydrogen fueling stations in areas including Fresno, Riverside, Orange and San Joaquin counties. In all, it would deliver an estimated 220,000 jobs, including 130,000 construction jobs and 90,000 permanent jobs, according to the state. California is pursuing hydrogen in addition to renewables such as offshore wind, solar power and geothermal energy to help diversify its supply, meet growing demand driven by artificial intelligence data centers, and reach its target of 100% carbon neutrality by 2045. The Trump administration said terminating the clean energy projects will save taxpayers money. One district with a project that's been cut is the northern San Joaquin Valley, represented by Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove). McClintock said he strongly supports the Energy Department's decision. \"$7.5 billion comes out to about $60 taken from the average earnings of every family in America,\" McClintock said. \"Call me old fashioned, but I think that companies should make their money by pleasing their customers and not by using government to take money that families have earned.\" The Times also reached out to Reps. Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield), Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale), Keven Kiley (R-Rocklin), Ken Calvert (R-Corona), Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills) and Jay Obernolte (R-Big Bear Lake), whose districts are touched by the ARCHES hub and other terminated projects. A representative for Fong said his office was dealing with issues related to the U.S. government shutdown and so was unable to comment. None of the others responded. Jesse Lee, senior advisor with the nonprofit group Climate Power, said the cancellations may not save taxpayers money, but cost them. The administration this year has canceled a $7 billion program to help low-income households install solar panels on their homes and halted the development of off-shore wind projects, among other efforts. \"Having these projects come to fruition is really the only chance we have at insulating people from skyrocketing utility bills year after year,\" Lee said — particularly in the face of energy-thirsty AI. \"The only way to have a prayer of meeting that demand is through these kinds of clean energy projects.\" Lee believes the actions could come back to haunt the party in the midterm elections. Since Trump took office in January, at least 142 clean energy projects have been canceled affecting what his group estimates is at least 80,500 jobs — not including the latest round of cuts announced this week. About 47% of those jobs were in congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Clean Power’s energy project tracker. Democratic officials in California said the Energy Department's latest cuts amount to political retaliation. They were announced on the first day of the shutdown, which the administration blames on Democrats. \"The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof that this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,\" California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla wrote in a joint letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright dated Thursday, in which they urged him to restore its funding. \"The cancellation of this award threatens the future promise of hydrogen energy, leaving us behind the rest of the world,\" the senators said. \"The ARCHES hub is a key strategic investment into American energy dominance, energy technology prominence, manufacturing job growth, and lowering energy costs for American families.\" The cuts come as the Trump administrations eases the path for production of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, including this week's announcement that it will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to recommission or modernize coal-fired power plants. Coal has become increasingly uncompetitive with either natural gas or solar power. Large-scale renewable energy and carbon capture projects in red states such as Wyoming, Ohio, Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota that received funding from the Energy Department were not subject to the cuts. Other canceled awards in California include $630 million to the California Energy Commission for grid resilience upgrades; $500 million to the National Cement Company of California for a carbon-neutral cement production facility; $87 million to Redwood Coast Energy Authority for grid updates benefiting tribal communities; $50 million to Southern California Edison for a battery energy storage project; and $18 million to the Imperial Irrigation District to modernize its electrical grid, bolster resiliency against power outages and catalyze renewable energy usage. \"We are disappointed as we did a great deal of work to win the $18.3 million matching grant from the DOE to help modernize our electrical grid and enhance reliability for our customers,\" said Robert Schettler, a spokesman for the Imperial Irrigation District located in southeastern California. \"Despite this setback, we will reevaluate the scope as the project is a necessity.\" Officials with ARCHES called the administration's decision a \"short-sighted move that abandons America's opportunity to lead the global clean energy transition.\" They said they hope to keep the project moving forward even without the federal grant; ARCHES has also secured more than $10 billion in private funding agreements. \"Despite the loss of federal funding, we will press forward with our state, private, and international partners to build the infrastructure, train the workforce, and establish the supply chains that will power a modern, resilient energy economy,\" ARCHES board chair Theresa Maldonado said in a statement.","summary":"The terminated projects span districts represented by 108 Democratic members of Congress and 28 Republicans.

New York mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared with firefighters. When producer Lorne Michaels asked: “Can we be funny?”, Giuliani replied: “Why start now?”\n\nIt was September 2001 and, just 18 days after the worst terrorist attack in US history, Saturday Night Live’s blend of satire, silliness and live music was back on the air. “In bad times, people turn to the show,” Michaels told Rolling Stone magazine 20 years later.\n\nSNL turns 50 this month and must once again try to meet the moment. This time, the crisis is not external but taking place in late-night TV comedy itself. In recent weeks, the genre has become the canary in the coal mine of US democracy.\n\nOver the summer, CBS announced the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ostensibly for financial reasons, though notably Colbert is a longtime Trump critic and CBS owner Paramount had been seeking government approval of an $8bn merger with Skydance.\n\nOn 17 September, ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel’s show over comments he made after the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Hours before the suspension, the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, warned that local broadcasters who aired Kimmel could face fines or loss of licences and said: “It’s time for them to step up.”\n\nThe move prompted an outcry over freedom of speech. ABC parent Disney faced pressure from Kimmel’s fans, some of whom cancelled subscriptions to the company’s streaming services Disney+ and Hulu. Kimmel returned to the air six days later and mocked Trump: “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show.”\n\nNow the spotlight shifts from CBS and ABC to America’s other major network: NBC. When SNL returns on 4 October, Bad Bunny will host with Doja Cat as the musical guest and five new featured players following several cast departures. But no moment will matter more than the “cold open” in how it deals with the current climate.\n\n“This would be one of the biggest, most important cold openings in the 50-year history of the show,” says Stephen Farnsworth, a co-author of Late Night With Trump: Political Humor and the American Presidency. “But in the past, when Saturday Night Live has faced a major challenge, like they did in the wake of 9/11, they’ve risen to the occasion.”\n\nSNL’s mockery of Trump has at times earned the wrath of his supporters and the president himself, but Farnsworth advised against pulling punches, saying: “Saturday Night Live will face charges that it isn’t going far enough or that it went too far pretty much no matter what they do, so there’s no reason not to be all in.”\n\nFarnsworth, the director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, adds: “It’s striking that a man who desires the spotlight as much as the president does, who wants to be a public figure as badly as he has over the years, doesn’t understand that criticism is part of the package that comes with power.”\n\nLaunched a year after the Watergate scandal toppled Richard Nixon, SNL features sketches and live musical performances. But it is also known for covering politics and featuring politicians. The weekend update segment provides ongoing commentary while cast members often parody presidents, candidates and other figures.\n\nThe most famous include Gerald Ford (Chevy Chase), George HW Bush (Dana Carvey), Bill Clinton (Darrell Hammond), George W Bush (Will Ferrell), Sarah Palin (Tina Fey), Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin) and Joe Biden (various cast and guest actors). Trump is now portrayed with aplomb by James Austin Johnson.\n\nSusan Morrison, author of Lorne, a biography of Michaels, recalls: “When Alec Baldwin was doing him, Trump was furiously tweeting right about SNL: it wasn’t funny, FCC should investigate, Lorne was over. Watching Alec Baldwin do his thing, it almost felt like bear baiting. It was so fun to watch the back and forth, and don’t anticipate that they’re going to pull back.”\n\nPoliticians have also appeared as hosts or in cameos. Al Gore, John McCain, Jesse Jackson and Sarah Palin have all featured. Trump hosted in 2004 and, more controversially, in 2015 during his presidential run. Hillary Clinton appeared multiple times, including alongside her impersonator, Kate McKinnon, and Kamala Harris took part before last year’s election.\n\nThe show picked up 12 Emmys recently for its 50th season and anniversary programming, including an award for outstanding variety special. Saturday’s episode will be scrutinised closely for how it deals with Trump’s attack on comedy, free expression and democracy – and whether it can make a serious point in a funny, unsanctimonious way.\n\nMorrison continues: “Lorne and his very smart writers will come up with some clever but on-the-nose way of dealing with this. The thing that it’s important to remember about Lorne is he’s been doing this for so many decades. He’s outlasted so many slates of executives. He’s a survivor. As Conan [O’Brien] told me, in the Game of Thrones of show business, Lorne would be the last man standing.\n\n“That isn’t to say that he’s going to cave but he will figure out a way to address this and stay on the air. I also don’t think the people at NBC or Comcast or the FCC are going to mess with him. He’s too much of a statesman in the TV business. But he’s going to come up with a way of dealing with it and addressing it and he’ll be funny about it.”\n\nConservatives have long accused SNL of bias, arguing that the show disproportionately lampoons right-leaning figures while going easier on Democrats. Former head writer Tina Fey openly acknowledged a “liberal bias” in a 2003 interview, fueling the narrative. But Michaels insists that it is nonpartisan and willing to mock both sides.\n\nMorrison adds: “It isn’t to say he would ever be an apologist for the Trump regime; nobody could have expected that politics would jump the shark in quite this way. But he certainly would not hesitate to make fun of Democrats even now if they merit it and that’s part of it.\n\n“To quote Jim Downey, one of the show’s longtime writers, you never want the show to seem like it’s the comedy division of the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Lorne is committed to that and that will help here as well.”\n\nDavid Litt, aformer speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work on White House Correspondents’ Association dinner monologues, acknowledges that he has been on the receiving end.\n\n“I was in the audience at SNL when their cold open was about the Obamacare website crashing,” he said. “I was working at the White House at the time and I remember thinking, I’m not having fun. Everyone else in the audience seemed be having a better time than I was.”\n\nWriting comic material under time pressure is tough, Litt says, and that will be the SNL team’s top priority for the new season. He said: “This is a show that rises to a pretty intense challenge every week and I assume they’re going to be thinking about rising to the exact same challenge, which is, how do we turn around a show that is good and funny because that’s hard enough without having the president of the United States breathing down your neck.\n\n“That’s part of what infuriates Trump so much about comedians. It’s not that they’re making fun of him, it’s that the audience is laughing. It’s connecting. If Kimmel or Colbert or weekend update was making a joke about Trump and the audience was rejecting that joke, I don’t think Trump would care. It’s the fact that it exposes him as still, despite everything, a fundamentally laughable person, or at least a human person.”\n\nLitt, whose new book, It’s Only Drowning, is about his unlikely friendship with a Joe Rogan fan, adds: “I can’t imagine that people are going to be sitting around a writers’ room saying, how do we address this as though they were journalists. I think they’re saying, how do we do funny stuff? Because doing funny stuff is really hard.”\n\nSNL has already used up one potential Trump gag. Its cold open on 9 November last year, the first weekend after Trump won the presidential election, was entitled SNL for Trump and had cast members sarcastically trying to get on Trump’s good side, singing: “We will, whatever you want.” The sketch was a satirical take on the public figures and institutions that had shifted their stances or expressed deference to Trump for political or personal gain.\n\nBill Carter, author of the book The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, says: “The gauntlet has been thrown now and, if they don’t do something, they will disappoint people. People will be expecting their take and their take won’t be the most obvious one. It’ll be some creative way of approaching it. They have a very good Trump right now so they ought to use him.”\n\nTrump has frequently railed against SNL over the years and is likely to be watching its return with fingers poised for a hot take on the cold open. But like Morrison, Carter thinks it unlikely that SNL will suffer the same fate as Colbert or Kimmel.\n\n“Unlike those shows, Trump cannot say this has terrible ratings and does not make money,” he says. “Saturday Night Live does not have terrible ratings. In fact, with the right host, it will often be among the most watched shows on television. And it has the best demographics on any show on television except for sports.\n\n“The idea that they would abandon that show is nuts, because if they did, some streaming service would say, we’ll put on Saturday Night Live. It’s 50 years that show’s been on. It’s had an audience all those times of a new generation of viewers. It continues to do that so it’s a tremendously valuable franchise. NBC is not walking away from that show. I don’t care what pressure they put on it.”","summary":"The return of the long-running series lands at a difficult time for late-night comedy – and free speech\n\nPaul Simon sang The Boxer.

Leftist Media Blame Kirk Assassination on Conservatives","text":"In the immediate aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, there were sickening statements made by both journalists and celebrities that either blamed Kirk himself or conservative rhetoric for his death. \n\nBefore Kirk’s death was even confirmed, MSNBC contributor Matthew Dowd criticized Kirk for constantly pushing “hate speech” and added: “hateful words….lead to hateful actions.” \n\nCBS Mornings host Nate Burleson pressed former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy: “Not everyone took to his [Charlie Kirk] words or his rhetoric….They were offensive to specific communities….Is this a moment for your party to reflect on political violence?”\n\nFormer MSNBC host Keith Olbermann actually put the onus on the President: “Charlie Kirk is dead – as so many others are dead or threatened or wounded or living in fear – because there is a Donald Trump.”\n\nThe Hollywood Left also pushed the angle that conservatives were at fault. ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s spreading of this disinformation got him briefly suspended: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”\n\nSadly, the calls for the left to tone down their rhetoric (in the wake of the Kirk shooting) went largely unheeded as they quickly returned to their attacks on “authoritarian” Trump’s attacks on democracy. \n\nThe following are just some of the most obnoxious outbursts by leftist journalists and celebrities from the past month:\n\n[LANGUAGE WARNING]\n\nMSNBC: Charlie Kirk’s “Hate Speech” Got Him Shot\n\nHost Katy Tur: Talk to me about the environment. You know, we are — there are the reports of exactly what happened — are not confirmed yet, but talk to me about the environment in which a shooting like this happens.”Contributor Matthew Dowd: “Yeah. And again, I emphasize what you just emphasized. We don’t know the full details of this. We don’t know if this was a supporter shooting their gun off in celebration or — so, we have no idea about this. But following up on what was just said, he’s [Charlie Kirk] been one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this who has constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or sort of aimed at certain groups and I always go back to hateful thoughts, lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions. And I think that’s the environment we’re in that, that people just — you can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and not expect awful actions to take place and that’s the unfortunate environment we’re in.”— Conversation between Tur and Dowd just moments after the first report of Charlie Kirk being shot, as aired on MSNBC’s Katy Tur Reports, September 10.\n\n“Offensive” Kirk Was Shot, Is This a Time for GOP to “Reflect on Political Violence?” \n\n“Not everyone took to his [Charlie Kirk] words or his rhetoric. You know, at times they were offensive to specific communities. But with that said, this is not the time to focus on that, we are focused on this tragedy. Speaking of tragedy, is this a moment for your party to reflect on political violence?”— Co-host Nate Burleson to former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on CBS Mornings, September 11.\n\nKeith Olbermann: Kirk Is Dead Because of Donald Trump’s Rhetoric\n\n“Charlie Kirk was killed in Donald Trump’s America. It is not just that Trump is the leading threat in this country, in this moment, to the safety and the lives of conservatives and Republicans and MAGA. It is that he has been for a decade. Charlie Kirk is dead – as so many others are dead or threatened or wounded or living in fear – because there is a Donald Trump.”— Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, after listing various past Trump statements, on his Countdown podcast, September 18. \n\nDon Lemon: Can’t Excuse Kirk’s “Behavior,” Most of Political Violence Is Done by Right-Wingers\n\n“I want Charlie Kirk to be okay. But, no one is excusing Charlie Kirk’s behavior and what he’s done and what he stands for. And, a lot of that political violence, if not most of it — it happens on both sides of the aisle—but a lot of that political violence comes from the right….The MAGA right can say what they want, but most of the political violence, especially the shootings, have been done….by young, white men who are usually right-wingers, and some of them far right-wingers.” — Former CNN anchor Don Lemon on The Don Lemon Show podcast, September 10. \n\nKirk Has Become a “Symbol of the Toxic Culture” That We’re In Now\n\n“He [Charlie Kirk] said a lot of things that got a lot of people riled up, right? And that was part of his style about race, about gender, about affirmative action and Islam and things like that…..He’s – you know – become in this last few days, I think, a symbol of the toxic culture that we’re in right now, in politics.”— The New York Times’s Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker on PBS’s Washington Week in Review, September 12. \n\n“Divisive” Kirk Was “Known to Make Racist Statements” \n\n“The reason that he [Charlie Kirk] is seen as a divisive figure, and why the left has had a reaction as well in this is because he has been known to make racist statements….and has definitely lobbed a number of attacks on transgender individuals. And so there's a lot across the LGBTQ advocacy space who are opposed to him.”— MSNBC White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez on PBS’s Washington Week in Review, September 12. \n\nAt Least Kirk Wasn’t As “Caustic” As Rush Limbaugh\n\n“Charlie Kirk, I think, kind of patented almost was the ability to do this and seem likable, friendly, open….He modeled himself early on after Rush Limbaugh, but without Limbaugh’s hard edges.

No writings left behind. Vague, secondhand testimony. That uncertainty, and the risk of drawing sweeping conclusions, suggests the murder may share similarities with recent violence not driven by an obvious political ideology.” — Anchor John Dickerson on CBS Evening News Plus, September 15.\n\nKirk Assassin’s Texts Were “Touching”\n\n“The other thing that stood out to me, David, is those text messages….It was very touching in a way that I think many of us didn’t expect — a very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect’s roommate and the suspect himself, with him repeatedly calling his roommate, who is transitioning, calling him ‘my love’ and ‘I want to protect you, my love.’ So, it was this duality of someone who the attorney said not only jeopardized the life of Charlie Kirk and the crowd….and then, on the other hand, he was, you know, speaking so lovingly about his partner.”— Correspondent Matt Gutman on live ABC News Special, September 16.\n\n“Snowflake Fascism” of MAGA Got Get Kimmel Removed\n\n“It’s another day that ends in Y and Donald Trump’s assault on American democracy. We have entered a new era of snowflake fascism, ladies and gentlemen, in the U.S., where the snowflakes on the far-right whine and complain every time somebody hurts their feelings. The weak-kneed corporate executives who only know how to smooch Trump’s butt simply go along with the dear leader’s demands. The latest example, the canceling of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night TV show.

Conservatives Imperiling Democracy\n\n“Today’s conservatism is animated by resentment, fear, and a consequent will to dominate its opponents.

In doing so, it has thrown our already imperiled democracy into even greater jeopardy.”— Columnist Eric Levitz in a September 11 article for Vox. \n\nTrump Declares War on an American City\n\n“On Friday, President Trump rebranded the Department of Defense the ‘Department of War.’ Saturday, he announced the department’s first target, an American city.

The first criminal indictment of a man Trump considers a political enemy.

The facts surrounding the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey showed that those norms have been shattered.”— Co-host George Stephanopoulos opening ABC’s Good Morning America, September 26. \n\n“Authoritarian” Trump’s “Unsavory, Unconstitutional” Retribution on James Comey\n\n“We now have a president of the United States that has an authoritarian bent like we’ve never seen before and that he feels that retribution is his job in his second term….People in the Justice Department, careerists, are looking to leave.

Elliott Morris posted in his Substack blog Strength In Numbers, Trump’s net approval among people aged 18 to 29 has declined by 35 percentage points since November 2024.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Newsweek: “President Donald Trump is keeping his promises and Making America Great Again: whether it’s securing the border, securing historic investments in American manufacturing, taming Biden’s inflation crisis, or fighting against the Democrats’ radical demands of free health care for illegal aliens.” Referring to a Rasmussen Reports poll from September 25, she added: “That’s why over 57 percent of Americans approve of the President and the incredible job he’s doing!”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nYoung people tend to support the Democratic Party, but a conservative shift among younger voters proved key to Trump’s success in the November 2024 elections.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico on September 30, 2025 in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, voters ages 18 to 29 supported Joe Biden by 61 percent to Trump’s 36 percent in 2020. But four years later, the proportion of Democratic-supporting young people declined and 51 percent voted for then Vice President Kamala Harris and 47 percent opted for Trump.\n\nIf the trend toward the GOP is reversing and the Democrats are seeing success among young people once more, Republicans may struggle to hold onto gains they made in 2024.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nMorris analyzed 7,000 interviews delivered over the course of five months and compared them to previous reports from the poll respondents about their 2024 election choices to track changing opinions.\n\nHe found that Trump’s approval rating among this group has declined by 35 percentage points, from -3 to -38.\n\nHe said that in particular, Trump had lost the support of young Hispanic voters, something he said had occurred because of Trump’s tariff and immigration policies.\n\nHowever, other polls suggest Trump’s fortunes with young people are less bleak. As per new polling by AtlasIntel, Trump’s approval rating among adults ages 18 to 29, has improved by 35 percentage points in two months.\n\nMeanwhile, in July, YouGov/The Economist polling found that Trump’s favorability among Gen Z was improving. His net approval among this group stood at -28 percent percentage points, an improvement on July when this figure was -38.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek Olivia Julianna, a Gen-Z political activist said: “Since Donald Trump took office, the cost of living has gone up everywhere—housing, groceries, fuel, utilities. If Republicans keep the government shutdown, health care prices will be next.\n\n“Many young people supported Trump because they thought he had real answers. Instead, they’ve seen a president more focused on culture war stunts—renaming the Department of Defense, fighting over the name of the Gulf of Mexico, and attacking celebrities from official accounts.\n\n“All the while, he’s been focused on enriching himself and his donors, not helping the people who believed in him.”\n\nThomas Whalen, an associate professor who teaches U.S. politics at Boston University, told Newsweek: “Well, they weren’t enthused with Biden, so it’s no surprise they’re not crazy for Trump, who is equally ancient and out of touch in their eyes.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrump’s popularity among young people and other voting demographics will likely fluctuate throughout his presidency. The midterm elections in November 2026 will test this popularity in earnest.","summary":"Survey data shows Trump&#039;s approval rating among young people has declined by around 35 percentage points since November 2024.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-approval-rating-plummets-among-young-10816838","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238300075.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 08:00:00","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":366100346,"title":"‘Trump’s decomposing ear of corn’: what does ‘hair certainty’ tell us about our leaders?","text":"Labour has an image problem. In a recent YouGov survey, people expressed a view that the party is “dishonest”, “only interested in themselves”, and “the same as the rest”. It’s no wonder that they are currently, terrifyingly, 10 points behind Reform in the polls. They also, by a slightly different – you could say less data-driven – metric, have a different kind of image problem. They lack “hair certainty”, from the top down.\n\n The idea of “hair certainty” was coined by the writer Simon Doonan. Writing in the buildup to the 2016 presidential election that would see Donald Trump first take office, he explained: “Presidential hair = hair with certainty … Hair-certainty describes hair that is what it appears to be. No illusions. No Greco-Roman fakery. Presidential hair can be thick or thin. Presidential hair can be messy. Presidential hair can be sparse, naff, and filled with dandruff. But, whatever it is, it just needs to have that certainty.”\n\nBack then, Doonan discounted Trump’s “iconic coiffure”, saying: “It’s Liberace’s candelabra. It’s Mick Jagger’s lips … But is it presidential? I am rather afraid not.”\n\nSpeaking now, he explains: “I put him in the category of ‘not going to get elected’, because his hair is a bit of an enigma; overly complex and requiring salon maintenance.” Subsequently, Doonan realised “where his hair certainty lies. It’s in the idiom of the 50s pompadour. It’s Elvis. It’s Johnny Hallyday.” It is, he says, “attention seeking … a showbiz kind of do. I thought, ‘Oh, that’ll never fly in Washington’. But then, bingo, it did.” Keir Starmer’s, by contrast, is, “unnoteworthy”.\n\nLast week afforded the perfect opportunity to see the contrast. As Trump and Starmer brandished their freshly signed tech prosperity deal at a joint press conference during Trump’s state visit to the UK, they also gave us a chance to see, side by side, their signature coifs. Trump’s wispy champagne top gave way, as usual, to a Mr Whippy swirl, in turn descending into a duck’s arse flip. Starmer’s, by contrast, was rigor mortised up into its usual stiff, baklava-like crest.\n\nWhile both of these coifs are “signatures” – recognisably their own – one is far larger than life than the other. Trump’s hair, variously described as “a decomposing ear of corn”, “an airboat skimming the Everglades” and a “complex superstructure”, takes centre stage in merch and on the blimp that hovered over anti-Trump protests. Like his bombastic written signature, it demands attention.\n\nHair matters, according to Rachael Gibson, who goes by The Hair Historian on Instagram: “There’s not many body parts which tell people about us … hair reflects anything from your status, your place in society, your religion.” None of which is new. “Since day one people have done strange things to their hair for the sake of wanting to be interpreted differently, or to pass a message about themselves.” (She points to Louis XIV’s “big brown curly wigs [as] showing wealth and status”.)\n\nFar from it being a nonsense to think about political hair, it is yet another lens through which we can scrutinise politicians and the prevailing political winds. “It’s another form of nonverbal communication,” says Washington DC-based image coach and style strategist Lauren A Rothman. Consistency is all. “The language that I’ll use with my clients is ‘clothing, hair, makeup; your appearance that feels intentional, even if messy, creates trust’.”\n\nWhile Doonan stresses that hair certainty can’t get you elected, he thinks it can help. He takes Kamala Harris’s, which was read by some as a symbol of black hair autonomy, as an example. Not to say her success wasn’t down to her capabilities (or to forget that she went on, of course, to lose), but, he says, her hair “played a role in propelling her forward”.\n\nIt now feels like a salon’s worth of Republicans have hair certainty by the pound. Take the hair of newly minted “secretary of war” Pete Hegseth. While not a million miles from Starmer’s, it is different in ways that make it far more certain: it is extra stiff, extra pomaded; extra. Or the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and her grey streak. “It’s like Mrs Robinson or Cruella de Vil, or Susan Sontag, that stripe … that seems to resonate with that theatricality the Republicans uninhibitedly embrace,” says Doonan.\n\nFor men in power in particular, having a healthy head of hair, according to Gibson, “suggests that you’re a healthy person, you’re virile, you’re strong, you’re in good shape … all things that we want from a leader”. It’s enmeshed with masculinity. Hegseth, a former national guard officer, makes a hair-based performance of his; his mop is unruffled by the winds of a chopper, or by a work out. (Proof of how important of all this is to him came earlier this year, when he passed new rules and regulations about “standards” of grooming and appearance for the US army.) “He’s using hair and appearance as a proxy for discipline, order and tradition,” says Rothman.\n\nMuch of the hair certainty trend is a symptom of the glossy Maga aesthetic. “There’s a showbiz overlay that isn’t normally there in politics,” says Doonan, although US politics is consistently glossier than the UK’s. Hegseth is a former Fox News host, Trump is a former reality TV star.\n\nIt also fits with the dominant politics of the day. As Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, told the Guardian in 2023: “All politicians have a brand, but when you’re a populist politician, it has to be outsize, and outsize hair is part of that brand. It makes you recognisable to people who pay little attention to politics.”\n\nThere is a fine line between good grooming and looking as if you’re spending too much time in the salon, and too little in the Senate or the House – particularly for women, and particularly in the UK, where we saw fit to reward Boris Johnson, a man who appeared a stranger to a hairbrush, with the top job. British politicians, says Doonan, “have to be self-denying. You can’t seem like you’re spending all day agonising about your look.”\n\nWhile Doonan would argue that hair certainty is largely “an American phenomena”, he thinks that’s changing: “The media and social media has propelled all of us into this world where everything is about hair, basically.”Thankfully for us, whatever you think about Starmer’s cut, Nigel Farage’s hair is distinctly lacking too.","summary":"From Starmer’s stiff quiff to the Maga movement’s glossy TV locks, a politician’s mane can speak volumes – it says as much about what side of the divide they sit on as it does about the prevailing political winds\n\nLabour has an image problem.

The 44th President of the United States and his accomplished wife have been together for more than three decades, celebrating their 33rd wedding anniversary on October 3, 2025. To mark the occasion, Barack shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, calling his marriage to Michelle “the best decision I ever made.”\n\nFrom his early days as an Illinois State Senator to two historic terms in the White House, and now through bestselling books, global projects, and family milestones, the Obamas continue to inspire with their enduring bond. Take a look back at Barack and Michelle’s love story with this timeline of their relationship.\n\nMeeting In 1989\n\nAt just 25 years old, Michelle was working as an attorney in the Southside of Chicago when she was asked to mentor Barack. While their relationship remained strictly professional at first, Barack eventually built up the courage to ask Michelle on a date. “Once [Barack and I] started talking and became friends, he was very clear — just like, ‘I want to date you.’ At least in my experience up until then, men would be coy. They would, you know, sort of look around the room. It was all so complicated, and it felt, a little immature,” Michelle recalled to Conan O’Brien.\n\n“What struck me about Barack was his, lack of pretense,” Michelle said. “I mean, he was somebody who knew what he wanted, and wasn’t afraid to say it. And, I thought, ‘well, if he’s that in tune with his emotions that he can say out loud to somebody that doesn’t know.’ He didn’t know whether I liked him back! He was like, ‘look, let me tell you, this is what I think about you: I think you’re special, I think you’re different, and I would like to take you out.’ And that was rare. And it was attractive.”\n\nWedding Bells In 1992\n\nThree years after their first date in the Southside of Chicago, Michelle and Barack exchanged their ‘I dos’ on October 3, 1992. Over the course of their nearly three-decade marriage, the couple have reflected on that day in the fall when they pledged their love for one another in front of family and friends. “You can’t tell it from this photo, but Barack woke up on our wedding day in October, 1992 with a nasty head cold,” Michelle began the caption to a photo she posted a few months before their 26th wedding anniversary.\n\n“Somehow, by the time I met him at the altar, it had miraculously disappeared and we ended up dancing almost all night. Twenty five years later, we’re still having fun, while also doing the hard work to build our partnership and support each other as individuals. I can’t imagine going on this wild ride with anybody else.”\n\nWelcoming Malia In 1998\n\nSix years into their marriage, Michelle and Barack welcomed their first of two daughters after years of difficulty conceiving. In the past, the former First Lady of the United States has been so incredibly forthcoming about what she and Barack endured in order to welcome their two amazing girls. “I felt like I failed because I didn’t know how common miscarriages were, because we don’t talk about them,” Michelle shared during a November 2018 interview.\n\n“We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we’re broken. That’s one of the reasons why I think it’s important to talk to young mothers about the fact that miscarriages happen. I think it’s the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work.” Thankfully, after IVF treatment, Michelle and Barack welcomed daughter Malia Ann Obama on July 4, 1998. But the family-of-three would soon have a new member to welcome!\n\nSasha Is Born In 2001\n\nOn June 10, 2001, Sasha made the Obama clan a family of four! Both Sasha and Malia have handled growing up in the spotlight with so much grace, having matured in the White House and lived on the national stage since they were just youngsters. But Barack and Michelle couldn’t be prouder of the young women their daughters have become.\n\n“They’re reflective of their generation in the sense they want to make a difference and they think about their careers in terms of: How do I have a positive impact? How do I make the world better?” the former president shared in a November 24, 2020 interview. “What particular paths they take in doing that, I think are going to change and vary between the two of them.”\n\nIllinois Senate In 2004\n\nBy 2004, the Obamas were steadily rising to the national stage. Barack announced himself as the newly-elected Illinois State Senator in 2004, and began to mold his legacy by working with his constituents. For her part, Michelle was always at Barack’s side on the campaign trail, while still holding down her job at the University of Chicago Hospitals. But in a few short years, the Obamas lives would be completely upended by one of the biggest decisions of Barack’s life.\n\nThe 2008 Election\n\nAs if Barack and Michelle hadn’t already proven that their union would go down in the history of American politics as one of the most supportive romantic partnerships on the national stage, the couple made history in November 2007 when Barack was elected as the 44th President of the United States. For the first time in American history, an African American family was the first family of the nation. The couple felt the pressure to meet all of the challenges that were ahead of them. But it did take a toll on their union.\n\nRe-Election In 2012\n\nAfter four years leading the United States in global and domestic politics, Barack was re-elected to a second term as the President of the United States. But upon reflection, the former commander in chief new that his marriage was struggling through the constant scrutiny. “I continued to sense an undercurrent of tension in her, subtle but constant, like the faint thrum of a hidden machine,” the former president recalled in his latest memoir, A Promised Land.\n\n“It was as if, confined as we were within the walls of the White House, all her previous sources of frustration became more concentrated, more vivid, whether it was my round the clock absorption with work, or the way politics exposed our family to scrutiny and attacks, or the tendency of even friends and family members to treat her role as secondary in importance.” Since leaving the White House, Michelle and Barack have been open about their marital struggles and have been completely transparent about attending marriage counseling. But after two terms in office, everything they endured made them so much stronger.\n\n30 Years Later\n\nAs soon as one chapter started another one came to a close. Michelle and Barack Obama left the White House in January 2017, following the election of President Donald Trump in November 2016. At first, the couple went back to private life — dropping off their daughters at college and spending some time together while pursing their new, individual goals. But as time passed under the Trump administration, the couple chose to use their voices once again, campaigning for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris with everything they had.\n\nAfter 30 years of marriage and counting, Michelle and Barack Obama are seemingly as in love as ever. The two regularly gush about one another on social media, and there is no denying that the spark of their love is still very much alight. “Even with everything going on, I wanted to take a moment to say happy anniversary to the love of my life. Every day with [Michelle Obama] makes me a better husband, a better father, and a better human,” Barack wrote in a caption for the couple’s 28th wedding anniversary.\n\n“I love [Barack Obama] for his smile, his character, and his compassion,” Michelle scribed for her own post on October 3. “So grateful to have him as a partner through everything life throws at us.” We cannot wait to see the Obamas love story continue to unfold for years to come.\n\nDespite their now close-knit bond, the lovebirds aren’t afraid of speaking out about previous hard times they had in their marriage. In 2022, Michelle talked about how there was a period of “10 years” when she “couldn’t stand” Barack. “People think I’m being catty by saying this — it’s like, there were 10 years where I couldn’t stand my husband. And guess when it happened? When those kids were little,” she told Revolt.\n\n“And for 10 years while we’re trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who’s doing what and what, I was like, ‘Ugh, this isn’t even.’ And guess what? Marriage isn’t 50/50, ever, ever,” she continued.\n\n“There are times I’m 70, he’s 30. There are times he’s 60, 40, but guess what? Ten years — we’ve been married 30,” she added. “I would take 10 bad years over 30 — it’s just how you look at it. And people give up … ‘Five years; I can’t take it.’”\n\nIn 2023, Barack reacted to Michelle’s comments by admitting that he was glad to be out of the White House because it’s made things better for them. “Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her,” he told CBS Mornings‘ Nate Burleson.\n\nThe doting husband said it also helped that their two daughters, Malia and Sasha are now adults. “Michelle — when our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three and four,” he explained. “And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her, knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasn’t normal.”","summary":"View gallery Image Credit: Getty Images There has never been a First Couple quite like Barack and Michelle Obama.

But the sweeping cuts to home-state projects — and the threat of mass federal firings — have some in the GOP worried the White House may be going too far and potentially give Democrats a way out of their tight spot.\n“This is certainly the most moral high ground Republicans have had in a moment like this that I can recall, and I just don’t like squandering that political capital when you have that kind of high ground,” GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters this week.\nAs hopes faded Friday for a quick end to the shutdown — with Democrats holding firm in a key Senate vote — the White House signalled more layoffs and agency cuts could follow. Trump shared a video Thursday night portraying budget director Russ Vought as the grim reaper. The cuts are raising fresh questions about whether voters want a government that uses discretionary power to punish political opponents — and whether Republicans may face electoral consequences for the White House’s actions.\n“There’s the political ramifications that could cause backlash,” Cramer said in another interview. “It makes everything going forward more difficult for us.” Since the shutdown began, Trump has moved to cancel USD 7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. On Friday, the administration announced an additional USD 2 billion cut, this time to a major public transit project in Chicago. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is also reviewing funding to Portland, Oregon.\n“He’s just literally took out the map and pointed to all the blue states,” Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, told The Associated Press.\nDemocrats have seized on the shutdown and cuts as evidence of Trump’s overreach. There could be near-term fallout, including in next month’s governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. Democratic candidates in both states have linked their GOP opponents to Trump’s policies and criticised them for not standing up to his latest moves.\nIn New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill blasted Republican Jack Ciattarelli over Trump’s move to block funding for a long-delayed rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, saying it will hurt commuters and put thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk.\n“What’s wrong with this guy?” Sherrill said Friday.\nIn Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger noted the state already has been hit hard by job cuts made by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. She said Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is “refusing to stand up for our workforce and our economy.” Earle-Sears said Democrats are to blame for the shutdown, and said Spanberger did nothing to encourage the state’s Democratic senators to stop it.\nThe administration’s targeting of blue states has already begun to ripple through states like California, where $1.2 billion in funding for the state’s hydrogen hub was scrapped. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said it threatens more than 200,000 jobs.\nThough Harris won California handily in 2024, the state includes several competitive House districts that could decide control of the chamber in 2026. Similar districts exist in other states affected by the cuts, including New York and New Hampshire, which also has key gubernatorial and Senate races.\nDemocratic groups have moved quickly to tie local Republicans to the fallout. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic group, has highlighted swing-district Republicans in states where cuts have occurred, accusing them of having “sat by and let it happen.” “The cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol.\nThe cuts are also complicating Senate negotiations, prolonging a shutdown that could leave thousands of federal workers without pay and halt key programs. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat whom Republicans have tried to sway, said “there’s no question” the cuts have damaged talks.\n“If you’re trying to get people to come together and try to find common ground, that’s the absolute wrong way to do it,” said Peters.\nSen. Angus King, a Maine independent, broke from Democrats earlier this week to support the GOP funding bill. He called the cuts “so utterly partisan as to be almost laughable.” “If they overreach, which is entirely possible, I think they’re going to be in trouble with Republicans as well,” said King.\nMany Senate Republicans have not endorsed Vought’s approach directly, instead blaming Democrats for rejecting funding bills and opening the door to the White House’s more aggressive moves.\n“It’s the reason why Republicans have continued to support a continuation,” said GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. “If you’ve noticed, Republicans have solidly supported this short-term continuing resolution because we do not want to see this.” “It’s not like we promoted it,” said Rounds. “We’ve done everything we can right now to try to avoid it.”(AP) RD RD","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/gop-says-its-winning-shutdown-some-fear-trumps-cuts-may-change-that-9613278.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/News18_World_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-07-4401653589b9d10b46b8abb07f758342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 04:30:02","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":366044576,"title":"Bill Maher Lays Into Kamala Harris Over Playing Victim in Memoir: ‘Nothing’s Ever Kamala’s Fault’| Video","text":"Bill Maher took aim at former Vice President Kamala Harris while discussing the role of gender in politics, and accused the once presidential hopeful of being a prime example of why the left keeps losing elections.\n\nDuring Friday night’s episode of “Real Time With Bill Maher,” the comedian tackled the divide in American politics, noting “that divide is on steroids now and getting worse.”\n\nAs he continued, Maher called on the women of the Democratic party to “look tough” and stop “perpetuating victimhood, especially when it’s false.”\n\nHe added, “It’s not a great advertisement for leadership.”\n\nHere’s where Maher laid into Harris, as he called out the title of her new memoir, “107 Days,” which details her 2024 presidential campaign.

Newsom on Friday waded further into the controversy surrounding a higher education compact President Trump has presented to nine universities including USC, chiding campus leadership to \"do the right thing\" and reject the offer. The compact, sent Wednesday to the University of Southern California and other campuses nationwide, has roiled higher education with its demands for rightward campus policy shifts in exchange for priority federal funding. On Thursday, Newsom swung back at the Trump proposal and threatened to cut \"billions\" of dollars in state funding to any California university that agrees to it. Newsom offered fiery remarks during a bill signing at UC Berkeley on Friday, escalating the stakes in the high-pressure decision confronting USC. “Do the right thing,\" he said. \"What’s the point of the system? What’s the point of the university? What’s the point of all of this if we don’t have academic freedom? … It’s not a choice, and the fact that I felt I needed to even send that message is rather shocking, because some people think it is.” Newsom scoffed at the notion that USC, a private institution, even has to deliberate over the Trump offer — calling it a \"false choice.\" The White House offer to USC and a small group of prominent universities — among them the University of Arizona, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Texas and Brown University — calls on campuses to follow Trump’s views on admissions, diversity and free speech, among other areas. In exchange, they would get more favorable access to federal research grants and additional funding, in addition to other benefits. Universities would also have to accept the government's definition of gender and would not be allowed to recognize transgender people's gender identities. Foreign student enrollment would be restricted. In regards to free speech, schools would have to commit to promoting a wide range of views on campus — and change or abolish \"institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” according to the compact. In a campus letter Friday, USC interim President Beong-Soo Kim said the White House offer \"covers a number of issues that I believe are important to study and discuss.\" \"I have already heard from several members of our community, and in the weeks ahead, I will be consulting with the Board of Trustees; the deans and leadership team; and members of the Academic Senate, the Academic Freedom Task Force, the President’s Faculty Advisory Committee, and other stakeholder groups to hear their wide-ranging perspectives,\" Kim said. \"These conversations can take time, but they are essential to building trust and community.\" He said it was his responsibility to \"advance USC’s mission and uphold our core values.\" Speaking at the Berkeley event, Newsom said USC is among California's \"great universities\" that are \"all in this together\" as campuses face an uncertain and rocky future amid the Trump presidency. A day earlier the governor threatened to withhold Cal Grants, the state’s largest financial aid program to California public and private universities that sign onto Trump's deal. The grants are awarded based on income, and students become eligible through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or California Dream Act Application. In 2024-25, $2.5 billion in Cal Grants were doled out statewide. USC received Cal Grants worth about $28 million during that academic year. In response to a question about the proposal to USC and whether Newsom would issue the same threat of removing state funding to UCLA — the subject of ongoing negotiations over a sprawling U.S. Department of Justice antisemitism investigation — the governor said he was \"not concerned\" about the UC system. \"I'm not concerned about their capacity to organize a strategy that's thoughtful and deliberative that maintains our values ... without resorting to the kind of expressed concerns that I have about the university in question that was on that list,\" Newsom said. As UCLA continues to negotiate with the Trump administration, Newsom said he has confidence in the university system, whose leaders have been working \"collaboratively for weeks\" to come to a resolution. The governor's more tempered remarks were a shift from his comments in August and September, when he said UC should \"sue\" Trump and should not \"bend the knee,\" a reference to his belief that the deals made by Brown and Columbia universities with the White House were bad moves that empowered the government to target more campuses. \"Governor Newsom, [UC] President [James B.] Milliken and the board of regents are fully aligned in protecting the values, integrity and unparalleled quality of the University of California system,\" UC Board of Regents Chair Janet Reilly said Friday in a statement to The Times following Newsom's comments. In a Friday letter, Milliken said the Trump compact was also a subject of talks among system leaders. \"Just within the last few days, the administration has announced a plan to impose a myriad of new requirements on universities seeking federal funding, which we will discuss soon with faculty leadership,\" said Milliken, without elaborating on the matter. The Trump proposal has not been sent to UC. A White House official said the initial campuses on its list were the first group in potentially many more colleges to receive the terms. After the Justice Department found in July that UCLA violated Jewish students' rights amid its response to spring 2024 pro-Palestinian demonstrations, the Trump administration sought a nearly $1.2-billion penalty from the school. The government is also seeking changes over admissions, foreign student enrollment, diversity programs and other GOP priorities in higher education. While praising UC's handling of federal negotiations, Newsom was less supportive of recent actions by UC Berkeley to release the personal information of 160 employees to Department of Education as part of a federal investigation into alleged campus antisemitism. UC officials said they strive to protect employee privacy and were required to share information with the department because it enforces civil rights law on campuses. Faculty have criticized the move, with some likening it to anti-free speech practices during the McCarthy era. Newsom said he \"requested an independent review\" of the data release in order to \"make a judgment as to whether or not it was appropriate, whether or not it was consistent with past practices or whether or not it should be adjusted in terms of policy.\" Rick Hess, an education analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said Newsom's remarks \"seemed not inappropriate.\" \"If a [Kamala] Harris administration had tried something like this, I think Republican governors would be equally livid,\" said Hess, director of the institute's education policy studies. \"USC is between a rock and a hard place,\" Hess added. \"If they say no, what does any of this mean? What does it mean to not be prioritized for federal research funds? Does that mean the tap will be shut off? On the other hand, once you've signed ... will the administration abide by the promises it has made? Part of the problem is, it is not entirely clear what it means to say yes and what it means to say no.\" Newsom blasted institutions that have already “sold out” by signing Trump’s compact. The University of Texas has suggested it could agree to the terms. Leaders of the Texas system were “honored” that the Austin campus was chosen to be a part of the compact and its “potential funding advantages,” according to a Thursday statement from Kevin Eltife, chair of the board of regents. \"In this state, our state of mind must be resolute,” said Newsom. “I don’t mean to put pressure on people. I need to put pressure on this moment and pressure test where we are in U.S. history, not just California history. And so forgive me for being so firm. This is it. We are losing this country.\"","summary":"Gov.

Mentioning the two cities, representing reason and religion, was a nod to an important right-wing authority – Leo Strauss.\n\nLeo Strauss, a political philosopher who spoke of Athens and Jerusalem as the two poles of Western thought, has influenced generations of American conservatives. His disciples include the “godfather of neoconservatism”, Irving Kristol, the sitting Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, and the Nietzschean provocateur Costin Vlad Alamariu (“Bronze Age Pervert”). From Reaganite grandees to the alt-right networks around Donald Trump, Strauss is a constant.\n\nIt is perhaps surprising that Strauss, an Ivy League professor who emphasised the distance between philosophy and public morality, should have had such bombastic heirs. It happened in part thanks to a fight between Strauss’s students in the 1970s, some of whom formed a radical faction at the Claremont Institute, a think tank located on the edge of Los Angeles’ suburban sprawl.\n\nThe Claremont Institute was founded by a group of “West-Coast Straussians”, including Larry Arnn, who also spoke at the Kirk memorial, a former mentor to the assassinated right-wing influencer. Kirk, who once attended a ten-day course at Claremont, called it “the intellectual home of the new right.” This is no exaggeration. More than any single institution, the Claremont faction has generated a philosophy for Trump’s second administration, and its ongoing attempt to radically redefine America.\n\nBorn into a German Jewish family in 1889, Leo Strauss trained as a scholar of medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy. In 1932, he left Germany, emigrating to Paris, London, and then to America, landing in 1937. After years of uncertainty, he found a job at the New School in Manhattan, then known as “the University in Exile” because of the number of Jewish emigrés who taught there. One of them was Hannah Arendt, whom Strauss had tried to court in Germany. She had refused, remarking to a friend how brilliant he was but how conservative.\n\nIt was in America that Strauss elaborated his most enduring idea. In 1938, he wrote to a friend: “I shudder in the face of what I may cause by my interpretation.” He had been studying the 12th-century Sephardic scholar Maimonides, and had discovered (or rather interpreted) that Maimonides’s true commitment was to Aristotelian philosophy rather than Judaism. From this, Strauss concluded that reason (Athens) and religion (Jerusalem) were incompatible. He came to believe that all true philosophers were sceptics. Fearing persecution, philosophers learn to conceal scepticism in their public writings. Strauss would have viewed JD Vance’s suggestion that Kirk was both Athens and Jerusalem as absurd.\n\nIn his 1952 book, Persecution and the Art of Writing, Strauss argued that, in true philosophy, there are two kinds of truth: exoteric truths, promoting the public morality of the time, and esoteric truths, hidden so that only the wise could understand them. He would go on to discover the truths hidden in Plato, Machiavelli, and Spinoza. This theory is a seductive, similar in its appeal to that of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, who each encouraged their readers to see things beneath the surface of a text. In other ways, Strauss’s method is highly distinctive. He argued that something a philosopher said only once in their work was more likely to be true than something they said repeatedly, and his classes pored closely over the texts of the great philosophers for their esoteric truths. Strauss’s interpretations, while powerful, were often eccentric. It’s difficult to disprove a conclusion based on what is “written” between the lines.\n\nOne of Strauss’s cardinal examples is Socrates, who used irony to mask his true beliefs from the Athenian people. Eventually, the philosopher was put on trial, accused of corrupting the youth and blaspheming the city’s gods, and forced to commit suicide. Socrates’s trial demonstrates the real threat of persecution but also the difficulty of truly hiding what you think. The idea of esoteric writing was born of a mistrust of the people, understandable for a philosopher who had fled Nazi mobs. But within this lurked an argument against democracy: only an elite group were capable of true wisdom and perhaps only they were fit to govern. Influenced by Martin Heidegger and Carl Schmitt, who both became members of the Nazi party, Strauss developed a conservative critique of Western modernity. He had witnessed the fall of the Weimar Republic, and he concluded that liberal democracy was incapable of defending itself against both fascism and communism.\n\nDespite a youthful engagement with Zionism, Strauss settled in America. In time, his adoptive nation would absorb the brunt of his critique of liberalism. In the paranoid years of the Cold War, many conservatives believed that communism was at the door. Strauss seems to have viewed the US with mistrust, as if it were a potential Weimar Republic, always threatening to fall. It was philosophy’s task to help it avoid this fate. In 1947, after being naturalised as a citizen, he became a professor at the University of Chicago. He stayed there for the rest of his career, inspiring bright young men and women to adopt his methods, his favourite authors, and his conclusions.\n\nPerhaps his most famous student was Allan Bloom, the author of a famous conservative polemic, The Closing of the American Mind, later immortalised in Saul Bellow’s novel Ravelstein. Inspired by Strauss, Bloom attacked jazz, Walkmen, and politically correct subscriptions to diversity, and called for the revival of classical philosophy for those capable of understanding it. Paul Wolfowitz, one of the architects of the Iraq War, was a student of Bloom’s and a fellow Straussian. And the influence of an Ivory Tower philosopher on George W Bush’s unintellectual White House led to a flurry of articles in 2003 about whether Strauss, by then dead for several decades, had inspired the war against Saddam. Another Straussian in the administration, Abram Shulsky, claimed that esotericism had inspired his work in military intelligence.\n\nNot all of Strauss’s students were supporters of Bush or the Iraq War, however. Many shunned political engagement, preferring to elaborate Straussian interpretations of classical philosophy. Over the decades, their influence has spread throughout North American universities. The intellectual historian Quentin Skinner claims that Straussianism remains “the prevailing way of approaching texts in the history of moral and political philosophy”. But Straussianism isn’t one simple thing. A schism emerged after the master’s death in 1973, focused on the nature of the US political system. In turn, this debate has helped to shape the political philosophy of Trump’s inner circle.\n\nHarry Jaffa, one of Strauss’s first doctoral students and his most combative heir, maintained that the founding of the United States was inspired by principles consistent with the ancient philosophy that Strauss championed. Meanwhile, Walter Berns, a Georgetown professor, saw the American founding as a “low but solid act”, based on a pragmatic view of human imperfection. Their disagreement focused on the words of the Declaration of Independence, and in particular its famous preamble: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.” What does it mean to be created equal?\n\nFor Berns, and other “East Coast Straussians”, equality is a condition similar to the state of nature famously described by Hobbes as “nasty, brutish and short”. For Jaffa, by contrast, the defence of equality in the Declaration was consistent with the ideal of justice proposed by Socrates and praised by Strauss. In his 1959 book Crisis of the House Divided, Jaffa studied the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in an 1858 race for the Senate. Jaffa argued that the Founding Fathers had articulated an equality in 1776 that had not actually existed until Lincoln abolished slavery and fulfilled the founder’s intentions. The emancipation proclamation had therefore brought about a “second founding”. If that sounds liberal, Jaffa would soon swerve to the right.\n\nAs a younger man, Jaffa had been a confirmed Democrat. But the 1961 Bay of Pigs crisis, which made JFK appear insufficiently tough on communism, caused him to defect. Three years later, Jaffa moved to California to teach at Claremont McKenna College. It was there that Jaffa’s students set up the Claremont Institute, turning Straussianism into a political movement. Soon, Jaffa was not only a Republican but a supporter of its radical right-wing. In 1964, he supported Barry Goldwater’s right-wing populist campaign for president, and wrote a memo that Goldwater used in a notorious speech at the Republican Convention, declaring: “I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!” With those now-notorious words, Jaffa tried to convince the Republicans that his preferred candidate, viewed by many within the party as unacceptably extreme, was justified. In time, Jaffa’s heirs would do the same for Trump.\n\nAccording to the stereotype, West Coast Straussians embrace a degree of political engagement that their East Coast colleagues disdain as vulgar. Jaffa developed a reputation for pugilism, attacking friends and allies without remorse. “If you think it’s hard disagreeing with Harry Jaffa,” the commentator William F Buckley said, “try agreeing with him.” At a Claremont conference, Jaffa once dismissed Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield as a “Calhounite” – comparing his interpretation of the Declaration to that of John C Calhoun, the pro-slavery president who said equality was a “self-evident lie”. This caused an uproar. The diminutive economist Milton Friedman tried to intercede, shouting “Gentlemen! We’re all friends here!” But it was to no avail. For Jaffa, friendship was no barrier to antagonism.\n\nJaffa remained liberal in some respects to the end of his life. In 1994, he opposed a law that would have denied the services of the state to undocumented people. In this, he was still a student of Leo Strauss, who called philosophy “stranger wisdom” and saw it as seeking distance from the business of politics. Jaffa’s followers would have no such scruple. He died in 2015, on the same day as his East Coast rival Walter Berns. The following year, some of his disciples at the Claremont Institute embraced Trump’s bid for the presidency.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest boosters in the Claremont crowd is Michael Anton, recently feted as the “MAGA Machiavelli”. Anton grew up in San Francisco, but his father sold the family home before the property boom. This meant that he grew up watching former hippies becoming millionaires, something that appears to have motivated a deep dislike of liberals. As a Claremont graduate student, Anton witnessed Harry Jaffa prowling the library stacks, and was proud to be considered one of his philosophical “grandchildren”. Then, Anton quit his PhD to go into politics, eventually becoming press secretary for Condoleezza Rice. Later, he worked for corporate behemoths Citibank and Blackrock. After going back into politics, he would disdain them as exponents of “woke capital”.\n\nOnce a prolific poster on menswear chatrooms, Anton’s publications include The Suit: A Machiavellian Approach to Men’s Style. But his most influential work is an essay, “The Flight 93 Election”, published in the Claremont Review of Books in September 2016. Signed “Publius Decius Mus” (the name of an ancient Roman general), it compared the United States to the airplane hijacked on 9/11 on which the passengers rushed the cockpit, causing the plane to crash but preventing an act of terrorism. “2016 is the Flight 93 election,” Anton warned: “charge the cockpit or you die.”\n\nAnton was addressing those Republicans who refused to vote for Trump. While conceding that their candidate was “worse than imperfect”, Anton compared Hilary Clinton to Hitler, warning that a million Syrian refugees were on the doorstep. “2016 is a test – in my view, the final test – of whether there is any virtú left in what used to be the core of the American nation.” The term virtú comes from Machiavelli: it doesn’t mean virtue in the modern sense, but, instead, the decisive use of power proper to a ruler. It is characteristic of West Coast Straussianism to insist that America might once again fulfil classical philosophical ideals. Here that argument was put to the aid of a candidate, who, like Barry Goldwater, was an extremist in defending something he called liberty.\n\nThe “Flight 93” essay went viral, and Anton was quickly outed as its author. After the 2016 election, he was rewarded with a job in the new government. After that, his estimate of Trump’s virtues has risen. Over the past eight years, Anton’s writing has become even more apocalyptic. In recent years, he has made dark suggestions about the “right to revolt” enshrined in the US Constitution, even outraging other Republicans. But another one of the so-called “Claremonsters” would play a more instrumental role in Trump’s efforts to pervert the 2020 election.\n\nIn December 2020, as Trump was looking for a way to challenge the election results in certain states, Rudy Giuliani brought John Eastman to the White House. A legal scholar and Claremont board member, Eastman had come to Giuliani’s attention after writing an essay questioning Kamala Harris’s citizenship. Eastman was there to tell the outgoing president what he wanted to hear. Michael Wolf describes the encounter in his book Landslide: “Eastman told the president that the vice president could reject any of these votes and simply replace Biden electors with Trump electors.” In the weeks leading up to the January 6 riots at the US Capitol, Eastman’s advice added fuel to Trump’s argument that the election had been stolen.\n\nThe Claremont Institute has also guided Trump’s attempt to rewrite history. Published two days before the end of Trump’s first term, the 1776 Commission proposed a “patriotic education” to replace the critical view proposed in the New York Times’s “1619 Project”. The chair of the Commission was Kirk’s mentor, the Claremont founder Larry Arnn. Jaffa’s influence is most visible where the report suggests that the pro-slavery President John C Calhoun was “perhaps the leading forerunner of identity politics”. This outrageous suggestion draws on Jaffa’s reading of the Declaration, arguing that progressive reforms such as affirmative action violate the natural right of equality. The 46-page Commission report was dismissed by historians in The Washington Post as a “hack job”.\n\nIncreasingly, the Claremont men depart entirely from Strauss: Anton speaks dismissively of Straussians as rarified Ivory Tower intellectuals – no doubt thinking of those, like Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield, who are “never Trumpers”. John Eastman, who Trump called a “very smart guy”, has not only been disbarred, but also did not receive a presidential pardon or payment for his services. In 2024, Eastman was indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud, and forgery. Meanwhile, Claremont McKenna College has discontinued the programme in political philosophy. However, its graduates have already migrated to right-wing universities such as the New College of Florida and Hillsdale College, where Arnn is the president, not to mention Washington DC. The Claremont ideology – no longer only on the West Coast, and no longer really Straussian – has become government policy.\n\nEven as the “Claremonsters” have moved away from the subtlety of Leo Strauss, they have lent his intellectual weight to an otherwise untheoretical White House. One sign of this enduring link is the fact that Peter Thiel is funding research into Strauss’s arguments about natural law, one of the bedrocks of his philosophy. The notoriously secretive Thiel is a thinker well suited to Strauss’s work. In a 2007 essay entitled “The Straussian Moment”, the billionaire investor uses Strauss to make dark warnings about the future of liberal democracy. The essay contains esoteric hints – in its epigraphs, its interest in numerology, and an untranslated German warning about a coming “Caesarism”. While Thiel’s interest in the esoteric is connected to his belief that the state should not be transparent, it is Strauss’s explicit arguments about the weakness of liberalism that appeal to Thiel’s acolyte JD Vance.\n\nOn 5 July 2025, shortly after a landmark Supreme Court judgment helped accelerate Donald Trump’s executive order to ban birthright citizenship, JD Vance gave a speech at the Claremont Institute. He spoke about the need “to redefine American citizenship in the 21st century”, and asked for their help. Anton, now director of policy planning for the White House, and a leading diplomatic negotiator with Iran, was in the audience that day. Anton was the only person that Vance mentioned by name, perhaps because Vance was using Anton’s own arguments.\n\nVance’s call to reimagine citizenship harks back to the dark side of Jaffa’s understanding of equality. Jaffa liked to remind his students that the Declaration mentions “savages”, which he took as a reference to those unsuited to or undeserving of liberty. In a 1987 essay, “The American Founding as the Best Regime”, Jaffa claims the founders wouldn’t have wanted equality to extend to “lesbians, sodomites, abortionists, drug addicts, and pornographers”.\n\nLikewise, in his Claremont speech, the Vice President distinguished between those who deserve to be citizens and those who don’t. He attacked New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for his qualified praise of America. Trump had already questioned the citizenship status of Mamdani, who was born in Uganda. Echoing this, Vance suggested that it’s not only criminals that should forfeit citizenship but those who lack gratitude for their nation. “This is one of the things we need to run with over the next few years,” Vance told the Claremont faithful. They are ready to oblige.\n\nDespite professing reverence for the Constitution, the Claremont men support a president who has used his office to enrich his already Pharaonic dynasty, who threatens to strip citizenship from their political opponents and stokes rumours of an unconstitutional third term. How serious Trump is about a third term remains to be seen. If his actions on January 6 are anything to go by, the next attempt to disrupt the peaceful transition of power – one of the great achievements of US democracy – will be opportunistic, vague, and chaotic. One thing is clear: Strauss’s dissident heirs are using his work to undermine democracy in the precisely the way that he feared.\n\nAt Strauss’s funeral, in 1973, Psalm 114 was read at the request of his friends. It speaks of the Jewish people’s exodus from Egypt and their sanctuary in the land of Judah. For the mourners, this must have called to mind Strauss’s own escape from Nazi Germany and his finding refuge in America. Today, his work is being used by those trying to ensure that America is no sanctuary.\n\n[Further reading: The prophet of the new right]","summary":"Meet the philosophical cabal remaking America","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2025/10/donald-trump-charlie-kirk-and-the-claremonsters","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/01/GettyImages-2236446641.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 00:18:18","author":"Orlando Reade","authors":["Orlando Reade"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.166},{"id":366003788,"title":"Taylor Swift fans are convinced that singer's song 'CANCELLED!' is about Chiefs WAG bestie Brittany Mahomes","text":"Taylor Swift fans are convinced her new song 'CANCELLED!' is about Chiefs bestie Brittany Mahomes following the latter's Donald Trump controversy over the summer.\n\nThe wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick has struck up a close friendship with Swift since she began dating (and ultimately got engaged to) fellow Chiefs star Travis Kelce.\n\nAnd listeners of the pop star's new album, 'The Life of a Showgirl', believe one track in particular is about Brittany.\n\nIn the song 'CANCELLED!', Swift sings: 'Good thing I like my friends cancelled // I like them cloaked in Gucci and scandal.'\n\nSwift also says in the song: But one single drop, you're off the roster // Tone-deaf and hot, let's f***in' off her'\n\nThe lyrics come months after her friend Brittany came under fire for liking a social media post from Trump, who was then running for his second presidential term.\n\nWhile it was unclear what Brittany was specifically agreeing with, as Trump's Instagram post outlined a slew of different GOP platforms, she faced tons of backlash afterwards.\n\nBrittany later doubled down on her approval of Trump's Instagram post by retweeting another post from preacher and author Shane Pruitt.\n\n'Contrary to the tone of the world today…' the post began.

If they can get through it, if they can be tough enough, they can actually learn some things through this process.' \n\n'And how I don't naturally just cast people aside just because other people decide they don't like them. I make my own decisions about people based on how they treat me within my life and their actions. And so this is a song about all those themes.'\n\nOther fans, meanwhile believe the song is about Blake Lively amid her legal battle with Justin Baldoni.\n\nRegardless, Brittany and Swift have seemingly remained friends despite their apparent political differences.\n\nSwift, who endorsed Kamala Harris ahead of the last presidential election, was seen with Brittany during her 30th birthday last month in Nashville.\n\nThe 14-time Grammy Award winner was front and center as Brittany celebrated another year around the sun with a girls trip to Tennessee.\n\nIn one photo, Swift and Brittany posed together as they enjoyed some celebratory cocktails.\n\nSwift could be leaning her head on Brittany's shoulder in the sweet moment as they wore matching black outfits.\n\nThey will cheer on the Chiefs partners this weekend as they seek their third win of the season against the Jaguars.","summary":"Taylor Swift fans are convinced her new song 'CANCELLED!' is about Chiefs bestie Brittany Mahomes following the latter's Donald Trump controversy over the summer.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-15161033/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-cancelled.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/04/00/101262407-0-image-m-16_1759535923701.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/03/7778625724997780638/1024x576_MP4_7778625724997780638.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-04 00:08:53","author":"Editor,Jake Nisse","authors":["Editor","Jake Nisse"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.258},{"id":366043028,"title":"Rabid Climate Group Goes to War with Trump to Protect Its ‘Major’ Financier: George Soros","text":"An eco-extremist group funded by leftist billionaire George Soros is turning from its typical climate change obsessions to launch an all out war against President Donald Trump.\n\n The youth-led Sunrise Movement, which was funded with $2 million between 2019 and 2023 alone by Soros, “expanding its mission to battle ‘authoritarianism’ as the Trump administration targets left-leaning organizations and puts one of the group’s major funders [Soros] in the crosshairs,”according to The Intercept October 2.\n\nThe radical organization, which has become notorious for unlawful demonstrations and obstructions, was featured in a blockbuster Capital Research Center report detailing how Soros gave $80 million to fund pro-terrorist organizations like Sunrise.

Sunrise Executive Director Aru Shiney-Ajay told The Intercept that “‘There is no serious way to think about stopping the climate crisis under a fascist government.’” She continued: “‘The path to climate lies through getting rid of the authoritarian government we’re in.’” If that sounds like it came straight out of the Antifa lexicon, it's because it does. \n\nCRC investigative researcher Ryan Mauro wrote that Sunrise, in particular, “endorsed the Antifa-linked Stop Cop City campaign, in which activists currently face over 40 domestic terrorism charges and 60 racketeering indictments.” That coalition, noted Mauro, “engaged in arson, property damage and violence against law enforcement personnel and utility workers to try to stop construction of this local police training center.” He continued: “Attacks include setting a police vehicle ablaze; throwing Molotov cocktails, bricks and rocks at police; setting construction equipment on fire; blocking roads with obstacles like tires; harming police officers’ eyes with lasers; and attacking the Atlanta Police Foundation’s building with fireworks.”\n\nMRC Business, in partnership with Bongino Report, also released a months-long investigation into Soros’s bankrolling of the global climate change movement in the U.S. and abroad. For Sunrise, which MRC and Bongino Report profiled, engaging in wanton disruption and chaos is its modus operandi.\n\nHere’s a recent example: During the crescendo of the tumultuous 2024 election in April, Sunrise protesters “blocked an intersection on a Monday morning near Vice President Kamala Harris’s Brentwood home, “leading police to arrest six of them without incident,” according to The Los Angeles Times. Sunrise activists would then taunt Harris again outside her home in September 2024, after she stepped out-of-line with the climate religion and bragged about increased levels of gas production under Biden during a debate with Trump.’\n\nTo be clear: Sunrise’s Shiney-Ajay insisted that coming to the Godfather of the Left’s defense was part of its overall mission to battle climate change. “We are pretty clear that we are doing this so that we can get on track to win federal climate legislation. That has always been the mission of Sunrise,” Shiny-Ajay exclaimed to The Intercept. \n\nOh but The Intercept was sure to point out that Soros’s OSF and Sunrise “both say they reject violence.” What a joke. \n\nRead MRC Business and Bongino Report’s complete investigation into George Soros’s financing of the global climate movement below.","summary":"An eco-extremist group funded by leftist billionaire George Soros is turning from its typical climate change obsessions to launch an all out war against President Donald Trump.\n\n The youth-led Sunrise Movement, which was funded with $2 million between 2019 and 2023 alone by Soros, “expanding its mission to battle ‘authoritarianism’ as the Trump administration targets left-leaning organizations and puts one of the group’s major funders [Soros] in the crosshairs,”according to The Intercept October 2.\n\nThe radical organization, which has become notorious for unlawful demonstrations and obstructions, was featured in a blockbuster Capital Research Center report detailing how Soros gave $80 million to fund pro-terrorist organizations like Sunrise.

Trump’s approval rating will have key implications for the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races this year, where Democrats have sought to tie Republican candidates to Trump as his approval has dwindled, as well as the 2026 midterms.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nThe latest poll from AtlasIntel found that 54 percent of Black voters approve of Trump, while 46 percent disapprove of the president’s job performance thus far. Across all racial groups, 52 percent of voters disapproved of his performance, while 47 percent approved of him, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,066 Americans from September 12 to September 16, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Of those respondents, about 10.6 percent identified as Black.\n\nPresident Donald Trump attends an executive order signing event in the White House in Washington, D.C. on September 5, 2025.\n\nPolling crosstabs often have relatively small sample sizes, in this case, about 113 respondents, which can at times produce results that are not replicated in other surveys.\n\nThe poll would mark a significant shift in Trump’s support among Black voters from past AtlasIntel surveys. The pollster found in July that just 14 percent of Black voters approved of Trump, and in May reported that 28 percent of Black voters approved of his job performance.\n\nNewsweek reached out to AtlasIntel for comment via its contact form.\n\nOther independent pollsters have similarly shown his support among Black voters remains low.\n\nA YouGov poll, which surveyed 1,656 adults from September 26 to September 29, found that 12 percent of Black Americans approve of his job performance while 86 percent disapprove. Meanwhile, a New York Times/Siena College poll, which surveyed 1,313 registered voters from September 22 to September 27, 2025, found that 10 percent of Black voters approve of Trump.\n\nA survey from NPR, PBS and Marist Poll showed similar results—it found that 19 percent of Black voters approve of Trump. It surveyed 1,477 adults from September 22 to September 26.\n\nIn 2024, Black voters backed Harris by a 73-point margin (86 percent to 13 percent), a slightly smaller margin than that of former President Joe Biden in 2020, when he won Black voters by 75 points (87 percent to 12 percent), according to CNN’s exit polling.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Trump wrote on Truth Social: “WOW!!! Such an! honor. Record ‘stuff’ for a Republican. President DJT.”\n\nJournalist Corey Walker wrote to X: “So his approval is dropping nationally and rising with black voters? Seems deeply unlikely.”\n\nX user Armand Domalewski wrote to X: “i am skeptical.”\n\nSteve Bannon wrote on Gettr: “Record Approval from Black Voters.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrump’s approval rating will continue to be monitored as a key metric of his popularity ahead of critical elections later this year. If his approval remains low, it could present a challenge for Republican candidates. However, if it increases, that would be viewed as a boon for the GOP.","summary":"A new poll from AtlasIntel found Trump&#039;s approval with Black voters rise, but other recent polls suggest that may be an outlier.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-approval-surges-to-new-high-with-black-voters-poll-10827685","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2233918556-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 21:21:12","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":365994610,"title":"Charlie Kirk Did the Unimaginable. He Turned the Youth Against the Liberal Establishment.","text":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. After that quite amazing and moving memorial for Charlie Kirk, there’s been a lot written about him, his legacy, his achievements\n\n We all were quite enthralled by his efforts as probably the most successful political organizer of any party under the age of 40 with Turning Point USA. It’s now up to, I think, requests for 75,000 new chapters. He was a columnist. He was a successful podcaster. He did it all.\n\nBut one thing, I think, that hasn’t been remarked about—what was the essence of his appeal to young voters? Why was he able to reverse the turnout in 2020 of young voters? Getting more of them out and getting somewhere from 6% to 20% more of the youth vote in particular states.\n\nAnd he may have got as many votes for President Donald Trump of those in the more narrow category, 18 to 29, than voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. Even the 18 to 39 was almost 50/50 in Michigan. So, in some ways, he might have won the election for Donald Trump.\n\nSo, what was the secret to his success? I think what he did was quite brilliant. He understood that young people are, by nature, rebellious. You’re full of energy. They’re full of hormones. They’re full of ideas. They haven’t lived a long time. And they question authority. That’s innate to all of us at that age.\n\nBut what he was trying to tell them was: Use that natural inquisitiveness, skepticism, maybe even rebelliousness, at the establishment. But you’re mistaken. The establishment is not conservative. The establishment, as defined by the network news, PBS, NPR; as defined by higher education, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Berkeley, Stanford; as defined by the corporate boardroom at Budweiser or Target, or Disney; as defined by the popular culture, if you look—I could just direct you to the halftime show at the typical Super Bowl extravaganza. We could go on, but you get the message.\n\nSo what Charlie Kirk was telling young people is, you are living in a society in which the baby boomers of the 1960s and ’70s, are now the establishment. And they are ossified. They are calcified. They have no new ideas. They still are trapped in amber of a sort of revolutionary idea of the ’60s and ’70s—DEI, critical race theory, critical legal theory, radical green environmentalism, open borders.\n\nThe result of all this is that you, the youth of America, are told not to do what history says will make you happy: to get married, to have more than two children, or at least two children, to buy a home, to be active in your community, to be patriotic, to be traditionalist. These are things that are not establishment, Kirk was telling young people on campus. These are counterrevolutionaries. You are revolutionaries.\n\nSo, what he asked young people to do is to, say, rebel. But remember what you’re rebelling against. It’s not some conservative, 1950s stereotype of an uptight America. America is not uptight. It has no rules. It’s completely without order. It’s in utter chaos. Whether we look at transgenderism or DEI, or an open border, or our legal system, it is a mess. And you’ve suffered.\n\nSo, you are going to be revolutionaries. But the trick is you’re not going to try to destroy the old order. You’re gonna try to restore it. The old order is what was normality and common sense. What you grew up under is an aberration. So, as good counterrevolutionaries, tie your youthful zeal to formal efforts to overthrow this dominant paradigm that has made your life, in some ways, miserable.\n\nSo, we look back at his career, Charlie Kirk came up with the idea that he was going to go throughout higher education, indeed, youthful America in general, and encourage that natural skepticism. And not to say, “Please don’t question authority. Please be stayed. Please be true.” He was trying to say, “Be a counterrevolutionary because the establishment is not you or me. It’s radical. And it needs to be changed.”\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Diddy” Combs’ sentencing has come in at 50 months (4 years and 2 months) in prison after his conviction on Mann Act-related charges, the next question is: can one of the world's most well-known personalities stage a comeback after his time is served? The short answer is yes — but it won’t be easy. If recent history is any barometer, high-profile figures who’ve faced legal peril have been able to come back and be reborn, albeit with a rebuilt or reshaped reputation.\n\nLet's take a look at how others in the spotlight have managed to bounce back, what strategies they used, and how a path to redemption may look in Diddy’s case.\n\n4 Obstacles To Comeback\n\nBefore plotting a comeback, it’s essential to understand the four key challenges of recapturing the public's ear, attention span, and sentiment:\n\nStigma & brand risk. A criminal conviction involving sexual misconduct and coercion carries heavy reputational damage. Off the top, this will eliminate some partners, sponsors, and media platforms from turning away from association with Diddy.\n\nLegal constraints. Based on Diddy's sentence, beyond his time behind bars, he also has parole limitations on where he can travel and be present for public engagement.\n\nFan and industry trust. Trust from allies is critical to rebuilding confidence with fans, and business partners. Sustained positive signals will be required to overcome.\n\nFinancial strain. Mo money, mo problems. Legal bills, court-ordered fines, and the lack of active income during incarceration can stress cash flow and access to capital.\n\nPARIS, FRANCE - JULY 21: Snoop Dogg tries on clothes during Team USA Welcome Experience ahead of Paris 2024 Summer Olympics at Polo Ralph Lauren on July 21, 2024 in Paris, France.

There is a long history of notable people who have overcome the past only to catapluted into their second act. On the other hand, some haven't been so fortunate. Let’s take a look at a few individuals who have been able to rise to the top.\n\nSnoop Dogg: Steady & persistence through legal storms\n\nSnoop may be the comeback king of the music industry. Over decades, he has had multiple brushes with the law — drug possession, arrests, and even a murder trial. His recovery was slow, steady, and multifaceted. Where did it end up? How did he do it?\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nDiversifying public roles. Snoop didn't stay still or get pigeonholed into one area. He expanded his interests beyond music into media more broadly. Covering events on NBC as a broadcaster, coaching musicians on The Voice, and even serving as a commentator at major sporting events. Besides covering the 2024 Summer Olympic gameshe will be returning as a roving correspondent for the 2026 Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics coverage.\n\nLeveraging celebrity goodwill. Leaning into cultural relevance through social media is key. From first-person camera shots and storytelling to holding up products to sell endorsements, philanthropy, and a humanized public persona, he was able to define his career narrative.\n\nKeep creating prolific art. Having a music release calendar to stay in the public eye was crucial for reminding people of your talent and brand values. It also helps visualize your growth rather than disappearing.\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - NOVEMBER 06: Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 06, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Trump: Turn legal fights into narrative fuel\n\nPresident Trump used a different model to overcome his past, and it earned him a second shot at the White House. How’d he do it? He uses legal fights as badges of honor and as a central part of his brand.\n\nAggressive media framing. President Trump was clear - frame the legal system as politicized or “rigged,” turning prosecutions into rallying cries. This helps keep a base invested in his personal narrative.\n\nDelay, appeal, and leverage publicity. Trump often leans into lengthy, drawn-out legal proceedings, appeals, and litigation, bringing the audience along with him as he fights publicly in the news and prolongs public attention.\n\nOvercoming legal battles is his brand DNA. His legal challenges become part of his political story, serving as proof of dissent that mobilized supporters rather than alienating them.\n\nAsset and corporate strategies. By shifting assets, using corporate structures, and negotiating financial remedies, President Trump was able to overturn or evade paying civil penalties.\n\nOther notable comebacks include Martha Stewart after her insider trading conviction and prison term; she made an intentionally restrained comeback, focusing on content, licensing, lifestyle branding, and building an audience through new opportunities after her legal troubles (even working with Snoop!) Also, Robert Downey Jr, who had issues with substance abuse and arrests, eventually reinvented himself through consistent and high-quality performances, most notably the Iron Man franchise, and regained his Hollywood support system.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 20: Sean \"Diddy\" Combs attends TimesTalks Presents: An Evening with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs at The New School on September 20, 2017 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nWhat Diddy’s Comeback Could Look Like\n\nThe through-line: comeback stories often blend accountability, continuous output, narrative control, and a pivot toward new domains or reinvention. Based on those templates here’s how Diddy could plot a path forward:\n\nA phased reemergence. Begin behind the scenes, then slowly step back into the spotlight.\n\nCollaborative choices may matter more than solo plays. Strategic alliances — with artists, platforms, institutions — may receive more immediate trust.\n\nUnderstand the shadow of conviction. As Diddy rebuilds, media narratives will reference the conviction, making full reintegration hard.\n\nA single misstep can derail recovery. In the era of social media and heightened scrutiny, any new controversy could reignite backlash far stronger than before.\n\nYes — Diddy can come back. However, unlike purely entrepreneurial or performance-based figures, his challenge is steeper: the nature of the wrongdoing carries moral weight, not just legal implications. His comeback, if it’s to succeed, will demand more than talent or influence — it will require a profound redefinition of public identity, sustained integrity, and a convincing narrative of transformation.\n\nSean \"P.

There are plenty of options, be it the government shutdown, the \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, the ongoing Jimmy Kimmel saga, or Taylor Swift’s new album. Based on the past few years, the cold open will likely only mock one side of the aisle. A recent NewsBusters study found that 82 percent of Weekend Update jokes last season were aimed at conservatives, while 60 percent of cold-open characters were Republicans or conservatives. Other reviews showed SNL went after Trump seven times more often than Biden during his first term. Like most late-night comedy, SNL has become increasingly partisan and predictable. It is hesitant to mock liberals even when the material is obvious, which is a shame because both sides provide plenty of fodder. Imagine a bit mocking the media voices who defended the Biden administration for pressuring tech companies to censor ordinary Americans, while declaring Kimmel's suspension the act of a fascist government. That happened in real life. Imagine another spoof mocking the Democrats who cheered Roseanne Barr’s cancellation as \"accountability culture,\" suddenly railing against \"cancel culture\" during Kimmel’s absence. That also happened in real life. After all, sketch comedy works best when the reenactment resembles the real event. Of course, none of those suggestions are likely to make the rundown. Instead, expect spoofed appearances from the usual targets like Trump, JD Vance, and maybe Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. What you won’t see are parodies of Jasmine Crockett or Ilhan Omar, both of whom are living caricatures of the bitter leftist ladies we have all come to regret knowing. A sketch about Kamala Harris admitting she passed on Pete Buttigieg as a running mate because he’s gay would write itself. Put simply, Harris is the only politician to openly admit she didn’t hire someone because of their sexual preferences. Then there’s Don Lemon, who recently declared white men the most dangerous creatures in America, despite black men accounting for 55 percent of murders in the U.S. while just 6 percent of the population. What about Keith Olbermann? OutKick recently investigated whether he is channeling a deranged, eccentric online persona for podcast downloads or if he is genuinely unwell. The conclusion: he is genuinely unwell. Still, a sketch of him ranting in his New York apartment, threatening strangers online while surrounded by rescue pets, could be amusing. The biggest question is whether the show touches on the assassination of Charlie Kirk. In principle, no story should be off-limits to sketch comedy. Comedy is supposed to be cringe, uncomfortable, and blunt. That’s why Dave Chappelle is recognized as the best of his generation. However, making light of a political assassination is difficult. The one rule of comedy is that it has to be funny, and it’s hard to imagine SNL’s progressive writers pulling that off. Jimmy Kimmel already failed when he falsely claimed Kirk’s suspected assassin was part of the \"MAGA gang,\" a lie he still hasn’t corrected. The right way to do it would be to mock the people who celebrated Kirk’s death, or the hosts who sympathized with the alleged killer because he had a trans partner. For the record, ABC’s Matt Gutman even described the alleged killer’s text exchanges with his lover—where he admitted to the murder—as \"touching.\" That alone is worthy of parody. What a ghoul. This all shows that there remains an opening for an alternative to SNL, a sketch comedy show that isn’t afraid to make fun of the protected classes that SNL avoids. The model already exists. Fox News’ Gutfeld! regularly beats the legacy late-night shows in ratings for exactly that reason. SNL made the decision to ignore half the country. It’s time for someone to capitalize on that. As Stacy Washington from SiriusXM says, some network should just hire me to write the thing. Just saying. Tomorrow’s cold open is going to be cringe, isn’t it?","summary":"Saturday Night Live returns for Season 51 with Bad Bunny hosting.

While CBS staff began prepping for the meeting, Trump’s schedule postponed the interview. \n\nDiscussions for Trump to appear on 60 Minutes are still ongoing, but the White House has made one thing clear: if it occurs, they want CBS to air the entire conversation unedited. \n\nIn July, Paramount settled its lawsuit with Trump after he accused the network of misleading editing on their interview with Harris, something he felt was election interference.CBS Settled a Lawsuit With TrumpWhile CBS disputed the allegations, and legal experts thought they had a good chance of winning, amid a pending merger of its parent company, the owner of Paramount told the board she wanted to go for a settlement. \n\nAs part of the settlement, CBS agreed to release full transcripts for future interviews with presidents. \n\n60 Minutes isn’t the only show Trump has taken issue with as of late.Trump Is Working to Get 'South Park' Off the AirAs RadarOnline.com reported, the president is working behind the scenes to get South Park taken off the air. \n\nIn the current season of South Park, Trump has been ridiculed with depictions of him naked and with a talking penis, something he’s said to have taken personal offense to. \n\n\"Trump has been fuming about the way South Park portrayed him,” an insider claimed. \"He's convinced the writers are obsessed with humiliating him and is now trying to use back-channel pressure to make sure the show doesn't survive.\"\n\n\"People on the team think it’s no coincidence that Jimmy Kimmel Live! was abruptly canceled after years of mocking Trump – and they fear South Park could be next,” they added.Trump Thinks South Park Is 'Crossing a Line'After Trump was first mocked on the show, the White House slammed the series as being \"irrelevant for 20 years.\" Rather than hurt the show, though, viewership only increased, with the second episode garnering double the number of viewers as the first. \n\n\"The president hates being made fun of, especially about his body. He sees the 'tiny penis' gag as crossing a line and is determined to punish the creators,\" another source shared. \n\n\"The delay of episode three has sent shockwaves through the writers' room. Everyone is braced for the possibility the plug could be pulled altogether,” they added.\n\nWhile J.D. Vance was also satirized on the show, he seemed to take it more in stride, posting on X, \"Well, I’ve finally made it.\"","summary":"Donald Trump is in talks to return to '60 Minutes' for a sit-down interview with Bill Whitaker.... even after their legal drama.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/donald-trump-60-minutes-return-in-talks-unedited-cbs-interview/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Xy8hNHnOv/0x0/donald-trump-60-minutes-return-in-talks-1759519052343.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 20:30:00","author":"Matt Richards","authors":["Matt Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":366009796,"title":"Federal energy funding cancellations hits two projects in New Hampshire","text":"A New Hampshire energy project is among more than 200 that were canceled across the country after an announcement by the U.S. Department of Energy late Wednesday.\n\nFederal officials said they determined the projects would not advance the nation’s energy needs and were not economically viable. The cancellations, originally announced in a tweet from a top White House official, amount to about $7.5 billion.\n\nBrayton Energy lost funding for a New Hampshire-based project as part of the cancellations, according to a spreadsheet provided by the Department of Energy to Sen.

They have received several federal awards, including for the development of nuclear power technology, fuel cells, and compressed air energy storage.\n\nBrayton Energy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe document shared with NHPR said that a second project in New Hampshire, run by New York-based company Ubiquity Solar, had also lost funding. Ubiquity Solar said in a statement on Friday that the listing of their project as based in New Hampshire was an error on the part of federal officials. The project is based in New York and Missouri.\n\nWhen asked for clarification, the U.S. Department of Energy shared a spreadsheet of canceled projects that included Ubiquity Solar but did not specify the states where projects were based.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Shaheen said the cancellations were part of “destructive partisan tactics” by Trump and his budget director, Russell Vought.\n\n“Let’s not mince words: Russ Vought is now politically targeting states in an effort to pressure Congress without regard for the collateral damage to the American people,” she said. “Instead of more destructive partisan tactics, the White House needs to rein in Russ Vought and sit down with Democrats in Congress who are ready to work in good faith to re-open our government and protect health care for tens of millions of Americans.”\n\nEvery state with projects that lost funding voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

Last month, Kenneth Weinstein – a former Trump appointee and leader of a conservative think tank – was appointed by Paramount to serve as the ombudsman of the news network.\n\nParamount’s leaders also effectively sided with the White House last month when it implemented new editing rules for the Sunday show Face the Nation, announcing that all interviews on the show will either be broadcast live or live to tape, following complaints from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about her answers being “shamefully edited” during a taping.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democratic lawmakers have opened an investigation into whether the 60 Minutes settlement – and Trump’s claims that he reached a “side deal” with Ellison to air pro-Trump ads on CBS after the merger was complete - constituted a “bribe.” The probe is also looking into Paramount’s pre-merger decision to cancel prominent Trump critic Stephen Colbert’s top-rated late-night CBS show. \n\nEllison, the son of Oracle founder and top Trump ally Larry Ellison, has been in talks to purchase The Free Press and bring Weiss aboard to set the editorial direction of CBS News for months now. \n\nWeiss, a former New York Times opinion columnist who famously quit The Grey Lady in 2020 over what she cited as the paper’s left-leaning editorial policies and “illiberal environment,” is expected to report to Ellison directly. Tom Cibrowski will remain as president of CBS News and work alongside Weiss, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe Free Press, which Weiss launched in 2021 alongside her wife and sister, will be purchased for a price tag of roughly $150 million, paid out in a combination of cash and stock. The site, which is hosted on Substack, has 1.5 million subscribers – with roughly 10 percent of those paid. According to Puck, the “heterodox” site’s valuation sits at around $100 million.\n\n“Her stunning comeback is a tribute to her hustle, her oft-acknowledged personal charisma, and above all her unapologetic support for Israel and attacks on progressive social justice dogmas, often disparaged as ‘wokeness’ – both of which align her with some of the most powerful people alive even as they alienate her from many of her generational peers in journalism,” The Guardian noted about Weiss in a profile last month.\n\nWhile it appears that The Free Press will remain a standalone property and it isn’t clear yet if it will be integrated into CBS News’ digital site, Weiss’ presence as a newsroom leader will almost certainly fuel even more tension at the network, which has been in turmoil since Paramount began negotiating a settlement over the 60 Minutes lawsuit.\n\nThe 41-year-old commentator will step into a news organization that has already seen the executive producer of 60 Minutes and the network’s news president resign over what they saw as corporate interference with editorial and journalistic independence, noting that they would not apologize for the Harris interview.\n\nAdditionally, the belief among network insiders and staffers is that Weiss is being hired to tamp down on pro-Palestinian coverage of the Gaza War, which was already a central sticking point with former Paramount chair Shari Redstone. \n\n“A major reason why this deal is happening is The Free Press’ unflinching pro-Israeli stance and Larry Ellison and his son David Ellison’s close ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,” Breaker reported this week.\n\nWhile CBS News staffers who spoke with The Independent noted that the majority of the newsroom wouldn’t welcome Weiss because of both her lack of experience and editorial sensibilities, they also said some reporters “would love” the hire specifically over her pro-Israel position.\n\n“I think there are some people there that are like, yes, get her in here because they care about one issue, and that's Israel,” one reporter said.\n\nHowever, for the most part, sources stated that morale is extremely low and there is no real appetite among most of the staff to see Weiss take charge of the network and potentially squander its credibility, as well as that of 60 Minutes, its legendary and long-running newsmagazine. \n\n“People are using words like depressing and doomsday – feels like some sort of doomsday,” the same reporter declared.\n\n“I think the ombudsman, Bari Weiss, and the impending massive layoffs that are coming in a couple of weeks have everyone just kind of freaking out, like, literally freaking out,” another CBS journalist noted. “It's not a good place right now. There was a proper way to do this and a not proper way, and they're doing it in the non-proper way, and maybe that's by design.”\n\nIndeed, with Ellison already making it clear that the new Paramount plans to slash $2 billion from its ledger sheet, painful layoffs are just around the bend – with hundreds of reporters and news staffers on the chopping block. Therefore, the windfall of cash to Weiss is not exactly sitting well with employees who are currently fearful of impending pink slips.\n\n“The fact that we don't have money to pay journalists, but we have money to pay Bari Weiss between $100 and 200 million is indicative of what the Ellisons' true goal here is,” a network correspondent said. “And it's not journalism.”\n\nNetwork staffers also told The Independent that Weiss would have a tough time gaining the respect of the newsroom because they see her as something of a “political operative,” adding that CBS News is already “not a welcoming place for outsiders.”\n\n“There are so many people who've come in here and been chewed up and spit out that the idea that somebody that we don't want is going to come in here and somehow manage to survive this is, I think, laughable,” the CBS reporter declared. “So she's in for, I would venture to guess, a rough ride.”\n\nWhile Ellison insisted right after the close of the merger that he was “committed to accuracy, integrity, and public trust” and wanted to maintain CBS News’ “storied” legacy, all while steering clear of politicizing the network, sources said that the installation of Weiss as top editor of the news division flies in the face of all of that.\n\n“He's essentially going to hand the keys to the kingdom to Bari Weiss and to anyone and everyone who is an ideologue that supports his and his father's world,” the CBS reporter told The Independent.\n\nThe network journalist added that Weiss lacks experience dealing with a broadcast organization of CBS News' size, wondering if she’ll be able to “determine if we cover weather in Mississippi” or send reporting crews to various American and international cities. \n\n“There's such a gulf between your own online publication and broadcast television,” they stated, adding: “Does she know how to do this stuff? … Forget what her political views are, does she know how to do this?!”\n\nFurthermore, in response to a “source close to Ellison” telling The Financial Times that the news “became extreme, elitist, and performative” and that Ellison plans to “bring back a performance-based culture” at CBS in the tradition of Walter Cronkite and Edward Murrow, a network insider scoffed while invoking the Weiss move.\n\n“Also, is Weiss’ Free Press not extreme, elite, and performative? It’s both those things, which is why it’s considered fringe media and CBS News is not,” the insider said. “Is Bari Weiss considered objective or a journalist? Cronkite and Murrow would absolutely not think she is and would have tossed her out of the newsroom inside an hour.”\n\nUltimately, at least one source pointed out that it was what they saw as a relative lack of qualifications for the senior editorial position that could really hinder Weiss in the eyes of those she hopes to supervise and lead.\n\n“It's just like anybody that you think isn't qualified for the job that comes in, there's going to be trepidation, right?” the network correspondent wondered. “Whether it's Bari Weiss or, you know, Michael Scott from The Office.”","summary":"EXCLUSIVE: ‘People are using words like depressing and doomsday – feels like some sort of doomsday,’ one source told The Independent about the mood inside CBS News right now.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cbs-news-bari-weiss-editor-reaction-b2839064.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/18/45/GettyImages-2194604196.jpeg?crop=2047.5,1365,x0.3,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/i6ky8Z1q-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-03 19:48:15","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":365976072,"title":"The Right Has a New Culture War Target.

This week, a boycott campaign took off on X, spearheaded by far-right transphobe Chaya “Libs of TikTok” Raichik, over the presence of children’s series and movies that feature such horrific scenes as a boy wearing a dress (gasp!), a transgender character talking to reporters (egad!), and a kid telling a robot about the term nonbinary (gadzooks!!). This has escalated to accusations of Netflix “grooming children,” which have been boosted by X owner Elon Musk and by elected Republican lawmakers. (One of them is now threatening to drag Netflix executives in front of Congress, while Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has referred to a cartoon series as “abuse” and promoted her law to ban gender-affirming care.) As of Friday, various X accounts are continuing to air out what they find so objectionable on Netflix, from its production deal with the Obamas to its employees, while promoting alternative streaming services and programming to their rage-baited followers. The corporation itself has not commented on the matter.\n\nNetflix boycott threats are a common tactic on the right, as ironically evidenced by Raichik herself, who’s been sharing screenshots of old Charlie Kirk tweets calling the company “a pedophile streaming platform.” (One user who claimed to be canceling their subscription was revealed to have said they’d previously canceled their Netflix account last year, and the year before that.) The online anti-trans fury does feel a touch more powerful this round, with sympathetic leaders in government who will gladly join something as stupid as the brigade against Cracker Barrel’s logo change. But, considering Netflix’s own right-wing bona fides, will this actually lead to an ideological protest on par with the Disney+/Hulu cancellations that spurred the reinstatement of Jimmy Kimmel’s show? Here’s an explainer for how this campaign against Netflix kicked off, what it really means for the streaming business, and why this may not have the oft-noted “Bud Light” impact.\n\nMan, how did we get here?\n\nThis all began Monday, when Raichik shared a clip from the Netflix Original animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park, which ran for only two seasons and was canceled in 2023—but which, Raichik incorrectly posited, was being actively “promoted” on Netflix Kids. The 40-second segment involves a character finding affirmation in their trans identity, in a monologue that ends with another character making an unrelated joke. Raichik, whose posts have long inspired vigilante threats against schools and hospitals with trans-inclusive policies, then targeted show creator Hamish Steele, an award-winning trans cartoonist in London who’d referred to Charlie Kirk as a “random nazi” in a post-assassination tweet. (Steele, who has locked their X account, posted about receiving “extremely nasty weird homophobic and antisemitic emails” in the aftermath and is now taking a social media break.)\n\nElon Musk hopped on to say that the perfectly anodyne Dead End clip was “not ok,” and Raichik claimed soon after that the Tesla CEO had ended his Netflix subscription. By Tuesday, Libs of TikTok had posted a screenshot of her cancel-confirmation email and encouraged others to do the same. The voice actor behind the Dead End character responded directly to Raichik, speaking to his own trans identity and writing on X, “you can fear monger all you want, but kids & parents have told me [the show] saved their lives!!”\n\n… That was it? A clip from an already-ended show that wasn’t even being promoted got Libs of TikTok all hopping mad?\n\nWell, after the Musk boost, she felt empowered to attack other movies and shows, however flimsily. On Wednesday, she highlighted Transformer: Earthspark, an animated kids’ sitcom that was commissioned for Paramount+ in 2022. A Strawberry Shortcake TV movie from 2023 (which was also not a Netflix Original) earned her anger for featuring a male character who wears a dress. Another long-canceled Netflix show, the 2020–21 Baby-Sitters Club revival, came to her attention for a scene where a girl corrects hospital staff on her bedridden friend’s gender identity. And then Raichik went after another Paramount+ original, 2022’s Monster High: The Movie, which is reportedly streaming on Netflix U.K. and had committed the sin of having two characters introduce each other with their preferred pronouns.\n\nReally, these are harmless and brief segments weaponized on behalf of a conservative movement that’s been seeking to erase transgender identity altogether, from pseudoscientific efforts to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors to scrubbing trans Americans from historical monuments. To these cruel people, the very depiction of a transgender person is tantamount to indoctrination, as is the (to them) inconvenient reality that young people do experience gender dysphoria and can understand the concept of gender fluidity. If you’ve imbibed enough far-right propaganda to become a J.K. Rowling type who believes that top surgery is “mutilation,” then anything about trans people will make you feel upset.\n\nI seem to recall that Elon Musk is estranged from his trans daughter.\n\nIndeed, and that’s spurred his mission to defeat the “woke mind virus.” He’s made nice with quite a few other transphobes lately, including Graham Linehan, the Father Ted and IT Crowd creator who was briefly arrested in London last month for tweets that invited readers to “punch” trans women “in the balls” if they’re situated in women-oriented spaces. (Linehan later wrote on Substack that this was “a serious point made with a joke” and “not a call to violence.”) Linehan, who has a lengthy record of transphobic rhetoric, announced his own Netflix cancellation on X in a Wednesday tweet that was celebrated by Musk. More paid-blue-check accounts who lied that Netflix is losing “millions” of customers joined in the fun throughout Wednesday, while God’s Not Dead actor Kevin Sorbo and his wife posted videos praising Raichik and Musk, with the former using the opportunity to also promote the “Christian publishing company” Brave Books—which happens to have a paid streaming service for kids.\n\nAh yes, it’s grifting time.\n\nBetter believe it! The Christian production company Angel Studios (best known for Sound of Freedom) soon began trending on X, as paid-check accounts recommended its streaming platform as a Netflix alternative. More enterprising users dug in and found that the Texan venture capital firm Gigafund, known for employing many Musk lackeys who’ve invested in his enterprises (SpaceX, the Boring Company, Neuralink), had helmed a multimillion-dollar fundraising round for Angel Studios back in 2022. Some of the more Christian nationalist types on X have objected to Angel’s history with Mormon founders, however. (Notably, no one seems to be recommending Truth Social’s homegrown streaming service. Sad!)\n\nEeesh, what a weird social network.\n\nRight? You could see more evidence of this throughout the week, as other activists dug into every Netflix corner they could to “expose” the company as an indoctrination factory. One tweeted out a trans-character-centered article from Netflix’s in-house publication, Tudum, posted earlier this year in honor of International Trans Day of Visibility. This user also shared a May 2024 Netflix press release that touted its Fund for Creative Equity’s support of the Transgender Film Center’s Career Development Lab. Raichik, meanwhile, extended her purview to target other Netflix titles like the popular 2023 movie Leave the World Behind, an Obama-produced feature that she accused of “hating white people” despite including many prominent white people in its cast. From there, individual Netflix investors who’d worked in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives were singled out as part and parcel of a “child grooming epidemic.” Anti-DEI crusader and Meta employee Robby Starbuck was mortified by the fact that various Netflix executives attended a corporate workshop in 2019 that centered on privilege and allyship.\n\nI don’t get it, though. Hasn’t Netflix taken a right-wing tack recently?\n\nCorrect! CEO Ted Sarandos has dined at Mar-a-Lago with Donald Trump. Netflix signed a deal with reactionary comic Tony Hinchcliffe not long after the Kill Tony founder made that racist joke about Puerto Ricans at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. The streamer also partnered last year with Shane Gillis, the stand-up comedian who was infamously fired from Saturday Night Live in 2019 after his racist anti-Asian podcast segments were unearthed. (Gillis continues to hang out with outright racists on his podcasts, and Netflix has produced other stand-up specials with open anti-Asian racism.)\n\nChairman Reed Hastings may have inadvertently fueled another conservative cancellation cycle last year when he donated to Kamala Harris’ campaign, but he’s consistently defended Dave Chappelle’s transphobia, and his company has frequently backed “anti-woke” entertainment like the reality show Snowflake Mountain and a whole host of stand-up specials whose titles riff on the onetime buzzword triggered. In 2022, after Elon Musk accused Netflix of harboring the “woke mind virus,” company leadership dropped certain deals with Black producers like Ava DuVernay and Ibram X. Kendi.\n\nThese guys get mad about Netflix pretty often, don’t they?\n\nThey do, which is why I’m not convinced that this round will leave any lasting damage on the service. The right-wing outrage over the 2020 film Cuties revved up many of the same talking points we see now, and multiple surveys demonstrate that Netflix’s customer base remains overwhelmingly liberal. (Notably, Tesla stock also took a little dive on Friday, perhaps because Musk’s crusade is reawakening shareholder fears that he’s engaging in politics again.)\n\nAll of which is to say: Conservatives only have so many accounts they can cancel, and the Streisand effect may just spur liberal viewers to check out the shows and movies that the far-right is binge-watching for content.","summary":"We’ve seen this movie already—and it always flops.","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2025/10/netflix-boycott-trans-elon-musk-marjorie-taylor-greene.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/9e1f2445-9dcb-49af-9bb7-b8090861e899.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 19:42:37","author":"Nitish Pahwa","authors":["Nitish Pahwa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":365963962,"title":"A by the numbers look at the current Hispanic population in the United States","text":"By FERNANDA FIGUEROA, Associated Press\n\nHispanic Heritage Month, celebrated from Sept. 15 through October 15, offers the opportunity to recognize and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures in the United States.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears’ opposition to abortion, despite Sen. Bernie Sanders recently warning former Vice President Kamala Harris that focusing on the issue could hurt her chances. In Harris’ new book, \"107 Days,\" she wrote that Sanders warned her: \"please focus on the working class, not just on abortion,\" and that he told her he supported then-President Joe Biden because he focused on economic issues. Harris went on to lose all seven swing states and return the White House to President Donald Trump. Spanberger’s ad begins with a clip from an Earle-Sears rally while a narrator calls her a \"MAGA Republican,\" and said: she wants a \"near-total ban\" on abortion. TRUMP VOICES SUPPORT FOR GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, ADMITS SHE HAS 'TOUGH RACE' \"So far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,\" the narrator later concludes. A spokesperson for Spanberger – a former Democratic congresswoman representing the Rappahannock Valley – told Fox News Digital it is still important that Virginians know where Earle-Sears stands on abortion, when asked about Sanders’ warning to Harris. VIRGINIA LT. GOVERNOR ON WHY HER STATE IS AT RISK OF LOSING FEDERAL FUNDING OVER TRANSGENDER BATHROOMS \"As we approach the first Virginia gubernatorial election since the fall of Roe v. Wade … Winsome Earle-Sears supports an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest,\" Spanberger’s spokesperson said. \"The Republican nominee in this race has called abortion \"wicked\" and just this year handwrote a note on Virginia’s proposed constitutional amendment protecting reproductive rights in Virginia making clear that she is ‘morally opposed’.\" As lieutenant governor, Earle-Sears presides over the Virginia Senate and is required to sign bills passed by the chamber. WINSOME EARLE-SEARS REBUKES SPANBERGER PLAN TO UNDO VIRGINIA’S ICE PACT: ‘THIS IS NOT HARD’ When the Senate successfully passed a resolution from state Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-McLean, that would amend the Virginia Constitution to provide a \"fundamental right to reproductive freedom\" if the 2026 chamber passes identical legislation, Earle-Sears inscribed her own objection: \"I am morally opposed to this bill. No protection for the child,\" she hand-wrote, which is allowed under Senate policy. Earle-Sears did not respond to a request for comment, but told the Winchester Star during her 2021 run for lieutenant governor that abortion should be illegal in most cases, excluding life-of-the-mother concerns. EARLE-SEARS: SPANBERGER'S PRE-SHUTDOWN 'SILENCE SPEAKS VOLUMES’ AFTER MONTHS OF DOGE SLAMS Spanberger said her stance constitutes \"doubling down on her long record of opposing reproductive rights.\" In that same Winchester Star interview, Earle-Sears pivoted to the economy as Sanders had advised Harris -- lambasting \"unnecessarily aggressive shutdowns that have been sanctioned by this hypocritical [Northam] administration\" at the time. The GOP nominee, a Frederick County business owner, said her company and others like it have endured economic \"assaults on hardworking Virginians.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Earle-Sears has instead focused on a different social issue than abortion – the continuing prevalence of transgender ideology in some Virginia school districts and counties, including the once-deep-red Prince William plus Fairfax and Loudoun counties. The issue was front-and-center in 2021, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin was credited with successfully harnessing public outrage in otherwise Democratic areas to narrow the margins enough – combined with running up the score in rural, conservative Southside Virginia – to upset Clinton confidant Terry McAuliffe.","summary":"Sen.

What does it mean for CBS News?","text":"CBS News will learn a lot about its future next week when Bari Weiss, founder of the upstart news site the Free Press, is expected to enter the hallowed halls where Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace once roamed. Weiss, 41, is joining CBS News in a new role of editor in chief, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to comment publicly. The appointment could be announced as soon as Monday. David Ellison, 42, chairman and chief executive of CBS owner Paramount, approached Weiss months ago, part of his campaign to shake things up. She will report to Ellison and work alongside CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who joined the network in February. Under the deal, Paramount has agreed to buy Weiss’ four-year-old digital media business, which offers newsletters, reported pieces, podcasts and what it calls \"sense-making columns,\" for around $150 million in cash and stock. For months, her anticipated arrival at CBS News, an aging pillar of the press establishment, has been a hot topic in the news business. The rapid rise of Weiss — a former newspaper opinion page staff editor — to a major role in shaping the coverage of a TV news organization with no previous experience in the medium is an extraordinary move that is likely to be highly scrutinized. Will she remold the news division — which has been beset by management turnover and sustained pressure from President Trump — in her image? There will also be questions as to whether the founder of a relatively lean digital operation such as the Free Press will have a leadership role at a legacy TV news organization with more than 1,000 employees. A shake-up is clearly on the agenda of new Paramount owner Skydance Media. When the company went through regulatory approval to complete its $8-billion merger, Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr said he welcomes Skydance's \"commitment to make significant changes to the once storied CBS broadcast network.\" In order to clear a path for the deal, Paramount paid $16 million to settle Trump's $20-billion lawsuit — deemed by legal experts to be spurious — over an interview he claimed was edited to help then-Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the 2024 election. He has left the network alone ever since. Skydance and the Free Press did not comment on the expected appointment of Weiss. When asked in August about her joining the network, Ellison — son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison — focused on how he wants the news division to speak to what he views as the 70% of Americans who consider themselves center left or center right politically. In a crowded sea of political and cultural pundits, Weiss found her own lane as a gay Jewish woman who attacked what she called the excesses of the political left, often saying it was intolerant of opposing viewpoints. She called herself \"a diversity hire\" at the New York Times' reliably liberal opinion section and gained a following through her appearances on HBO's \"Real Time With Bill Maher.\" When she quit the New York Times in 2020, she accused her former employer of failing to protect her from internal criticism by her colleagues. Her public resignation letter was shared on social media by Donald Trump Jr. and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who used it to advance their case of institutional liberal bias in the media. Described as a confident and skilled communicator, Weiss used her notoriety to attract investors for the Free Press, a digital media business offering newsletters, reported stories, opinion pieces and podcasts. Launched in 2021, it now ranks as the No. 1 bestselling politics platform on Substack. The Free Press has made itself heard in the national conversation. A treatise on the left-wing leanings of NPR, written by a longtime editor at the radio service, generated massive attention and likely helped set the stage for eliminating federal funding to public media. Last year, the Free Press also broke the story over the internal CBS News controversy surrounding \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil's aggressive questioning of author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank to the Jim Crow era of segregation in the U.S. Dokoupil said Coates' book on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.” After some staffers complained, Dokoupil was admonished by CBS News leadership on an editorial call that the Free Press posted online. Weiss is extremely popular among corporate executives disdainful of high taxes and big government. Finance and private equity executives rave about Free Press missives against purportedly \"woke\" attitudes and DEI initiatives that they believe have made it more difficult to do business. Weiss has become a celebrity as well, attending the wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez in Italy. She was the star attraction at the annual gathering of media moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho. Newsrooms are typically suspicious of outsiders and change has never come easy at CBS News, which has a culture steeped in its storied past. \"A place like CBS News is so rooted in its traditions and in what it believes in,\" said Tom Bettag, a veteran network news producer who is a lecturer for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. \"It's got its own theology and an outsider has to win the confidence of the people inside.\" Even like-minded conservative commentators such as Megyn Kelly suggested that Weiss might face challenges in navigating such an entrenched institution. \"I'm worried they're going to eat her alive, because CBS is among the worst when it comes to being insular,\" Kelly said on her Sirius XM podcast last month. \"Like you have to be raised by CBS to be respected by CBS people.\" A number of veterans inside CBS News who were not authorized to speak publicly said they have a wait-and-see attitude over the pending Weiss appointment, as they are uncertain on what her role will entail. They don't believe Weiss will want to deal with day-to-day news coverage decisions such as how many correspondents and technical crews to send to cover a natural disaster. Having an opinion journalist in a leadership role may not sit well among a number of staffers. But with layoffs sweeping through the TV news business, an employee exodus predicted in some reports appears unlikely, according to one former CBS News executive. One possible source of tension may be in international coverage, primarily the war in Gaza, which has been the subject of internal debate in many newsrooms. Weiss, who once belonged to the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that was the site of a shooting massacre in 2018, is a staunch Israel supporter. She's joining a company that, led by its new management, was the only studio to push back against a campaign gathering steam among Hollywood progressives to boycott Israeli film festivals and organizations. But ideological newsroom flare-ups that spill into public view are rare. Managing a network TV news division largely consists of keeping an eye on costs, ratings and maintaining a pipeline of stories for dozens of hours of scheduled programming each week. Despite its well-documented troubles, CBS still has two of the most successful news programs on television in \"60 Minutes\" and \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" Even after the gantlet \"60 Minutes\" went through earlier this year, viewers showed up when it returned for its 58th season Sunday with a season premiere that drew 10 million viewers, making it the most-watched non-sports show of the week, according to Nielsen data. Bettag noted that even though former Paramount majority shareholder Shari Redstone was updated on \"60 Minutes\" stories amid the legal battle earlier this year, he believes the program retained its editorial rigor and independence. \"If anything, it stiffened spines,\" Bettag said. \"CBS Sunday Morning\" remains the most watched weekend morning program and increased its share of the TV audience last season, averaging close to 5 million viewers weekly. While those two programs still attract large, loyal audiences, CBS News is faced with declining ratings and revenue, as viewers continue to move away from traditional TV to digital video offerings. CBS News has long operated a 24-hour streaming channel, but it doesn't attract the same audience levels or ad rates as the network. CBS News also has to regain the trust of the audience that has listened to right-wing pundits pound away at the credibility of mainstream press. It's hardly a new development as conservative North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms tried to lead a takeover of CBS in the mid-1980s so he could \"become Dan Rather's boss.\" But social media have amplified those bias allegations, driving MAGA-supporting viewers to Fox News and other conservative-leaning outlets. Bettag believes CBS News has to do a better job of getting the public to understand the editorial process and how it strives for accuracy and fairness to counter the right-wing narrative of media bias. \"If Bari Weiss can come in and explain what they're doing and why they're doing it then I think she can be successful,\" he said. Veteran TV news executives warn that any overt attempt to woo disaffected conservatives risks alienating the millions of viewers who are still watching CBS News programs. CNN's attempt to try to cater to right-leaning consumers — at the behest of parent company Warner Bros. Discovery — led to a decline in audience that has not bounced back. One idea circulating at Paramount is having the Free Press remain as an independent entity within the company, providing contributors and commentators to its special coverage, the Sunday roundtable program \"Face the Nation\" and streaming channel. While the Free Press has been embraced by conservatives, Weiss has been fluid in her political leanings, at least in the voting booth. Her recent votes for president were Mitt Romney in 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. In a video posted last fall, Weiss said the Free Press staff was split three ways between Trump, Harris and undecided in their 2024 vote. She called it a reflection of the nation. Weiss is pro abortion rights and favors pro-gun control and LGBTQ rights (Weiss is married to Nellie Bowles, a former New York Times journalist who also works at the Free Press). She has said she was among the many who cried at their desks when Trump was first elected in 2016. But she told Fox News in early 2024 that her view of the president had moderated since, as she approved of his handling of Israel and the economy during his first term. \"I'm the first to admit that I was a sufferer of what conservatives at the time would have called TDS, Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" Weiss said. But the Free Press does not give Trump a free pass as other right-wing outlets have. One of the current lead stories on the site is a highly critical take on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's speech on warrior ethos given to military leadership on Tuesday.
