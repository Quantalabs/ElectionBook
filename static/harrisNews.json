{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":7713,"news":[{"id":254801738,"title":"How Kamala Harris’s Berkeley neighborhood is a greater struggle for the Middle Class","text":"BERKELEY — The fog lifted early Friday over the flatlands of Berkeley where a diverse mix of homeowners and renters had gathered for a block party the night before to watch Kamala Harris on a big screen accept the Democratic nomination for president and deliver a shout-out to her childhood neighborhood. “We lived in the flats,” Harris said from the convention stage in Chicago Thursday night, “a beautiful, working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses and construction workers — all who tended their lawns with pride.” This is the kind of middle class neighborhood and people, she said, she would fight for if she beats former President Donald Trump in November. But much has changed in this pocket of the Bay Area since the 1970s, when Harris’s mother, a UC Berkeley grad student, raised her two daughters in an upstairs apartment on Bancroft Way. Nurses and firefighters who may earn more than $100,000 a year would be unlikely to afford the average $1.2 million homes here, including the hefty down payment, without financial help from family. A typical 2-bedroom apartment, like the one where Harris spent her elementary school years, would likely rent for upwards of $3,500 a month — a hefty cost even for an average tech worker living on one salary. For the average California construction worker, whose median wage was less than $62,000 in 2020, the rent would be impossible. “I find it tragic that the high cost of living in Berkeley today makes it that much harder for someone like Kamala Harris’s mom to afford to live here,” said Abby Friedman, who helped organize the block party in her neighbor’s side yard on Browning Street, around the corner from Harris’s childhood home. Vernita McCray lives across the street from it. She was born here in 1956, a year after her father, a hod carrier who delivered bricks and lumber to construction sites, bought the modest corner house. He could afford the $134 monthly mortgage and raise his three daughters while his wife stayed home. They were some of the first Black residents to move into the mostly White neighborhood back then, she said, and kids across the street sometimes threw rocks at their house. In the 1970s, when Harris was school-age here, the neighborhood was mostly Black. The homes with long, narrow lots along Bancroft Way look much as they did in the 1970s, including the two-story yellow house that Harris grew up in. Instead of Regina Shelton’s day care beneath the Harris apartment where the sisters stayed after school, there is a Montessori preschool now. But as housing prices skyrocketed and the neighborhood gentrified over the next decades, the ZIP code that includes about 17,600 people is mostly White again, making up nearly half the population, according to the 2020 Census. The Black population has fallen to about 15%, followed closely by Hispanics and Asians at about 14%. McCray, 68, who spent years working for Bank of America and now works in child care, says there’s no way she could afford to buy her own home now. “Oh no,” she said, “not in my wildest dreams.” Harris has made helping the middle class a central theme of her candidacy, a demographic that Trump largely appealed to in his successful 2016 presidential campaign. In a campaign video released Friday, Harris promised to create an “opportunity economy,” for middle-class families “like the one I grew up in,” she said, “where everyone has a chance to get a car loan, buy a home, start a business.” In her Thursday night speech, she also pledged to build three million new homes and “end America’s housing shortage.” What she didn’t mention, however, is that Democratic policies and local “not-in-my-backyard” sentiments have often thwarted opportunities to build new housing, and Democratic-sponsored rent control programs that make some units affordable for the middle class also discourage development. As Trump put it in a post on his Truth Social site, “She’s talking about the Middle Class, but she’s the one who broke the Middle Class, and made it UNSAFE AND UNAFFORDABLE!” Still, Harris’s message resonates in this Berkeley neighborhood not far from the university campus called “Poet’s Corner,” for the street names of famous poets like Browning and Chaucer. “Like all of Berkeley, Poet’s Corner has gotten radically more expensive,” said Marilyn Garcia, a real estate agent who’s worked in Berkeley for two decades. “It’s definitely affected who can afford to live there… I don’t think that a teacher could afford to buy a house in that area these days.” There are still educators, therapists and working class retirees who live here, however, and attended the livestream of Harris’s speech as the sun set Thursday night. But many of them either bought their homes decades ago, have taken in renters, or are renters themselves with roommates. Celine Bonfils, a French immigrant who conducted postdoctoral research in climate science here, and her husband, also a scientist, rent a two-bedroom with their two children. Like Harris, her children are the offspring of two scientists and “we’re renting. So we are middle class,” said Bonfils, who helped set up chairs at the viewing party. “It’s not easy to buy a house.” Pramish Thapa, a Nepal immigrant, and his wife, Annie Powers, purchased their two-bedroom house across from the old Harris home for more than $1 million. But even with low interest rates when they bought the house and their tech salaries – he’s an economist and she works for an AI start-up – they still needed family help to buy it. They’re happy to be here, and take pride in living across from Harris’s childhood home. When Harris spoke about her days here – that Mrs. Shelton who lived below “became a second mother,” and that their neighbors taught them “how to make gumbo, how to play chess” and instilled the values of treating others with “kindness, respect and compassion” – Thapa believes that spirit still lives on. He missed the block party, where neighbors ate handfuls of popcorn and slices of cake with frosting that said “Kamala 47,” and where Friedman’s 11-year-old daughter, Elia (cq) Schifrin (cq), made hand-painted t-shirts that said “Keep calm and vote Kamala.” Despite the challenges to afford living here – or maybe because of them – Thapa says he’s felt the same sense of community that Harris talked about. “When we first came here, we received a cake from some of our neighbors and fruit,” he said, “and random acts of kindness.”","summary":"The homes with long, narrow lots along Bancroft Way look much as they did in the 1970s, including the two-story yellow house that Harris grew up in, but it's unlikely that Harris's mother could afford to raise her two daughters there now as a grad student.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/23/how-kamala-harriss-berkeley-neighborhood-is-a-greater-struggle-for-the-middle-class/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SJM-L-HARRISBERK-0825-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 00:02:06","author":"Harriet Blair Rowan,Julia Prodis Sulek,Kate Talerico","authors":["Harriet Blair Rowan","Julia Prodis Sulek","Kate Talerico"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.219},{"id":254801710,"title":"RFK Jr. Could 'Cost' Donald Trump, Ex-Bush Official Warns","text":"Republican pundit Scott Jennings cautioned former President Donald Trump's campaign to \"be a little careful\" with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s fresh endorsement.Kennedy, who has run as an independent for much of the 2024 election, announced that he is suspending his campaign during a speech in Arizona Friday afternoon, claiming that his internal polling showed that remaining in the race would likely benefit Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.The environmental lawyer subsequently endorsed Trump, which the former president called a \"great honor.\" There is speculation that Trump could offer Kennedy a role in his administration in exchange for his support. Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email Friday evening for additional comment.While polling has shown that Kennedy's supporters are likely to lean toward Trump's campaign with the independent out of the race, Jennings, former adviser to President George W. Bush, said that Kennedy's reputation could \"cost\" Trump's chances with some voters come November.\"Look for whatever benefit you get ... there could be some cost on the other side of the algebra,\" Jennings said during an appearance on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. \"I mean, I'm old enough to remember when RFK was a liberal conspiracy theorist,\" Jennings continued. \"Now he's more of a conservative conspiracy theorist, but the through line is he's a conspiracy theorist, and a lot of people think he's kind of a loony tune.\"\"So I would just caution the former president be a little careful here,\" he added. \"Don't make any promises you can't get out of.\"Kennedy, son of 1968 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of Democratic President John F. Kennedy, has gained attention in recent years for his skepticism toward the COVID-19 vaccinations. He also stirred controversy on several occasions while on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, Kennedy admitted to dumping a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan 10 years earlier, saying that he and his friends who assisted thought the act was \"amusing.\"Allegations also spread this summer that Kennedy had previously eaten a dog, which was first reported by Vanity Fair, although his campaign later dispelled the rumors. That same article included information on Kennedy being accused of sexually assaulting his former babysitter, a claim that Kennedy did not deny during a podcast appearance.\"I had a very, very rambunctious youth,\" Kennedy told Breaking Points podcaster Saagar Enjeti. \"I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\"It's unclear how Kennedy's decision to suspend his campaign will impact an already tight race. The New York Times reported Friday that, according to its polling averages, Kennedy held about 5 percent of voters' support nationally on the day he dropped out. His support earlier in the race was closer to double digits, but started to trail off once Harris launched her reelection campaign.Kennedy's impact could be felt most in tight battleground states, although the Times reported that its most recent survey with Siena College conducted in seven swing states found that if all of Kennedy's supporters shifted toward Trump, the former president would gain 1 percentage point on average.In comparison, Harris held a 2 percent lead over Trump on average across the seven states, with or without Kennedy's inclusion in the poll.","summary":"Scott Jennings warned Friday that a \"lot of people\" view Kennedy as \"kind of a loony tune.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-jr-could-cost-donald-trump-ex-bush-official-warns-1943851","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457322/rfk-jr-could-cost-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 00:01:46","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":254801758,"title":"How RFK Jr’s decision to drop out could impact the outcome of the election between Trump and Harris","text":"Robert F. Kennedy’s Jr.’s voters could help Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election, according to an exclusive poll for DailyMail.com. It shows that his supporters lean towards Trump over Harris by a margin of two to one. Although the nephew of JFK is only polling in single digits, that sort of boost could be enough to tip the balance towards Trump in a tight race that will be decided by just tens of thousands of voters in a handful of swing states. The issue could take on fresh urgency on Friday, amid speculation that RFK Jr. is preparing to drop out. He is scheduled to speak in Phoenix, Arizona, ‘about the present historical moment and his path forward,’ at 2pm Eastern time, and has already withdrawn his name from the state’s ballot. Our latest poll with J.L. Partners, conducted from August 7 to 11, found that of 1,001 likely voters only five percent would vote for Kennedy if the election were tomorrow. He was far behind Trump on 43 percent and Harris on 41 percent. But when that poll was combined with a second survey to ask whether they lean more to Trump or to Harris the results appear to be decisive: More than half (51 percent) said they leaned towards the former president. About a quarter (26 percent) said they leaned more to Harris. That could swell Trump’s voter base by a point or two if Kennedy is no longer running. ‘Don’t buy the line that RFK Jr. only makes a small difference to the election,’ said J.L. Partners cofounder James Johnson. ‘This is a major third party candidate dropping out. ‘And our data show that even before that, RFK Jr.’s voters were going to go to Trump by a large margin if their man wasn’t in the race.’ RFK Jr., 70, an environmental lawyer with a nose for conspiracy theories and anti-vax arguments, entered the race as a Democrat. But he switched to independent after failing to find purchase against Biden in the primary contest. Previous J.L. Partners polls had shown he had picked up more support from the left than the right. ‘The data also show there is a small but significant group of voters who opted for Biden in 2020, moved to RFK Jr, and are now leaning Trump,’ said Johnson. ‘These voters—who used RFK Jr as a sort of gateway drug to backing Trump—could make all the difference in states on a knife-edge, and RFK Jr’s dropping out will give Trump a boost in these states. ‘It is a more significant development than anything out of the DNC this week.’ Trump is on a tour of battleground states and is due to hold a rally near Phoenix soon after RFK Jr’s announcement. His campaign has teased a special guest, heightening speculation that Kennedy will endorse the former president. During a trip to the southern border on Thursday, Trump said he was open to the possibility, calling it a ‘great honor.’ He also said there might be room in his administration for RFK Jr, the son of Robert Kennedy, JFK’s attorney general. But he will face a battle to win over RFK Jr’s supporters. Harris communications director Michael Tyler told MSNBC that her campaign would welcome his voters. ‘I think that him dropping out fully cements … that this election is going to be a choice between Vice President Harris, who is fighting for the American people, [and] Donald Trump, who … is simply fighting for himself,’ he said at the Democratic convention in Chicago. Kennedy has endured a turbulent campaign. He recently admitted he dumped a dead bear cub in Manhattan’s Central Park in 2014. And he struggled with strained campaign finances and legal challenges, including a ruling in New York that he should not appear on the ballot in the state because he listed a ‘sham’ address on nominating petitions.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobert F.

Kennedy Jr. said Vice President Kamala Harris has “no interest” in ridding the nation’s food supply of toxic chemicals or cleaning house at agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Department of Agriculture (USDA). During his announcement, Kennedy suggested that he would be involved in a future Trump administration with a focus on ending chronic health issues and raising regulatory standards for the United States food supply. “These agencies — the FDA, USDA, CDC, all of them — are controlled by giant for-profit corporations. Seventy-five percent of the FDA’s funding doesn’t come from taxpayers; it comes from pharma. Pharma lobbyists cycle in and out of these agencies,” Kennedy said: With President Trump’s backing, I’m going to change that. We’re going to staff these agencies with scientists and doctors who are free from industry funding. We’re going to make sure that the decisions of consumers, doctors, and patients are informed by unbias science. [Emphasis added]We’re going to stop subsidizing the worst foods with our agricultural subsidies. We’re going to get toxic chemicals out of our food. We’re going to reform the entire food system. For that, we need new leadership in Washington because, unfortunately, both the Democrat and Republican Party are in cahoots with the big food producers, big pharma, and big ag[riculture], which are among the DNC’s major donors. [Emphasis added] Kennedy also said Harris, who refused to take a phone call from him, “has expressed no interest in addressing this issue.” “Four more years of Democratic rule will complete the consolidation of corporate and neocon power, and our children will be the ones who suffer most,” Kennedy said. ﻿﻿ Trump, Kennedy said, “has adopted these issues as his own to the point that he has asked to enlist me in his administration.” Among the issues Kennedy will spearhead while campaigning with Trump is massively reforming the U.S. food supply, which he blames for widespread chronic illnesses among Americans that financially are a boon to big pharmaceutical corporations. “Today … we spend more on healthcare than any country on Earth, twice what they pay in Europe. And, yet, we have the worst health outcomes of any nation overall. We’re about seventy-ninth in health outcomes — behind Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mongolia, and so many other countries. Nobody has a chronic disease burden like we have,” Kennedy said: Two-thirds of American adults and children suffer from chronic health issues. Fifty years ago, that number was less than one percent. We’ve gone from one percent to 66 percent. In America, 74 percent of Americans are now overweight or obese — and 50 percent of our children. One hundred and twenty years ago, when somebody was obese, they were sent to the circus. They were literally case reports about them. Obesity was almost unknown … today, one out of every three kids is diabetic or pre-diabetic. [Emphasis added]…There’s been an explosion of neurological disorders — ADD, ADHD, speech delays, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, Asperger’s, autism. In the year 2000, the autism rate was one in 1,500. Now, autism rates in kids are one in 36 nationally. Nobody is talking about this … this is a crisis that 77 percent of our kids are too disabled to serve in the United States Military. [Emphasis added]About 18 percent of American teens now have fatty liver disease … that disease, when I was a kid, only affected late-stage alcoholics who were elderly. Cancer rates are skyrocketing in the young and the old … one in four American women are on anti-depressant medication. Forty percent of teens have a mental health diagnosis, and 15 percent of high schoolers are on aderrol, and half a million children are on SSRIs. [Emphasis added] Kennedy said “ultra-processed food” as well as “toxic chemicals in our food, our medicine, and our environment” are responsible: “About 70 percent of American children’s diet is ulta-processed — that means manufactured in the factory. These foods consist primarily of processed sugar, ultra-processed grains, and seed oils. Laboratory scientists … deployed thousands of scientists to find new chemicals to make the food more addictive. These ingredients didn’t exist 100 years ago. Humans aren’t biologically adapted to eat them. Hundreds of these chemicals are banned in Europe but ubiquitous in American processed food.The second culprit is toxic chemicals in our food, our medicine, and our environment. Pesticides, food additives, pharmaceutical drugs, and toxic waste permeate every cell of our bodies. This assault on our children’s cells and hormones is unrelenting. To name just one problem, many of these chemicals increase estrogen. Because young children are ingesting so many of these hormone disrupters, America’s puberty rate is now occurring at age ten to 13, which is six years earlier than girls were reaching puberty in 1900. Our country has the earliest puberty rates of any continent on the Earth. No, this isn’t because of better nutrition, this is not normal. Breast cancer is also estrogen-driven, and it now strikes one in eight women. We are mass poisoning all of our children and our adults. [Emphasis added] As a result, Kennedy said, the federal government is spending twice as much on treating chronic illnesses as it is on funding the U.S. military. At the same time, Kennedy said the government’s agricultural subsidies for processed food are “destroying small farms, and they’re destroying our soils.” “What is happening in our country? Why isn’t this in the headlines every day … why are we allowing this to happen to our children?” Kennedy said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWhile dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing former President Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: RFK Jr. Criticizes Kamala Harris&#8217;s Stance on Food Supply Safety and Corporate Influence in Federal Agencies first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/rfk-jr-criticizes-kamala-harriss-stance-on-food-supply-safety-and-corporate-influence-in-federal-agencies/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-RFK-Jr-Kamala-Harris-Has-No-Interest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 23:48:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":254801826,"title":"Robert F.

I recently read a letter with the words “Vote for results” in the headline — ironically it was about Donald Trump. I can’t speak for everyone, but why would you vote for a person who doesn’t know the meaning of the words morality, honesty or ethics and who obviously doesn’t live by them? Why would you vote for someone who has admitted he wants to be a dictator: “You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.” I want to live in a free country, one where democracy is the word used to describe it. Please vote. Geraldine Mellen San Leandro Harris’ ethnicity, race should be off-limits Donald Trump’s comments about Kamala Harris’ race and ethnicity are reprehensible. Respect is due, Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris Is the first Black woman to serve as vice president, and the first Indian American woman to serve as vice president. She is also the first Black woman to be nominated for president by a major party, and the first Indian American to be nominated for president by a major party. Race and gender have no place in this election. I cannot fathom why Trump keeps bringing it up. He needs to stop — now. James Hightower Hayward Urge Congress not to take out Prop. 12 Certain special interests in the pork industry are pressuring Congress to overturn Proposition 12 via the Farm Bill. Proposition 12 sets commonsense animal welfare and food safety standards on certain animal products and was passed overwhelmingly in California in 2018. Nullifying this law via the federal Farm Bill would not only overrule the will of voters, but it would be a step backward and undermine the progress of treating animals more humanely. The proposed Farm Bill language in the U.S. House of Representatives would go beyond dismantling Proposition 12; it could invalidate hundreds of other state laws that protect public health and have devastating repercussions. As a voter in California who cares deeply about how animals are treated, I respectfully urge Senator Alex Padilla to stand against these controversial attempts to gut Proposition 12 and work to keep language that invalidates state animal welfare and agriculture laws out of the final Farm Bill.

And being tied to Project 2025 continues to freak the hell out of Trump. On Thursday, he even went to his favorite cable news refuge, “Fox & Friends,” to claim ignorance yet again. “I have no idea what Project 25 is, but they use it, and they know it.” Trump said. While hate-watching Vice President Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, he posted about the right-wing scheme again on Truth Social. The most hilarious evidence of his panic has to be this GOP mailer that hit mailboxes in Michigan this week. The denial is in bright blue and red letters: “Straight from Trump’s Platform,” it says. “NOT PROJECT 2025, WHICH TRUMP DIDN’T WRITE AND DOES NOT SUPPORT.” Oh, Donald—still fighting these inconvenient truths about The Heritage Foundation’s scheme. Like the fact that the project’s chief architect admitted on hidden camera that Trump has given them his blessing. Or the story this week from CBS News, headlined “Hundreds of proposals in Project 2025 match Trump's policies.” CBS “identified at least 270 proposals in Project 2025's published blueprint for the next Republican president that match Trump's past policies and current campaign promises.” Those include: bringing back at least 80 of Trump’s executive orders from his tenure; 170 Project 2025 proposals that are on Trump’s website or that he talks about in speeches; and another 21 that “match both Trump's past actions and his campaign promises and statements.” That builds on this July story from CNN, titled “Trump claims not to know who is behind Project 2025. A CNN review found that at least 140 people who worked for him are involved.” For starters, CNN found that six former Cabinet secretaries, four Trump ambassador nominees, his first deputy chief of staff, and “several enforcers of his controversial immigration crackdown” had helped craft Project 2025. This is a serious case of the gentleman protesting too much. And it’s hilariously ironic that the more he insists it has nothing to do with him, the deeper journalists dig—the Streisand Effect in action. Trump isn’t credible on just about anything, but on this one, he’s lost the battle. Fox News might indulge his repeated disavowals, but it won’t work: Trump and Project 2025 have become inextricably linked. Trump’s campaign keeps yammering on about how Harris has no policies—as if they want this to be an election about policy. But now that Project 2025’s proposed policies are on everyone’s lips, they’re panicked by that. Trump’s cronies at The Heritage Foundation put it all out there on paper, and everybody hates it. Even worse for Republicans, people are now likely to cast their votes with Project 2025 in mind. That makes the Democrats’ strategy of putting the focus on it very smart. This is Trump’s vision for another term in the White House, and the people who wrote it are the people who would enforce it if given the chance. Like vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, Minnesota governor and former high school football coach, said: “When somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, trust me, they're gonna use it.” RELATED STORIES","summary":"Democrats were laser-focused on Project 2025 during this week’s Democratic National Convention, devoting segments each night to describing the different policy disasters that are part of the extremist blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd being tied to Project 2025 continues to freak the hell out of Trump.

Abraham is the U.S. Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is based in Indonesia. A U.S. official confirmed that Abraham will conclude his tenure in Jakarta in the coming days. In his new role, Abraham is expected to have a small team tasked with putting in place operations for Vice President Kamala Harris to begin building an administration after the election, if she defeats former President Donald Trump. The source said that the team will not be making decisions about personnel in a potential administration or developing policies before Election Day. Covington and Burling LLP, the law firm where former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder works, will help the transition team get set up. Holder vetted potential running mates for the Harris campaign. A State Department spokesperson said Abraham has spent his two years as ambassador working to expand and deepen the relationship between the U.S. and nations in southeast Asia. Before that, he was chief of staff of the National Security Council and oversaw the White House Situation Room. Transition teams are familiar territory for Abraham. In 2020, he was executive director of the Biden transition. During that time, he worked closely with Harris, according to the source. Abraham's appointment comes as the General Services Administration prepares to engage the Harris and Trump campaigns in the presidential transition process. A spokesperson for the GSA said the agency will offer its services to both transition teams through a letter on Aug. 27. Next steps include accepting the offer in writing and executing a memo of understanding in order to get office space in Washington, D.C., and administrative support to do their work. Federal law related to presidential transitions stipulates Sept. 1 as the deadline for GSA to enter into formal agreements with presidential transition teams. It’s not clear how that timeline will be affected given the short period between the offer of services and the start of next month, which falls on a Sunday before a federal holiday. The Trump campaign announced last week that it has formed a transition team headed by Linda McMahon, who led the Small Business Administration under Trump, and Howard Lutnick, CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. The choice of McMahon and Lutnick also serves to further distance Trump from Project 2025. The collaboration by conservative groups offered about 900 pages of policy proposals and includes a personnel database aimed at staffing a future Trump White House. Democrats have called the proposal extreme and have attempted to link Trump’s campaign to it. Several former Trump administration staffers are part of the groups behind Project 2025, but McMahon and Lutnick haven’t been connected to the effort. Congress outlined a need for structured presidential transitions in 1963, recognizing that any incoming president needed to hit the ground running immediately after inauguration by having a team working to fill thousands of appointments across the federal government before the new administration takes power.","summary":"The Harris campaign has tapped Yohannes Abraham for a top role in her presidential transition team, according to a source familiar with the planning.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-transition-team-yohannes-abraham-biden-official-rcna168048","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240823-Yohannes-Abraham-2022-ac-615p-881dd5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 23:24:16","author":"Aaron Gilchrist","authors":["Aaron Gilchrist"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":254800800,"title":"Team Trump sees RFK Jr. endorsement as key to swing-state wins","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s 2024 campaign never got the traction some might have expected given his famous name and ability to get earned media. But now that the effort is suspended, the maverick politician may end up playing a pivotal role between now and November — particularly in battleground states. That’s the case made by Chris LaCivita, one of former President Donald Trump’s senior advisers, in a “confidential” memo Friday arguing that “in every single state RFK Jr.’s vote breaks for President Trump.” “This is good news for President Trump and his campaign – plain and simple,” the veteran political consultant declares about the key states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and their 93 combined electoral votes that could swing the race for the White House if they perform in a bloc. Among the seven battlegrounds, Nevada (with six electoral votes) is the place where RFK voters are most primed to switch to Trump now that their preferred candidate has endorsed the Republican. A full 66% of the RFK voters in Team Trump’s “most recent round” of internal surveys back the Republican with Kennedy out of the race, while 16% say they would back Harris and the remainder claim they are undecided. Kennedy had 4% support in Nevada according to LaCivita’s polling. To put that number in perspective, Biden won the state by 2.39% in 2020. Though Nevada offers the most striking example of an exodus to Trump, it’s not the only one according to the Trump operation’s calculations. Trump won North Carolina in 2016 and 2020; but a recent poll showed Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of Trump in the race for the state’s 16 electoral votes on the strength of the Democratic National Convention showcase. The LaCivita numbers suggest Kennedy voters, who make up 3% of the Tar Heel State electorate, are also moving over to the Trump column. With Kennedy out of the race, 58% of his backers say they will switch to Trump, against just 22% moving to Harris. An additional 21% say they are undecided. Wisconsin, whose 10 electoral votes Biden won by 0.63% four years ago, is yet another state where Kennedy backers moving to Trump could make the difference in November. RFK had 4% support according to the internal polling, and the former oresident is poised to get 55% of those voters, with 25% likely to back Harris and 20% undecided. If Trump gets all the undecided voters, that’s good for a 2% gain in his vote share. If he’d had that cushion in 2020, he would have carried the state. Arizona, where Kennedy announced his withdrawal from the race, is another state where Trump disproportionately benefits from RFK’s exit and the dispersal of his support, measured at 5%. The former president takes 53% support, with Harris at 28% and 19% undecided. Biden won the state’s 11 electoral votes by 0.3% — or fewer than 11,000 votes — in 2020. LaCivita notes that “the net vote gained in a state like Arizona based on just a 2020 turnout model would be over 41,000 votes, nearly 4 times Biden’s winning margin.” In Pennsylvania and Georgia, where Biden won 35 electoral votes by narrow margins four years ago, a similar scenario plays out with somewhat less intensity. Trump leads Harris with RFK voters 49% to 35% in the Keystone State and 47% to 34% in the Peach State. Kennedy was at 4% in Pennsylvania and 3% in Georgia, where LaCivita observes “the net gain would be over 19,000 votes, nearly twice Biden’s margin.” The only state where RFK voters look likely to break evenly according to the Trump internal poll is Michigan, where Harris takes 43% of Kennedy voters and the 45th president (appropriately enough) takes 45%. Fifteen electoral votes are up for grabs in the Wolverine State. If Trump sweeps all seven of these states, he has a pathway to 312 electoral votes. While it’s premature to allocate all Kennedy’s voters to the Republican column, the reality is if RFK Jr. can deliver them, the man from Mar-a-Lago is headed back to DC.","summary":"Robert F.

It seems, Ruiz claimed, her precious little one got hold of Mama’s phone and the rest, well.. is…hivstory (forgive me)I’m not sure anyone is swallowing something so simple and obvious, but we’re not the ones to get all national security involved. Not good for the health. So… no Beyoncé live and in-person, but we were actually okay with that because hearing her masterpiece with Kendrick Lamar blasting as the first Black woman of color stepped on the stage to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination as the next POTUS filled us All The Way Up–especially after all that was poured into us by Barack Obama and Michelle Obama’s words, Oprah’s incredible energy and call to action, and the big, beautiful heart of Tim Walz’s son, 17-year-old son, Gus. Source: Justin Sullivan / Getty But in no way least of all, there was also all that incredible music weaving the week together. What a gift! Because think about it: the DNC, with like a month to pull this off, didn’t have to go that hard in the Chi. I mean, could the bar have been set any lower after the RNC and Kid Rock? DNC showed up to say they weren’t there to compete against those guys. They were there to show them and the world how it’s done. And they did that, over and over again and the only thing really missing were our beloved mothers and grandmothers who didn’t make it witness this day, this hour. But if I know them, they were probably there, hiding their wings in the wings holding each other and whispering a soft, powerful chorus of, “G’head Baby. Cause we not going back. We’re not going back.” Here are 5 of the best musical moments from the 2024 DNC! DJ Cassidy’s Roll Call! Source: The Washington Post / Getty Every convention features a state-by-state roll call, where each state accounts for its respective delegates and announces its endorsements. This ending component of the primary process was enhanced at the DNC when DJ Cassidy played music that corresponded with each state. For Indiana, Cassidy played “Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough” by the late Michael Jackson, a Gary native. Lil Jon Turns Up With the Turn Down! Source: Chip Somodevilla / Getty DJ Cassidy helped the crowd get motivated with his musical roll call. But for the state of Georgia, he got some assistance from an Atlanta native. Platinum-selling producer and artist Lil Jon brought his trademark boisterousness to the DNC during Georgia’s roll call, briefly performing his smash collaboration with DJ Snake, “Turn Down For What.” Sheila E. and John Legend Honor Prince Source: Myung J. Chun / Getty To coincide with Harris’ running-mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the DNC incorporated a tribute to Minnesota’s favorite song, the late, great Prince. Performing a medley of the legendary singer/songwriter, the DNC featured a Prince medley performed by John Legend and long-time Prince collaborator, percussionist Sheila E. The highlight of the medley was their rendition of “Let’s Go Crazy,” featuring a blistering guitar solo from Ariel “Ari” O’Neal. The Maryland native previously played for Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande. Stevie Wonder Elevated DNC to a the Highest Ground Source: Myung J. Chun / Getty In a moment people will talk about for a long time to come, the national treasure who is Stevie Wonder got everyone up onto a higher ground before he even sung a note. He began by endorsing Harris and calling for peace for the country and “courage over complacency,” and then he took us to the sky with his legendary song, “Higher Ground.” And there’s nothing else to say–except we soared. We soared far up into the clearest sky. And Patti LaBelle Called Our Loved Ones into the Room Source: Justin Sullivan / Getty And still, with all the many triumphant musical moments at the DNC, the power of what was done was the way they chose to honor the breadth of our emotions, and it would be difficult to imagine anyone but Ms. Patti LaBelle doing it better. In a poignant and deeply moving performance of “You Are My Friend,” LaBelle tributed beloveds of ours who had passed away since the 2020 DNC. Behind her we saw images of so many, including the once-in-a-generation actor, Chadwick Boseman, Calvin O. Butts, III, who’d been the cherished senior pastor of Harlem’s world-renowned Abyssinian Baptist Church and defining feminist, theorist, professor and author, bell hooks.

Harris focused on universal themes like the ‘politics of joy,’ ‘patriotism,’ and her life’s story, but there were very few specific policy proposals that voters could react to. ‘Even a casual observer couldn’t help but notice that there was very little in Vice President Harris’ speech that added up to an agenda for the United States or even policy prescriptions,’ wrote Democratic campaign consultant Doug Schoen in an op-ed after the speech. Schoen noted that throughout the convention, Democrats failed to offer key solutions to critical issues like inflation , the cost of living , immigration, and crime . ‘There wasn’t enough substance offered to build a significant contrast to former President Trump,’ he wrote. Harris spent part of her speech trying to identify with the American electorate, speaking of growing up as a middle class kid in a home with a budget and shared fond memories of her family and her mother. Republican CNN commentator Scott Jennings also pointed out Harris’ failure to talk about her record as vice president and what she would do differently. ‘How far can she run away from Joe Biden to prevent the Republicans from portraying her as the incumbent and then firing her as the incumbent?’ he asked. CNN’s Gary Tuchman spoke with eight different undecided voters from Allentown, Pennsylvania who gave the speech positive ratings for her delivery. But several voters said Harris failed to go into detail about her plans to fix the country and deal with critical issues facing the country. ‘She didn’t go in depth,’ one voter said, and added he wanted ‘a little bit more information on some of the things she planned on doing,’ would have been better. ‘She wasn’t clear enough on the policies,’ another voter said. ‘I still don’t feel like she’s ready.’ But the speech appeared to have won hearts and minds from some of the people watching. Six of the eight undecided voters said they would support Harris, with one concluding he would be voting for Trump and another voter saying she did not plan to vote. Undecided voters who spoke to the New York Times also gave the speech high marks, but pointed out the missing policy details. “I want some concrete answers and some substance in those debates,” schoolteacher Sharon Reed from Pennsylvania said. “I don’t know if I’m going to get either.’ The Washington Post columnist Matt Bai also praised the speech, but also pointed out the lack of policy. ‘I thought the economic section, which matters, felt dutiful and squishy. Wanting to build the middle class is not an agenda,’ he said. ‘But that’s a small complaint.’ Bai criticized Harris for not mentioning the issue of inflation. ‘I was playing the “inflation” drinking game. And I’ve been stone cold sober all week,’ he said. Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Can they make an impact?","text":"When U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night, she highlighted an issue that dominated the party’s convention this week: the reality millions of women face without access to abortion. Each day of the convention, audiences inside Chicago’s United Center and watching from home heard harrowing stories from women who faced the prospect of carrying their rapist’s child to term, nearly dying from a miscarriage at home after being denied medical treatment, and almost losing their ability to get pregnant when they chose to be. Harris said she’s heard similar stories from women, as well as their husbands and fathers, across the country in the two years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which led to abortion bans and restrictions in more than half of all U.S. states. And she warned that Donald Trump and the Republican Party won’t stop there. “This is what’s happening in our country,” she said Thursday. “And understand: he’s not done.” Abortion access was set to be a key election issue well before Harris, an outspoken advocate for reproductive rights and women’s health, replaced U.S. President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. But Democrats are betting it will gain even more attention under Harris, who leads Trump on abortion by 27 points among voters, according to an early August poll by Ipsos. They’re also hoping that wide margin will overcome the leads Trump has over Harris on the economy and immigration. Nine states will also have measures on their ballot in November that will ask voters whether they want to protect access to abortion. Some of those states have enacted new laws since Roe v. Wade was overturned that restrict access during the earliest stages of pregnancy, which would be nullified if voters approve those measures. The complicated legal minefield created by handing the issue of abortion back to the states — which Trump has called a “beautiful thing” — set the stage for women to share their stories at the convention this week. On Monday, Kentucky activist Hadley Duvall recalled how she became pregnant at age 12 after being raped by her stepfather. She was able to have an abortion at the time, but Kentucky has since enacted an abortion ban that does not include exceptions for rape or incest. “I can’t imagine not having a choice,” Duvall, who’s now in her early 20s, said, adding that Trump was to blame by appointing the Supreme Court justices who grew the conservative majority. “He calls it ‘a beautiful thing.’ What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent’s child?” Monday’s audience also heard from Amanda Zurawski, who described being denied an abortion in Texas after her water broke at 18 weeks, and Kaitlyn Joshua, who told of being denied miscarriage care in Louisiana. All three women spoke in front of stark black backdrops. Zurawski and Florida woman Anya Cook, who spoke Thursday, spoke alongside their husbands, with Cook’s holding the couple’s infant daughter — underscoring the impact the health restrictions have on families. “Two years ago, a miscarriage nearly killed me,” Cook said. “I needed care, but my state’s abortion restrictions kept it from me. I miscarried in a bathroom. “I’ll never forget my husband’s face as he tried to stop the bleeding — trying to do what doctors should have been doing.” There were also moments of joy. Kate Cox, a Texas mother who made international headlines after suing the state and then travelling to another state for abortion care that doctors said she needed to ensure her fertility, announced during Tuesday’s celebratory roll-call for Harris that she’s pregnant again. “There’s nothing pro-family about abortion bans,” she said as she helped pledge Texas’s delegates to Harris. Advocates for women’s reproductive and sexual health say the stories heard at the convention can make an impact outside of U.S. politics. “Those stories are a window into understanding the humanity behind a topic that often is used to separate us,” said Debbie Owusu-Akyeeah, co-director of policy and advocacy at Action Canada for Sexual Health & Rights. Owusu-Akyeeah singled out Duvall in particular for “being brave enough to go on stage and tell that story.” “There was just something about that bravery that I thought was super important and beautiful,” she said. Democratic lawmakers also shared their own stories of being able to choose when to start a family, or the difficulty they faced with infertility treatments. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who became the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office in 2018, said in her convention remarks that she was only able to conceive her daughters through in vitro fertilization (IVF). During his speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also reiterated his now well-known story of how he and his wife needed fertility treatments to conceive their daughter Hope. Democrats have warned that Republicans will seek to ban access to IVF after an Alabama Supreme Court decision in February temporarily blocked the treatment, and GOP lawmakers voted against an effort to enshrine access into law. The current and former presidents of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson and Cecile Richards, respectively, spoke at the convention Wednesday about the importance of voting for abortion access, as did Mini Timmaraju, CEO and president of Reproductive Freedom for All. So did surprise guest Oprah Winfrey, who touched on reproductive rights during her speech. “If you do not have autonomy over this,” she said, gesturing toward her body, “if you cannot control when and how you choose to bring your children into this world and how they are raised and supported, there is no American dream.” Democrats repeatedly warned that Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law “with or without Congress,” something Trump has denied. But the Project 2025 policy document that has been tied to his campaign and members of his past administration suggests such measures as banning or limiting the availability of abortion medication, increased data collection on abortions from states and an “unapologetically pro-life” co-ordinator of women’s health initiatives in the U.S. government. “Simply put, they are out of their minds,” Harris said Thursday night, vowing to sign a bill that restores abortion access nationally. “We trust women.” While the stories heard at the convention may affect votes in the U.S., Owusu-Akyeeah said the impact will go beyond America’s borders. “I hope this will be a reminder for many Canadians who are thinking about what this all means for us, and (understanding that) access is still not 100 per cent guaranteed for everybody,” she said. “This is health care, and everyone should be able to access this and make decisions that impact their bodies, their health and their future.”","summary":"The Democratic National Convention heard personal stories from women who faced restrictions on reproductive care, which advocates say will resonate beyond U.S. voters.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10710856/dnc-abortion-womens-health-kamala-harris/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CP172954233-e1724450101950.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 23:01:51","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":254800390,"title":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. lambasts 'DNC-aligned mainstream media,' accuses them of engineering Harris' rise","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. lit into liberal \"media organs\" of the Democratic Party in his remarks suspending his campaign on Friday, accusing them of essentially colluding with the party to stifle him and create a veneer of popularity for nominee Kamala Harris. \"Over the course of more than a year … the DNC-aligned mainstream media networks maintained a near-perfect embargo on interviews with me,\" he said. \"During his 10-month presidential campaign in 1992, Ross Perot gave 34 interviews on mainstream networks. In contrast, during the 16 months since I declared, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and CNN combined gave only two live interviews [with] me. Those networks instead ran a continuous deluge of hit pieces with inaccurate, often vile pejoratives and defamatory smears. Some of those same networks colluded with the DNC to keep me off the debate stage.\" Kennedy, the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated, also said his famous Democratic family members would have been \"astonished\" to learn Harris had not done a single interview or \"unscripted encounter with voters\" in the nearly five weeks she's been leading the party. \"This is profoundly undemocratic. How are people to choose when they don’t know whom they are choosing, and how can this look to the rest of the world?\" he asked. \"My father and my uncle were always conscious of America’s image abroad, because of our nation’s role as the template for democracy, a role model for democratic processes, and the leader of the free world. Instead of showing us her substance and character, the DNC and its media organs engineered a surge of popularity for Vice President Harris based upon, well, nothing. \"No policies, no interviews, no debates, only smoke and mirrors and balloons in a highly produced Chicago circus.\" TRUMP THANKS RFK JR FOR ENDORSEMENT AFTER THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE SUSPENDS HIS CAMPAIGN: 'THAT'S BIG' Harris rapidly ascended to the Democratic nomination after President Biden, under intense pressure from party leaders, stepped aside from the 2024 race last month and endorsed his vice president. The party coalesced quickly around Harris, who formally accepted the nomination on Thursday. Kennedy launched his long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in April of last year, but by October the 70-year-old candidate had switched to an independent run for the White House. Kennedy scolded press members at his speech to consider their \"really sacred responsibility\" to challenge the party in power, which he accused of systematically keeping him from fairly challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination. Kennedy also lambasted his former political party as one that \"abandoned democracy\" and was now a party of \"war, censorship, corruption\" and major pharmaceutical and tech companies. WEEKS AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, PELOSI COMPARES 'THREAT' OF TRUMP TO REVOLUTIONARY, CIVIL WAR \"In an honest system, I believe that I would have won the election,\" he said. \"I no longer believe that I have a realistic past of electoral victory in the face of this relentless, systematic censorship and media control.\" Spokespersons for ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Kennedy's accusations that they colluded against them. DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION FEATURES CNN, MSNBC FIGURES IN PLUM SPEAKING ROLES Kennedy specifically addressed representatives of their outlets who were on hand for his comments. \"Your institutions have made themselves government mouthpieces and stenographers for the organs of power. You didn’t alone cause the devolution of American democracy, but you could have prevented it,\" Kennedy said. Kennedy has sunk in the polls from the double digits earlier this summer to an average of around 4 percent in recent surveys. Whether his backing of Trump will provide a boon to the Republican ticket remains to be seen, but even a gain of one or two percentage points could be decisive in battleground states. Trump welcomed the endorsement while speaking Friday in Las Vegas, thanking Kennedy and calling him \"respected by everybody.\" The DNC was unconcerned, telling Fox News Digital, \"Good riddance.\" Asked for comment, the Harris campaign said that any American who was tired of Trump and \"looking for a new way forward\" could come to her team.

The Democratic presidential nominee took part in the music game Track Star, where she had to guess a song by a few seconds of its instrumental, winning money for each correct answer. Harris easily identified a song from Stevie Wonder, whom she called “one of the greatest musicians who ever lived. […] He’s a lyricist, he’s a poet, he’s very active on social justice issues and he’s actually a friend.” Harris also admitted that because of her schedule lately, gearing up for the presidential elections, “this is probably the most music I’ve listened to in a long time.” She continued, “Both of my parents loved music. It was part of my childhood. We would go to sleep with them playing music all the time.” She concluded by noting that the song everyone should know is Roy Ayers Ubiquity’s 1976 hit, “Everybody Loves the Sunshine.” She admitted, “It’s one of my favorite songs.” Harris recently sat down with her Vice President selection, Tim Walz, for a wide-ranging discussion, where they brought up the music that shaped their lives. For Walz, it started with Bruce Springsteen’s 1980 album The River, which he called a “transformational piece of music” for him. He also shared his love for Bob Seger. “My first car, it was the summer of 1980 and I’d been saving up. I buy a 1973 orange Chevy Camaro,” he recalled. “Got an eight-track player in it. The previous owner left Bob Seger’s Night Moves in there. I listened to it, and it’s kind of the soundtrack of my life. […] What’s really great about it is I’ve got a ’79 international that’s my car and it’s got an eight-track player in it. I have the very eight-track to this day.” Harris added that while Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Miles Davis and John Coltrane were main fixtures within her family home, one of her “personal favorite musicians” is Minnesota’s own Prince. “My husband Doug and I — I’m more of a hip-hop girl, and he’s more Depeche Mode,” she shared. “However, in the Venn diagram of things, Prince he and I love the same. Talk about how Prince was with that guitar, man. I almost know by heart every one of those songs.”","summary":"\"Both of my parents loved music.

John Maa San Francisco Trump would take what Biden has given Re: “Harris economy would worsen inflation rate” (Page A6, Aug. 20). Ed Kahl from Woodside is already crying wolf regarding inflation under a Harris presidency. He believes that Joe Biden’s administration is the reason for our inflation. Ed apparently forgot about COVID and the global supply shortages that were caused by it. I never read that Ed complained about Donald Trump calling the pandemic a hoax and that it would “just go away,” but he’s now complaining about inflation that has been decreasing slowly but still decreasing. Inflation in the United States is high, but it’s higher around the world in other democratic countries. The government gave millions of Americans a hand during the pandemic. That helped many Americans. The other hand (that of Trump) will take any money given to the middle class by the government and give it to his rich friends. The government gives with one hand and the other takes it away, right?

Paul Rosati San Jose Halloween displays are desensitizing us Today, as I drove to the post office, I noted the beginnings of a Halloween display in a nearby front yard. Has Halloween given us permission to publicly express a coarseness that never considers its deeper meaning? What do displays (butcher knives, severed heads, blood and gore) say about us?

His newly minted Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, had just accused him of groveling to dictators, imperiling democracy, betraying American values and, to top it off, deemed him “an unserious man.” So Trump picked up the telephone and called Fox News. The network quickly patched him in to its live coverage of the Democratic convention, and the former president proceeded to issue a meandering, stream-of-consciousness rebuttal. Several times, Fox anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum tried to interject to ask a question. Several times, Trump ignored them. “Mr. President, let me interrupt,” Baier pleaded at one point. Trump kept talking. The impromptu call-in — which lasted for 10 minutes, until Fox News informed Trump that the network had run out of time — came shortly after he had taken to his social media platform, Truth Social, to provide real-time commentary on Harris’ speech. His posts there, capitalized in a haphazard manner, were less directed at her specific remarks than at broader complaints about issues that Trump wants to keep the focus on: crime, immigration and the economy. At times, he digressed. “WHERE’S HUNTER?” Trump asked as Harris came onstage, reviving one of his favorite slogans about the son of President Joe Biden, who withdrew his candidacy weeks ago. At one point, referring to Harris, Trump asked, in all capital letters, “Is she talking about me?” (She was, often.) Trump also accused Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, of puffing up his resume as a leader of a high school football team. “Walz was an ASSISTANT Coach, not a COACH,” he wrote. A few minutes later, on Fox News, Trump argued that Harris had not accomplished much during her tenure as vice president. “All of these things that she talked about — ‘We are going to do this, we are going to do that, we are going to do everything’ — but she didn’t do any of it!” Trump said on the air, complaining that “she didn’t talk about China, she didn’t talk about fracking, she didn’t talk about crime.” His one concession? The Democrats’ convention hall. “It was a nice-looking room,” he said. When MacCallum observed, accurately, that Harris was “having some success” with women, Hispanic and Black voters, Trump objected. “She’s not having success; I’m having success,” he said. “I’m doing great with the Hispanic voters, doing great with Black men, I’m doing great with women.” “It’s only in your eyes that they have that, Martha,” he added. “We are doing very well.” At several points during the call, a familiar beeping sound interrupted Trump’s remarks. It appeared that the former president was accidentally pressing buttons on the keypad of his phone. Finally, while Trump was still midsentence, Baier moved to end the interview and thanked his guest for his time: “We appreciate that live feedback.” The network immediately shifted to an episode of its late-night comedy program, “Gutfeld!” The host, Greg Gutfeld, looked bemused. “That wasn’t my fault, Donald Trump,” he said, speaking to the president through the TV. “He’s still talking, by the way,” Gutfeld joked.

He's gone viral multiple times, especially with his catchphrase, \"Can I make you a dress?\"\"We make dresses for all kinds of moments for people,\" Ando-Hirsh said. \"This was so great because she's had other moments in the past, but this was a really, really big moment for her.

Her style is sometimes called eclectic or eccentric. On the first night of the convention, Emhoff wore a white tank top that showed off her tattoos and a camo \"Harris-Walz\" baseball cap. On Tuesday, she switched it up with a blue plaid suit, and on Wednesday, Emhoff wore a blazer overtop a sweater that had the United States flag sewn into it.\"I thought all of her choices were really interesting in the past,\" Ando-Hirsh said. \"She has a really vibrant appreciation and nice taste for.\"The two were connected through a mutual friend, Ando-Hirsh said.\"We both have been aware of each other's work for a while,\" Ando-Hirsh said.Ando-Hirsh said Emhoff could have taken a lot of different routes for her DNC dress, especially since big-name brands are \"trying to dress people for it.\" Emhoff, though, wanted to go with an independent designer.He brought her some design ideas, and they worked through them together. It took between 75 to 90 hours altogether, Ando-Hirsh said.\"It's a good amount of work,\" Ando-Hirsh said. \"I worked for the week straight.\"Ando-Hirsh went through the creative process, the patterning, the draping and problem-solving. He is known for his dresses with a lot of volume and tule.They picked out the fabrics together, as seen in a TikTok Ando-Hirsh shared. He called the choice \"dusty in a good way, in a really pretty way.\"The finished dress was modern and like an \"adult outfit that didn't feel too princessy or costumy,\" Ando-Hirsh said.And he only had about two weeks from that introduction to when Emhoff needed the dress. He posted a video of him looking wiped out, ready to ship off the dress.\"In the studio I'm at, I pump out dresses in three days sometimes,\" Ando-Hirsh joked. \"A week is actually super feasible.\"Even still, people took to social media to share how amazed they were with Emhoff's outfit. Commenters called it \"gorgeous,\" \"perfect\" and \"outstanding.\"\"My jaw dropped when I saw her dress because it's stunning and she looks incredible !!!\" TikTok user viennaskye commented on Ando-Hirsh's post.And there are potential plans for the two to collaborate again in the future.\"We're thinking about some stuff.

Kennedy, who belongs to one of the most-known American families in politics, said on Friday that he was dropping out because he did not see a “real path to the White House” for himself. “I promised the American people that I would withdraw from the race if I became a spoiler,” Kennedy said at a rally. “In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory in the face of this relentless, systematic censorship and media control.” As for his reasons for supporting Trump, Kennedy said it was the same as his reasons for leaving the Democratic party and running as an Independent. Free speech and Ukraine were among the reasons he cited more specifically. “We just had a very nice endorsement from RFK,” Trump said. “We’re going to be talking about that … great guy, respected by everybody,” Trump said. Polls suggest his exit will likely help Trump, who has slipped behind Vice President Kamala Harris in polls. Kennedy is the son of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former president John F. Kennedy. Kennedy’s long-shot campaign was beset with troubles from the start. His own family opposed it and relatives attacked him publicly and brutally. “It is a sad ending to a sad story,” they wrote in a statement after his announcement. The statement was signed by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Courtney, Kerry, Chris and Rory Kennedy, children of Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in California while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. Kennedy’s campaign appeared to be in even more trouble after reports said he had been in talks with the campaigns of former President Trump and Vice-President Harris.

The coalition filed suit Friday to halt the program launched by President Biden in June, saying in court filings that the administration bypassed Congress to create a pathway to citizenship for “blatant political purposes.” “This action incentivizes illegal immigration and will irreparably harm the Plaintiff states,” the suit filed in federal court in Tyler, Texas, says. Under the policy, which started taking applications Monday, many spouses without legal status can apply for something called “parole in place,” offering permission to stay in the U.S., apply for a green card and eventually get on a path to citizenship. But the program has been particularly contentious in an election year where immigration is one of the biggest issues, with many Republicans attacking the policy and contending it is essentially a form of amnesty for people who broke the law. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement Friday that the plan “violates the Constitution and actively worsens the illegal immigration disaster that is hurting Texas and our country.” The suit filed against the Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other Biden administration officials accuses the agency of attempting to parole spouses “en masse,” which the states contend is an abuse of power. The states also filed a motion asking for the program to be put on hold while the lawsuit proceeds. In a post on X, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said her state is challenging the parole in place policy because she believes the Biden administration “is illegally using ‘parole’ in a systematic way to advance their open-borders agenda.” The conservative nonprofit America First Legal, which is headed by Stephen Miller, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, is serving as co-counsel in the lawsuit. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Mayra Alejandra said the agency will defend the Keeping Families Together program in court and continues to process already submitted applications as well as accept new applications. “Keeping Families Together is grounded in well-established legal authority, and its purpose – enabling the families of U.S. Citizens to live without fear of separation – is consistent with fundamental American values,” Alejandra said. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández fired back against Republicans “playing politics” and characterized the lawsuit as another form of family separation. “This lawsuit is seeking to force U.S. citizens and their families, people who have lived in the United States for more than ten years, to continue to live in the shadows,” Fernandez said in a statement. The bipartisan immigration and criminal justice organization FWD.us said the program is in compliance with the law and noted the timing of the lawsuit – as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for president. “The only motivation behind this lawsuit is the cruelty of tearing families apart and the crass politics of hoping a judge might do the bidding of the anti-immigrant movement,” the organization said in a statement. Karen Tumlin, founder and director of the Justice Action Center, called the legal challenge “unsurprising yet extremely disappointing and cruel.” “However, it’s important to emphasize that nothing changes for now, and the process is still open and accepting applications,” she said. To be eligible for the program, immigrants must have lived continuously in the U.S. for at least 10 years, not pose a security threat or have a disqualifying criminal history, and have been married to a citizen by June 17 – the day before the program was announced. They must pay a $580 fee to apply and fill out a lengthy application, including an explanation of why they deserve humanitarian parole and a long list of supporting documents proving how long they have been in the country. If approved, applicants have three years to seek permanent residency. During that period, they can get work authorization. The administration estimates about 500,000 people could be eligible, plus about 50,000 of their children. Before this program, it was complicated for people who were in the U.S. illegally to get a green card after marrying an American citizen. They can be required to return to their home country – often for years – and they always face the risk they may not be allowed back in. The lawsuit contends that states will bear the burden of additional immigrants staying in the country. Texas, the suit says, spends tens of millions of dollars each year on a program that provides health insurance for children, including those in the country illegally. It says that the state also spends millions each year “for increased law enforcement as its citizens suffer increased crime, unemployment, environmental harm, and social disorder due to illegal immigration.” Because the program beneficiaries will be entitled to work authorization, those additional workers “will drive down the wages of Texas residents, directly harming the State and its citizens,” the lawsuit says. Evelyn Wiese, an immigration attorney at American Immigrant Justice, described the lawsuit as an “attack” on mixed status families who have spent years contributing to their communities in the United States. “Trying to rip apart these families and prevent them from accessing a lawful pathway to status in the U.S. is cruel and reflective of anti-immigrant extremism,” she said.

Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear.” “It is a sad ending to a sad story,” they added. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he was suspending his independent campaign and would remove his name from the ballot in swing states like Pennsylvania and Arizona. His name will remain on the ballot in states that are solidly Democratic or Republican. He also announced that he was endorsing Trump, a move that had been expected for much of the week. On Wednesday, Kennedy announced he would address the nation Friday about the future of his candidacy. During his Friday address, Kennedy spent most of his time blasting Democrats and the media for “not giving him a fair shake.” “In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory in the face of this relentless, systematic censorship and media control,” he said during Friday’s press conference. “So I cannot in good conscience ask my staff and volunteers to keep working their long hours, or ask my donor to keep giving when I cannot honestly, tell them, that I have a real path to the White House.” Since Wednesday, Kennedy has moved to remove his name from the Arizona and Pennsylvania ballots, and sources close to Kennedy indicated that he is negotiating with the Trump campaign for a spot in the potential second Trump administration. Kerry Kennedy, who leads the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, wrote the statement alongside four siblings — Courtney Kennedy, Chris Kennedy, Rory Kennedy and former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (D). RFK Jr. is the third-eldest child of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The Kennedy family has been a mainstay of the Democratic Party since John F. Kennedy became president. The family has regularly dismissed RFK Jr.’s Independent candidacy since he first launched his presidential bid last year. Before he launched his campaign for president, family members also penned a column denouncing his anti-vaccination positions during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment. Today’s announcement is deeply saddening for us. We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country,” some of Kennedy’s siblings wrote last year. After he dropped out, other members of the Kennedy family also weighed in. “Never been less surprised in my life. Been saying it for over a year — RFKjr is for sale, works for Trump. Bedfellows and loving it,” Jack Schlossberg, former President Kennedy’s grandson who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, wrote on social platform X. “Kamala Harris is for the people — the easiest decision of all time just got easier.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(The Hill) — Members of Robert F.

Tuesday’s damning Homeland Security Inspector General report revealed that 32,000 migrant kids failed to show up for court dates between 2019 and 2023, and the number of kids in the wind could be much higher, since 291,000 never got a notice to appear in the first place. That’s more than 300,000 kids the feds aren’t keeping track of — children who could very well be in danger: The IG report warned that unaccompanied children “who do not appear for court are considered at higher risk for trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor.” And by failing to issue notices to appear, “ICE limits its chances of having contact with [unaccompanied children] when they are released from [Department of Health and Human Services’] custody, which reduces opportunities to verify their safety.” To top it all off, “ICE did not always inform” HHS when migrant kids “failed to appear in immigration court after release from HHS’ custody.” So not only do the feds not know where these kids are, the proper authorities sometimes don’t even know they’re missing — in part, the report says, because “ICE does not have an automated process for sharing information.” ICE is overwhelmed with the sheer number of unaccompanied migrant kids who’ve flooded into the country — 113,000 in 2023 alone — since Biden threw the border open on Day 1 of his presidency. Democrats and their press lapdogs are quiet about this crisis of lost kids; a far cry from the Trump years, when the media blared the news that HHS failed to confirm the whereabouts of about 1,500 kids over a three-month period in 2018. Those weren’t failures to appear in court, but cases where HHS reached out to the children or their sponsors by phone or message and didn’t make. In total, there were 54,000 of those cases over three years under Trump; there were 85,000 cases in just two years under Biden. The left doesn’t want to admit the obvious: A weaker border means more unaccompanied migrant children, which means more kids slipping through the cracks of a strained system. Border czar Kamala Harris hasn’t said word one about changing any of the Biden border policies, only claimed that she’s somehow “tough.” So a vote for Harris is a vote for putting tens of thousands of already vulnerable kids in more danger.","summary":"A damning report from the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General released Tuesday revealed that 32,000 migrant kids failed to show up for court dates between 2019 and 2023.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/23/opinion/the-biden-administration-is-losing-migrant-kids-and-the-media-are-silent/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-2sde260f0-1724452608150.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724438248&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:42:37","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.795},{"id":254800332,"title":"How much momentum will RFK Jr.'s endorsement give Trump?","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Friday that he had suspended his campaign for the presidency and endorsed former President Donald Trump (though he said he will remain on the ballot in states that are not competitive at the presidential level). Kennedy's bid failed to garner enough support to contend in any state, and support for him in national polls fell by nearly half after President Joe Biden dropped out of the running to be the Democratic Party's nominee. Our analysis of the polling data suggests Kennedy's endorsement of Trump will have a minimal impact on the race. Kennedy, who has consistently polled around 5 percent since Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee, was drawing roughly equally from both Trump and Harris, with that support coming from both traditionally Democratic and traditionally Republican groups. His endorsement of Trump may marginally help the Republican among white, male, and older voters. But the effect of his departure on overall support for either candidate will be small. Kennedy's candidacy has a small effect on our polling averages So where will Kennedy's voters go? There are a few ways to calculate a guess. The most straightforward method is to calculate an average of support for Harris and Trump using only the polls that allow voters to express support for Kennedy, and then compare those results to their average support in polls that do not include Kennedy as a response option. This allows us to guess where his voters might be going if they're forced to pick other options. 538's national presidential polling average is doing similar math when combining polls with different response options, so we can extract an estimated effect from the aggregation model as a first guess. Our model tells us that support for Harris is 1.3 percentage points higher in polls testing support only for Harris and Trump than in polls where Kennedy is included. In comparison, Trump's support is 1.5 percentage points higher in two-way polls than when voters get the third-party option. Adding it up, this suggests that Kennedy's presence in the race is drawing slightly more support away from Trump and increasing Harris's margin by about 0.2 percentage points on average across the states. To put that in context, the daily absolute change in 538's margin for Harris in our national polling average is, on average, 0.21 percentage points. In other words, the direct effect of Kennedy dropping out, according to polling toplines alone, is about the same as the amount that polls tend to fluctuate based on the average day's news or campaigning. With Kennedy gone, heavily partisan groups will repolarize Another way to guess who Kennedy is pulling more votes from is to look at voting patterns at the demographic level and compare results poll-by-poll instead of inferring aggregate trends (which is what our polling average does). To do this, we collected all of the Harris-Trump polls that have been conducted since July 21 and included both two-way and multiple-candidate questions on presidential support. Then, we aggregated support for each candidate at the demographic group level using the published crosstabs for these polls, where available, and looked at how the margin between Harris and Trump differed within each of these groups when Kennedy was or was not included in the question.* (To be clear, this is not the same as our topline polling average: No fancy modeling has been applied to this data, just a simple average of all the polls.) When Kennedy is absent from surveys, support for Harris rises most among Asian, Black and Hispanic voters,** as well as with nonwhite voters without college degrees and young voters. Trump, meanwhile, consolidates support with men, white and rural voters, and voters over 30. That means Trump is best situated to capitalize on Kennedy's endorsement among the groups already friendliest to both of them. For the most part, however, Kennedy is drawing few votes from either candidate and, once again, the effect of his withdrawal on the race is likely to be small. Harris's margin over Trump changes by less than two percentage points in 16 out of the 18 groups we considered, and by less than one percentage point in more than a third. In fact, the most notable trend in our demographic-level analysis is a repolarization of solid Democratic and Republican groups; that is, without Kennedy on the ballot, Harris tends to gain among groups that are typically solidly Democratic, while Trump does better with key Republican demographics. But vote intention among the more swingy groups — suburbanites, college-educated nonwhites, and women — changes little. Exit this way While running for president, Kennedy was often discussed in terms of whether he would be a spoiler candidate for either Trump or Biden/Harris. This was a distinct possibility: As of Aug. 23 at 6:30 p.m. Eastern, our election forecast for Trump and Harris gives Kennedy a 0-in-100 chance of winning the majority of Electoral College votes, but a 40-in-100 chance of third-party candidates winning more votes in any decisive state than the margin between Harris and Trump in that state. With Kennedy's exit likely to lower those odds, that's a big reason Trump is likely glad to have Kennedy's support, even if he doesn't bring many votes to the table. When Ross Perot bowed out of the 1992 presidential race (before later reentering it), he said he did not want to send the election to the House of Representatives by siphoning off enough electoral votes to prevent any candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority. And while Kennedy also specified in his announcement Friday that he is withdrawing his name in battleground states where he might prove to be a spoiler, he struck a different (and, to be clear, not very realistic) tune by technically remaining in the race. \"I encourage you to vote for me,\" he said, specifying that his name will appear on the ballot in most states. \"And if enough of you do vote for me, and neither of the major-party candidates win 270 [electoral] votes, which is quite possible … I could conceivably still end up in the White House in a contingent election.\" In order to be eligible to be elected president by the House, however, Kennedy would need to win at least one Electoral College vote from a state's slate of presidential electors. That is likely an overly optimistic forecast (following an overly optimistic campaign). Toward the end of his press conference, Kennedy officially threw his support behind Trump. That may reflect a more prescient prediction of where his future in American politics lies. Footnotes *When pollsters released results among different populations, we preferred polls of likely voters over those of registered voters and registered voters over all adults. When a pollster released multiple different multi-candidate matchups, we included the matchup with the largest candidate field when calculating the margin including Kennedy. We included all national polls conducted after July 21 and released by Aug. 22 at 11:59pm. **Some pollsters include a \"Hispanic\" demographic group in their crosstabs, and others include a \"Latino\" group. We included both categories in the Hispanic/Latino averages.","summary":"Polls show Robert F.

Tim Walz to accept their party’s nomination as president and vice president of the United States. It turned into an all-out political festival filled with powerful speeches, surprise performances and touching moments that brought all Americans — no matter race, gender or creed — together by the tens of millions The DNC kicked off on Monday and wrapped Thursday. It was a full house in Chicago, with what looked like all 23,500 seats in the Windy City’s United Center completely filled. Couples, parents with young children, students, celebs and large face cutouts of Harris and Walz could be seen from every view of the room. And while a falsely reported Beyoncé performance of “Freedom,” Harris’ main campaign number, would have been a nice cherry on top, the event was lively from start to finish, and that’s why it captivated everyone who tuned in. This DNC is better than any award show in the last 5 years— Wilma M. Holla ✨ (@LetAnthonyRock) August 23, 2024 In short: the DNC was just one hell of a good time, and there were key moments that made it so. Take a look at the best viral moments from the 2024 DNC. 1. Jesse Jackson gets a standing ovation On the first night of the convention, Rev. Jesse Jackson, 82, received a standing ovation when he appeared on stage. The moment marked 40 years since Jackson ran his presidential campaign in 1984, seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination. He lost to Walter Mondale, who was ultimately defeated by Republican contender Ronald Reagan. 2. Parents of Hamas hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin take the stage Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, the parents of Hamas hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, took the stage to call for the immediate return of their son, and pushed for a cease-fire deal in one of the conventions most rivetingly emotional speeches. 3. Chuck Schumer dances it out U.S. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gained a lot of attention from folks during the DNC, but it wasn’t because of his remarks at the podium — it was how he paraded to it. Before he gave his speech, he showed off some of his moves. For whatever reason, the moment went viral and late night hosts haven’t been able to stop laughing about it. 4. Lil Jon goes from the window to the Walz One of the most exciting moments from the convention was one no one anticipated. During the 50 states’ roll call, the city of Atlanta, Georgia brought out iconic record producer and rapper Lil Jon, who did a performance of his hit track “Turn Down for What.” 5. Tim Walz’s son, Gus Walz, breaks down in tears This moment speaks for itself, and showcases vice presidential nominee Tim Walz as the family man he is. 6. Hillary Clinton relishes chants of “lock him up!” against Trump After bringing up former President Donald Trump’s 34 felony charges, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton inspired chants of “lock him up!” in the arena, echoing the Trump and his supporters’ 2016 threats to imprison Clinton. 7. Kamala Harris’ nieces teach the world how to pronounce her name One of the cutest moments from the convention, whilst also a very serious matter, was the appearance of Harris’ grandnieces. With the help of actress Kerry Washington, the three guided the audience through how to pronounce Harris’ first name. The teaching lesson came after Trump and members of the GOP have consistently mispronounced her name. 8. Michelle Obama reads Trump for his “Black jobs” comments During former First Lady Michelle Obama’s speech, she called out Trump’s repeated use of the term “Black jobs,” as well as the former president’s history of attacking the Obamas. 9. D.L. Hughley apologizes for spreading lies about Kamala Harris Actor and comedian D.L. Hughley took the stage, not just to encourage the support of Harris, but to also apologize to her for previously spreading misinformation about her history in politics. 10. Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn share a “Scandal” reunion Last but not least, “Scandal” fans were falling over in their seats when they saw Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn take the stage together and ask the crowd for a group selfie.","summary":"The ratings blowout event came to us live from Chicago this week with the Obamas, Kamala Harris and Coach Tim Walz\n\n\nThe post The 10 Best 2024 DNC Moments, From Tim Walz&#8217;s Son to That &#8216;Scandal&#8217; Reunion | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/dnc-best-viral-moments-2024/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rump-18.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:33:41","author":"Raquel 'rocky' Harris","authors":["Raquel 'rocky' Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.152},{"id":254799048,"title":"Ella Emhoff, the stylish stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, proudly displays her collection of ‘at least 18’ tattoos on Instagram. Her unique ink features playful designs like apples, crab claws, and a cartoon cow.","text":"Kamala Harris’s stepdaughter has for years now been cementing her status as not just a model, but a certified It-Girl with a chic sense of style, knitting habit and lots of body ink. In a New York Times interview a few years ago, Ella Emhoff, 25 – whose father is ‘first gentleman’ dad Doug Emhoff, 59 – revealed she had ‘maybe around 18’ tattoos, including some she she did herself during the Covid lockdowns – some of which her parents ‘may not know about’. Some of the designs – which are always flaunted on Instagram. where Ella has more than 387,00 followers – featured are a cow, a quirky crab claw holding a gemstone, and two teddy-bears walking alongside one another. Others include a rendition of Donald Duck, some cartoony apples and a flower, whereas a handful are not as visible or clear to make out. They are sweet and wholesome in nature, to match Ella’s trendy but cozy aesthetic, marked by Crocs, crochet clothing, bucket hats and minimal make-up. This week, many of the designs on display as Ella showed support for her family at the first night of the Democratic National Convention, accentuated by her ensemble; a plain white T-shirt that she tucked into a pair of matching dress pants. And later, she took the stage Thursday ahead of her stepmom or ‘Momala’ for a touching tribute and to rally support. Ella was all smiles as she was joined on stage by the vice president’s niece Meena Harris as well as her goddaughter Helena Hudlin. Their appearance comes on the fourth night of the convention as the Democratic party introduces Harris to the American people as their presidential nominee before she formally accepts the presidential nomination. They called the 59-year-old vice president who they know on a personal level an ‘extraordinary woman.’ ‘Kamala came into my life when I was fourteen, famously a very easy time for a teenager,’ Ella said. ‘Like a lot of young people, I didn’t always understand what I was feeling, but no matter what, Kamala was there.’ ‘She was patient, caring and always took me seriously. She never stopped listening to me, and she’s not going to stop listening to all of us.’ The tattooed Ella, with slicked back hair and attired in a white and ice blue off-the-shoulder dress designed especially for the occasion by Joe Ando ignited the internet with her appearance on the convention stage. Ella, who is known for her knitting, crocheted the flower on her dress’ sleeve herself, Joe revealed. Here, FEMAIL takes a closer look at the fashionista’s body art and what the meaning behind them is… COW Almost always visible, on Ella’s left arm is a sweet cartoonish cow, tattooed right above the elbow. The design is also partially coloured-in, with black spots for the hide and a pink udder. She is understood to have had the tattoo since at least 2020. BABY ANIMAL On her right arm – along the bicep – Ella has what appears to be a baby calf, lamb or deer. The adorable design, which is more realistic in nature than her others, is perched on the opposite side to the cow. CUSTOM ANIMATED DESIGN Ella’s right arm features a quirky design of a cartoon character emerging – seemingly from her flesh – and shooting either pills or water drops at a pot of flowers. The fun little caricature is also wearing a bat or cat-ear-esque costume. CRAB CLAW WITH GEMSTONE One of the designs on Ella’s body includes a crab claw holding onto a gemstone. The playful tattoo takes up quite a bit of space on the bicep, and includes incredible pattern work. On her Instagram, Ella was full of praise for the artist, Emile Bernardo, adding they ‘deserve an Oscar’. APPLES One of Ella’s most colorful tattoos is a set of apples against the background of sunny blue skies and green grass. Of the four apples pictured, one is eaten to the core while the other has had a bite taken out of it. Tattoo artist Cole (@cruelbarb) took their social media to thank the model for ‘getting a cool one’. WOMAN BUTTERFLY WINGS Ella ‘s left arm also includes a tattoo of a woman with butterfly wings. The masterfully inked design pictures a naked woman covering herself as she hugs her torso. FLOWER POT Clearly a fan of all things floral, Ella has a number of tattoos which illustrate plants. However, this sweet one of a flower pot is arguably one of the more simple – and adorable – selections. LAVENDER Ella’s left arm features a custom lavender, inked by artist Lexi Stahr. The coloured-in piece has been filled in with green and purple hues. Known to allude to calming and soothing themes, it’s possible Ella’s tattoo is symbolic as well as aesthetic. VINE AROUND WRIST The 25-year-old’s left wrist is usually adorned with bracelets, but has also been joined by a permanent accessory. A chic thick vine design wraps itself all the way around – and serves as a cool contrast against the lavender flower. SMILEY BREAKFAST Although rarely spotted, one of Ella’s more playful photos is a joyful plate of breakfast. The fried eggs constitute the eyes, while a piece of bacon works as the mouth. Taking rise and shine to a new level! RABBIT One of Ella’s more tucked away tattoos is a leaping rabbit, who can be seen hopping away as they run. It is placed on her sternum, so is usually only visible in lowcut tops or when she wears a swimsuit. BABY While it’s rarely ever visible, a tattoo on the back of Ella’s right arm appears to show the outline of a cartoon baby. The design appears to be jovial, with the character smiling. BOO CAKE Ella’s tattoo artist for this fun cake – who is also called Ella – shared the design to their Instagram in 2020. ‘Colorful ‘boo’ cake bc it’s scary out there y’all,’ the caption read. ‘Made this for @ellaemhoff as part of an artists’ trade- she makes amazing knit garments check it out!!!’ Tattooist Ella was also the mastermind behind model Ella’s cow tattoo. TEDDY BEARS Tattooist Hazel inked Ella up with an adorable pair of teddy bears holding hands, which is placed on her legs. ‘Teddy bear lovee,’ they wrote in Instagram post in 2022. DONALD DUCK Vintage Disney tattoos are always a nostalgic classic, and this retro Donald Duck design is no exception. In the sweet image, the beloved character is holding onto flowers. The design is also coloured in with shades of blue, yellow and red to add a fun pop of vibrancy. VIOLET FLOWER Tattoo artist Lexi Stahr created a stunning violet flower design that runs along Ella’s right arm. In an Instagram post explaining the ink in a ‘nerd bonus’, Lexi wrote: ‘Artemis turned one of her nymphs into a violet to protect her from Apollo and keep her a maiden forever. ‘Thus the violet was created and became a famous symbol of modesty that is now joined by 500 plus species. It also is an exciting marker of the return of spring.’ LITTLE GIRL Tattoo artist Ricky Sunshine took to their Instagram in 2022, to share a fun design they’d inked on Ella’s left leg. It features a cartoon little girl walking around with a paintbrush, while the words ‘I love my friends’ are scrawled at the top. KME INITIALS It is not known or clear what it stands for, but Ella’s right hand features the initials KME on it. It may be a possible tribute to her mother – whose maiden name is Kerstin Mackin – but she still appears to professionally go by Emhoff. DOG One of Ella’s few leg tattoos appears to be the outline of a dog’s head, positioned right under her knee. The dog is facing in a side profile, and shows off some impressive line-drawing skills. CAR Another tattoo on Ella’s right leg – this time her thigh – is a lot flashier. A vintage car outline appears to take up most of the space. Once again, it is captured from a side profile, with minimal shading. LITTLE CIRCULAR DESIGN One of Ella’s arms contains a mysterious circular little design, right next to a calf tattoo. It’s unclear if the tattoo is more abstract in nature or is meant to fit into her general floral theme, perhaps as a fruit. SCATTERED LEG TATTOOS Over the years Ella has accrued a number of tattoos across her legs over the years – but some of them are not always visible or clear. This includes small circular designs around her knees and calves, all adding to the fun patchwork aesthetic of her body ink. Further up her thigh also shows off a hidden tattoo – which appears to be a checkered board and a little circle. RIBCAGE TATOO There also appears to be a delicate – but relatively spacious – tattoo along Ella’s right ribcage. However, it is not clear what the design could be. Followers of her Instagram page may sometimes get a glimpse of it if the model dons a cropped top or ensemble.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris&#8217;s stepdaughter has for years now been cementing her status as&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ella Emhoff, the stylish stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, proudly displays her collection of &#8216;at least 18&#8217; tattoos on Instagram.

We’ve tried to do these Wang Yi-Jake Sullivan touch points about once a quarter,” he said.“(The election) is always in the background in any engagement we have with foreign officials concerned about what comes next or what the transition will be like, but this meeting will be focused on the topics and the issues that we are dealing with,” the official added.Sullivan, during his visit, would push for a resumption of theatre-level military-to-military talks with China, and is also likely to raise the US’s concerns about China’s “increased military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taiwan.”Notably, China-US relations have been turbulent in recent years. The two countries have sparred over their economic ambitions, and incidents like the US downing of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year further inflamed tensions, Al Jazeera reported.Notably, this is the first visit by a US national security adviser since 2016, though other senior US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have visited China over the past two years.Sullivan’s visit comes within months of the US’s general election in November, in which Vice President Kamala Harris is running to succeed outgoing president Joe Biden.If she wins, Harris is expected to continue to seek dialogue with China while also maintaining pressure.

The lawsuit argues the program, which began accepting applications on Monday, oversteps the administration’s authority to provide relief to those without legal status and circumvents the intent of U.S. immigration laws. The initiative, called Keeping Families Together, provides a path to citizenship to an estimated 500,000 immigrant spouses who entered the U.S. illegally and have at least 10 years of residence. Without this option, many would need to leave the U.S. for years before being able to return legally. Republicans have made illegal immigration a central focus of the Nov. 5 presidential election where former President Donald Trump, a Republican, will face off against the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. America First Legal, an organization led by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, served as co-counsel in the lawsuit alongside Texas and 15 other states with Republican attorneys general. Miller, a driving force behind Trump’s restrictive policies during his 2017-2021 presidency, called the Biden program “brazenly unlawful” in a statement. Keeping Families Together also allows some 50,000 children under age 21 with a U.S.-citizen parent to obtain temporary “parole” status that creates a path to citizenship. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez said the Texas lawsuit aimed to separate families and “goes against our nation’s values.” Texas has repeatedly clashed with the Biden administration in court over immigration and border issues. A federal appeals court in July said Texas could keep a large floating barrier in the Rio Grande River intended to block migrants illegally crossing from Mexico.","summary":"Texas, Florida, and others sued President Joe Biden’s administration over a new immigration program for spouses of U.S. citizens.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate Nichole Shanahan expressed doubts about Donald Trump and said their campaign would never “sell out,” hours before RFK Jr. endorsed the former president. In an interview on the Adam Carolla Show that aired on Friday, Shanahan described the challenges the RFK campaign has had getting on the ballot in states like New York and tried to calm speculation they were about to endorse Trump, telling Carolla only RFK would make that announcement. “We would never sell out this campaign ever. It’s not what we would ever choose to do nor are we defeated in this moment, but I have to say something. We are up against something that is unprecedented,” she said. “My statement was that we are weighing our options of staying in or working however we can with a plan b to ensure that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do not end up in office in November,” she added, referring to comments on a different podcast where she described the campaign “looking at” endorsing Trump. Elsewhere in the interview, Shanahan described certain reservations about allying with Trump, including his record on Covid, including \"the vaccinations, the lockdowns letting Fauci and Francis Collins run the show, the firing of the other folks at the NIH and individuals at the CDC that were censored.\" \"There was a lot that happened under Donald Trump’s watch that should not have happened and cannot happen again,\" she said. Later that day, RFK Jr. did in fact endorse Trump, suspending his campaign and removing his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states. The decision was “agonizing”, Kennedy said, but he argued it aligned with his stances against Big Pharma and his belief a Trump administration would work to combat chronic disease. Other members of the Kennedy family, many of whom opposed RFK Jr.’s candidacy to begin with, condemned the endorsement. “Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear,” they said in a statement. “It is a sad ending to a sad story.” The Kennedy campaign was projected to get about five percent of the expected share of national votes, and it’s unclear how his supporters will impact the race going forward, given the tight margins between the two leading candidates.","summary":"RFK eventually threw support behind Trump, calling the decision ‘agonizing’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-trump-nicole-shanahan-b2601122.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/20/19/Screenshot-2024-08-20-at-2.08.49%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/WHDHqlFQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:30:16","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":254799666,"title":"MARSDEN: Kamala Harris has forgotten Canada","text":"David Marsden is a Calgary writer and editor. It’s often said an omission is worse than a lie. In other words, if you don’t reveal the complete truth, you are intentionally peddling a falsehood. That doesn’t speak well of an individual’s character.Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris did that Thursday in her stirring speech to close out the party’s convention in Chicago. She spoke passionately of her hardscrabble upbringing and moving around America as a young girl with her teacher mother, an immigrant from India.Harris never mentioned she spent many of her formative years in Canada. She arrived at age 12 in Quebec and graduated from high school in the province. So when Harris shared that a high school classmate revealed that she was being sexually abused, the conversation presumably happened in Canada.One of Harris’s Montreal schoolmates told the CBC that Harris changed her life.“When I was in high school, I was being molested by my stepfather, and Kamala and I were best friends. I shared the story with her, which is not always easy to do, to tell someone. And I was close with her.“I told her and she went home and told her mom, and her mom, she said, ‘she has to come stay with us.’ So I stayed with them for the latter part of the high school year.”Harris said Thursday that the emotional exchange persuaded her to pursue a career in law and bring offenders to justice — but again no mention of Canada.It’s clear that a candidate who characterizes her mother — who was a respected researcher focusing on breast cancer cures — as a teacher, is pandering to the lowest level of voter. If a person is truly proud of their past, they share it all, including their mother’s professional success and the time they spent in a foreign country.Perhaps that’s what politics does to a person. Democrats would rather rally around the daughter of poor immigrants, rather than someone who makes $284,600 a year and spent her early life in Canada. Harris talks a good talk, but has little in common with the average American she pretends to represent. They don’t fly around the world in a huge private jet while blathering about climate change. The average wage in the United States is shy of $64,000 a year, far short of the salary of the leader that is supposed to be one of them.But, of course, few people are interested in anything beyond their doorstep. They’d rather absorb Pollyanna rhetoric about freedom and a woman’s right to get an abortion, than hear the truth about a person’s past. Such soothing messages sell well with the electorate, so that’s what Democrats put on the shelf with tremendous flourish with their star-studded gala posing as a political convention.Her dismissal of Canada is reminiscent of the Canadian Caper, maybe better known as the theme of the 2012 movie Argo, starring Ben Affleck. After America granted asylum to the Shah of Iran in 1979, extremists attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, but six diplomats escaped and were given protection in the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor.Part of the ruse was to conduct an imaginary film and provide the embassy staff with Canadian passports. If you watch Argo, Canada plays a small role, even though Taylor is widely credited for his resourcefulness in support of an important ally in volatile circumstances.For the Americans, it’s all about America. There’s nothing wrong with that, but a true telling of the facts would be welcome.Harris, for instance, pointed out Thursday her government worked out a bipartisan bill to ensure border security in the south. It’s not wrong to say Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pressured his party’s representatives to oppose the deal, so the problem of illegal immigration would survive for the election. But she declared Thursday, she would sign the bill into law as president.If that wasn’t possible this year, how will that be possible next year?Harris also spoke about ensuring Israel has the right and means to defend itself. Then she said Palestine has the right to safety and security. Isn’t that the struggle that has plagued the region for decades?She said the president and herself have been working around the clock to secure a peace deal in the Middle East. That claim either speaks to the intransigence of the Mideast parties or the ineffectiveness of President Joe Biden and Harris.There’s little doubt Harris would be a preferable president for Canadians. Unlike Trump, she isn’t threatening to cut off malingering NATO allies such as Canada. She’s also a bridge-builder, not a knocker-downer like Trump.Still, she should tell the truth, and when she fails to mention her Canadian connection during the biggest speech of her life, it raises question about her character. Americans deserve a fulsome account, if she’s going to ride on her past, not someone who picks and chooses the facts.David Marsden is a Calgary writer and editor.","summary":"It’s often said an omission is worse than a lie.

He said in his announcing press conference Friday he believes he would’ve won the election “in an honest system.” However, Kennedy could still technically win the White House with a contingent election. Here’s what that means: If Kennedy receives at least one electoral vote and neither Vice President Kamala Harris nor former President Donald Trump reach 270 electoral votes, the presidential election will go to Congress to decide. House congressional delegations would vote for the president, and the Senate would vote for the vice president. Both would need to come to a majority vote to elect either. In that scenario, Republicans or Democrats could revolt against their candidate and vote for Kennedy, and he would only have to lobby a couple of hundred congressional members instead of millions of voters. What makes the situation more than improbable is that even if this tie does happen, more likely than not, Republicans, who lead in House delegations 26-22, would choose Trump. Two states are tied, Minnesota and North Carolina. For a tie to happen, Kennedy would need more than one electoral vote as well. He’d need at least two because a 269-269 tie gives no room for him to have a vote. That’d mean he’d either have to win two of the single-vote congressional districts in Maine or Nebraska or an entire state. Either of those scenarios would be close to impossible but still not technically impossible. The most likely impact of Kennedy’s campaign will be his withdrawal from all swing states. The public perception is that it will benefit Trump because Kennedy endorsed him, but it’s no guarantee. Trump’s campaign has already come out with their own numbers of how this will benefit them Even if it’s a swing of a point or two to Trump or Harris in these states, Kennedy can make a massive difference with his withdrawal.","summary":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F.

Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen announced Friday that the rival initiatives each gathered enough signatures to get on the November ballot, making Nebraska the first state to carry competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Nebraska also becomes the last of several states to put an abortion measure on the November ballot, including the swing states of Arizona and Nevada where abortion ballot measures could drive higher voter turnout. Others are Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana and South Dakota. New York has a measure that supporters say will effectively guarantee access, though it doesn’t mention abortion specifically. In Nebraska, organizers of the competing efforts announced last month that they turned in far more signatures than the approximately 123,000 required. One of the initiatives, like measures on ballots elsewhere in the U.S., would enshrine in the state constitution the right to have an abortion until viability or later to protect the health of the pregnant woman. Organizers said they submitted more than 207,000 signatures. The other measure would write into the constitution the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman. Organizers said they submitted more than 205,000 signatures. Evnen said his office validated more than 136,000 signatures for both proposals. Organizers of a third effort, which would have effectively banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy and defined embryos as people, did not submit petitions. It’s possible voters could end up approving both measures, but because they’re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most “for” votes will be the one adopted, Evnen said. Evnen’s office said that if both measures are approved by voters, Gov. Jim Pillen is responsible for determining whether there is a conflict. Asked if there is a scenario in which the Republican governor could order the measure that gets the lesser number of votes to be enshrined in the constitution, Evnen’s office said it didn’t see how that could occur, but added it could not speak for the governor. Asked the same question, Pillen’s office said it would not “comment on a hypothetical future legal issue,” but hedged on ensuring that the measure with the most votes would be written into the state constitution. “The overwhelming majority of Nebraskans support strong constitutional protections for the unborn, so the Governor expects only the pro-life initiative to prevail,” Laura Strimple, a spokeswoman for Pillen, said in an email to The Associated Press. “In any other scenario, the Governor will consult with the Attorney General as to his legal duties.” Most Republican-controlled states have implemented abortion bans of some sort since Roe was overturned, which ended 50 years of the right to abortion across the U.S. But abortion rights supporters have prevailed in all seven ballot questions on the issue that have gone before voters at the state level since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC survey that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don’t want to be pregnant for any reason. Fourteen states currently have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions; four ban it after about six weeks, which is before many women know they are pregnant. Nebraska and North Carolina are the only states that have opted for bans that kick in after 12 weeks of pregnancy. In Nebraska, abortion could play an outsize role in the Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District for both the U.S. House and presidential races. The House race — a rematch between Republican Rep. Don Bacon against Democratic challenger and state Sen. Tony Vargas — is widely regarded as neck-and-neck. Bacon defeated Vargas in 2022 by fewer than 3 percentage points, and Vargas has outraised him during this campaign with $300,000 more in cash on hand according to the latest campaign finance reports released last month. In the presidential election, increased voter turnout could boost Vice President Kamala Harris to pick off the district’s lone electoral vote. Nebraska is one of two states that splits its electoral votes, and while the state overall is reliably Republican, the Omaha district is competitive. The 2nd District has twice awarded its electoral vote to a Democratic presidential candidate — to Barack Obama in 2008 and to Joe Biden in 2020.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. – Nebraska voters will choose between two competing abortion measures&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nebraska&#8217;s November Ballot to Include Measures on Abortion Rights Expansion and Limitation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/nebraskas-november-ballot-to-include-measures-on-abortion-rights-expansion-and-limitation/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Competing-measures-to-expand-or-limit-abortion.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:28:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":254799604,"title":"Final night of Democratic convention outpaces closing night of GOP convention","text":"The closing night of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday drew about 26.2 million TV viewers, narrowly outpacing the Republican National Convention's final night, according to data from the media measurement company Nielsen. The convention's final night aired across 15 television networks and drew about 820,000 more viewers than the estimated 25.4 million people who watched the final night of the Republican event, Nielsen reported. Vice President Kamala Harris' speech accepting her party’s nomination aired from approximately 10:31 p.m. to 11:11 p.m. ET and averaged 28.9 million viewers. That edged out the audience that tuned in for former President Donald Trump's acceptance speech by about 500,000 viewers — about 28.4 million people watched Trump speak during the 10:45 to 11 p.m. ET window, Nielsen said. The DNC in Chicago attracted a larger audience each night than the RNC, which took place last month in Milwaukee. The first night of the Republican convention drew an estimated 18.13 million viewers, compared to around 20 million viewers on the DNC's opening night, according to Nielsen. Viewership for the DNC increased to an estimated 20.7 million people on Tuesday night, which included remarks from former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama. The figures show an increase from four years ago, when the party’s virtual convention, consisting of a mix of recorded and live events that were all done remotely, lacked the energy of the past week’s live, in-person event. The DNC's closing night exceeded viewership for the convention’s final night four years ago, when 24.6 million viewers tuned in across cable and TV for President Joe Biden’s speech. Virtual convention aside, fewer viewers overall were watching on Thursday night than they have on the final nights of conventions in years past, as TV viewership has broadly continued to decline.

The Democratic National Convention, which ended on Thursday, smashed the Republican National Convention in viewership, according to data released by Nielsen. The DNC averaged 21.8 million viewers across its four nights, compared with the RNC’s average of roughly 19.1 million per night. That’s an average of 2.7 million more viewers per night for the DNC. Trump’s speech scored the RNC its best ratings all week, with an average of about 25.4 million viewers tuning in that night. “We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win,” Trump declared on stage in Milwaukee. Unfortunately for him, he lost, lost, lost. On Thursday, the DNC pulled in nearly a million more viewers, with an average of 26.2 million. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ speech even beat Trump’s in peak viewership, with 28.9 million watching her and 28.4 million watching him. And digging into the data further only highlights the RNC’s weaker engagement. Night by night, the DNC steadily outperformed the RNC: The RNC’s second night scored the fewest eyeballs, with a paltry average of just over 14.8 million viewers. That night’s closing speech came from Republican National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump, who—total coincidence—happens to be Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law. Other speakers that night were 2024 presidential also-rans Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. Compare that to the DNC’s lowest-performing night, the first evening, which saw an average of 20 million viewers—better than any night of the RNC, except the night when Trump spoke. And it makes sense. The night saw speeches from President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others. However, to put things in perspective, it’s unlikely that convention viewership translates to election turnout. In the past 16 presidential cycles, the party with the higher convention viewership won the subsequent election eight times and lost eight times, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. At the same time, this isn’t a normal election and Donald Trump isn’t a normal candidate. In the days leading up to the DNC, Rolling Stone reported that the former host of “The Apprentice” was worried about how the RNC’s ratings would compare. Reportedly, he also thought it was unlikely Harris’ speech would be able to top him in the ratings game. It’s possible that Trump’s loss here will make the media-obsessed candidate spiral even further.","summary":"Donald Trump’s worst nightmare has come true: He lost—in TV ratings.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, which ended on Thursday, smashed the Republican National Convention in viewership, according to data released by Nielsen.

After calculating how Kennedy's vote will break for Trump, Fabrizio—a veteran GOP pollster and longtime Trump ally—acknowledged that Trump lost Arizona and Georgia to President Joe Biden four years ago. Trump has still not conceded the 2020 election.\"To put these numbers into perspective, the net vote gained in a states like Arizona based on just a 2020 turnout model would be over 41,000 votes nearly 4 times Biden's winning margin or in Georgia the net gain. would be over 19,000 votes nearly twice Biden's margin,\" the memo reads.Biden flipped both Arizona and Georgia blue in the last presidential election. In the past 72 years, only two Democratic presidential nominees—Bill Clinton and Harry Truman—have won Arizona in the general election. Biden's win in Georgia was another major victory for the Democratic Party, who had not won the Southern state in nearly 30 years.The memo was obtained by NBC News' Sahil Kapur. Newsweek reached out to the Trump campaign via email for comment.Fabrizio's note comes hours after Kennedy suspended his presidential campaign and threw his support behind Trump.At a press conference from Arizona, the independent candidate said the \"principled causes\" that pushed him to leave the Democratic Party, and now back Trump were \"Free speech, the war in Ukraine, and the war on our children.\"\"One of the two candidates has adopted these issues as his own to the point where he has asked to enlist me in his administration,\" he said. \"I'm speaking, of course, of Donald Trump.\"It's not only Kennedy's endorsement that Trump benefits from.

In 2022, illegal immigrants who avoided agents grew by 56% and, in 2023, increased by over 10%, according to the source. \"There's room for new legislation, but the actual little secret here is that existing laws are not being enforced, and that's what I'd like to see happen,\" Ramaswamy said.

Kennedy Jr. “We just had a very nice endorsement from RFK,” Trump told a crowd of 200 supporters in a Sin City restaurant’s banquet room. “I want to thank Bobby. That was very nice. He’s a great guy and respected by everybody.” Trump used the nod from the Democratic scion to take a shot at his original opponent, who withdrew from the race after pressure from his own party. “The Democrats treated him very badly, and then they treated Biden just like him,” the ex-prez told reporters after the event. Trump addressed other news of the day, saying there’s “a lot to learn” from the suspension of at least five Secret Service agents, including one from his protection detail, this week following an investigation of the Butler, Pa., assassination attempt that left one rally attendee dead and two wounded. Twenty-year-old shooter Thomas Crooks hit the former president, who narrowly escaped death with a serendipitous turn of the head. Trump views Nevada — where a Redfield and Wilton poll this week shows him leading Vice President Kamala Harris 43% to 42%, though that may change depending on what the 6% backing Kennedy decide — as a crucial element in his quest to return to the White House after losing in 2020. “If we win this state, if we win Nevada, we’re going to win something that’s going to be very, very special,” he told the crowd. Opponents hit Trump hard during this week’s Democratic National Convention, but he defended the 2022 6-3 Supreme Court overturn of Roe v. Wade, which returned abortion regulation to the states: “Nobody wanted it — nobody wanted it — in the federal government.” As a female reporter asked Trump about “taking away abortion rights,” the crowd erupted with shouts of “Bulls-it” and “Baby killer” directed at the journalist. As typical at his rallies, the former prez addressed a litany of issues. Of Harris’ corporate-tax-hike plan, he said, “If they charge too much on taxes, these companies will leave the United States and take the jobs with them.” He pushed the release of federal land for development: “We’re gonna have housing built, and it will be great for Nevada.” But “No Tax on Tips” remained the focus. Trump chided Harris for appropriating proposal he first made June 9 at a massive outdoor rally here. “They copied us two months later. She’s the greatest flip-flopper in history. She went from communism to capitalism in two weeks,” he said. He said Harris sponsored legislation to eliminate the tip credit and impose a service charge instead, forcing workers to earn a minimum wage. Not everyone in the service industry here is confident about the Trump pledge. Two hours before the event, local Democrats trotted out union officials, workers and a local barbershop owner to throw cold water on the plan, despite the Culinary Union’s quick endorsement of Trump’s proposal months before Harris followed his lead. But Nicole Williams, a Local 226 member who tends bar at the Wynn resort on the Las Vegas Strip, sharply disagrees with union leadership, telling The Post Trump’s plan would help her and her husband raise their family of seven children. “I had to return to work a lot sooner than planned after my nine-month-old baby was born eight weeks prematurely last November because of the economy,” Williams said at the Trump event. “The increased cost means that our family has had to cut back on extras, like my girls taking gymnastics, my six-year-old doing flag football.” Williams said keeping “the money in my own family’s pockets, rather than the federal government, would make a huge difference in my life and the lives of those in my community.”","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Donald Trump stopped in swing-state Nevada Friday to stump for his popular proposal “No Tax on Tips,” even as he picked up a potentially huge tip himself: an endorsement from departing independent presidential candidate Robert F.

Over four days in Chicago, the Democratic National Committee rolled out a slick, made-for-TV (and social media) production peppered with former presidents and surprise celebrity guests. The convention had one main purpose: to turbocharge Kamala Harris's month-old bid for the White House, ahead of the final stretch of the election campaign. Democrats inside the arena exuded optimism. They danced in the stands, chanted new campaign slogans with gusto, and waved around cardboard cut-outs of Harris's face. And over and over, in our conversation with delegates, the same adjectives kept being offered up: excited, enthusiastic, motivated. It's impossible to know how different the atmosphere would have been had Joe Biden still been the party's nominee. But underneath the joy in the room, there appeared to be a sense of relief. Democrats could start their long farewell to the president — acknowledging what they see as his sacrifice in dropping out — before quickly turning to a new candidate who wouldn't make them nervous as she walked out onto the stage. Harris's rise to the top of the Democratic ticket has up-ended the race and given a previously anxious party a new-found sense of confidence. But it wasn't all that long ago that momentum was widely assumed to be on the Republican side of politics. At the GOP convention last month, up the road in Milwaukee, Donald Trump was hailed as a martyr after surviving an assassination attempt. Delegates wore white patches over their ears in solidarity with the former president, and shouted \"fight, fight, fight\": the now infamous phrase he delivered in the minutes after he was shot. Against an 81-year-old president under intense pressure over his age and mental acuity, Trump projected a message of strength. Four weeks on, it's an entirely different contest. But Democrats are being warned not to take anything for granted. 'We cannot be our own worst enemies' Hillary Clinton is intimately aware of how it can all come crashing down. In 2016, the-then Democratic nominee was leading against Trump in the polls. Many assumed the former secretary of state and first lady would become America's first-ever female president — a milestone she has once again labelled the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\". But while Clinton won the popular vote, she lost the electoral college, paving the way for Trump to enter the White House. \"No matter what the polls say, we can't let up,\" Clinton told the convention, in a speech she later described as \"cathartic\". \"Don't get distracted or complacent.\" Another former first lady, Michelle Obama, warned \"a handful of votes in every precinct\" could decide the election outcome. \"No matter how good we feel tonight, or tomorrow, or the next day, this is going to be an uphill battle,\" she told the crowd. \"So folks, we cannot be our own worst enemies … This election is going to be close.\" It was a message reinforced by Harris herself, who suggested Democrats would need to come down to Earth fairly quickly. \"I know we're going to get this done. We're going to win!\" she told an after-party inside the arena. \"But only if we understand you can party tonight and you need to work for the next 75 days or so.\" Harris doesn't have time to mess around. Biden's last-minute withdrawal from the race has left her with a very limited window to sell herself to undecided voters. It also leaves less time to rebound from any stumbles. That risk has been minimised so far, with the vice-president mostly sticking to the script with pre-prepared speeches. The party's post-convention high shows that strategy has worked up to this point. But it can't be sustained indefinitely. Harris has flagged doing a major interview by the end of this month, and her high-stakes debate against Trump is just over two weeks away. The RFK Jr wildcard Harris could also be hampered by Robert F Kennedy (RFK) Jr's decision to suspend his independent presidential bid. The nephew of former president John F Kennedy had benefited from a cohort of so-called \"double haters\": voters who were unhappy with both Trump and Biden. But Harris's entrance to the race exacerbated flagging political and financial support for his campaign. While a bus decked out in RFK signage was doing late-night laps of the Democratic convention venue as recently as Thursday night local time, by Friday he'd announced he was getting behind Trump instead — a decision he described as \"heart wrenching\". \"This decision is agonising for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends,\" he said at a press conference. \"But I have the certainty that this is what I've meant to do.\" RFK Jr's polling numbers had slipped into the single digits, but in an incredibly close race, any support he drew away from either major party candidate could have an impact. Harris's campaign made an appeal to his backers, arguing that anyone who was \"tired of Donald Trump\" should swing behind the vice-president. But Trump's campaign was quick to claim RFK Jr's withdrawal had given its side the upper hand, citing its own surveys to argue it would deliver more votes to the former president. \"This is good news for President Trump and his campaign — plain and simple,\" a memo read. The rising stars in the spotlight Political conventions can be an opportunity for rising stars to get noticed on a very big stage. Barack Obama's speech as a US senate candidate in 2004 earned him a reputation as a skilled orator and helped him on his path to the White House four years later. This year, there was a new generation of up-and-comers whose speeches were being watched closely. Wes Moore is Maryland's first black governor, and at 45 years old, he's the youngest Democrat currently leading a state. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was passed over as Harris's running mate, but is widely reported to hold higher ambitions. Transportation Secretary and former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg received a rapturous response from his many fans in the crowd. And Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer caught attention by using her address to describe Harris as a \"total badass\". If the vice-president loses this election, the party could look to one of its younger leaders to be the one accepting the nomination in four years' time.

Gavin Newsom joked about the process that landed Vice President Kamala Harris the Democratic presidential nomination, saying in an interview posted Friday that he was \"told to say\" it was an open, inclusive process. President Biden's blockbuster announcement last month that he was ending his re-election bid for a second term in the White House resulted in Harris replacing him at the top of the ticket. She has since enjoyed a surge in polling and fundraising, but never received a vote as the Democratic Party quickly embraced her to lead the ticket. Critics of the Democratic Party have suggested Harris got the nomination without the true will of the voters, but Newsom appeared to find the process humorous. \"We went through a very open process, a very inclusive process. It was bottom-up, I don’t know if you know that. That’s what I’ve been told to say,\" Newsom said as he laughed during a talk with \"Pod Save America\" posted Friday. 33 DAYS: VP HARRIS REFUSES TO REVEAL POLICY POSITIONS, GIVE NEWS CONFERENCES OR INTERVIEWS Newsom then joked that Democrats held a 30-minute convention between tweets by Biden on July 21 announcing he left the race and then had endorsed Harris. \"It’s been amazing,\" quipped Newsom, who's widely seen as having future White House ambitions himself. Democrats like Nancy Pelosi have claimed the nomination wasn't orchestrated in Harris' favor after Biden dropped out The clip drew criticism as it began to circulate on social media on Friday. \"The Party of Democracy sits around guffawing at how anti-democratic and vote-free and secret was their process for choosing and then imposing the new Democratic presidential nominee on the country,\" journalist Glenn Greenwald responded. 'MASCULINITY IS ON THE BALLOT': COMPETING VISIONS OF BEING A MAN IN AMERICA AT CENTER OF TRUMP-HARRIS MATCHUP Another critic added, \"Gavin Newsom knows the Harris nomination was a top-down coup, and they’re all cynical about it. Is this the ‘democracy’ they want to save? What a sick joke on their own supporters and this country.\" Institute for Black Solidarity with Israel CEO Dumisani Washington wrote, \"The party always screaming about DEI and White privilege love using DEI to flaunt their White privilege. Isn’t screwing over the voters funny?\" Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night. Biden clinched the party's nomination in March against minimal opposition, but everything changed after his disastrous debate performance in June. Media allies and fellow Democrats who had defended his mental acuity and fitness for office changed their tune and called for him to exit the race, and despite his initial claims only God could get him out, he finally succumbed to pressure and stepped aside.
