According to an NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC Latino poll released Sunday, Harris is lagging behind her left-leaning predecessors among Latino-identifying voters, even as millions more join the nation’s second largest voting block and get set to cast their ballots in the 2024 general election. “Support for Harris is at 54% among registered Latino voters, according to the poll, while Trump gets 40% and another 6% say they’re unsure or wouldn’t vote. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points,” the network found. Harris’ numbers are actually better than those seen when it was President Joe Biden barreling toward the general election, but they still lag far behind the spread seen from previous election cycles. According to pollsters, Democratic candidates managed to grab a 39-point advantage among Latinos in 2012, a 50-point lead in 2016, and were ahead by a 29-point margin in 2020. The same trend can be seen when voters are asked to consider who the would like to see in control of Congress, even though Democrats hold a 12-point advantage, that margin “represents a steady decline” since the 45-point difference seen in 2012, the 34-point lead in 2016, and the 21-point split seen in 2020, according to that survey. “54% of Latino voters preferring a Democratic-controlled Congress, versus 42% who want Republicans in charge,” NBC wrote. The root of the difference among a key voting demographic, according to pollsters, lies with Latino men under the age of 50 and who do not have college degrees. Those voters prefer Trump by about a dozen-point margin. On the other hand, Harris performs best among college educated Latino men and among Latina women with a college degree, where she’s up by 52 points and 24 points, respectively. “Solid Democratic support from Hispanic women, or Latinas, has helped offset some of that erosion,” the network wrote. This year an estimated 36.2 million Latinos are eligible to vote in the general election, according to Pew Research. That’s up from 32.3 million in 2020. Every year, Pew says, the Latino voting block grows by 1.4 million voters. Pollsters also asked about better immigrant rights, securing the border, fighting crime, reproductive rights, the economy and the rising cost of living. Harris wins on abortion and immigrant rights by wide margins, and on crime by five points, but the poll showed that more Latino voters prefer Trump for securing the border, handling the economy, and tackling inflation. “A majority of Latinos in the poll – a combined 54% – say the cost of living and the economy are their top issues,” pollsters wrote. About one third of Latinos polled said they felt that immigration was a net negative for the nation, a nearly two-decade high for that sentiment among that demographic. “Sixty-two percent of Latino voters believe immigration helps more than it hurts, versus 35% who think it hurts more than it helps. But that 35% saying immigration hurts more than it helps is the highest share of Latino voters saying this on a question dating back to 2006,” NBC found. The poll was conducted from September 16 to the 23rd, and spoke with 1,000 registered Latino voters — half by cellphone, 10% via landline and the rest via the web. It carries a plus-minus 3.1-point margin of error. That poll comes as other recent surveys show Harris holding the slightest within-the-margins lead in several key swing states. According to a Fox News poll of nearly 800 likely voters, Harris is running even with former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, at 49% each. According to the network, the race stood at exactly that same position in July, after Biden dropped out but before Harris officially became the party nominee. “Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength: college graduates and urban voters,” Fox wrote. Those results match a poll published by UMass Lowell’s Center for Public Opinion and YouGov late last week, which showed Harris up by two points. “The presidential race remains very close in Pennsylvania with the coming weeks a crucial time for both campaigns. As can be expected in a highly competitive race with few undecided voters, get-out-the-vote strategies will become increasingly important to mobilize supporters and ensure they go to the polls on Election Day,” UMass Lowell Professor and Center for Public Opinion Associate Director Rodrigo Castro Cornejo said along with that poll. A New York Times/Siena College poll of Michigan voters found the Vice President ahead by just a single point among likely voters, and the same survey showed her up by two points in Wisconsin. The Times described those races as “essentially tied.” The UML/YouGov survey showed Harris up by five in Michigan, which falls just outside that poll’s 4.3-point margin of error. “The Trump campaign has a negative favorability in Michigan that needs to be overcome if they want to remain competitive in the state,” Cornejo said.","summary":"New polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris losing ground among a key voting block, one that has supported Democrats by wide margins for the last four presidential elections.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Published:00:40 BST, 30 September 2024 |Updated:01:16 BST, 30 September 2024 e-mail View comments EastEnders legend Rudolph Walker reportedly accused BBC bosses of racism after he and his black co-stars were snubbed from the show's 20th anniversary book in 2005. The actor, 85, who's played Patrick Truman in the show since 2001, said he was 'totally disgusted' and met with then boss John Yorke to demand an explanation. Writing in his autobiography Walking With Dignity, which was printed in The Sun, Rudolph said that his photo was nowhere to be seen in the book and co-stars Adam Wodyatt and Shane Richie had demanded it be 'withdrawn and reprinted'. He said was told that only characters with prominent stories at the time were featured in the book, despite new family The Millers, who had yet to make their debut, were included. Writing: 'By the end of 2004, I had appeared in 300 episodes over three years and in 2004 had eight 'doof doofs' [the iconic sound to mark the end the end of an episode]. EastEnders, 85, legend Rudolph Walker reportedly accused BBC bosses of racism after he and his black co-stars were snubbed from the show's 20th anniversary book in 2005 The actor who's played Patrick Truman in the show since 2001, said he was 'totally disgusted' and met with then boss John Yorke to demand an explanation (pictured with Nicolas Bailey who played his onscreen son Patrick) He said was told that only characters with prominent stories at the time were featured in the book, despite new family The Millers (pictured) who had yet to make their debut, were included 'The absence in the book of one of the first black families in the Square — despite their small photos, there were scant references inside to [on screen sons] Gary Beale and Nick Bailey either, caused many eyebrows to be raised and questions asked.' He went on to explain that bosses blamed an 'independent editor' for the error, before praising the show for continuing to include 'characters from diverse ethnic backgrounds'. MailOnline have contacted BBC for comment. It comes after the actor revealed he was secretly homeless while starring on the soap and admitted to leading a 'double life' after a divorce in his 70s left him 'penniless'. He recalled 'crying' on the way to the BBC's Elstree studios as he kept his struggle with 'pain and loneliness from his co-stars. Rudolph married his first wife Lorna Ross in 1968, after their divorce he went on to wed his second wife, Dounne Alexander in 1998, but they also split. The legal costs of his second divorce took its toll and he was left with 'only a car to his name.' In an interview with The Mirror, he explained: 'It was painful. It was extremely difficult. I just didn’t have any financial means. I was literally starting from scratch again in my 70s, with nowhere to live. It was a time of great pain and loneliness. Writing in his autobiography Walking With Dignity, Rudolph said that his photo was nowhere to be seen in the book and co-stars Adam Wodyatt and Shane Richie had demanded it be 'withdrawn and reprinted' Writing: 'By the end of 2004, I had appeared in 300 episodes over three years and in 2004 had eight 'doof doofs' [the iconic sound to mark the end the end of an episode]. 'The absence in the book of one of the first black families in the Square — despite their small photos, there were scant references inside to [on screen sons] Gary Beale and Nick Bailey either, caused many eyebrows to be raised and questions asked.' 'Some days on my way to the studio, I would pull up at the side of the road, have a cry. I suppose it was a sort of double life. 'Questions of: \"Who am I? Why am I in this position?\" There was no way the public watching me as Patrick every other night were aware that was what was happening.' Diane Parish, who plays Denise Fox, was one of the only cast member's who could see past Rudolph's happy façade. But despite her questions, he never revealed what he was going through. He hasn't even explained the height of his financial difficulties to his children Darren, 52, and Sheona, 48.

The episode aired nine days after the leak of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which former president Donald Trump exalted grabbing women “by the pussy.” The sketch is the cold open, the first of the night. The camera settles in on former cast members Cecily Strong and Alex Moffat, both playing journalists moderating a debate between Trump (played, then, by Alec Baldwin) and Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon. McKinnon’s take on Clinton by this point in the election was well established: a gleeful ambition monster, a woman who has to be told by her staff that she can’t be her own VP, who warms up her vocals by singing “first female president—me-me-me-me-meeee!” As she introduces the players, Strong says, “Please welcome Republican candidate Donald Trump and—” She glances at Moffat. “Can we say this yet?” He shrugs. “Probably fine.” “President Hillary Clinton,” Strong finishes. The laugh she gets is swift and sure. And—as we know now, of course—wrong. Later in the sketch, when asked to name something she likes about Trump, McKinnon’s Clinton says, “I do like how generous he is. Just last Friday—” She does a karate kick for emphasis. “—He handed me this election.” Again there are big laughs, from an audience still three weeks away from hearing the actual punchline. The episode of SNL that aired on November 13, 2016 opened with a very different vibe. It was the first after Trump, not Clinton, won the election. There was no sketch. The stage was dark, the audience somber. McKinnon—in costume as Clinton, but not really in character—sat at a piano. She sang Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah.” When the song was over, she looked into the camera. “I’m not giving up,” she said, “and neither should you.”","summary":"There’s a sketch from an October 2016 episode of Saturday Night Live that—no matter how you voted in the last two presidential elections, or how you will in this year’s trilogy-conclusion-coded contest—will give you time-traveling goosebumps.

This statement comes as the US election is just over a month away, with rhetoric on both sides becoming more heated. Democratic nominee and incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly called her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, a threat to democracy. Musk, who endorsed Trump in July, claimed that the opposite is true in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday. “Very few Americans realize that if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election. Far from being a threat to democracy, he is the only way to save it!” he stated. “Let me explain: if even 1 in 20 illegals become citizens per year – something the Democrats are expediting as fast as humanly possible – that would be about 2 million new legal voters in four years,” Musk said in reply to a post claiming that 9 million illegal immigrants are eligible for citizenship under the current US administration. “Moreover, the Biden/Harris administration has been flying ‘asylum seekers,’ who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Arizona. It is a surefire way to win every election,” he added. With swing states often determining US elections by a margin of fewer than 20,000 votes, Musk claimed that if the Democrats succeed in using immigration to boost their electorate, there will be no more swing states. The only elections thereafter would be Democratic primaries, similar to what occurred in California in the late 1980s, he said. “America then becomes a one-party state, and democracy is over,” Musk concluded. Everywhere in America will be like the nightmare that is downtown San Francisco. Musk announced in July that he would be closing the X offices in San Francisco, stating that he’s “had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building.” X’s relocation to Texas coincided with multiple high-profile business departures amid the city’s well-documented homelessness, drug and crime epidemic. Illegal immigration and the situation at the border have become major points of contention between Democrats and Republicans in this election cycle. Trump has criticized his Democratic opponents on immigration issues, condemning President Joe Biden’s reinstatement of the Obama-era ‘catch and release’ policy, which he claims allows convicted criminals among illegal immigrants to be released into the US.","summary":"Democrats could turn the US into a one party state through naturalizing illegal immigrants in swing states, Elon Musk has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/604919-harris-plunge-us-nightmare/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.09/article/66f9ea1820302721a4765d34.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 00:05:53","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":257869990,"title":"‘Trump Is a Scab’: Harris Campaign Fumes Over Trump’s Wild Anti-Overtime Rant","text":"Former president Donald Trump openly admitted that he “hated” to pay his workers overtime at the Trump organization and would even replace those who spoke out about it—comments the Harris campaign immediately seized upon. Speaking at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump, who has used a proposal to end taxes on tips as a key talking point to bolster his pro-worker bona fides on the campaign trail, confessed that he would be better off if he didn’t make his thoughts on overtime publicly known. “I shouldn’t say this,” he said, but continued on anyway. “I know a lot about overtime. I hated to give overtime, I hated it. I’d get other–I shouldn’t say this–but I’d get other people in. I wouldn’t pay,” Trump said, adding: “This is going to lead to a lot more. I think it’s going to be economically positive, but I’m not even doing it for that reason. I’m doing it because, like the tax on overtime, it’s something so good.” Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Sarafina Chitika latched onto the comments from Trump’s latest rally, saying in a statement emailed to the Daily Beast: “Donald Trump is finally owning up to it: He’s built an entire career on screwing over workers. It’s exactly what he did in the White House–trying to rip away tips and overtime pay for millions of workers–and exactly what he plans to do in a second term.” The campaign added: “Trump is a scab, plain and simple. He is selling snake oil lies in a desperate attempt to trick voters. He can’t be trusted–workers know it, and voters know it. They’ll elect a champion who has their back by voting for Vice President Harris this November.” It was only one of Trump’s disjointed comments during the rally—he also blamed the Biden administration for his small crowd size in Wisconsin just a day prior, during which he called his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris “mentally disabled.” He doubled down on the line of attack Sunday, questioning his rival’s mental acuity once again. “Joe Biden became mentally impaired, sad, but lyin’ Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There’s something wrong with Kamala and I just don’t know what it is but there is definitely something missing, and you know what, everybody knows it,” he said, as the campaign played video of Harris laughing overhead. The attacks saw some notable Republicans pushing back, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” Graham told CNN. “I’m not saying she’s crazy, her policies are crazy.” Minnesota Republican and House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer, also a member of JD Vance’s debate preparation team, told ABC News: “I think we should stick on the issues. The issues are, Donald Trump fixed it once. They broke it. He’s going to fix it again. That – those are the issues.” Trump revealed he was switching from calling his opponent “a Marxist” to a “communist,” because “unfortunately nobody knows what that is.” He repeated calls for her impeachment and prosecution. In addition, the former president repeated his baseless attacks against Harris over her summer McDonald’s job decades ago, claiming she “never worked there” and it was a “total lie.” Similar repeated attacks were thrown at ABC News’ “pretty boy” David Muir over his presidential debate fact-checking. “I still won, by a lot,” Trump claimed.","summary":"Brian Snyder/ReutersFormer president Donald Trump openly admitted that he “hated” to pay his workers overtime at the Trump organization and would even replace those who spoke out about it—comments the Harris campaign immediately seized upon.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump, who has used a proposal to end taxes on tips as a key talking point to bolster his pro-worker bona fides on the campaign trail, confessed that he would be better off if he didn’t make his thoughts on overtime publicly known.\n\n “I shouldn’t say this,” he said, but continued on anyway.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-a-scab-harris-campaign-fumes-over-trumps-wild-anti-overtime-rant","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1221,w_2171,x_0,y_96/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1727652901/2024-09-29T203422Z_1627427138_RC2KAAAFK185_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP_gnhu7f","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 00:01:59","author":"Matt Young","authors":["Matt Young"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.626},{"id":257870170,"title":"Kamala Harris at war with the Constitution","text":"The NAACP, a New York nonprofit corporation, had taken the lead in fighting for the civil rights of black people in Alabama, specifically in support of its chapter in Montgomery, along with other local groups (Women’s Political Council) and leaders (the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Abernathy), to end the Jim Crow segregation of public buses there. In May 1956, a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama ruled Alabama’s law and local ordinances requiring segregation of public transportation unconstitutional. In November, the Supreme Court summarily affirmed that holding, citing Brown v. Board of Education. Stung by its defeat at the hands of the NAACP, which not only aided in the Montgomery bus boycott, but also provided legal counsel locally and in federal court to challenge racially segregated public transportation, Alabama targeted the NAACP. Arguing the NAACP was “causing irreparable injury to the property and civil rights of the residents and citizens of the State of Alabama for which criminal prosecution and civil actions at law afford no adequate relief,” Alabama sought to bar the group from operating in Alabama or, failing that, to require the nonprofit to provide Alabama the “names and addresses of all its Alabama members.” In a unanimous opinion by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, the Court held: “Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association [given] the close nexus between the freedoms of speech and assembly. [Moreover,] freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ‘liberty’ assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech.” Therefore, “compelled disclosure of [the NAACP’s] Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely [its] ability [and that of] its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate, in that it may induce members to withdraw from the [NAACP] and dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure.” Harris, who was attorney general of California before she moved up to the U.S. Senate, no doubt knows this history. After all, one tall tale from her personal narrative finds its origin in this era, to wit, her “Fweedom” cry from a stroller pushed by her parents during a civil rights march, albeit in Oakland, California. (Sadly, like much else by Harris, it’s an obvious theft from a 1965 interview with Dr. King about a little girl in Birmingham who cried “Fee-dom.”) Notwithstanding NAACP v. Alabama, when California opened a war against nonprofit organizations that refused to provide lists of their major donors, Harris weighed in enthusiastically against them. Historically, California had long required that, when nonprofit groups filed their annual IRS-mandated Form 990s with the Golden State, they include Schedule B, which provides names and addresses of those who contribute $5,000 or more. California was nearly alone in that decree; as a result, it was largely ignored. At the time, I led a nonprofit, public-interest law firm. Although I filed the entire Form 990, including Schedule B, with the IRS, I refused to do so with California. I learned later that many California nonprofit organizations, especially those involved in hot-button issues, sought to protect donors’ anonymity because of the constitutional issues involved, because of the Attorney General’s notoriously poor record of keeping those records confidential, and because the backlash against donors to 2008’s Proposition 8 traditional marriage constitutional amendment effort. In 2010, the Attorney General’s Office “ramped up its efforts[,] sending thousands of deficiency letters to charities that had not complied with the Schedule B requirement.” In 2011, Kamala Harris became attorney general. In 2012 and 2013, her office sent deficiency letters to noncomplying nonprofit organizations and, when they refused to disclose their contributors’ identities, she “threatened to suspend their registrations and fine their directors and officers.” Two nonprofit groups, Americans for Prosperity Foundation and the Thomas More Law Center, sued to keep their donor lists private. A California federal district court ruled in their favor, but Harris appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed and remanded the rulings. After bench trials in the two cases, the federal district court again ruled in favor of the nonprofits in April 2016 for one and in November 2016, for the other. Attorney General Harris appealed the former, but by mid-November, she had been elected to the Senate and, no doubt, was on her way there. She left the cases behind but her successor continued her arguments at the Ninth Circuit, which again ruled in favor of California’s demand for the donor records of nonprofit groups. On July 1, 2021, in its last decision of the term, Chief Justice John Roberts announced the 6-3 holding of the Court reversing the ruling of the Ninth Circuit and reinstating the holdings of the federal district court barring California from collecting nonprofits’ Schedule Bs. Unsurprisingly, he quoted NAACP v. Alabama, writing, “It is hardly a novel perception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute as effective a restraint on freedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action.” In short, the Supreme Court gave no more credence to California’s demand for the records of nonprofit groups than it had to similar demands made by Alabama over 60 years earlier. Harris, who is now the Democrats’ nominee for the presidency, has made her antipathy toward the First Amendment clear. It is demonstrated in her demand to regulate free speech on the internet. Her hostility toward the Fifth Amendment is also clear in her willingness to confiscate patents or lawfully owned firearms. Her antipathy toward the right of privacy and the “sanctity of your locked home” is manifest, as is her antagonism for due process, demonstrated in the glee with which she learned she could execute the powers of her office (“swipe of my pen”). As California Attorney General, in her treatment of nonprofit groups akin to the NAACP, demonstrated her enmity toward one of the constitutional underpinnings of the Civil Rights Movement. With her history in mind, we should respond skeptically to any attempted reassurance on her part or “fact-checking” by others, as the Supreme Court did to California’s guarantee of confidentiality regarding donors. It’s “not worth much” and “rings hollow.” Mr. Pendley, a Wyoming attorney and Colorado-based, public-interest lawyer for three decades with victories at the Supreme Court of the United States, served in the Reagan administration and led the Bureau of Land Management for President Trump.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris would not be born for another six years when, in 1958, the Supreme Court of the United States issued one of the first of a series of decisions at the heart of the civil rights movement, the case of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v.

But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There’s something wrong with Kamala. And I just don’t know what it is, but there is definitely something missing. And you know what, everybody knows it.” With just over a month until the election, Trump is intensifying his use of personal and offensive attacks, even as some Republicans say he’d be better off sticking to the issues. His suggestions that political enemies be prosecuted are particularly notable for their departure from norms in the U.S. in which the justice system is supposed to be protected from political influence. In recent weeks, Trump has threatened prosecutions of Google for allegedly giving priority to “good stories” about Harris and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Trump has long threatened legal action against his rivals, including President Joe Biden and his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton. This month he vowed to jail those “involved in unscrupulous behavior” this election, including election workers, lawyers, political operatives, donors, and voters, yet again attempting to sow doubt about the integrity of the election. But he also has many legal problems of his own. He was convicted in May of falsifying business records in a hush money case in New York, with a sentencing scheduled for Nov. 26. Two other cases are pending – a federal case for his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, and a state case in Georgia for his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss there to Biden. Prosecutors are appealing a federal judge’s dismissal of a case involving his handling of classified documents. Trump argues federal and state prosecutors are targeting him for political reasons, though there is no evidence to suggest that is true. If he wins the election, Trump could potentially pardon himself on the federal cases or order the Justice Department to shut down their investigations of him. On Sunday, he acknowledged he might lose in November: “If she wins, it’s not going to be so pleasant for me, but I don’t care.” Trump has derided Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, as “stupid,” “weak,” “dumb as a rock” and “lazy.” His allies have pushed him publicly and privately to talk instead about the economy, immigration and other issues. “I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday when asked about Trump’s comments. “They’re crazy liberal.” When asked whether he approved of the personal attacks on Harris, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sidestepped during an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for America,” said Emmer, who is helping Trump’s running mate JD Vance prepare for Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. “I think Kamala Harris is actually as bad or worse as the administration that we’ve witnessed for the last four years.” When pressed, Emmer said: “I think we should stick to the issues. The issues are, Donald Trump fixed it once. They broke it. He’s going to fix it again. Those are the issues.” Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, running for the Senate as a moderate Republican, brought up Trump’s false claims that Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, had previously played down her Black heritage. Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black institution, and has identified as both Black and South Asian consistently throughout her political career. “I’ve already called him out when he had the one interview where he was questioning her racial identity, and now he’s questioning her mental competence,” Hogan told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “And I think that’s insulting not only to the vice president but to people who actually do have mental disabilities.” Harris has not commented on Trump’s recent attacks but has said when asked about other comments that it was the ” same old show. The same tired playbook we’ve heard for years with no plan on on how he would address the needs of the American people.” Ahead of the rally on Sunday, some of Trump’s supporters said he often makes offensive remarks. Still, they support his proposals to restrict immigration and said he would have a better handle on the economy. “He says what’s on his mind, and again, sometimes how he says it isn’t appropriate,” said Jeffrey Balogh, 56, who attended the rally with two friends. “But he did the job. He did very well at it.” Tamara Molnar said she thinks Trump is very strong on immigration. As for his insults, Molnar said: “I think everybody has to have some decorum when speaking about other candidates, and I don’t think either side is necessarily innocent on that. There’s a lot of slinging both ways.” At the rally in Erie, Trump said the “invasion” would end and deportations would begin if he took office. “Thousands of migrants from the most dangerous countries are destroying the character of small towns and leaving local communities in anguish and in despair,” he said, talking about communities in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Last month, the GOP leader said he was “entitled” to personal attacks against Harris. “As far as the personal attacks, I’m very angry at her because of what she’s done to the country,” he told a news conference then. “I’m very angry at her that she would weaponize the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her. I think I’m entitled to personal attacks.” Long reported from Washington.

It was his second consecutive appearance in a crucial battleground state this weekend, following Saturday’s speech in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where he called Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris “mentally disabled” while delivering an anti-migrant speech. This time around, Trump continued to make the border and migrants the bogeymen, adding that their presence in this country requires appointed officials who give police the right to be “really violent” versus “the liberal left” who “want to destroy our country.” He has also claimed crime has been up in cities across the United States, which is not the case, per a report from the Council on Criminal Justice. “See, we have to let the police do their job, and if they have to be extraordinarily rough. And you know, the funny thing with all of that stuff, look at the department store, same thing … You see these guys walking out with air conditioners, with refrigerators on their back, the craziest thing, and the police aren’t allowed to do their job,” Trump said. “They’re told, if you do anything, you’re going to lose your pension — you’re going to lose your family, your house, your car. The police want to do it. The border patrol wants to do it … They’re not allowed to do it because the liberal left won’t let him do it. The liberal left wants to destroy them, and they want to destroy our country.” Trump then fantasized about giving police one “really violent day” to crack down on crime. “Now, if you had one really violent day,” Trump said. “Like a guy like Mike Kelly, put him in charge,” he continued, gesturing to Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Mike Kelly. “Congressman Kelly, put him in charge for one day. Mike, he’s a great Congressman. Would you say, Mike, that if you were in charge, you would say, ‘Oh, please don’t touch them. Don’t touch them. Let them rob your store’?” Trump said. “’Let all these stores go out of business, right?’ They don’t pay rent that the city doesn’t. The whole — it’s a chain of events. It’s so bad. One rough hour, and I mean real rough, and the word will get out and it will end immediately. End immediately.” On Tuesday, Oct. 1 Trump returns to the battleground state of Wisconsin, where he will speak at two different events in Waunakee and Milwaukee.","summary":"During yet another anti-migrant rant, the former president falsely claimed crime is up and so cops should be allowed to be “extraordinarily rough”","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-wants-police-really-violent-for-a-day-migrants-1235116074/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TrumpErieSeptember2024-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 23:48:38","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":257869040,"title":"The House should stay red in 2024 to keep the executive branch in line","text":"Just two years ago, New York voters were crucial in handing control of the House of Representatives to Republicans, who proceeded to rein in the worst Biden-Harris madness; control is up for grabs again this year, with the stakes every bit as high. Democrats ran both the House and Senate after the 2020 elections, and used it to launch the insane spending spree that pushed inflation to crushing levels. After 2022, the Republican House not only tightened the spending spigot (some: you can only do so much with narrow control of half of Congress), they began to shine light on the Biden scandals and investigate other outrages like the Afghanistan debacle, and even launch a fully bipartisan look at China’s vast campaign of influence on these shores. Democrats regaining the House this fall would be a complementary disaster, no matter who holds the White House or the Senate. Again: Kamala Harris’ campaign website claims “no one is above the law,” but the GOP-run House has been the prime player ensuring Joe Biden has to account for his actions, including the recent vote formally condemning Biden, Harris and 13 other administration officials for the 2021 Afghan bugout that resulted in the deaths of 13 American troops. House Republicans’ probes into Hunter Biden’s shady dealings not only exposed many sordid details, they forced an end to Justice Department efforts to ensure Hunter completely escaped justice. And they’ve fought other lunacy, for example in July passing a measure to overturn Biden’s move to add “gender identity” as a protected class under Title IX, and another this month to block a loony EPA rule that would require two-thirds of new cars sold to be electric vehicles by 2032. If Harris ekes out a win this November, a Republican House will be vital in stopping a repeat of the Biden disasters; if Donald Trump wins, to undoing the worst Biden legacies. Whereas as Democratic House would fight to protect the worst of Bidenomics, as well as creating bogus scandals (in consort with the media) to kneecap a President Trump in his second term as the “Russiagate” smears did in his first. New York will again be big in determining House control this year, in races we’ll examine in the coming days: Democrats are pumping millions into reversing the GOP’s 2022 gains here. Remember: Even when a Democratic House candidate seems moderate, he or she would empower that party’s worst: the AOCs and Rashida Talibs, the big spenders, foreign-policy fantasists and social engineers. No one expects the Empire State to decide the presidential race, but when it comes to the House, this is a swing state. In this crucial way, the nation’s future is in New York voters’ hands.","summary":"As we head into the final stretch before the 2024 elections, don't lose sight of Congress: Republicans have frequently used their slight majority in the House to hold the Harris-Biden administration accountable.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/29/opinion/the-house-should-stay-red-in-2024-to-keep-the-executive-branch-in-line/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-nycejylo9-1727653298555.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727638939&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 23:44:29","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":257870072,"title":"EastEnders legend Rudolph Walker 'embroiled in secret race row with BBC bosses after he and his black co-stars were snubbed from soap's 20th anniversary book'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Streaming Reality Daytime Film Soaps My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Sep 30th 2024 1AM 5°C 4AM 5°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement EastEnders legend Rudolph Walker 'embroiled in secret race row with BBC bosses after he and his black co-stars were snubbed from soap's 20th anniversary book' Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com By Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Published:00:40 BST, 30 September 2024 |Updated:00:42 BST, 30 September 2024 e-mail View comments EastEnders legend Rudolph Walker reportedly accused BBC bosses of racism after he and his black co-stars were snubbed from the show's 20th anniversary book in 2005. The actor, 85, who's played Patrick Truman in the show since 2001, said he was 'totally disgusted' and met with then boss John Yorke to demand an explanation. Writing in his autobiography Walking With Dignity, which was printed in The Sun, Rudolph said that his photo was nowhere to be seen in the book and co-stars Adam Wodyatt and Shane Richie had demanded it be 'withdrawn and reprinted'. He said was told that only characters with prominent stories at the time were featured in the book, despite new family The Millers, who had yet to make their debut, were included. Writing: 'By the end of 2004, I had appeared in 300 episodes over three years and in 2004 had eight 'doof doofs' [the iconic sound to mark the end the end of an episode]. EastEnders, 85, legend Rudolph Walker reportedly accused BBC bosses of racism after he and his black co-stars were snubbed from the show's 20th anniversary book in 2005 The actor who's played Patrick Truman in the show since 2001, said he was 'totally disgusted' and met with then boss John Yorke to demand an explanation (pictured with Nicolas Bailey who played his onscreen son Patrick) He said was told that only characters with prominent stories at the time were featured in the book, despite new family The Millers (pictured) who had yet to make their debut, were included 'The absence in the book of one of the first black families in the Square — despite their small photos, there were scant references inside to [on screen sons] Gary Beale and Nick Bailey either, caused many eyebrows to be raised and questions asked.' He went on to explain that bosses blamed an 'independent editor' for the error, before praising the show for continuing to include 'characters from diverse ethnic backgrounds'. MailOnline have contacted BBC for comment. It comes after the actor revealed he was secretly homeless while starring on the soap and admitted to leading a 'double life' after a divorce in his 70s left him 'penniless'. He recalled 'crying' on the way to the BBC's Elstree studios as he kept his struggle with 'pain and loneliness from his co-stars. Rudolph married his first wife Lorna Ross in 1968, after their divorce he went on to wed his second wife, Dounne Alexander in 1998, but they also split. The legal costs of his second divorce took its toll and he was left with 'only a car to his name.' In an interview with The Mirror, he explained: 'It was painful. It was extremely difficult. I just didn’t have any financial means. I was literally starting from scratch again in my 70s, with nowhere to live. It was a time of great pain and loneliness. Writing in his autobiography Walking With Dignity, Rudolph said that his photo was nowhere to be seen in the book and co-stars Adam Wodyatt and Shane Richie had demanded it be 'withdrawn and reprinted' Writing: 'By the end of 2004, I had appeared in 300 episodes over three years and in 2004 had eight 'doof doofs' [the iconic sound to mark the end the end of an episode]. 'The absence in the book of one of the first black families in the Square — despite their small photos, there were scant references inside to [on screen sons] Gary Beale and Nick Bailey either, caused many eyebrows to be raised and questions asked.' 'Some days on my way to the studio, I would pull up at the side of the road, have a cry. I suppose it was a sort of double life. 'Questions of: \"Who am I? Why am I in this position?\" There was no way the public watching me as Patrick every other night were aware that was what was happening.' Diane Parish, who plays Denise Fox, was one of the only cast member's who could see past Rudolph's happy façade. But despite her questions, he never revealed what he was going through. He hasn't even explained the height of his financial difficulties to his children Darren, 52, and Sheona, 48. Read More EastEnders icon Rudolph Walker, 84, reveals he was secretly homeless while starring as Patrick Trueman From 2001, the Trinidad and Tobago native's character Patrick has been central to numerous hard-hitting stories including suffering strokes, being assaulted in his shop, and the death of his adopted son.

The foundation includes an interschool drama award across schools in London, and a Role Model award for students who have demonstrated positive influence on others. In 2015, he celebrated his 1000th EastEnders episode. Rudolph's services to drama and charity resulted in him being appointed a CBE in the 2020 New Years Honours List.

It is less than two months since Donald Trump was clearly ahead in the race to the White House, which is to be decided in five weeks. Now he is either behind, or neck-and-neck with, his opponent, Kamala Harris. In such circumstances, even the debate between vice presidential candidates — usually a non-event — assumes significance when JD Vance and Tim Walz face off at 9pm in New York City (2am Wednesday Irish time). Circumstances in Britain could be even more of a mind concentrator. It is not 100 days since Keir Starmer won a landslide victory with 411 seats and a simple majority of 174, the second largest in Labour Party history behind Tony Blair’s “a new day has dawned” triumph of 1997. That dominance began to reduce immediately when seven left wingers had the party whip withdrawn after rebelling against the king’s speech because of a failure to remove the two-child limit on tax credit, illustrating the dangers to discipline of an overwhelming majority. In his biography of Starmer — assisted but not authorised by the Labour leader — Tom Baldwin says that the electoral appeal of the former Director of Public Prosecutions lay in a simple comparison with Tory opponents: “I am not them.” That lustre has already worn thin, with stories about clothing allowances for the party elite from millionaire benefactors and an embarrassing list of freebies including the best tickets to Taylor Swift concerts and private boxes at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. One MP has already resigned over what she described as “sleaze, nepotism, and apparent avarice” that is “off the scale”. That this has coincided with a decision to withdraw winter fuel payments from pensioners and with predictions of a swingeing budget to come at the end of October is not a good look for a premier who entered Downing Street promising to “tread lightly on people’s lives”. With disappointment has come a collapse in personal approval ratings. Net satisfaction with Britain's new prime minister was at plus-seven after polling day. Ipsos say he is now, after 87 days, down to minus-21. The Opinium international research agency has him at minus-26, below Rishi Sunak during his lowest ebb as Tory leader. Harris can also say “I am not them” but with predecessor Leo Varadkar on what looks like an existentialist farewell tour offering off-the-cuff opinions on immigration, Irish reunification, even Eurovision, then he might want more of a cushion in the polls before he decides to go to the country. We will soon know if Budget 2025 is designed to deliver that. Streaming costs Do you remember when streaming was the future of TV, asks the journalist and novelist Stuart Heritage. Now, he comments presciently, it feels more like a prison. The core of discontent is the number of services that demand a monthly payment including Amazon, Now, Apple, Disney, Paramount, Britbox, Hayu, Shudder, BFI Player, and Mubi. ITV has a paid tier, as do Channel 4 and YouTube. On some, you can pay for an ad-free service; on others the offering is cheaper if you accept frequent, and intrusive, adverts. To access all the channels and all their whistles and bells,calculates Heritage, takes in the region of €1,750 a year. Streaming is a reason most frequently quoted by dissenters who object to making a financial contribution to public service broadcasting. It is beginning to make the television licence fee look like a bargain.","summary":"With Budget 2025 on the way and the air heavy with talk of a general election, recent polls here — and events in the US and Britain too — might concentrate the minds of the Coalition","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41486009.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8625/4312901_3_seoimage1x1_POLITICS_20Lebanon_20Ireland_2012473821A.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 23:30:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":257867936,"title":"Harris 'mentally impaired', should be prosecuted: Trump","text":"Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump has escalated his personal attacks on his Democratic rival Kamala Harris by repeating an insult that she was \"mentally impaired\" while also saying she should be \"impeached and prosecuted.\" Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania on Sunday took on similar themes as an event a day earlier that he himself described as a \"dark speech\".

In the past, left-leaning residents of the central Florida enclave tended to keep their views to themselves, fearing they might be kicked out of their golf group, excluded from the mahjong club, or disinvited from a neighbourhood pool party. But United States Vice President Kamala Harris’ emergence as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate has given the small, but enthusiastic group a boost of confidence and a push into the light. “They are beginning to realise that they have a voice and they can use it,” said Diane Foley, president of the Villages Democratic Club, which has seen its membership nearly double since the 2020 election cycle, to around 1,500 people. Prior to that time, she noted, “Democrats have been inclined to be quiet and to not broadcast their political preferences because we were so overwhelmed by the Republican party.” Parades of golf carts decorated in support of Harris have rolled through the streets, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff recently paid a visit. Meanwhile, Democrats opting to wear a T-shirt or put up a lawn sign in favor of Harris have had neighbors approach them with relief, saying, “We thought we were the only ones.” Still, most say they choose not to talk politics openly, to avoid tension in Wildwood-The Villages, the official name of this census-designated, master-planned metro area of more than 151,000 people. “You want to get along with your neighbours. They’re nice people. So we just don’t talk about it,” said Foley. Retired lawyer Howard Underwood, 71, and his wife, Janet, 74, were Republicans for four decades until Donald Trump became the candidate in 2016. “We’ve made common cause with the Democrats, even though I don’t share a whole lot of Kamala’s ideas on things,” said Underwood, who is now not affiliated with either major party but has volunteered with the Democrats club to support Harris. Underwood won’t go so far as to put a bumper sticker on his car for fear of blowback, but he acknowledges that the political atmosphere is changing, however slightly. “Democrats in The Villages has kind of become a thing,” he said with a laugh.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/shift-in-preferences/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P24-G_30092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 23:05:31","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":257868132,"title":"Trump, anxious for a Pennsylvania win, rails against immigrants in latest address","text":"Former US president Donald Trump railed against immigrants in the country illegally in an often-graphic speech in Pennsylvania on Sunday, his fourth campaign stop in a month in what has become the presidential campaign’s most hotly contested state. The Republican presidential candidate called some categories of immigrants “vicious” more than 10 times during his nearly two-hour address in Erie, and described several violent incidents. While there is no nationwide data on crimes committed specifically by undocumented immigrants, research shows they do not commit crimes at a higher rate than people born in the US. Trump’s speech was short of new policy details and the ferocity of his rhetoric suggests he is focused mainly on driving core supporters to vote, rather than winning over middle-of-the-road voters, ahead of Election Day on November 5. Trump believes immigration is a winning campaign issue, and he has at times said he believes immigration weighs on voters’ minds more than other major topics, such as the economy. “They call them of the worst order,” Trump said of immigrants who had committed violent crimes. “Charged with or convicted with heinous crimes, including child predators, drug dealers, vicious gang members, sadist thugs and people that deal in women.” Trump multiple times referenced instances of rape, including child rape. At one point, he suggested he would condone a burst of police violence. “One rough hour, and I mean real rough. The word will get out and it will end immediately,” he said. It is hardly the first time Trump has unleashed a tirade against undocumented immigrants in his bid for the White House. In June 2015, in the speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination for the 2016 election, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to live in the United States. “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some I assume are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting,” he said in his inaugural campaign speech in the atrium of Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump’s rally on Sunday in Erie came one month to the day after his vice-presidential running mate, US Senator J.D. Vance, held his own event there. Trump is expected to hold another rally in western Pennsylvania on October 5. The former president notably did not repeat his debunked claims that Haitian immigrants have eaten household pets in Springfield, Ohio. He did briefly refer to the community of Charleroi, Pennsylvania, which he has described as being overwhelmed by Haitians. At one point, Trump played a video of a criminal defendant who had entered the country illegally threatening a judge. Many allies and advisers to Trump believe Pennsylvania is the most important of the seven battleground states that will ultimately decide the election. Of those seven, Pennsylvania is the most populous and has the most votes in the Electoral College, which in turn determines the presidential election winner. “If we win Pennsylvania, we win,” Trump said on Sunday. Democratic candidate Vice-President Kamala Harris and Trump have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on ads in Pennsylvania, more than the total spent in any other state and also more per capita. Erie County is one of two Pennsylvania counties that favoured Trump in the 2016 election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton before favouring US President Joe Biden against Trump in 2020. Trump narrowly won the state and the presidential election in 2016, before losing both in 2020. This time around, polls show that Pennsylvania is again competitive. Harris leads Trump by 1 percentage point in the state, according to an average of polls maintained by polling and analysis website FiveThirtyEight. That difference is well within almost all polls’ margin of error. Trump’s next rally in Pennsylvania, on October 5, will take place in Butler, about 100 miles (160km) south of Erie and the site of a failed assassination attempt on Trump in July. A bullet grazed the former president’s ear.","summary":"Republican presidential candidate called some categories of immigrants ‘vicious’ more than 10 times during his nearly 2-hour address in Erie.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3280458/trump-anxious-pennsylvania-win-rails-against-immigrants-latest-address","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/30/bab4758d-1808-4d1a-8f21-12330d87bd1f_c1cf27c0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 23:05:27","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":257867676,"title":"New Yorker spends large part of Kamala Harris endorsement rebuking Biden: He 'stood in the way'","text":"The New Yorker magazine issued a scathing rebuke of President Biden in its official endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris published Sunday. The magazine heaped praise on Harris for displaying \"the basic values and political skills\" to defeat former President Trump in a lengthy endorsement, but not before scolding President Biden for standing in her way. \"It was hardly a secret that Biden has aged, growing markedly less robust, particularly in the past eighteen months or so. If he got through an interview or a (rare) press conference without incident, staff and supporters exhaled and treated it as a victory,\" the editors wrote. FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS ‘STARK CHOICE’ \"But, rather than open the gate to a younger generation of Democratic candidates, Biden, his advisers, and the Party leadership stood in the way. They made it plain that a challenger would inevitably be defeated. Meanwhile, through spin and deft scheduling, the White House staff protected the President and hoped for the best. Tens of millions of voters, fearing another Trump Presidency, had little choice but to close their eyes and think of America,\" the endorsement reads. The editors wrote that the infamous debate, which led to the end of Biden's re-election bid, broadcast to the world the extent of his \"disintegration.\" \"Viewed more coldly, it was a gift. Had it taken place, say, after the Conventions, it might have been too late to force a reassessment,\" the article reads. \"Trump said… ‘I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don’t think he knows what he said, either.’ By Trumpian standards, this was a kindness. It was also the end of the Biden candidacy,\" the editors continue. The endorsement also spends a significant portion attacking Trump, calling him a \"menacing presence in American life.\" \"There’s every reason to think that Trump II would be far worse than Trump I,\" they wrote. HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE Harris, they wrote, has \"got the ‘vibes,’ as this year’s cliché has it. But the race remains very close. \"In both 2016 and 2020, Trump outperformed the polls. No responsible assessment of the contest has the luxury of focussing only on the imperatives for a Harris Administration and gliding past the ramifications of another Trump Administration,\" the editors continue. The New Yorker was among the first left-leaning publications to urge Biden to step aside after his disastrous debate performance in June. \"Watching Thursday’s debate, observing Biden wander into senselessness onstage, was an agonizing experience, and it is bound to obliterate forever all those vague and qualified descriptions from White House insiders about good days and bad days,\" The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, wrote at the time.

Held at the JW Marriott hotel in downtown Los Angeles, today’s gathering was a mix of big donors willing to pay almost $1 million to be there and those shelling out just $500, with price levels sold out as of this morning. About 1,500 people were packed into a hotel ballroom for the event, with more expected, and seated around a simple stage with the Harris-Walz logo and a large blue curtain as the backdrop. As Deadline exclusively reported on September 28, Alanis Morissette and Halle Bailey performed for the crowd, with speeches from figures like Keegan-Michael Key. “This is the most important election of our lifetime, for real,” Key said. Among the attendees were campaign co-chair Jeffery Katzenberg, Lily Tomlin, Watchmen boss and longtime Democratic donor Damon Lindelof and spouse Heidi. In a guest column for Deadline on July 3, Emmy winner Lindelof was the first major Hollywood donor to publicly call for President Joe Biden to step aside after his debate debacle with Donald Trump on June 27 on CNN. The ex-Lost showrunner was soon followed by the likes of Rob Reiner and George Clooney as donations dried up for the campaign. Sterling K. Brown also was attending, according to a source. Harris was scheduled to speak later in the afternoon, after mingling with high-dollar donors at a reception and photo line at the hotel. Also spotted were a smattering of agents and industry publicists, including Kristina Schake, Jeff Tobler, Alison Rou, Scott Rowe and Kelly Bush. On the political side, figures such as former California Governor Gray Davis, Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-CA) and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) were there. Padilla also spoke, and Butler was to address the crowd during the afternoon. There also was heavy security, with attendees greeted by armed Secret Service agents. Starting just after 2 pm PT, today’s fundraiser was expected to be a big draw, as Harris has yet to headline an event in her adopted hometown since launching her presidential run on July 21. In fact, the event venue was just around the corner from where a clearly exhausted POTUS appeared with ex-president Barack Obama and Jimmy Kimmel on June 15 at the Peacock Theatre. That was the 81-year-old Biden’s last L.A. visit before the viability of his candidacy before a crisis for the Dems. That’s a far cry from the enthusiastic campaign Harris and running mate Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota are now conducting in what remains a tight race. Jetting in on Air Force Two last night from San Francisco, where Harris was district attorney for six years, the VP decamped at her and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff’s Brentwood home before whipping downtown for the fundraiser. With just over 30 days left before Election Day, the Vice President is leaving Sunday’s LA fundraiser to head directly to LAX and fly to Las Vegas for a rally there this evening. Though most of the attention for the election is on battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, this weekend’s double dipping in the Golden State is both an opportunity to put in a big haul financially and give some deep pocket donors some facetime. There also has been increasing focus among donors on down ballot races. With Democrats just a handful of seats of reclaiming the House majority, races in California and New York could determine if Hakeem Jeffries becomes the next Speaker. Congressional candidates likely will be seeking a photo or two with Harris, as she is expected to carry California by a wide margin. Harris’ campaign events come as Walz prepares to debate Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) on Tuesday in their first and only match up. Coming off a very successful debate performance against Trump on Sept. 10, Harris has been challenging the ex-president to meet her for a second round on CNN Oct. 23. Trump has so far refused. The event raised money for the Harris Victory Fund, a joint committee of her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state parties. security agents","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHollywood figures made a big showing this afternoon as Vice President Kamala&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Many Hollywood Celebrities Attend Kamala Harris&#8217; Fundraising Event in Los Angeles first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/many-hollywood-celebrities-attend-kamala-harris-fundraising-event-in-los-angeles/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 22:59:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.047},{"id":257868982,"title":"Top Republicans disavow Donald Trump’s ‘mentally disabled’ comments about Kamala Harris","text":"Senior Republicans distanced themselves Sunday from comments made by Donald Trump at campaign stops over the weekend that opponent Kamala Harris was born “mentally disabled” and had compared her actions to that of “a mentally disabled person”. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, pushed back on Mr Trump’s remarks, which came in what Mr Trump himself admitted was a “dark” speech. “I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” Mr Graham said on CNN. “I’m not saying she’s crazy, her policies are crazy.” Mr Graham’s comments came as immigration and border security remained the top domestic issue on Sunday’s political talk shows. Mr Trump made his comments during a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday amid remarks on Ms Harris’s actions on those issues as vice-president. “Kamala is mentally impaired. If a Republican did what she did, that Republican would be impeached and removed from office, and rightfully so, for high crimes and misdemeanours,” he said. Mr Trump added: “Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.” Minnesota Republican representative Tom Emmer, a member of JD Vance’s debate preparation team, told ABC News: “I think we should stick on the issues. The issues are, Donald Trump fixed it once. They broke it. He’s going to fix it again. That – those are the issues.” But Maryland governor Larry Hogan struck back, telling CBS News that Mr Trump’s comments were “insulting not only to the vice-president, but to people that actually do have mental disabilities. “I’ve said for years that Trump’s divisive rhetoric is something we can do without,” Mr Hogan added. Steven Cheung, the communications director for the Trump campaign, did not directly address Mr Trump’s comments, widely criticised as offensive, but said Ms Harris’s record on immigration and border security made her “wholly unfit to serve as president”. Mr Trump’s comments joined a long list of personal attacks against opponents that supporters at his campaign eagerly lap up. Democrats have their own reductive articulations, calling Trump and Vance “weird”. But the use of mental disability to describe Ms Harris’s faculties has been widely seized upon. Democrat Illinois governor JB Pritzker told CNN that Mr Trump’s remarks were “name-calling”. “Whenever he says things like that, he’s talking about himself but trying to project it on to others,” Mr Pritzker said. Eric Holder, the former Obama administration attorney general, said Mr Trump’s comments indicated “cognitive decline”. “Trump made a great deal of the cognitive abilities of Joe Biden,” he told MSNBC. “If this is where he is now, where is he going to be three and four years from now?” Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities, pointed out that many presidents had disabilities. Ms Town said in a statement to the Washington Post that Mr Trump’s comments “say far more about him and his inaccurate, hateful biases against disabled people than it does about vice president Harris, or any person with a disability”.","summary":"Comments made during speech widely criticised as offensive","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/09/29/top-republicans-disavow-donald-trumps-mentally-disabled-comments-about-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/LO5BMKTQCOD76HUKHEHLXPSBNE.jpg?auth=efc2778dbb4cfc20c7db3e139f9593f5a3afe9be9c439d8ac126e691b1ec039f&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 22:56:23","author":"Edward Helmore","authors":["Edward Helmore"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":257867910,"title":"Mark Cuban tells 'faithful soldier' Elon Musk that Trump will eventually turn on him","text":"Mark Cuban warned Elon Musk about supporting Donald Trump in a social media post on Sunday, as the online feud between the two billionaires continues.Musk, who has endorsed the GOP nominee and set up a pro-Trump super PAC, reiterated his support for Trump in a post on X on Sunday morning, accusing the Democratic party of deliberately bringing immigrants into the US and key swing states to bolster support. \"Very few Americans realize that, if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election,\" Musk wrote.In response, Cuban called Musk a \"loyal, faithful soldier\" to Trump and warned that his fealty won't always be rewarded.\"Elon, there will come a time when you need something from Donald Trump.

Well, this weekend we saw, in a picture-perfect example of psychological projection, Harris throwing a small business under the bus for her own supposed political gain. On Saturday, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance tried to drop in on Pittsburgh’s famed Primanti Bros. sandwich shop, only to be barred entry. This came much to the disappointment of waiting voters, some of whom angrily recorded the events on their phones. VANCE NOT ALLOWED TO CAMPAIGN IN PITTSBURGH CULINARY LANDMARK - DESPITE HARRIS EVENT AT SAME RESTAURANT CHAIN Ire was raised on the right, threats of boycotts abounded, and Vance had cause to be a little miffed. But Trump's running mate graciously forgave the snub, while greeting fans in the parking lot, paying for the crowd's meals with a generous tip. The store released a statement saying he was welcome and that their employee had just been surprised by the cameras. As the Bard once pointed out, all's well that ends well, until Kamala Harris gets involved, and it's very telling. On Sunday, Harris’ campaign posted a video on X showing Harris being welcomed as a hero in Primanti Bros. back in August. The message was as clear as it was ugly - unlike Republicans, Democrats are welcome in polite society. Let’s set to one side the fact that Harris' appearance at the Steel City staple this summer was met by widespread mockery when it was discovered her campaign had kicked out actual diners and bused in supporters to set the fraudulent scene. That’s bad enough. But what Harris has wrought here isn’t just the disingenuous papering of the house at a political event. She is doing real harm to Primanti Bros.' effort to walk this situation back and make clear that everyone, of every political stripe, is welcome there. That was the point Vance was trying to make when he spoke after being denied entry, saying of the manager, \"Don’t hold it against her, she just got a little nervous, but it's a great local business.\" That is the classy way to handle such a thing. It is what generations of Americans have expected from our leaders. Primanti Bros. confirmed that was what happened and that really should have been the end of it. But no, not for Kamala Harris, the ‘me’ girl, around whom all things must revolve. It didn’t matter to Harris that the matter had been settled, that calls to boycott the restaurant were dying down, or that people were ready to move on to more serious matters. No, the vice president of the United States had to spike the football on X over her astroturf event at the greasy spoon, even if it meant hurting the business. You see, Harris winning is more important than any individual small business. And it was done in such an obnoxious way. Does Harris really want all of our businesses segregated by the politics of the customers? How ghastly. It brought me back to a conversation I had with a woman in San Francisco recently. She was a lifelong resident who had followed Harris’ rise. \"She doesn’t seem to believe in much, and the word is she isn’t very nice,\" she told me. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This echoes similar voices in Pennsylvania who told me they \"just don’t know who she is,\" or, commonly, \"I think she’ll say anything to get elected.\" Harris keeps insisting that she is the candidate who is selflessly in the race for the sake of the American people, while Trump only cares about Trump, but when has Harris ever done anything selflessly, or not on the public dime? When in her career has she taken a back seat for the good of the people? She certainly isn’t doing so by extending the controversy and misery surrounding Primanti Bros., which wants nothing more than for this whole story to go away. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The brutal fact is that the only moral compass Harris and her campaign have is set squarely on a north star of victory, not helping actual people, even if they think they might get around to that part eventually. In the meantime, much like the bused-in participants at her event at Primanti Bros., we are all just extras in Kamala’s Excellent Adventure.

Kelly, who said earlier this year that he would support conditions on military aid if steps to minimize civilian casualties were not taken, told NBC’s Kristen Welker on Sunday that he hadn’t seen the Israeli government cross that line yet. He added that he continues to have conversations with Israeli officials. Kelly, who sits on the Armed Services committee, would be a key vote on the passage of future aid packages. “We continue to talk to our allies, Israel, about how they are conducting this operation,” he said. “Hey, civilian loss of life is tragic wherever it happens. The Palestinian people who live in Gaza; they’re not Hamas. There are Hamas terrorists there, that Israel is focused on eliminating...but it’s a continuous discussion.” He was asked to clarify by Welker, who said it sounded as if he was “not at that point yet” where supporting conditions on military aid packages would get his vote. Kelly, a Democrat, affirmed that was an accurate read on his views. \"I've seen some positive responses from them when I have specifically asked them to do things differently,” he told Welker, stating that he would continue with dialogue until he feld that option had failed. Kelly won a tough fight in the 2022 campaign cycle and is now seeing his home state return as a battleground for the presidential race once more. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are committing significant resources to winning the state, which Joe Biden won in 2020. The war in Gaza and its continued escalation has the potential to throw a wrench in Harris’s bid for the presidency this time around, as her opponent has hammered the Biden-Harris administration for supposedly allowing major conflicts to break out in the Middle East and eastern Europe under its watch. Separately, concerns and anger over the president’s handling of US-Israel relations is at an all-time high among Democrats, threatening voter enthusiasm particularly in places like Michigan, which has a high Arab-American population and is also a key swing state. Harris’s ascendance to the top of the Democratic ticket has curbed some of the worst of that anger but she still faces deep skepticism from pro-Palestinian voters, which includes large segments of younger voters, after declining to allow a Palestinian-American speak at the Democratic National Convention in August. As October dawns, it looks more likely than ever than that the conflict in Gaza and the inability of Joe Biden’s administration to broker a ceasefire will be a defining issue of the incumbent president’s legacy. Deaths in Gaza have passed 40,000 according to local officials, while Lebanese officials say the death toll in Beirut and southern Lebanon has climbed into the high hundreds after continued attacks from Israel. The US was reported to have been kept in the dark regarding Friday’s strike targeting a top Hezbollah commander, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut. Biden himself was cited by a source familiar with the matter as having been frustrated by the attack, which confounded US efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire, and felt that Israeli officials had humiliated US Secretary of State Antony Blinken with continued escalations, according to Politico.","summary":"Biden feels Blinken ‘humiliated’ but Democrats in Congress still oppose conditioning military aid","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mark-kelly-israel-senate-nbc-b2620982.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/29/23/kelly_mtp_sept2024.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SDimRNAC-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-29 22:31:45","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.492},{"id":257865366,"title":"Team Harris Trolls JD Vance after He Was Reportedly Turned Away by Primanti Bros","text":"The Harris campaign trolled JD Vance after he was reportedly turned away from a restaurant that had previously welcomed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Republican VP candidate JD Vance intended to stop at iconic Pittsburgh restaurant Primanti Bros on Saturday, but when his campaign arrived they were told no cameras and the restaurant didn’t want to be part of a “campaign event,” so Vance ended up shaking hands in the parking lot. “JD Vance intended to make a stop at a Primanti Bros near Pittsburghâ¦ but when they got there, the campaign was told no cams & restaurant didnât want to be part of a âcampaign eventâVance ended up shaking hands outside in parking lot.He has event in Monroeville, PA this aftn,” NBC reporter Doug Adams shared on X. Shaking hands in the parking lot is giving Rudy Giuliani at Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference energy, which is perhaps fitting for a Republican ticket with Donald Trump at the top. But this is made more awkward by the fact that Primanti Bros hosted Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, a visit over which the Harris campaign cheerfully trolled the Republican ticket by posting it above the reporter’s tweet. The joy happened in Moon Township on August 18, 2024, during the Harris-Walz bus tour of Pennsylvania: Nothing beats a stop at Primanti Bros https://t.co/OvpcYLIO69 pic.twitter.com/lfYzVzgF6Y — Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) September 29, 2024 Lest anyone think that Vance was turned away from the restaurant out of spite, CEO Adam Golomb said without advance notice, the staff was confused initially, but that Vance and his team were welcomed into the restaurant and engaged with guests inside and on the property. Their full statement: âPrimantiâs prides itself on being a staple of the Pittsburgh community and a proud American business that has hosted sitting presidents, politicians, and political candidates from across the spectrum for over 90 years. Our doors are open to all patrons who wish to dine with us. Without any advance notice, todayâs campaign stop caused some momentary confusion for our staff. However, Senator Vance and his team were welcomed into our restaurant shortly after and engaged with our guests inside and on the property. Senator Vanceâs supportive comments that our manager got a little nervous given the secret service, police and crowd accurately reflect the nature of what occurred, but we are glad that it was resolved quickly.” However, Allegheny County Republican Party Chair Sam DeMarco said Vance’s visit was spontaneous, but reportedly said “a manager wouldnât let Vance go inside initially and even threatened to call police.” âSenator Vance was absolutely turned away today,â DeMarco said. The manager of the restaurant, a woman, reportedly would not allow Vance out of his car even though reportedly the restaurant had been told two hours prior to expect the Republican Senator. This upset Republicans who began posting on social media that Vance had not been allowed in and so his supporters who were there to meet him cancelled their orders. .@primantibros refused to let @JDVance in to their restaurant full of customers waiting to greet him.

It does seem to be a some kind of misunderstanding, but the PR fail of it lands on top of Vance’s streak of weird food-related campaign stops. The Republican’s donut shop visit was ruthlessly mocked by comedians and the general public because it was so perplexing, starting off with Vance oddly thanking the workers for letting him come in to the worker behind the counter asking not to be on film. This was followed by Vance making cumbersome small talk that sounded like someone fed the words into a robot and they were just spitting back out randomly. Another way of looking at it is: Ron DeSantis walked so JD Vance could run. But in this case, JD gets points for not making it into a big deal and the restaurant CEO has tried to explain it as a mishap. Still, the lingering haze of awkwardness amongst the people follows Vance like a curse, which was highlighted by Team Harris sharing their video of joy at the restaurant. It’s true that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz just have an ease about them, and that makes campaigning a lot easier. The secret to their success, though, is that they are genuinely interested in other people.

But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There’s something wrong with Kamala. And I just don’t know what it is but there is definitely something missing. And you know what, everybody knows it.” With just over a month until the election, Trump is intensifying his use of personal and offensive attacks, even as some Republicans say he’d be better sticking to the issues. His suggestions that political enemies be prosecuted are particularly notable for their departure from norms in the U.S. in which the judicial system is supposed to be protected from political influence. In recent weeks, he has threatened prosecutions of Google for allegedly giving priority to “good stories” about Harris, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and anyone he deems to be “involved in unscrupulous behavior” related to the coming election. His derision of the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket as “stupid,” “weak,” “dumb as a rock” and “lazy” is also a sign of how nasty and personal the final stretch of the campaign may be. His allies have pushed him publicly and privately to talk instead about the economy, immigration and other issues. “I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday when asked about Trump’s comments. “They’re crazy liberal.” When asked whether he approved of the personal attacks on Harris, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sidestepped during an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for America,” said Emmer, who is helping Trump’s running mate JD Vance prepare for Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. “I think Kamala Harris is actually as bad or worse as the administration that we’ve witnessed for the last four years.” When pressed, Emmer said: “I think we should stick to the issues. The issues are, Donald Trump fixed it once. They broke it. He’s going to fix it again. Those are the issues.” Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, running for the Senate as a moderate Republican, brought up Trump’s false claims that Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, had previously played down her Black heritage. Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college, and has identified as both Black and South Asian consistently throughout her political career. “I’ve already called him out when he had the one interview where he was questioning her racial identity, and now he’s questioning her mental competence,” Hogan told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “And I think that’s insulting not only to the vice president but to people who actually do have mental disabilities.” Harris has not commented on Trump’s recent attacks but has said when asked about other comments that it was the “ same old show. The same tired playbook we’ve heard for years with no plan on on how he would address the needs of the American people.” Ahead of the rally on Sunday, some of Trump’s supporters said he often makes offensive remarks. Still, they support his proposals to restrict immigration and said he would have a better handle on the economy. “He says what’s on his mind, and again, sometimes how he says it isn’t appropriate,” said Jeffrey Balogh, 56, who attended the rally with two friends. “But he did the job. He did very well at it.” Tamara Molnar said she thinks Trump is very strong on immigration. As for his insults, Molnar said: “I think everybody has to have some decorum when speaking about other candidates, and I don’t think either side is necessarily innocent on that. There’s a lot of slinging both ways.” At the rally in Erie, Trump said the “invasion” would end and deportations begin if he took office. “Thousands of migrants from the most dangerous countries are destroying the character of small towns and leaving local communities in anguish and in despair,” he said, talking about communities in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Last month, the GOP leader said he was “entitled” to personal attacks against Harris. “As far as the personal attacks, I’m very angry at her because of what she’s done to the country,” he told a news conference then. “I’m very angry at her that she would weaponize the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her. I think I’m entitled to personal attacks.”","summary":"With just over a month until the election, Trump is intensifying his use of personal and offensive attacks.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/29/donald-trump-prosecution-kamala-harris-political-enemies-list-google-meta/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24273701689130-e1727646714512.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 22:03:14","author":"Adriana Gomez Licon,Colleen Long,The Associated Press","authors":["Adriana Gomez Licon","Colleen Long","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":257866070,"title":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric is getting darker as the election approaches, with a call for police to make a 'violent' crackdown on crime","text":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric is getting darker as the election approaches, with a call for police to make a 'violent' crackdown on crime | National News | guampdn.com Skip to main content You have permission to edit this image.

That’s among the running gags in the Saturday Night Live Cut for Time sketch titled “Blonde Dragon People,” which pokes fun at the network-streamer and its star prestige series House of the Dragon. In the six-minute-long video, a group of friends become increasingly confused with the show’s short runtime and long shooting schedule, extraordinarily similar-sounding names and continuity errors. Dorgos, Dormos, Dargomos, Dorgon and Dorman are just a handful of the names that confuse the group, which comprises SNL stars Andrew Dismukes, Heidi Gardner, Devon Walker and newcomer Jane Wickline. As they watch the show’s recap — as played by Chloe Fineman, Kenan Thompson, Bowen Yang and a heavily accented and nonsensical James Austin Johnson (clearly parodying Matt Smith’s Daemon Targaryen in HOTD) — the friends start to lose track of plot points, wondering why there’s a dog with “blonde dreads,” a stock video of a bat in place of a dragon and why “every person and city” has the “same weird name.” “I mean even in Game of Thrones they gave us one guy named John,” Dismukes’ character remarks. However, the host of Season 50’s premiere, Jean Smart, is given the most ridiculous lines yet, stating regally: “Yes, it is I, Dorgos, daughter of Doremos and sister of Daragmos, ruler of the seven five lands and keeper of the 11 three keys. Only I can reclaim the kingdom stolen from Doregmon, by the usurper Dormegon.” She adds at another point, “You will never silence the people of East New Westersouth, from the isles of Rizzoli to the ranches of Hidden Valley,” referencing the drama show Rizzoli & Isles and popular ranch brand. To further confuse matters, in comes surprise guest Andy Samberg (who appeared earlier in the night as the Douglas Emhoff to Maya Rudolph’s Kamala Harris during the Cold Open) and musical guest Jelly Roll, who appear as Orlando Bloom’s Legolas and Sean Astin’s Samwise Gamgee from The Lord of the Rings, respectively. As such, the sketch turns to poking fun at the streaming wars, with Smart remarking that their show is on Amazon Prime instead. Thompson then goes on a short historical tangent as he outlines the transition of HBO from HBO Now, then HBO Go, then HBO Max and now just Max, which Samberg’s character says “sounds bad.” With the recap concluded, the television announces — in signature Westerosi font — that the new season has concluded. “I just looked it up.

The seven swing states are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada.Harris won all seven swing states 15,273 times out of 70,000 simulations of Silver's model run on Sunday. The next most likely scenario is that Trump wins all seven swing states. The former president won all the swing states 13,912 out of the 70,000 simulations.Silver said there is roughly a 40 percent chance that either Harris or Trump will take all of the swing states amid this year's election.Newsweek reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaigns via email for comment on Sunday evening.How Are the Candidates Doing in Each Swing State?Harris currently leads Trump in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to Silver's presidential model. In Michigan, Harris has 48.7 percent of support and the former president has 46.8 percent. In Nevada, Harris has 48.9 percent compared to Trump's 47.1 percent. In Pennsylvania, the vice president has 48.8 percent to Trump's 47.5 percent. And in Wisconsin, Harris has 49.4 percent to Trump's 47.5 percent.Meanwhile, Trump is ahead of Harris in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. In Arizona, the former president has 48.6 percent of support compared to Harris' 47.3 percent. In Georgia, Trump has 48.6 percent while Harris has 47.9 percent. And in North Carolina, Trump has 48.1 percent to the vice president's 47.9 percent.While the numbers slightly change in FiveThirtyEight's current polling averages, both candidates still lead in the same swing states, except for North Carolina where Harris has a 0.1-point lead over Trump (47.6 to 47.5 percent).In Michigan, Harris has 48.1 percent of support to Trump's 46.2 percent. In Nevada, the vice president has 48 percent compared to Trump who has 46.5 percent. In Pennsylvania, Harris has 48.1 percent and the former president has 47.1 percent. And in Wisconsin, Harris has 48.6 percent while Trump has 46.7 percent.Meanwhile, in Arizona, Trump has 47.9 percent of support compared to Harris' 46.9 percent and in Georgia, the former president has 48.1 to Harris' 47.5 percent.How Are the Candidates Doing Nationally?National polls better show what the popular vote will be, which does not ensure an election victory. However, it does gauge how Americans are feeling about each candidate.Silver's presidential model has Harris 3.3 points ahead of Trump on the national stage (49.3 to 46 percent). The vice president is also leading Trump in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average by 2.8 points (48.5 to 45.7 percent).","summary":"Polling analyst Nate Silver said on Sunday the most frequent combination involving the seven swings states is a sweep for Harris.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-donald-trump-swing-state-nate-silver-polls-1961004","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2483162/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 21:47:22","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":257867994,"title":"CBS News Slammed For Saying Vance And Walz Will Have To Fact-Check Each Other at VP Debate","text":"Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz are set to debate this Tuesday. Ahead of the Oct. 1 event, the broadcaster announced that moderators Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan will not fact-check either candidate — Walz and Vance will be responsible for fact-checking one another. The news prompted political scientist Norman Ornstein to lament that though CBS was once “the gold standard for television news,” both “those days and their standards are long gone.” Ornstein isn’t the only voice objecting to CBS’ announcement, with the condemnation of their choice widespread on social media after CNN previously declined to fact-check candidates during the debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump earlier this year, followed by ABC opting to include brief fact-checks from moderators in the presidential debate between Trump and Kamala Harris. According to CBS News’ editorial standards, the moderators are there to facilitate the conversation/debate between the candidates, as well as enforce the debate’s rules. However, they leave the responsibility to the candidates when it comes to fact-checking as part of the broadcast. CBS does plan to offer its own form of live fact-checking — but it will be online, rather than directly from the moderators. New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen chimed in of moderators fact-checking candidates during a debate, “ABC showed it could be done.” As Biden ad writer and columnist Cliff Schecter put it, “CBS announced they’re not a news org, don’t think they need to *give viewers truth or protect democracy.* My cats could moderate, same result as CBS ‘news.’ D campaigns, please take note. No future CNN/CBS debates. If there’s not truth, it’s not a debate, it’s mud wrestling. Speaking of mud, JD Vance has shown he’ll make s–t up anytime, anywhere. Then admit he lied, like Springfield. Good to know CBS is all NOT over that.” Author Gary Shteyngart offered one version of how the debate might go without any fact-checking. “Vance: Haitians eat cats. Walz: Let me spend all my allotted time proving that’s untrue.” Author Denver Riggleman said, “Ironic that @CBSNews airs this segment on ‘safeguarding the truth’ and won’t fact check the Walz-Vance debate — guess real journalism and upholding the integrity of the 4th estate is subordinate to ratings at CBS. F the truth, right?” Perhaps the New Yorker’s Philip Gourevitch summed up the critics’ sentiment best when he tweeted, “CBS announces it no longer is in journalism business.”","summary":"Many observers compared CNN's presidential debate without fact-checks and ABC's debate with them, praising the latter\n\n\nThe post CBS News Slammed For Saying Vance And Walz Will Have To Fact-Check Each Other at VP Debate appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/cbs-news-moderators-vance-walz-fact-check/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tim-walz-jd-vance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 21:45:13","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":257863962,"title":"Melania Trump 'Barely' Visible in Donald Trump's Campaign—Fox News Host","text":"Fox News host Howard Kurtz said on Sunday that former first lady Melania Trump has \"barely been visible\" in her husband's latest presidential campaign.During a Fox News segment, Kurtz highlighted Melania's low public profile when asking Fox News analyst Kat Timpf if the timing of Melania Trump's new memoir is \"odd\" given that she \"has barely been visible in this campaign.\"Timpf replied that \"it is a very odd timing,\" adding that the former first lady \"is a very polished woman.\"\"When she speaks, I feel like I listen because she doesn't speak often,\" Timpf said.The former first lady's memoir, Melania, which is set to be released on October 8, will follow her Slovenian childhood, fashion career, and meeting her now husband, former President Donald Trump. Melania will also offer \"behind-the-scenes stories from her time in the White House, shedding light on her advocacy work and the causes close to her heart.\"Kurtz's and Timpf's comments come just three days after Melania promoted the book in a Fox News interview on Thursday, marking her first media interview in two years. As Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social account on Sunday morning, Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt who interviewed the former first lady on Thursday, will air a special one-hour segment on Melania at 10 p.m. ET this evening.Since leaving the White House, Melania has remained fairly shielded from the public eye.She has not appeared on much of the campaign trail, in contrast to second gentleman Doug Emhoff, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance's wife Usha Vance, and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz's wife Gwen Walz, who have made numerous public campaign appearances.In July, Melania appeared at the Republican National Convention where her husband was named the GOP nominee just a few days after the first assassination attempt on his life, but she did not take the podium and speak.In a 2023 interview on NBC News' Meet the Press, Donald Trump described his wife's political appearances by saying, \"She's a private person, a great person, a very confident person, and she loves our country very much.\" He also noted that she would be join the campaign trail when \"it's appropriate.\"Newsweek has submitted an online request to contact Melania Trump on Sunday.As of Sunday, Melania is ranked #1 on the Amazon book best sellers. Readers can pre-order it now for delivery after the publication date, which is less than a month ahead of Election Day on November 5.Earlier this month, Donald Trump implied during his speech at a campaign rally in Uniondale, New York, that he had not yet read the memoir, saying, \"Go out and get her book. She just wrote a book; I hope she said good things about [me]. I don't know, I didn't, so busy. She just wrote a book called Melania go out and buy it, it's great.\"In her Thursday Fox interview promoting the book, Melania described Donald Trump as a \"family man\" who had \"kindness and positivity.\" She also addressed the two assassination attempts on him, both of which she found out about via TV. She told Earhardt, \"I think something was watching over him. It's almost like the country really needs him.\"Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, are in an extremely tight race for the White House.

Butler is CEO of the National Tree Company, and, like many businesses, his is counting on shipments that are en route from Asia but won't reach their ports before an expected strike by longshoremen starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday. The company, based in New Jersey, is an importer of artificial Christmas trees and other holiday decorations. If a strike were to last just a few days, there might be time afterward to unload the trees, transport them to warehouses and have them ready for customers this season. Yet if a strike were to keep ports closed until, say, November, about 150,000 trees might not arrive in time for the peak shopping season, imposing costs on National Tree and other businesses. In a worst-case scenario, those costs, multiplied across industries, could fuel inflation and pressure the U.S. economy. “Definitely not an ideal situation,” Butler said. National Tree already has stockpiled or delivered most of the roughly 2 million artificial trees it sells each year. But it would lose revenue if 150,000 of the trees got stuck in the pipeline. Other businesses face the same predicament, with goods that could be stranded at sea if 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association make good on their threat to strike. They could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States. (West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren't involved in the strike.) A prolonged strike would force companies to pay shippers for the delays, and goods could arrive too late for the high point of holiday shopping season. On Friday, top Biden administration officials met with port operators and told them they should negotiate with the union ahead of Tuesday, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing meeting. Butler says he's hoping for an agreement or for government intervention to halt a strike. But the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents shippers and ports, and the longshoremen’s union haven't met since June. And no talks are scheduled. The union is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and moving containers in the loading and unloading of freight. The Toy Association, the nation’s leading toy trade group, was among about 200 organizations that asked President Joe Biden in a letter this month to work with both sides to reach an agreement. The National Grain and Feed Association also urged Biden to take action to avert a strike, which would come just as harvest season gets underway. Their push has put Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a sensitive position: Both have courted union support and don't want to be seen as pressuring the longshoremen to reach a settlement. Yet if an extended strike were to cause shortages of consumer goods or fuel high inflation, it could cost Harris votes in the November election. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order to suspend the strike for an 80-day cooling-off period. Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that the administration has never invoked the act and isn't considering it now. Biden and Congress did step in two years ago to block a looming freight rail strike and force those workers to accept a deal because of widespread fears that a rail strike would have damaged the economy. Alex Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who served as a Labor Department official under Biden, suggested that the administration will follow the playbook it used in talks last year between West Coast ports and the union there: Mediating negotiations without directly intervening. Greg Ahearn, CEO of the Toy Association, said a strike would happen at a critical moment for toy sellers and makers: Up to 60% of annual sales occur from October through December. Though some toy companies shipped goods earlier, Ahearn said a strike would make it hard to replenish hot-selling items. A strike, he warned, could raise toy prices “based on scarcity and increased costs.” At National Tree, Butler and his crew began preparing for a strike in July. They accelerated shipments for everything they could. But one major retail client, he said, asked for trees early. And until recently, factories in China and elsewhere couldn’t produce the rest of National Tree’s orders. Ships containing the trees are on the way to New York but won't get there before Tuesday. A prolonged strike, Butler said, would force most of the trees to be warehoused until next Christmas season. A longshoremen's strike would further distress a global supply chain that has already endured slowdowns from attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. Those attacks have all but shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. The attacks are forcing longer transit times for vessels that must navigate around the Cape of Good Hope to reach East Coast and Gulf Coast ports. A dockworkers' strike, Gold said, could prove even more damaging than the pandemic-induced port congestion in 2021 and 2022, when cargo was allowed to move, albeit slowly. Eastern ports could be left at a standstill. Gold noted that carriers are already announcing surcharges on containers to address potential disruptions, a trend that could elevate inflation. Many retailers might find it difficult to charge customers more to make up for those expenses. Most vulnerable, Gold said, would be small businesses that don’t import directly and lack the financial resources to incur higher costs. Shippers could reroute some cargo to West Coast ports. But those ports couldn't come close to absorbing the additional cargo. The Port of Los Angeles, for example, moved 960,000 containers in August — about 80% of its capacity — said Gene Seroka, its executive director. The major Western railroads, Union Pacific and BNSF, have added capacity to their systems to handle more freight as imports have increased. Eastern railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern say they can move cars and crews to handle more freight coming to Chicago from the West. But it’s not clear just how much more the railroads can manage. In any case, Butler said, it would be too costly for him to ship trees across the country by rail. Taylor Green, co-founder of landscaping company Artificial Grass Solutions in Los Angeles, which imports artificial turf, said he bought 25% more turf than usual to ensure there would be enough for clients’ projects. He also made arrangements with alternative suppliers in case the strike goes on indefinitely. If it does, Green said, price increases would likely be necessary. Still, like some larger retailers and manufacturers, Artificial Grass says it's better prepared for shortages than it was during the pandemic. “We’ve learned to be proactive rather than reactive,” Green said.

Singers Alanis Morissette and Halle Bailey were scheduled to perform at the fundraiser sometime Sunday afternoon, according to the Deadline website, which attributed the information to Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Harris campaign co-chair. The trip to L.A. was Harris’ first since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. According to an invitation obtained by Deadline, tickets ranged from $500 per person to as high as $1 million to receive four tickets, attend a reception with Harris, lunch and a photo. Proceeds will benefit the Harris Victory Fund, which is a joint committee that includes Harris’ campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties. Harris arrived at LAX on Saturday after speaking for nearly 30 minutes at a sold-out fundraiser at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco where tickets were up to $250,000 each. She told the gathering that she would restore Roe v. Wade if elected and attacked the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, over his “concept” for health care and what she described as his lack of plans to meet the needs of the American people, according to media reports. “For every story we hear of women suffering under Trump Abortion Bans, there are so many more untold,” Harris posted on X, formerly Twitter. “To those women, I say: You are not alone. We see you, and we are here with you.” While in Arizona Friday, Harris made a high-profile visit to the U.S.-Mexico border. She is expected to host a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday night, with a return to Washington set for Monday night. “This race is as close as it could possibly be,” she said Saturday to a raucous crowd of donors. “This is a margin-of-error race.” “I reject the false choice that we must decide between securing our border and creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly, and humane.,” Harris noted on X. “We can and we must do both.” While Harris stumped in the West, Trump escalated his personal attacks on his Democratic rival on Sunday by repeating an insult that she was “mentally impaired” while also saying she should be “impeached and prosecuted.” Trump’s rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, took on similar themes as an event one day earlier that he described himself as a “dark speech.” He told a cheering crowd that Harris was responsible for an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border and “she should be impeached and prosecuted for her actions.” “Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired,” he added. “Sad. But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There’s something wrong with Kamala. And I just don’t know what it is but there is definitely something missing. And you know what, everybody knows it.” With just over a month until the election, Trump is intensifying his use of personal and offensive attacks, even as some Republicans say they’d prefer he’d stick to the issues. His allies have pushed him publicly and privately to talk instead about the economy, immigration and other concerns. “I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday when asked about Trump’s comments. “They’re crazy liberal.” After Trump’s remarks, the Harris campaign declined to comment on his personal attacks. A campaign spokesperson, Sarafina Chitika, said in a statement that Trump offered “darkness” to voters rather than inspiration. The American Association of People with Disabilities, a nonpartisan advocacy group, criticized Trump’s comments as both inaccurate and harmful. “Trump holds the ableist, false belief that if a person has a disability, they are less human and less worthy of dignity,” said Maria Town, the group’s president and CEO, in a statement. “Presidential history indicates that we’ve had many presidents who had disabilities.” On Monday, Harris was expected to discuss racial identity, police brutality and more on the sports and pop culture podcast “All the Smoke,” which is hosted by two retired NBA players. The nearly hourlong interview with Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, will be released Monday and aligns with her pattern of speaking with nontraditional media and their niche audiences. Appearing on “All the Smoke” could help her reach more Black men, a base that has been increasingly courted by former President Donald Trump. “In previous times, someone would have gone to a Black barbershop or a soul food restaurant,” said Todd Boyd, a race and pop culture scholar and professor at the University of Southern California. “But these days, certain podcasts appeal to certain audience members.” Kobe Bryant, Snoop Dogg and Will Smith have all been interviewed on “All the Smoke,” which began in 2019 and has more than 1 million YouTube subscribers. “All the Smoke,” which has become one of the more recognizable athlete-led podcasts in a saturated marketplace, typically brings on guests from sports and entertainment to discuss topics in those areas. The show’s hosts, Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, spent portions of their long NBA careers with the Golden State Warriors while Harris was the district attorney of San Francisco. The vice president, who was born in Oakland, where the Warriors played for 47 seasons, has been a vocal fan of the team, and coach Steve Kerr endorsed her at the Democratic National Convention. “To step into this political realm and understand the importance and how some people are either all the way in it or all the way out of it, I’m really interested to see what our fans have to say,” Barnes said in an interview with The New York Times.

Citing three experts who analysed videos of Friday’s strikes, posted by the Israeli Air Force, the Post said on Sunday that at least some of the bombs were US-made “BLU-109s and JDAM guidance kits”. BLU-109s are bunker-buster heavy bombs and JDAM kits are guidance systems that attach to munitions to help attack a specific target. A 2,000-pound bomb has a destruction radius of 35 metres (115 feet), according to the Project on Defense Alternatives (PDA), which conducts defence policy research and analysis. Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime chief, was killed in Friday’s strike on the group’s underground headquarters. Israel dropped what local media said were “bunker-busting” bombs and flattened about six buildings, while trying to kill Nasrallah. The attack also devastated the entire neighbourhood, turning several apartment buildings into rubble. The Washington Post quoted NR Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services – a group providing analysis on arms and munitions – as saying that “initial available videos of the strike show that numerous large air-delivered bombs were used”. He added that they were meant to penetrate through a “heavily protected space”. US officials have repeatedly said that they received no prior notice about Friday’s Israeli strikes in Lebanon. But US President Joe Biden and his Vice President Kamala Harris have welcomed the assassination of Nasrallah, calling it a “measure of justice”. The Biden administration has been facing increasing criticism from rights advocates over its unconditional arming of Israel, which has killed more than 41,500 people in Gaza and hundreds in Lebanon. Washington stopped a single shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel earlier this year over concerns about their use in densely populated areas in Gaza. The Biden administration later approved the release of 500-pound (227 kg) bombs which were part of the same transfer. Israel’s Ministry of Defense said on Thursday that it had secured an $8.7bn US military aid package – days after it launched a massive attack that killed hundreds of people in south Lebanon and Beirut and displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians. Separately, the Pentagon said on Sunday that it has “increased the readiness of additional US forces to deploy” to the Middle East. “The United States retains the capability to deploy forces on short notice,” the Pentagon said in a statement. “The Department of Defense continues to maintain a significant amount of capability in the region and to dynamically adjust our force posture based on the evolving security situation,” it added. Later in the day, Biden said he would speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stressing that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. “It has to be,” Biden told reporters as he boarded Air Force One for Washington. “We really have to avoid it.” The president’s statements come as Israeli air strikes across Lebanon intensified on Sunday. The Biden administration has maintained support for Israel and its attacks across the region as Washington continues to call for de-escalation.","summary":"Washington Post reports the Israeli army possibly dropped heavy US bombs in the attack, which razed buildings in Beirut.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/29/israel-likely-used-us-made-bombs-in-nasrallah-assassination-report?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-09-27T155257Z_1975291258_RC229AA5WPSZ_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-1727455185.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 21:40:55","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":257863716,"title":"Republicans condemn Trump’s ‘insulting’ and false claims on Harris’ mental fitness","text":"Several Republicans have sought to distance themselves from “insulting” comments made by Donald Trump, in which he claimed Kamala Harris was “mentally disabled.” Many have urged the former president to “stick to the issues” of his campaign, rather than reverting time and time again to personal attacks on Harris.

Perhaps the strongest rebuke came from former governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who is in a tight race for the Senate. “I think that’s insulting not only to the vice president, but to people that actually do have mental disabilities,” he said. “Trump’s divisive rhetoric is something we can do without.” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, also pushed back on the personal nature of Trump’s attack. \"I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,\" Graham told CNN. Graham added that while he did not think Harris was crazy, he did think her policies were. Representative Tom Emmer — a Minnesota Republican who has been helping Trump’s running mate JD Vance get ready for his debate with Tim Walz, shared a similar sentiment. \"I think we should stick to the issues,\" he told ABC News. The comments also drew criticism from advocacy group the American Association of People with Disabilities. Maria Town, the president and CEO of AAPD said Trump’s language was “ableist.” \"Donald Trump’s ableist comments today say far more about him and his inaccurate, hateful biases against disabled people than it does about Vice President Harris, or any person with a disability,” she said in a statement shared with The Independent. “Trump holds the ableist, false belief that if a person has a disability, they are less human and less worthy of dignity. AAPD continues to call for the leadership of both parties in the 2024 election to condemn the use of ableist language like Trump used today [Saturday].” Others recalled Trump’s previous, and similar, attacks on president Joe Biden’s cognitive ability. “Trump made a great deal of the cognitive abilities of Joe Biden,” said Eric Holder, the former attorney general who served in the Obama administration. Referring to the former president’s own cognitive state, he added: “If this is where he is now, where is he going to be three and four years from now?” While campaigning against Biden, Trump called multiple times for the president to take cognitive ability tests, while boasting that he had aced one in 2018. At a rally in June Trump suggested Biden “should have to take a cognitive test,\" only to confuse the doctor administered the test to him in the next sentence. The former president went on to refer to Texas Republican Representative Ronny Jackson, who was the White House physician for part of his presidency, as \"Ronny Johnson.”","summary":"Many have urged the former president to ‘stick to the issues’ of his campaign, rather than reverting time and time again to personal attacks on Harris","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-mental-disability-speech-republican-criticism-b2620968.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/29/19/EEUU-ELECCIONES_2024-TRUMP_80448.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VL7CHLfe-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-29 21:35:51","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":257864294,"title":"Trump escalates attacks on Harris' mental fitness and suggests she should be prosecuted","text":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump escalated his personal attacks on his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, on Sunday by repeating an insult that she was “mentally impaired” while also saying she should be “impeached and prosecuted.\" Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, took on similar themes as an event one day earlier that he described himself as a “dark speech.” He told a cheering crowd that Harris was responsible for an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border and \"she should be impeached and prosecuted for her actions.” “Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired,” he added. “Sad. But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There’s something wrong with Kamala. And I just don’t know what it is but there is definitely something missing. And you know what, everybody knows it.” With just over a month until the election, Trump is intensifying his use of personal and offensive attacks, even as some Republicans say he'd be better sticking to the issues. His suggestions that political enemies be prosecuted are particularly notable for their departure from norms in the U.S. in which the judicial system is supposed to be protected from political influence. In recent weeks, he has threatened prosecutions of Google for allegedly giving priority to “good stories” about Harris, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and anyone he deems to be “involved in unscrupulous behavior” related to the coming election. Trump has long threatened legal action against his rivals, including President Joe Biden and his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton. This month he threatened to jail those “involved in unscrupulous behavior” this election, including election workers, lawyers, political operatives, donors, and voters, yet again sowing doubt about the integrity of the election, even though fraud is very rare But he also has many legal problems of his own. He was convicted in May of falsifying business records in a hush money case in New York, with a sentencing scheduled for Nov 26. Three other cases are pending against him, including one tossed out by a federal judge following a Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity. The Justice Department is appealing. The other cases are on hold. On Sunday, he acknowledged he might lose the election, saying: “If she wins, it's not going to be so pleasant for me, but I don't care.” His derision of the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket as “stupid,” “weak,” “dumb as a rock” and “lazy” is also a sign of how nasty and personal the final stretch of the campaign may be. His allies have pushed him publicly and privately to talk instead about the economy, immigration and other issues. “I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN's “State of the Union\" Sunday when asked about Trump's comments. “They’re crazy liberal.” When asked whether he approved of the personal attacks on Harris, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sidestepped during an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for America,” said Emmer, who is helping Trump’s running mate JD Vance prepare for Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. “I think Kamala Harris is actually as bad or worse as the administration that we’ve witnessed for the last four years.” When pressed, Emmer said: “I think we should stick to the issues. The issues are, Donald Trump fixed it once. They broke it. He’s going to fix it again. Those are the issues.” Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, running for the Senate as a moderate Republican, brought up Trump's false claims that Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, had previously played down her Black heritage. Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college, and has identified as both Black and South Asian consistently throughout her political career. “I’ve already called him out when he had the one interview where he was questioning her racial identity, and now he’s questioning her mental competence,\" Hogan told CBS' “Face the Nation.” “And I think that’s insulting not only to the vice president but to people who actually do have mental disabilities.” Harris has not commented on Trump’s recent attacks but has said when asked about other comments that it was the “ same old show. The same tired playbook we’ve heard for years with no plan on on how he would address the needs of the American people.” Ahead of the rally on Sunday, some of Trump's supporters said he often makes offensive remarks. Still, they support his proposals to restrict immigration and said he would have a better handle on the economy. “He says what’s on his mind, and again, sometimes how he says it isn’t appropriate,” said Jeffrey Balogh, 56, who attended the rally with two friends. “But he did the job. He did very well at it.” Tamara Molnar said she thinks Trump is very strong on immigration. As for his insults, Molnar said: “I think everybody has to have some decorum when speaking about other candidates, and I don’t think either side is necessarily innocent on that. There’s a lot of slinging both ways.” At the rally in Erie, Trump said the “invasion” would end and deportations begin if he took office. “Thousands of migrants from the most dangerous countries are destroying the character of small towns and leaving local communities in anguish and in despair,” he said, talking about communities in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Last month, the GOP leader said he was “entitled” to personal attacks against Harris. “As far as the personal attacks, I’m very angry at her because of what she’s done to the country,\" he told a news conference then. “I’m very angry at her that she would weaponize the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her. I think I’m entitled to personal attacks.” Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed from New York. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I didn’t vote for him in 2016 or 2020,” Hogan said during an appearance on CBS News’s Face the Nation. “And I’ve made that pretty clear.” However, he stopped short of issuing an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. “I’ve said neither one of the two candidates has earned my vote. And the voters in the country are going to be able to make that decision,” Hogan said. Since launching his Senate campaign, Hogan has touted his independence from the Republican Party. He reiterated this on Sunday, saying the race isn’t about “red versus blue.” “I’m concerned about the red, white, and blue,” he said. “And I’m willing to put country over party. And I am hoping that the voters will be willing to do the same thing.” Hogan’s remarks came just one day after Trump escalated his personal attacks against Harris, a tactic he has stuck with since she launched her campaign over the summer. Trump held a rally in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, on Saturday, where he made false accusations about the vice president’s mental capacity. He started out by saying President Joe Biden “became mentally impaired.” Whereas Harris, Trump said, “was born that way.” “Kamala was born that way. She was born that way,” Trump said. “And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this.” Hogan slammed Trump’s comments, accusing the former president of using divisive rhetoric. “I think all of that is outrageous and unacceptable. And I’ve already called him out when he had the one interview where he was questioning her racial identity, and now he’s questioning her mental competence,” he said. “And I think that’s insulting, not only to the vice president but to people that actually do have mental disabilities.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “Trump’s divisive rhetoric is something that we could do without.

It’s why they want to change Washington, and it’s why I’m running,” he added. Despite Hogan’s criticism of the former president, Trump endorsed Hogan in June. At the time, Trump said he would like to see Hogan win and that he had a “good chance.” Hogan’s campaign rejected the endorsement.","summary":"Former Maryland Gov.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Hannah Mcdonald Published:22:10 BST, 29 September 2024 |Updated:22:22 BST, 29 September 2024 e-mail View comments Cruz Beckham has embarked on an age-gap romance with Brazilian singer-songwriter Jackie Apostle. But the 28-year-old star's recent look bore a slight resemblance to that of Cruz's mother Victoria, 50. The youngest Beckham son, 19, is believed to have been dating Jackie since June, and appeared loved up as they supported Victoria at her show in the French capital on Friday. Jackie looked stunning for the show in a sleek white satin gown with her dark brown locks tossed up in a loose bun. But the look was reminiscent of a picture of Victoria in a similar backless satin gown and topknot hairdo as she looked over her shoulder by a mirror. Cruz Beckham has embarked on an age-gap romance with Brazillian singer-songwriter Jackie Apostle - but she donned a look reminiscent of a picture of Victoria in a similar backless satin gown and topknot hairdo as she looked over her shoulder by a mirror According to HELLO! Jackie is almost a decade older than Cruz, who turns 20 in February, and will be celebrating her 29th birthday next month. Writing '[Jackie] was formerly a member of Brazilian girl band Schutz, [and] is nine years her boyfriend's senior. 'In an Instagram post introducing the members of Schutz shared to Instagram in 2022, Jackie is introduced as being 26 years old, making her 28 now. The star will turn 29 on 18 October'. Jackie has been spotted numerous times with the Beckham's during Fashion Week and even wore one of Victoria's chic dresses to her runway show. Following the catwalk presentation she took to Instagram writing: 'the most beautiful show and the most beautiful dress. Congratulations @victoriabeckham'. It comes just days after MailOnline revealed that Cruz's former girlfriend Bby Ivy claimed the aspiring musician 'cheated' her in a bombshell social media video. Norwegian singer Bby Ivy, real name Viktoria Reitan, posted a video of the pair kissing on TikTok, while Cruz was strumming a guitar, alongside a caption which read: 'This is how we were together and he still cheated.' Underneath the video, Bby Ivy, who has nearly 60,000 followers on TikTok, received support from fans who left comments on the short video. One wrote: 'I'm sorry baby,' while another added: 'You deserve the world and more.' The youngest Beckham son, 19, is believed to have been dating the Brazilian singer-songwriter since June, and appeared loved up as they supported his mother Victoria at her show on Friday Following the catwalk presentation she took to Instagram writing: 'the most beautiful show and the most beautiful dress.

Another video shared on Issey's page shows Bby Ivy and Issey on a night out together, alongside the caption: 'When he thought you would never find out about each other but now you're best friends.' Cruz was linked to Issey, 19, in February earlier this year, weeks before he was pictured with Bby Ivy, including at a family meal in Paris with the Beckham clan. In a video shared to her page, Bby Ivy claimed her ex-boyfriend had been 'seeing another girl the whole time', but did not name Cruz directly.

Before his relationship with Bby Ivy, Cruz was previously dating social media star Issey as well as actress and dancer Skye Ladell, 23.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Hannah Mcdonald Published:22:10 BST, 29 September 2024 |Updated:22:40 BST, 29 September 2024 e-mail View comments Cruz Beckham has embarked on an age-gap romance with Brazilian singer-songwriter Jackie Apostle. But the 28-year-old star's recent look bore a slight resemblance to that of Cruz's mother Victoria, 50. The youngest Beckham son, 19, is believed to have been dating Jackie since June, and appeared loved up as they supported Victoria at her show in the French capital on Friday. Jackie looked stunning for the show in a sleek white satin gown with her dark brown locks tossed up in a loose bun. But the look was reminiscent of a picture of Victoria in a similar backless satin gown and topknot hairdo as she looked over her shoulder by a mirror. Cruz Beckham has embarked on an age-gap romance with Brazillian singer-songwriter Jackie Apostle - but she donned a look reminiscent of a picture of Victoria in a similar backless satin gown and topknot hairdo as she looked over her shoulder by a mirror According to HELLO! Jackie is almost a decade older than Cruz, who turns 20 in February, and will be celebrating her 29th birthday next month. Writing '[Jackie] was formerly a member of Brazilian girl band Schutz, [and] is nine years her boyfriend's senior. 'In an Instagram post introducing the members of Schutz shared to Instagram in 2022, Jackie is introduced as being 26 years old, making her 28 now. The star will turn 29 on 18 October'. Jackie has been spotted numerous times with the Beckham's during Fashion Week and even wore one of Victoria's chic dresses to her runway show. Following the catwalk presentation she took to Instagram writing: 'the most beautiful show and the most beautiful dress. Congratulations @victoriabeckham'. It comes just days after MailOnline revealed that Cruz's former girlfriend Bby Ivy claimed the aspiring musician 'cheated' her in a bombshell social media video. Norwegian singer Bby Ivy, real name Viktoria Reitan, posted a video of the pair kissing on TikTok, while Cruz was strumming a guitar, alongside a caption which read: 'This is how we were together and he still cheated.' Underneath the video, Bby Ivy, who has nearly 60,000 followers on TikTok, received support from fans who left comments on the short video. One wrote: 'I'm sorry baby,' while another added: 'You deserve the world and more.' The youngest Beckham son, 19, is believed to have been dating the Brazilian singer-songwriter since June, and appeared loved up as they supported his mother Victoria at her show on Friday Following the catwalk presentation she took to Instagram writing: 'the most beautiful show and the most beautiful dress. Congratulations @victoriabeckham' The 28-year-old star's recent look bore a slight resemblance to that of Cruz's mother Victoria, 50 - and similarities could be drawn from other snaps According to HELLO! Jackie is almost a decade older than Cruz, who turns 20 in February, and will be celebrating her 29th birthday next month Cruz and new girlfriend Jackie have a significant age gap it's been reported, after she joined his famous family for Paris Fashion Week The video was reposted by another of Cruz's ex-girlfriends Issey Moloney, who she appears to have found solidarity with and befriended in the wake of their split. Another video shared on Issey's page shows Bby Ivy and Issey on a night out together, alongside the caption: 'When he thought you would never find out about each other but now you're best friends.' Cruz was linked to Issey, 19, in February earlier this year, weeks before he was pictured with Bby Ivy, including at a family meal in Paris with the Beckham clan. In a video shared to her page, Bby Ivy claimed her ex-boyfriend had been 'seeing another girl the whole time', but did not name Cruz directly. It comes just days after MailOnline revealed that Cruz's former girlfriend Bby Ivy claimed the aspiring musician 'cheated' her in a bombshell social media video In another recent Tik Tok post shared on Thursday, Bby Ivy revealed she was in Paris for fashion week but felt 'stressed' and had cancelled all of the days events. Bby went on to reveal she felt 'overwhelmed' and had been on the edge of tears all day at the thought of leaving her hotel room. Before his relationship with Bby Ivy, Cruz was previously dating social media star Issey as well as actress and dancer Skye Ladell, 23. Cruz's run of glamorous dates comes after he split from Tana Holding, 19, in October 2023. InstagramCruz Beckham Share or comment on this article: Remind you of anyone, Cruz?

Here's why that matters.","text":"In recent presidential election cycles, the level of ticket-splitting — where people vote candidates from different parties on their ballot — has plummeted.Some 20 years ago, then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry lost GOP-leaning states like Arkansas and North Dakota even as the incumbent Democratic senators in those states — Blanche Lincoln and Byron Dorgan — coasted to victory.This sort of ticket-splitting was generally not seen as atypical.But by 2020, things were different. Maine was the only state that year where voters backed a presidential candidate from one party (Democrat Joe Biden) and a Senate candidate from another party (Republican Susan Collins).In November, a slew of incumbent Democratic senators are running for reelection in states where the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remains competitive.However, there's an interesting dynamic at play in pivotal swing states like Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania headed into November: A relatively small but significant bloc of Trump voters are also backing Democratic Senate candidates.While many of these Trump voters have long been loyal to the former president, many of the Democrats running have more moderate political brands that are — so far — giving them polling advantages over their GOP counterparts.Here's a look at how pro-Trump ticket-splitters could invariably aid a Harris presidency should she win the general election, or cause trouble for a Trump agenda should he emerge as the victor.Even before Biden ended his reelection bid, swing-state Democrats running in the most competitive Senate races were generally leading in the polls.While Biden struggled in his matchup against Trump, many voters earlier this year had already began to differentiate between the presidential race and down-ballot candidates.Trump has eagerly thrown his support behind GOP Senate candidates like Kari Lake of Arizona, Mike Rogers of Michigan, Bernie Moreno of Ohio, and David McCormick of Pennsylvania. And he's implored his supporters to vote for these candidates.But Democrats in these races have largely defied the conventional political norms of today.According to the latest New York Times/Siena College survey of five competitive Senate races, an average of 7% of likely voters indicated they would back Trump while also pulling the lever for a Democratic Senate candidate.The polled states included Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Of the five states, Ohio is most likely to vote for Trump, as he easily won it in both 2016 and 2020. And the most recent Times/Siena survey showed Trump with a six-point advantage over Harris (50% to 44%) in the Buckeye State among likely voters.But in that same poll, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown had a four-point edge over Moreno among likely voters (47% to 43%). Brown also won over 13% of Republicans in the poll, a level of crossover support that helps him in the red-trending state.The Times/Siena poll also showed Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego leading Lake by six points (49% to 43%) in Arizona. In Michigan, Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin led Rogers by five points (47% to 42%). And in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Sens. Bob Casey Jr. and Tammy Baldwin led their GOP opponents by nine and seven points among likely voters, respectively.Should Democrats run the table in the most competitive swing-state Senate races, it'll leave them on the cusp of holding on to a majority.For Democrats, winning both safe and swing-state races — along with Ohio — would get the party to 49 seats. Then they'd need Montana Sen. Jon Tester to win reelection to get to 50 seats. (Tester is currently locked in a tough reelection battle against Republican Tim Sheehy in a state that Trump is expected to win by double digits.)Democrats are now trying to expand their Senate map by investing more money in Florida and Texas, which lean Republican on the presidential level but are poised to have close Senate races.Holding a majority is the best-case scenario for Harris should she win the election, as she would need a Democratic-led Senate to not only move through most of her agenda but also approve the bulk of her judicial appointments.If Harris wins in November and Democrats win exactly 50 seats, then Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would deliver a majority by virtue of the vice-presidential tie-breaking abilities.And Democrats would be able to thank some of Trump's voters for that.But should Trump win the election and pro-Trump ticket-splitters help Democrats keep their majority, it would pump the brakes on a conservative agenda.A Democratic Senate would serve as a check on Trump. If Democrats flip the House, that chamber would be another check on him. And even if Republicans keep the House in a potential Trump second term, they'd clash with a Democratic-led Senate on a range of issues.So ticket-splitters who are backing Trump now have the potential to become one of the most important voting blocs of the 2024 election.","summary":"A relatively small but significant bloc of Trump's backers are also voting for Democratic Senate candidates.

Yesterday (September 28), during Saturday Night Live‘s season premiere the show’s writers put their own spin on it. In a comical talk show sketch, Bowen Yang channelled the “365” singer to tackle the biggest political headlines. Of course, the unlikely merger of Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign and Charli XCX’s approval of it was mentioned in the Talk Talk Show sketch. However, as the Charli XCX fill-in Yang quickly transitioned to other more pressing issues like what other political news was deemed “brat or nat.” In a lighting round, Yang declared Hunter Biden’s laptop “brat,” Mark Robinson’s search history “nat.” Barron Trump going to NYU “brat,” but NYU as an institution “nat.” Then Yang decided on the fates of Amy Adams’ performance in Nightb*tch, which he crowned “brat.” Unsurprisingly, Yang marked Eric Adams’ indictment a flat out “nat.” Charli XCX wasn’t the only musician present in spirit through the sketch, her Sweat Tour co-headliner Troye Sivan appeared by way of Sarah Sherman’s portrayal. Although Jean Smart (playing “queer nightlife icon” Susanne Bartsch) and Chloe Fineman (playing “hetero CNN icon” Kaitlan Collins) were also featured in the sketch, it was Ego Nwodim that stole the sketch.

Forty-six percent of Republicans and 27% of Democrats said they would refuse to accept any election result unless their candidate wins. That’s disconcerting, but it’s easy to write off that finding as pre-election frustration—the same way thousands of people swear they’ll move to Canada if their candidate loses. But dig into those numbers and there are some terrifying numbers to be crunched. Of the 1,046 Americans polled, 14% of Republicans and 11% of Democrats said they would be comfortable taking “action” to overturn an election result they didn’t like. Combined, this represents a significant share of Americans who could, at least in theory, rationalize away violent actions like the insurrection we saw on Jan. 6, 2021—as long as they were the ones doing the rioting. “You can see quite low levels of trust in the process, particularly among Republicans, but also, in some areas, among Democrats,” Elizabeth Andersen, director of the World Justice Project, told USA Today. “It’s not zero by any stretch of the imagination.” Though its findings were just released, the survey was conducted from June 10 to 18. That means it was fielded well before President Joe Biden’s departure from the presidential race, Kamala Harris’ emergence as the first major-party Black female nominee for president, and two assassination attempts against Donald Trump. It also predates a wave of anti-immigrant panic, stoked by right-wing politicians and media, that has resulted in numerous bomb threats against schools, government offices, and supermarkets in Springfield, Ohio. In other words, it’s easy to imagine the survey’s numbers looking even worse today. Yet, unlike flustered Democrats, the Republican Party has taken unmistakable steps in recent years to not only excuse election-related violence and partisan intimidation but encourage it. The Washington Post found multiple examples of Trump excusing and encouraging violence against his opponents since 2015. Trump’s recent hoax about Haitian immigrants eating cats led to so many threats against Ohio’s Haitian population that Republican Gov. Mike DeWine condemned Trump in a New York Times op-ed. “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there,” he wrote. None of this chaos is lost on weary Americans. A new poll from Quinnipiac University published on Tuesday found that 7 in 10 likely voters expressed serious concern about the possibility of election-related violence—and that includes 59% of Republican voters. Instead of enthusiasm, most voters seem to now feel a mix of anxiety and dread. That could play a major role in suppressing Election Day turnout, as skittish voters choose to stay safe at home instead of risking a possible conflict at their polling place. But all is not lost. There are ways to minimize the dangers and calm voters’ concerns, this cycle and beyond. Local law enforcement can proactively address and debunk the most extreme right-wing conspiracies. The events in Springfield have shown us that, pushed to their limit, local police officials, elected leaders, and even a Republican governor can push back on Trump’s dangerous lies. Local law enforcement is the first line of defense when it comes to protecting the lives of election workers, who are often just volunteers eager to support their community. Republicans will reject every opportunity to police the extremists in their ranks. Many of the lawmakers who helped motivate the Jan. 6 rioters have thrived in a culture of right-wing lawlessness. It will be up to the American people to demand their safety from the dwindling number of elected officials who still care about our democracy. The clock is ticking.","summary":"A newly published survey by the nonpartisan World Justice Project reveals that election denialism and violent feelings among Americans are more widespread than initially thought.\n\n\n\nForty-six percent of Republicans and 27% of Democrats said they would refuse to accept any election result unless their candidate wins.

After being banned by other platforms, Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter (now called X) permitted her to rejoin; since then, she has garnered over a million followers. Apart from this, a number of Trump's Republican backers expressed dismay last week when they saw that former president Donald Trump joined by Loomer on many travels. Some other interesting facts about Loomer that are unknown to the general public are as follows. 1. Several Social Media Platforms Banned Loomer Most social media, ridesharing, and money transfer sites banned the far-right online agitator for hate speech. Known for her guerilla journalism with the far-right activist organization Project Veritas, Loomer poses as an investigative journalist. Following accusations that her postings against Muslims included hate speech, Loomer was deactivated from all three social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Eventually, Lyft, PayPal, and Venmo were all included in the prohibition. As reported by The Palm Beach Post, Loomer has been unrepentant about the substance of any of her postings and has referred to herself as 'the most banned woman on the internet' throughout her campaign. 2. The Republican Presidential Candidate Nearly Hired Loomer Trump wanted to bring her on board in April 2023, according to The New York Times, but he ultimately decided against it after hearing from worried senior advisers that she may hurt his campaign. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is an ally of Trump's extreme right, was quick to criticize the news of Loomer's possible hiring. Trump was warned by Greene that Loomer 'can not be trusted,' and that she would see that he is informed. According to Senator Thom Tillis, Loomer 'is a crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage intended to divide Republicans.' Furthermore, he said that she would undermine Trump's prospects of being elected president in November 2024. 3. Loomer Was the 2020 Republican Primary Winner in Florida Trump gave Loomer his stamp of approval the moment she won the 2020 GOP primary in Florida. Loomer, who had Trump's backing, narrowly lost to Lois Frankel in the Republican primary for Florida's congressional seat the same year. Yet for the year 2022, Loomer had a different strategy in mind. She challenged Rep. Daniel Webster, a 73-year-old who has been in office since 2011, in the heavily Republican 11th Congressional District of Florida. She came so close to winning. As per MSNBC, Loomer shocked many by receiving 44% of the vote, however Webster narrowly defeated her by around 5,000 votes. 4. Donald Trump’s Statements on Laura Loomer Trump acknowledged Loomer at his pre-caucus speech, yelling out, \"You want her on your side.\" He filmed Loomer at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, this past summer, and he gushed about how 'really very special' she is. In April, The New York Times claimed that Trump had instructed campaign staff to recruit Loomer for an official position inside the campaign. However, after the publication of the article, a senior campaign official halted the hiring. As reported by Mediate, Trump advocated a video of Loomer last year on his Truth Social account in which she told an interviewer that she had once told an ex-lover who felt she was too preoccupied with Trump that they needed to realize that he was her number one priority. 5. Laura Loomer’s Conspiracy Theories and False Facts Someone like Loomer, who promotes QAnon—a complex and end-of-the-world conspiracy theory based on the belief that Trump is fighting the 'deep state'—often has their posts amplified on Trump's social media site. As reported by ABC News, In addition to her vicious racist and sexist comments on Trump's Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, she often publishes social media remarks that are anti-Islamic and anti-immigrant. Last year, she uploaded a video on X that said '9/11 was an Inside Job!' and implied a connection to the September 10, 2001, announcement of $2.3 trillion in 'lost' government funds by then-Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld. 6. Trump and Laura Loomer Have Been on the Road Together Loomer was seen getting off the aircraft with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before the debate in Philadelphia, suggesting that she travelled with the former president. Loomer told CNN that she rode with Trump on his jet after the murder attempt, in addition to supporting him at rallies. she told the outlet, \"I was with him. I flew with him to the (Republican National Convention), so it could show that I’m a trustworthy person, I have his back.\" Apart from the traveling, Loomer has foretold that she would join him in his second term as his press secretary. As reported by Mediate, she declared, \"Someday I will be his Press Secretary. I will protect him from all of his enemies and haters. They will meet their match in me. #Trump2024.\" 7. Laura Loomer Has Always Been a Trump Fanatic For a long time, Loomer has been an ardent advocate for the former president. During her recent news appearance in California, Trump justified his connection with her. As reported by Telegraph, Trump stated, \"Laura’s been a supporter of mine. She speaks positively of the campaign. I don’t control Laura. She’s a free spirit.\" However, in what seemed like an effort to put some space between himself and his cheerleader, Trump subsequently expressed his disagreement with Loomer's remarks on Kamala Harris on social media.","summary":"Laura Loomer, a far-right activist and admirer of Donald Trump, has been in the news for a long time due to her inflammatory comments.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/seven-things-to-know-about-donald-trumps-controversial-friend-laura-loomer","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/716865/uploads/114bcec0-799a-11ef-a8e6-cd5d29510e31_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 21:00:01","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":257860660,"title":"US, Israel in touch over developments following death of Hezbollah chief","text":"NEW YORK, September 29. /TASS/.

Biden is trickier for me, part of the continuum of getting that high-energy part of him.” He added, “It sounds kinda corny, but the true North Star is to try to make it funny and not really get it to be a political message, per se.” During Saturday’s political cold open, Carvey joined fellow cast alum Maya Rudolph, who is reprising her impression of Kamala Harris leading up to the Nov. 5 presidential election. The sketch also featured Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff and Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walz, as well as Johnson’s Trump and Bowen Yang as JD Vance.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMore than 30 years later, Dana Carvey still knows how to nail&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Dana Carvey didn&#8217;t aim to turn his &#8216;SNL&#8217; Biden impression into a political statement. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/dana-carvey-didnt-aim-to-turn-his-snl-biden-impression-into-a-political-statement/","image":"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GYngRAHXsAEjdWo.jpeg?w=300","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 20:56:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.261},{"id":257861278,"title":"Actor Zachary Levi cites RFK Jr.’s endorsement in call to support Trump","text":"Levi explained that he grew up in a Christian conservative household with parents who evolved from “Kennedy Democrats” to “Reagan Republicans,” and he was raised to have “a healthy level of distrust for the government.” He added that he believed Kennedy was the type of presidential candidate he was looking for.

Tulsi Gabbard.” Kennedy and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard then joined Levi onstage for a live discussion, during which the actor said that poeple are being “inundated every single day with poison,” both by the food they purchase and the media they consume. He added voters who support Vice President Kamala Harris are “being lied to,” and encouraged the event’s attendees to reach out and engage in debate with these voters without getting “baited into their attacks.” BREAKING: Actor Zachary Levi just finished his remarks in support of Trump by saying the people supporting Kamala are being lied to by the media and that all Americans are being poisoned through the food we eat, the news we consume, and Big Pharma's drugs\"Not just in the foods… pic.twitter.com/Imju76jyAu— George (@BehizyTweets) September 29, 2024 Levi’s comments on engaging in healthy debate received praise from former Star Wars actress Gina Carano, who shared footage of his speech on X. Carano was fired from her role in The Mandalorian Disney+ series shortly after she shared a post on social media stating that Jews in the Holocaust were beaten up simply for their religious beliefs, and questioned how this was “any different from hating someone for their political views.” Good man Zach, well said. 🙏 @ZacharyLevi https://t.co/MO3QTQ2El1— Gina Carano 🕯 (@ginacarano) September 29, 2024 CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Levi is best known for his role in the TV series Chuck. He is also known for starring in the film Shazam! and voicing Flynn Rider in Disney’s Tangled. Shortly after endorsing Trump last month, Kennedy previewed what his role in a hypothetical second Trump presidency would look like, which included repurposing “the $42 billion budget” of the National Institutes of Health and finding the root causes of chronic diseases. Kennedy also starred in an ad voicing his support for Trump, in which he said he wants to “clean up” the United States’s various health agencies that have become “sock puppets of the industries they’re supposed to regulate.”","summary":"Actor Zachary Levi called former President Donald Trump the best choice voters have ahead of the 2024 election, citing how Trump has been backed by Robert F.

She refused,” reports the Washington Free Beacon’s Aaron Sibarium. “The university took no action against a cartoonist who depicted ‘Zionists’ drinking the blood of Gazans” or “against students and professors who celebrated the worst pogrom since the Shoah.” But it punished Wax for saying that diversity officials “couldn’t be scholars if their life depended on it.” “It is rare for universities to sanction tenured professors and all but unheard of for them to do so over political speech. Penn made an exception for Wax” — “a precedent-setting blow to academic freedom.” Libertarian: North Fork Eminent-Domain Outrage If New York “can hide behind false claims of public use, property rights — and the Fifth Amendment — become meaningless,” warns Arif Panju at Reason. Brothers Ben and Hank Brinkmann in 2017 “tried to build a hardware store on their own land in Southold, Long Island.” Officials “tried myriad ways to stifle the brothers’ plans”; when those failed, “Southold took the Brinkmanns’ land using eminent domain,” crucially “lying about the ‘public use’ to feign compliance with the Fifth Amendment.” The town claimed it needed “the land for a ‘passive use park.’ That’s an empty field. In other words, the public use was a sham.” “Brinkmann v. Town of Southold is now at the Supreme Court’s door”; the justices may hold “the government accountable for its lies” and ensure “that constitutional protections mean something.” Conservative: Climate Activists Infiltrate Courts “Courthouse bureaucrats are helping a left-wing dark money group exploit the judicial system to destroy American traditional energy companies,” flags Sen. Ted Cruz at The Hill, of collaboration between the “Federal Judicial Center (FJC), the federal agency in charge of research and education for federal judges and judicial staff” and the “leftist” Climate Judiciary Project, in which court staff seem to be “helping far-left climate activists lobby and direct judges behind closed doors.” The Environmental Law Institute “launched the Climate Judiciary Project to provide judges with ‘education on climate science’ ” and the law. Yet CJP’s “funding comes from the same sources bankrolling the climate change lawsuits”; its partnership with the FJC is thus “contrary to judicial independence and to the FJC’s mission. It must stop.” Social-media watch: Vance Leaves Harris in the Dirt If you hadn’t noticed, Sen. JD Vance is “extremely online,” observes Steve Krakauer at The Hill — and that’s a “good thing”: The GOP veep nominee “uses social media in a way no American political figure has before,” exemplified earlier this month when he “responded to a brief comment on X about daycare” with “a point-by-point, 350-word policy dissertation.” Talking heads deemed it “hilarious how JD Vance dropped a whole policy manifesto in a Twitter reply,” when “Kamala Harris can’t describe one policy in this level of detail” in her interviews. And social-media output in Harris’ name suggests she doesn’t even know “the password to get into her accounts. It’s all meaningless and hollow.” “Maybe being Extremely Online isn’t such a bad thing — especially when it’s juxtaposed with the stilted emptiness on the opposing ticket.” Energy desk: Bullies for Wind Power After a nearby offshore-wind blade broke off, “Nantucket residents expressed concerns about officials’ handling of the turbine breakage and the environmental hazards of enormous fiberglass blades tumbling into the sea,” recounts Emmett Hare at City Journal. Environmental groups “downplayed the episode,” with the Sierra Club arguing that it shouldn’t “adversely impact” harnessing “offshore wind.” Complaining Nantucketers have been smeared as “tools of the fossil-fuel industry.” But it will take more than smears “to convince the residents of New England and coastal states that the fiberglass and foam washing up on their beaches is nothing more than a conservative talking point.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"If you hadn’t noticed, Sen.
