Beyoncé, Doechii, and Kendrick Lamar were among the musical artists honored with wins.\n\n One of the night's biggest winners was multi-hyphenate Keke Palmer, who made a memorably rousing speech after taking home the top prize for Entertainer of the Year.\n\n \"While we continue to ask for more money, because we need that, it's important that we remember that what we choose and what we deem as important is enough,\" Palmer told her peers. \"And that's all I want to say.\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.'s free daily newsletter\n\n Comedian Dave Chappelle was also honored at the Saturday night ceremony, receiving the President’s Award, while the Wayans family — including Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. — were inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.\n\n Former Vice President Kamala Harris was in attendance as well, to accept the NAACP's prestigious Chairman's Award. Her nearly five-minute speech was met with applause, as she heralded the civil rights organization as a pillar of the Black community and took time to address the reelection of President Donald Trump.\n\n \"Our power has never come from having an easy path,\" Harris said. \"Our strength flows from our faith: faith in God, faith in each other, and our refusal to surrender to cynicism and destruction. Not because it is easy, but because it is necessary. Not because victory is guaranteed, but because the fight is worth it.\"\n\n She concluded, \"While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter of our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the Oval Office, nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you, written by us — by we the people.\"\n\n See the complete list of winners below.\n\n Entertainer of the Year \n\n Cynthia ErivoWINNER: Keke Palmer Kendrick LamarKevin HartShannon Sharpe\n\n Outstanding Motion Picture \n\n Bad Boys: Ride or DieBob Marley: One LoveThe Piano LessonWickedWINNER: The Six Triple Eight\n\n Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture \n\n André Holland, Exhibiting ForgivenessColman Domingo, Sing SingJohn David Washington, The Piano LessonKingsley Ben-Adir, Bob Marley: One LoveWINNER: Martin Lawrence, Bad Boys: Ride or Die\n\n Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture \n\n Cynthia Erivo, WickedWINNER: Kerry Washington, The Six Triple Eight Lashana Lynch, Bob Marley: One LoveLupita Nyong'o, A Quiet Place: Day OneRegina King, Shirley\n\n Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture \n\n Brian Tyree Henry, The Fire InsideCorey Hawkins, The Piano LessonDavid Alan Grier, The American Society of Magical NegroesWINNER: Denzel Washington, Gladiator II Samuel L.

Janet Mills’ vow that she would see Trump in court over his threat to withhold money from the state if it didn’t comply with his executive order delighted Democrats who want more strident pushback. But the dust-up that played out in the open Friday as Trump hosted governors at the White House ticked off a president known to retaliate against people he considers enemies.\n\nHours after the spat, the federal Department of Education announced it was initiating an investigation into the Maine Department of Education over the inclusion of trans athletes. Trump doesn’t want them playing in girls and women’s sports; Maine law bars discrimination based on gender identity.\n\n“Any time a public interaction like that takes place, it’s coming from a person who’s grounded in their values,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in an interview Sunday. “I love Janet Mills and I appreciate her for standing up. I also know that there’s always a cost that comes with that.”\n\nThe Democrats who lead the nation’s most populous states were in Washington for a meeting of the National Governors Association, where they tried to strike a balance between their states’ needs and their feelings about Trump.\n\nWhitmer, known for clashing with Trump during his first term over the federal COVID-19 response, campaigned vigorously against him in 2024 on behalf of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Whitmer said she sat next to Trump at a White House dinner on Saturday night.\n\n“I was the only Democrat at the table. I was a little surprised. I think everyone in the room was a little surprised, to be honest,” she said. “But I took the opportunity to talk a little bit about tariffs.”\n\nMichigan and other states could be significantly affected by some of the president’s early proposals. For example, Michigan expects nearly 42% of its budget to come from federal funds and relies heavily on trade with Canada, which now faces potential Trump-imposed trade penalties.\n\nA federal judge is considering a request to block the administration from freezing trillions of dollars in grants and loans, a move that could severely impact states. At the same time, Trump’s key ally, Elon Musk, is pushing to shrink the federal government, with likely ripples nationwide. About 80% of the roughly 2 million people in the federal workforce live outside metro Washington, dispersed across the country.\n\n“I’m very worried that people are going to make make decisions without a real understanding of what the ramifications are going to be for the American public,” Whitmer said. Musk, she said, is “dangerous.”\n\nAt discussion panels and news conferences at the meetings, state leaders struck a conciliatory tone.\n\n“We always hope that people can disagree in a way that elevates the discourse and tries to come to a common solution,” said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, the association’s chair, when asked about the Trump-Mills exchange. “I don’t think that disagreement was necessarily a model of that,” he said.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., met with Trump for more than an hour on Friday afternoon to discuss Manhattan’s congestion tolling. Trump ordered a halt to the program, a key Hochul priority, and declared in a social media post: “Long live the king!”\n\nAsked about the meeting, Hochul told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that it was “adversarial” and said New Yorkers “need to know I’m willing to take the fight wherever I have to.”\n\n“We’re not going to sit idly by and let our rights be attacked,” she said. “We’ll work with you when there’s common ground, no doubt about it, let’s build great projects and infrastructure. There’s areas where we’re going to work with you on immigration and getting the violent criminals off our streets. We do not dispute that, but don’t think that you can just come in and bully us around and not expect a reaction from governors.”\n\nWhitmer said she had a chance to speak with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in addition to Trump.\n\n“I’ve got to put the people’s interests before my own interests, before my partisan interest.

Republicans are working on such plans as the party nears passage of budget legislation.\n\nJeffries was asked by the show’s host Jake Tapper about Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro — who was almost Kamala Harris’s running mate — criticizing Democrats in Congress for “failing to address the real concerns that people have” and not being a sufficient “check” on the power of Trump and his DOGE chief, Elon Musk.\n\n“I have no idea what the Governor was talking about, so you're going to have to ask him for clarification,” Jeffries responded.\n\nHe went on to say that Democrats were “partnering on at least 79 different lawsuits that have been brought related to about 35 different illegal or unconstitutional executive orders.” However, those lawsuits are primarily being led by state attorneys general, not Congress.\n\n“Democrats are going to continue to make clear that we will stand against the effort to end Medicaid as we know it, stand against the effort to detonate Social Security or Medicare, certainly stand against the effort to undermine veterans benefits or nutritional assistance to children and families,” said Jeffries.\n\nHe and Tapper went back and forth over which Republicans the House Democratic leader thought his party would have the best chance in turning against the budget legislation, while not providing any details or signs of success related to that effort.\n\nRepublicans have just three votes separating their party from the Democrats. The defection of even two members on a budget agreement such as this could tank the measure.\n\nBut Democrats have not shown any public movement towards convincing Republicans to vote against the bill, and in one instance Jeffries himself seemed to dismiss the idea that his party had any leverage at all over the GOP — despite the likelihood that the entirety of his caucus will vote against it, putting the legislation permanently on the brink of failure.\n\n\"I'm trying to figure out what leverage we actually have,\" he said at a press conference. \"What leverage do we have? Republicans have repeatedly lectured America — they control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It's their government.\"\n\nDemocrats have continuously crossed party lines to confirm Trump’s nominees for various agencies and continue to negotiate with Republicans on legislation to fund the government through the remainder of the fiscal year, without securing concessions from the GOP.\n\nJeffries and other Democrats, including his state’s governor Kathy Hochul, have also refused to call for the removal of Eric Adams, the embattled mayor of New York, who has seemingly agreed to work with administration officials on the president’s mass deportation effort while the Justice Department tries to abandon his prosecution for corruption-related charges.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll last week found that only 21 percent of Americans approve of the job congressional Democrats are doing.","summary":"Jeffries says he has ‘no idea’ why Democrat governor, others say his party needs to stand up to GOP with urgency","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cnn-hakeem-jeffries-tapper-democrats-b2703254.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/15/18/SEI229728404.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 22:45:51","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":293604052,"title":"James Carville predicts Trump, GOP are in ‘midst of a collapse’ — and gives them 4 to 6 weeks to fully implode","text":"Renowned Democratic strategist James Carville has delivered a stunning prediction that the Trump administration is in the “midst of a collapse” and will crumble within four to six weeks.\n\nCarville, 80, on Friday urged his fellow Democrats to play “possum,” clear out of the way and let Republicans implode as President Trump plows ahead with his dramatic overhaul of the federal government.\n\n“It seems that the angrier Democrats get, the more it feeds into exactly what Donald Trump and Elon Musk and some of these other folks want,” Carville mused to Mediaite founder Dan Abrams.\n\n“What I have said very publicly is that Democrats need to play possum. This whole thing is collapsing,” he said.\n\nThe elderly Dem guru was the top strategist in Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, when Democrats soared back into the White House after 12 years of Republican rule.\n\nHis wild prediction comes mere months after Trump became the first Republican to win the popular vote in a presidential election in two decades, making gains in more thanb 90% of US counties.\n\nCarville, who confidently proclaimed in October he was “certain Kamala Harris will win” and wrote a book in 2009 about how Dems would be the dominant party over the next 40 years, decried progressive hardliners who have a knack for being noisy.\n\n“These people were just useless,” he bemoaned about certain progressive activist groups during the last election cycle. “They’re actually worse than useless, they’re detrimental. And they never, ever learn to shut up.\n\n“I believe that this administration, in less than 30 days is in the midst of a massive collapse and particularly a collapse in public opinion.”\n\nCiting polling data, Carville argued that Trump’s approval rating has been taking a nosedive and that within a matter of weeks, Republicans will be almost completely hobbled in Congress. \n\nThat prediction comes against the backdrop of protests against GOP lawmakers such as Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.) during town-hall and other events last week.\n\nHistorically, there had been similar occurrences in past off-election years such 2017 and 2010 that served as a harbinger of the minority retaking the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.\n\nTrump, 78, has undertaken a blitz of executive actions over his first month in office and tapped Department of Government Efficiency boss Elon Musk to pursue cuts and other reforms of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThose actions have alienated government workers and their unions but have generally been met with much fanfare by conservatives. \n\nCarville also suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) will struggle to get Republicans on board for Trump’s marquee agenda package, which has already proven to be very challenging given the party’s threadbare majority in the House.\n\n“It’s going to be easy pickings here in six weeks,” Carville added, addressing Democrats. “Just lay back.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a collapse. It’s over.”\n\nDemocratic leadership in Congress has been attempting to train their focus on working-class issues. But that cautious approach has drawn groans from progressives who feel that leadership has been going soft on Trump as he barrels ahead with a more ambitious agenda than his first term.\n\nAdding to the woes, progressives have been struggling to mobilize the mass protests they drew eight years ago during the Trump administration, fueling concerns that the base is in a place of despair.","summary":"\"What I have said very publicly is that Democrats need to play possum.

Written by us. By we the people.”\n\nThe 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.\n\nHarris, defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and the state’s attorney general. \n\nIn her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump’s actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nHarris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America’s future.\n\n“Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask ‘What do we do now?’” Harris said. “But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path.”\n\nOther winners of the Chairman’s prize have included former President Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.\n\nHarris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family. The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.\n\nKeenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.\n\nMarlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock’s “Bel-Air” was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family’s rise.\n\n“He raised us all like Jedis,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for our big brother.”\n\nMarlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, ”Boy, I’ve known you your whole life, and you ain’t never said nothing funny. That’s the funniest thing you’ve said.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades. \n\nThe family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series “In Living Color” in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof “Scary Movie,” which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in “White Chicks” in 2004. Damon Wayan's had a starring role in the 1995 comedy “Major Payne,” and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom “Poppa’s House,\" which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show. \n\nDamon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: “Happy Endings” and “New Girl.” Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama “Pariah.”\n\nKeke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.\n\n“Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn’t think I was going to win,” said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo’s Oscar-nominated performance in “Wicked.” \n\nPalmer starred in the buddy comedy “One of Them Days,” which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC’s “Password.”\n\n“It’s such an amazing category to be in with all these people,” Palmer said. “It’s a beautiful night. It’s Black History Month, y’all. It’s so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another.” \n\nOther nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe. \n\nImage Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January’s devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires. \n\nA video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage.\n\n“Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozens souls gone forever,” said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu. \n\n“But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,” said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded. \n\nCole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West’s wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.\n\nThe opening act was a lead-up to the evening’s first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in “The Equalizer.” \n\nDave Chappelle was honored with the President's Award for his “thought-provoking humor.\"\n\nAccepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP's push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation. \n\n“Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine,” he said. \n\nPast recipients of the President's Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

It’s not tough to attack people who aren’t in a position to fight back. That’s weak from my perspective,” Mr Albanese said.\n\nSimilarly, last month Mr Dutton sat down with entrepreneur and self-made millionaire Mark Bouris for interview on his podcast Straight Talk.\n\nDuring the 90-minute chat, the Opposition Leader spoke about The Voice, the “woke” agenda, along with his 4.30am wake up routine and his childhood working in a butcher shop.\n\nThe part of the interview that garnered the most attention was his defence of young men, claiming they are fed up with being painted as “ogres” and are feeling “disenfranchised and ostracised” as a result.\n\n“They’re saying, ‘Well, hang on, I have nothing but respect for women, and I would never treat my female friends differently than my male friends. But I’m being told that I’m some sort of ogre, or I have some belief structure which is true to that, which … (is) what I hold in my heart’,” Mr Dutton said.\n\n“They’re pushing back and saying, ‘Well, why am I being overlooked at work for a job, you know, three jobs running when I’ve got, you know, a partner at home, and she’s decided to stay at home with three young kids, and I want a promotion at work so that I can help pay the bills at home,’ and so I think all of that has morphed.”\n\n‘Power brokers or wild cards’\n\nIt is clear younger generations are becoming a dominant voting bloc, however, Dr Chowdhury said it is important not to “fall into the trap” of thinking they are a homogeneous one.\n\nAs a whole, Gen Z and Millennials may seem to hold more progressive views than their older counterparts, but there is still a sense of “political unpredictability”, which could see them end up being “power brokers or wild cards” of the next election.\n\nThis sentiment was backed by Dr Damon Alexander, senior lecturer of Politics and Public Policy at Swinburne University of Technology.\n\nHe said it “isn’t rocket science” to understand that parties like Labor and the Greens typically do a lot better among young voters, compared to the Liberal Party and Nationals.\n\nHowever, he noted that there have been signs of slight conservative shift happening within the group.\n\n“That’s certainly been the case in other jurisdictions around the world, and I’d be surprised if we don’t see the same sort of thing in Australia, to an extent,” Dr Alexander said.\n\n“But the Conservatives are coming from a long way back in terms of sort of how young people vote in Australia, or have done over the last couple of decades.”\n\nWhen it comes to this shift, there is also a clear gender divide appearing within the group.\n\nDr Chowdhury noted that young men, particularly between the ages of 18 and 34, are showing an increased preference towards Opposition Leader Peter Dutton compared to women in this same age range.\n\nShe said this difference in opinion can be the result of a series of factors, including economic standing, education, whether they are from inner-city or remote areas, or whether they work a blue collar or white collar job.\n\nThese factors can push people toward what Dr Chowdhury labelled “anti-government rhetorics” and small pockets of “online battlegrounds where younger voters are relating to authoritarian and anti-feminist messaging where we’re seeing a starker rift between men and women”.\n\nLeaders warned against discounting young voters\n\nWith Gen Z and Millennials now making up almost half of voters, it may seem like a no-brainer that the leaders of the major parties would adapt their campaigns to better connect with a younger audience.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced this will be the case in the upcoming election.\n\nWe know that young people consume their news very differently from Baby Boomers and Generation X, preferring to get their information from social media and online platforms, rather than mainstream news outlets or commercial television.\n\nDr Mark Chou, Associate Professor of Public Policy at the Australian National University (ANU), pointed out that, if Mr Albanese and Mr Dutton want to truly engage young voters, they need to take their campaigns online.\n\n“Unfortunately, this is something that neither Anthony Albanese nor Peter Dutton do particularly well; and politicians in parties like the Greens do better,” he told news.com.au.\n\n“But even if the PM or Opposition leader were to switch their tactics, they’d need to be genuine about it. \n\n“Young people know when political leaders aren’t being genuine - particularly because there are now younger politicians like Jordon Steele-John and Georgie Purcell who use social media as their main platform to communicate with their constituencies.”\n\nPoliticians increasing their online presence also doesn’t come without risk.\n\nDr Alexander said there is a chance that pushing out too much content in these online spaces favoured by young people could end up backfiring and causing them to disengage.\n\n“Those sort of platforms are getting flooded more and more as well, and I think we’ll probably get to a point where young people start to turn off because of the sheer volume of stuff that gets thrown at them,” he said.\n\nYoung voters more engaged, but still sceptical\n\nSince 2016 the national youth enrolment rate has increased by almost 10 per cent, currently sitting at 89.7 per cent for the December 2024 quarter, up from 81.3 per cent in March 2016.\n\nRecent significant political issues, such as the same-sex marriage referendum in 2017 and the Indigenous Voice to Parliament vote in 2023, have likely contributed to the surge in young voters over the years.\n\nDr Chou pointed out that young people are ow “acutely aware that their vote counts”. Because of this, they want to have a say in the issues that matter to them, such as the housing and rental crisis, the cost of living, and climate change.\n\n“I think young people are now becoming more conscious of the need to make their voices heard. This is only a good thing,” he said.\n\n“The question is whether our political leaders will respond genuinely by seeking out young people and representing what matters to them and their futures.”\n\nHowever, just because more young people are engaging with politics, it doesn’t mean our political leaders have earned their trust.\n\nA study from Think Forward conducted last year found that 97 per cent of young Australians believe the country’s political leaders are self-interested, shortsighted, and corrupted by donors and special interest groups.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Gen Z and Millennials surveyed have minimal confidence in the ability of governments to craft long-term and meaningful policies to respond to the most crucial problems facing their age cohort.\n\nMost view political leaders to be inherently selfish and share the belief that their efforts appear to be centred on winning re-election – not what the country needs to be its best in the future.","summary":"There is a change in the upcoming federal election that Baby Boomers won’t be happy about, and Anthony Albanese’s latest move has cemented it.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/massive-shift-the-australians-who-will-decide-the-2025-federal-election/news-story/ee082e28cc6319474a79438b5608d0cf?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ce99b9fde240fa812e49346a9021a7ff","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 20:27:50","author":"Ally Foster","authors":["Ally Foster"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.201},{"id":293578370,"title":"The Sneaky Way Government Unions Rake in Taxpayer Money, and How Congress Can Fight It in Reconciliation","text":"While public-sector unions file lawsuits to block President Donald Trump’s reforms to the bureaucracy, federal government workers are getting paid by the taxpayer for time they spend doing work for those very same unions.\n\nThe little-known practice of “official time” allows bureaucrats to bill the taxpayer for hours they spend doing work for the union. Members of Congress have filed bills to ban the practice, but a budget expert suggests that taxing the practice instead might pose a smaller hurdle for getting it through Congress. \n\nWhile most bills face a 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster and get through the Senate, senators could pass such a tax through a process known as budget reconciliation—a process by which bills only require a majority of senators’ votes to pass.\n\nRep. Ben Cline, R-Va., a member of the House Budget Committee, told The Daily Signal he supports the idea of taxing official time.\n\n“Taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for federal employees to conduct union business instead of fulfilling their official duties,” Cline said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “Taxing or ending ‘official time’ altogether are commonsense options to ensure taxpayer dollars are used responsibly while increasing accountability in the federal workforce.”\n\n“It’s important that public funds serve the American people, not private union interests,” he added.\n\nSenators Weigh In\n\nSenate Republicans also condemned official time.\n\n“Federal employees should not engage in union activities on the taxpayer’s dime, which is why I’ve introduced legislation to ban the practice,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, told The Daily Signal. He was referring to the No Union Time on the Taxpayers’ Dime Act, a bill he filed in July. The bill never made it out of committee.\n\n“So-called ‘official time’ has been abused as essentially publicly funded political organizing by government employees on federal property, which would be illegal in any other context,” Lee added. “We should get rid of it. Public servants should serve the public while on the clock.”\n\n“Bureaucrats seems to have forgotten that they serve the American people, not themselves,” Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told The Daily Signal. “If federal employees want to engage in union activity while on the clock instead of doing their job, they need to reimburse taxpayers for every last cent.”\n\n“My Protecting Taxpayers’ Wallet Act ends the absurd practice of taxpayer-funded union time and eliminates tax dollars for public unions,” she added. Ernst was referring to legislation banning official time that she filed earlier this month.\n\nErnst has exposed bureaucrats claiming to be on taxpayer-funded union time while sitting in jail or after moving to Florida. As chair of the Senate DOGE Caucus, which aims to help the Department of Government Efficiency combat fraud, waste, and abuse, Ernst moved to outlaw official time as part of her effort to get the federal workforce back to work.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, suggested he would be open to passing a tax on official time through the budget reconciliation process.\n\n“I think that’s an interesting idea,” he told The Daily Signal in an interview on Thursday. “There’s no doubt we are going to need to consider a number of ideas that are fundamentally transformational. If you look at the election in November, this was a mandate. … We have an historic opportunity right now; we can’t miss the moment.”\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., agreed that Congress should get rid of official time.\n\n“We shouldn’t be paying for somebody to do something besides their job as a federal worker. That’s the No. 1 thing,” Scott told The Daily Signal in an interview on Thursday. “The American taxpayer is not interested in paying for somebody to do a job that’s not part of their job, to provide a service or provide a product, or something like that.”\n\nHe did not specifically address taxing official time in budget reconciliation, but he insisted that the government should not “allow people to get paid to work on doing something that’s not their job as a federal employee.”\n\n“That needs to be changed,” Scott added.\n\nWhy Budget Reconciliation?\n\nWhile Lee’s and Ernst’s bills take aim at official time, they may fall short of the mark when it comes to getting through the legislative process, experts note.\n\n“Though this practice of abusing official time should be banned outright, Democrats are unlikely to join with Republicans to give them the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that’s required to do so,” Richard Stern, director of The Heritage Foundation’s Grover Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, told The Daily Signal. “Banning the practice would also not fit with the tight requirements of what could be done in a reconciliation bill—which only requires 51 votes in the Senate.”\n\n“However, imposing taxes on the practice would fit the parameters of reconciliation,” Stern noted. “Using tax policy in this manner would allow a conservative majority in Congress to pass a policy that would work towards ending this terrible abuse of the taxpayer’s dollar.”\n\nTo drive the point home, Stern noted, “Your tax dollars quite literally go to pay for the salaries of people while they are doing work for unions that is often at odds with what is in the best interest of the country.”\n\nSean Higgins, a deregulation and labor union analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, agreed.\n\nHe told The Daily Signal he would prefer to ban official time outright, but “if reconciliation is a means to do this, it’s an interesting approach and a worthy try.”\n\nBiden Hides the Ball\n\nHiggins noted that the Office of Personnel Management previously published the amounts the federal government spent on official time in a regular report titled “Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Usage in the Federal Government.” The Biden administration not only stopped publishing the reports but removed the web page hosting previous reports. \n\n“They got rid of it because it was embarrassing,” Higgins said. “The unions just don’t want us to know that this happens. I’m sure the broader public doesn’t know it exists or would be surprised to find out about this phenomenon.”\n\nErnst and Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, wrote to Charles Ezell, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management in the new Trump administration, to restart the annual reports, and an OPM spokesperson told The Daily Signal the office will again release this information under Trump.\n\n“OPM is committed to transparency and accountability,” the spokesperson told The Daily Signal in an emailed statement Thursday. “We are in the process of compiling this data and will begin releasing this information again. Unfortunately, the previous administration halted its publication, shielding unions from taxpayer scrutiny. We are working to restore this critical transparency for the American people.”\n\nThe Deep State Effort Against Trump\n\nHiggins, the Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar, noted that official time is “literally just people being paid by the government not to work for the government but to work for entities that seek to increase costs for the taxpayer.”\n\nOnly 5.9% of private sector workers were union members last year, while 32% of public sector workers had joined unions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The aggregate number of employees belonging to unions in the public sector (7 million) was roughly the same as those in the private sector (7.2 million).\n\nHiggins contrasted “the days when a union worker was someone who worked in a factory and was trying to get a few extra hours or a safety regulation” with today. “Now, the typical worker is someone who works for the government, and the union makes it impossible for them to get fired by the government.”\n\nHe further noted that “any person who works for any organization tends to get territorial and parochial” and will likely “resent anybody from the outside telling them what to do.” Bureaucrats have often seen their work as apolitical and have stayed in the administrative state from one administration to another.\n\nTrump is not carrying out business as usual, however. Higgins described Trump’s reforms as “the first time somebody has tried to seriously throw a wrench in the system and rework it from the ground up.”\n\nNow, public sector unions like the American Federation of Government Employees, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, are filing lawsuits to block Trump’s reforms.\n\n“They’re just trying to protect their members as they see fit,” Higgins noted. “They’re for the status quo ante, and the administration is not.”\n\nA recent poll found that 64% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees who voted for Kamala Harris in November say they will refuse a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy. Trump aims to prevent this deep state from growing.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment about whether federal employees have claimed official time in work related to the lawsuits they have filed against the Trump administration.","summary":"While public-sector unions file lawsuits to block President Donald Trump&#8217;s reforms to the bureaucracy, federal government workers are getting paid by the taxpayer for time...

Along with the world's richest person, Elon Musk, the US president is dismantling or seizing control of the institutions and apparatus of the US state, like all revolutionaries have done throughout history.\n\nThe end game with this American revolution is unpredictable. It should just last four years, but Trump is already talking (often) about running for an unconstitutional third term. What is the official position of the Australian government and opposition about that?\n\nLike most democracies, the US government was a machine that cranks on no matter who is in power, largely because close to half the population didn't vote for the temporary leader and must be protected from oppression by the narrow majority.\n\nIt goes further in the United States because so much of the government is outsourced, especially financial decision-making: Treasury is usually run by someone from Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, the \"Fed\", is independent and the founding fathers gave Congress control of the budget. \n\nAlso, the constitution gives the American judiciary the power to make decisions that are elsewhere reserved for politicians.\n\nTrump and Musk are taking control of the money and either gutting, closing or taking control the bureaucracy, and at the same time they are defying the judiciary.\n\nThere was a telling moment on Friday when President Trump was addressing state governors and he clashed with Janet Mills, the governor of Maine, over his transgender policy.\n\nShe said: \"I will obey the law\".\n\nTrump replied: \"We are the law\".\n\nA week ago, Trump posted a quote attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte on his social media site, Truth Social: \"He who saves his country does not violate any law\".\n\nHe then also posted it on X/Twitter and then the official White House account also posted it next day, making it clear this was not a passing thought, but a considered one, to be taken seriously.\n\nThe specifics of the Trump revolution were no better exemplified than by Memorandum M-25-13, issued by the US Office of Management and Budget a week after his inauguration. \n\nIt instructed all federal agencies to pause, within 24 hours, all financial assistance — totalling $US3 trillion — and required them to review all programmes \"consistent with the president's policies and requirements\".\n\n\"Career and political appointees in the executive branch have a duty to align federal spending and action with the will of the American people as expressed through presidential priorities.\"\n\nAnd to be more specific: \"The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve\".\n\nThe memo was rescinded after a federal judge temporarily halted it, which was later supported by a second restraining order, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declared it was a \"rescission of the OMB memo, NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze.\"\n\nIn a monologue delivered in the White House, Elon Musk said: \"All we're trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president. And what we're finding is there's an unelected bureaucracy … a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the president and the cabinet. And if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the president from implementing what the people want, then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy.\"\n\nThere are weaknesses in America's great democracy\n\nElection winners always claim a mandate, no matter how narrow the victory, although it's usually reserved for policies that were announced before the election.\n\nIn the 2024 US presidential election, 63.9 per cent of those eligible to vote actually voted, or 155.2 million people. Of those, 77.3 million voted for Donald Trump and 75 million voted for Kamala Harris, so the split in the popular vote was 49.8 per cent to 48.3 per cent.\n\nThe percentage of eligible voters who voted for Donald Trump was 31.9 per cent. What is the will of the 87 million people who could have voted but didn't? No one knows.\n\nIt's the will of the 77.3 million who did vote for him that now prevails, although many are having buyer's remorse, having lost benefits, and even their jobs if they worked for the government, and Trump's disapproval rating is now well below 50 per cent. \n\nBut that's the way democracy works, of course — the majority at an election prevails.\n\nIn most democratic countries, the split between major parties is usually around 50/50, with a few percentage points of swinging voters in the middle who flip the parties every few years, which is why a largely independent civil service and a representative parliament are important for continuity.\n\nIn Australia, the split in 2022 was 52/48 (two-party preferred), and the latest polls suggest this has flipped already, although the declining vote of both major parties suggests that neither will have a majority at the next election.\n\nIf Peter Dutton won this year and then, say, Gina Reinhart tried what Trump and Musk are doing, they would be quickly stopped and sacked. Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull were all sacked for far less.\n\nIt turns out America's democracy may not be as easily defended as Australia's.\n\nAlan Kohler is finance presenter and columnist on ABC News and he also writes for Intelligent Investor.","summary":"The challenge presented to Australia by the second Trump presidency is about more than foreign policy and defence, and the end game is unpredictable.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-24/trump-presidency-changing-democracy-message-for-australia/104970992","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/36b58f1da6c3c87fd7ead1c86f4305a7?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=720&cropW=1280&xPos=0&yPos=78&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 19:37:07","author":"Alan Kohler","authors":["Alan Kohler"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":293592490,"title":"Stephen A. Smith Leads Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama in Betting Odds for 2028 Democrat Nomination","text":"Even though President Donald Trump’s presidency is only a month old, there is already speculation about who could possibly take the reins of the sinking Democratic Party for the 2028 election, and one seemingly unlikely name has just zoomed up to fourth place in the betting odds list.\n\nAccording to Front Office Sports, left-wing sports commentator Stephen A. Smith is popping up on the prediction market Kalshi as a top contender for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2028 election cycle.\n\nSmith, who has lately become a sharp critic of the Democrat Party and its massive failures by foisting the senile Biden and the loser Harris on the country, is now being weighed as equally worthy as Democrats, including former Biden Treasury Secretary Pete Buttigieg, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and hard-core, left-wing Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nCurrently, only California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore have better odds than Smith.\n\nIn fact, Smith has better odds than operatives, who one might think are far heavier hitters than the TV commentator. Smith seems to have more favorability than Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, 2024 loser Kamala Harris, ex-first lady Michelle Obama, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Penn: Sen. John Fetterman, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.\n\nSmith has dismissed the idea of running for president, but it also seems he has not entirely ruled it out.\n\n“I can’t imagine myself ever running,” he told Front Office Sports on Feb. 5. “The one thing that will always dissuade me from political office is having to campaign… Now, if I could just get interviewed and get into office, that would be different. But that campaign stuff would kill me because I am a straight shooter.”\n\nOn the other hand, despite his seeming inclination to wave off a campaign, Smith has also said that he’d love to be the man to “affect millions of lives” by being president.\n\n“If you tell me that I could catapult to the White House, and I could be in a position to affect millions upon millions of lives, not just in America, but the world over, yeah, that’s something that I would entertain,” he told CNBC a week later.\n\nHe also seemed to egg people on to consider him, telling TMZ, “I don’t know what the hell they’re thinking. I ain’t qualified, but if you want to go ahead and entertain it, you can go ahead and entertain it.”\n\nSmith has also commented on the current crop of Democrats, whom many suspect have presidential candidacy ambitions. He called them “weak.”\n\n“If you’re the Democrats, that’s why Stephen A Smith is in the news,” Smith said on his podcast of his name being thrown in the ring, “because y’all don’t have anybody. You don’t have anybody. Who you got? Who you got? Kamala Harris better not run. She better not run. She’s not going to win a presidency in 2028!\n\n“I’m not in the news because I’m here!” Smith said, holding his hand up at a high level. “I’m in the news because the Democratic Party is [down] here! Dammit, lower than that! Down to the bottom! They suck right now! Horrible! Because they don’t have a voice! Where the hell is the voice?”\n\nClearly, Smith is encouraging the talk about his possible run for president in 2028.\n\nIn the end, though, the sports man who calls himself a “political centrist” would appear to be a bad fit for a party still barreling down the extreme left-wing path. One would think he would not make it out of the primaries intact.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston","summary":"Even as Pres.

Cory Booker Sunday on whether his party’s increasingly popular talking point about America supposedly being in a “constitutional crisis” is a winning strategy.\n\nTowards the end of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign against President Donald Trump, she and fellow Democrats ramped up their rhetoric, claiming Trump was not only a “threat to democracy,” but also a “fascist,” comparing him to Adolf Hitler. On “Meet the Press,” Welker pressed Booker on the Democrats’ new talking point, playing a clip of multiple lawmakers repeating the phrase “constitutional crisis” before reminding him that similar rhetoric did not win them the November election. (RELATED: ‘Never Seen Anything Like This’: Fmr Clinton Pollster Says Dems’ Support ‘Is Falling Off A Cliff’)\n\n“Some of your colleagues have been saying that America is in a ‘constitutional crisis,'” Welker said. “Senator, as you know, Democrats just lost an election, largely with the closing argument accusing Trump of being a threat to the democracy. Is that the most effective messaging right now?”\n\n“I think the most effective messaging is talking about the crisis that’s happening to Americans,” Booker responded.\n\nWelker then intervened, stating that based on Booker’s response, the party “shouldn’t be talking about a constitutional crisis.” However, Booker pushed back, saying the “crisis” is occurring “now,” and calling out the Trump administration’s budget and personnel cuts across the federal government.\n\n“No — I’m saying we should be talking about what’s happening to Americans. I had one of the biggest hospital leaders in my state call me up and talk about the cancer research that’s now in crisis, literally ruining years of research, literally having to take cancer treatments away from people, cutting edge breakthrough treatments,” Booker said.\n\n“What’s crazy is crisis when you have planes falling from the sky and you’re cutting FAA folks. It is a crisis when nuclear regulatories who are keeping our safe regulators are being cut,” Booker continued.\n\nThe New Jersey lawmaker’s claims about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cuts being linked to “planes falling from the sky,” echoed his fellow party member Democratic California Rep. Norma Torres who held Trump responsible for the fatal aircraft collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in January. In February the FAA fired less than 400 employees from its workforce of 45,000, according to Reuters, though Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has repeatedly confirmed that positions critical to aviation safety like air traffic controllers and inspectors have been protected.\n\nBooker went on to highlight claims from farmers complaining to him about the lack of federal funding, before focusing on the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) Elon Musk and his team.\n\n“Look, all this talk about USAID. I have visited people on the front line stopping infectious diseases from coming here. To have scientists in dangerous areas like Kampala suddenly not be able to get their access to their cell phone, their emails,” Booker said. “And be cut off by a president and Elon Musk or in a hand handed incompetent way, cutting funding that makes no sense and ultimately won’t make a difference on our deficit because the president wants to rack it up to give tax cuts to the wealthiest and create even bigger deficits in our country.”\n\nSince Musk’s announcement on an X space discussion about his and Trump’s agreement to overhaul the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Democrats have protested and pushed back against Musk’s involvement in cleaning out government waste.\n\nReports have revealed that some international programs not only aided left-wing social engineering, such as LGBT advocacy, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and tech censorship, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. Regardless, Democrats have continued to question the cuts, with some lawmakers claiming the move of USAID to the leadership of Secretary of State Marco Rubio was unlawful.\n\nDemocrats’ messaging, however, has appeared to struggle since Trump’s historic election win, as he secured not only the Electoral College but also the popular vote and the swing states. With Harris losing once-key Democratic voting blocs, some party members have blamed the social justice policies that the left has been pushing, while others, like Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have blamed voters for not “understanding” what their party has done for them.\n\nEchoing Schumer’s sentiments from January, the Democratic National Committee’s new chairman, Ken Martin, told The New York Times on Feb. 2, after his win for the position, that the struggle he saw within the party was a “messaging” and “brand problem.”\n\n“The policies that we support and the message that we have is not wrong,” Martin told the outlet. “It is a messaging problem and a brand problem.

Critics pointed to some viral clips of Reid, who has made headlines for her attacks against Trump supporters and on the president himself. MSNBC canceled her show as part of a major shake-up at the network. Reid’s 7 p.m. ET program will be replaced by a show featuring Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former spokesperson to Vice President Kamala Harris, Alicia Menendez and RNC Chair turned MSNBC host Michael Steele, according to a source familiar with the plans. JOY REID CLAIMS TRUMP TRANSITION TO POWER WAS 'THE MOST VIOLENT IN US HISTORY' Former FCC chairman Ajit Pai quipped, \"An unfortunate development for Joy Reid's viewer, considering the host's insightful analysis on political topics.\" Pai included a clip of Reid praising former Vice President Kamala Harris' \"flawlessly run campaign,\" despite losing to Trump. Actor Michael Rapaport also reacted to the news, with the hashtag, #joyless. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., shared the news on X, saying, \"The ad execs and the board finally figured out that racism, lies, and Trump derangement syndrome will put them out of business.\" Some liberal commentators slammed the network on the social media platform, Bluesky. Keith Olbermann, a former MSNBC host, said the network didn't have a \"Joy Reid problem,\" but rather a \"Joe Scarborough problem,\" pointing to the network's \"Morning Joe\" co-host. \"Until he is fired, MSNBC will not recover. Shuffling tepid shows in and out does nothing,\" he continued. Olbermann also made the argument that a panel show, which is what will be replacing Reid's program, wouldn't be successful. \"Also: panel shows with multiple meh hosts don't work in primetime in cable news. They didn't work in 2003, which is about the last time MSNBC tried one - even those executives understood the need for strong solo anchors (though they seldom could identify them),\" he wrote.

Written by us. By we the people.”\n\nThe 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.\n\nHarris, defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and the state’s attorney general.\n\nIn her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump’s actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nHarris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America’s future.\n\n“Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask ‘What do we do now?’” Harris said. “But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path.”\n\nOther winners of the Chairman’s prize have included former President Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.\n\nNAACP Hall of Fame\n\nHarris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family. The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.\n\nKeenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.\n\nMarlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock’s “Bel-Air” was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family’s rise.\n\n“He raised us all like Jedis,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for our big brother.”\n\nMarlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, ”Boy, I’ve known you your whole life, and you ain’t never said nothing funny. That’s the funniest thing you’ve said.”\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.\n\nThe family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series “In Living Color” in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof “Scary Movie,” which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in “White Chicks” in 2004. Damon Wayan’s had a starring role in the 1995 comedy “Major Payne,” and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom “Poppa’s House,” which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show.\n\nDamon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: “Happy Endings” and “New Girl.” Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama “Pariah.”\n\nEntertainer of the year\n\nKeke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.\n\n“Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn’t think I was going to win,” said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo’s Oscar-nominated performance in “Wicked.”\n\nPalmer starred in the buddy comedy “One of Them Days,” which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC’s “Password.”\n\n“It’s such an amazing category to be in with all these people,” Palmer said. “It’s a beautiful night. It’s Black History Month, y’all. It’s so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another.”\n\nOther nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe.\n\nAwards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires\n\nImage Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January’s devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.\n\nA video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage.\n\n“Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozens souls gone forever,” said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu.\n\n“But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,” said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded.\n\nCole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West’s wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.\n\nThe opening act was a lead-up to the evening’s first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in “The Equalizer.”\n\nChappelle honored\n\nDave Chappelle was honored with the President’s Award for his “thought-provoking humor.”\n\nAccepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP’s push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation.\n\n“Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine,” he said.\n\nPast recipients of the President’s Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.","summary":"Harris, defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/23/kamala-harris-receives-prestigious-chairmans-prize-at-naacp-image-awards/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kamala_Harris_NAACP_69554.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 17:57:06","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.004},{"id":293541734,"title":"The New Trump-Family Megaphone","text":"The same day, a separate announcement concerning Lara and Fox again raised charges of nepotism: she would be getting her own show on the network, “My View with Lara Trump,” airing in prime time on Saturday nights. The program would “focus on the return of common sense to all corners of American life as the country ushers in a new era of practicality,” Fox said, in a press release. Lara said that she was looking forward to covering “the success of The Golden Age of America.” This did not sound like a recipe for hard-hitting accountability journalism, as various observers were quick to point out. “Fox News viewers getting Trump-family talking points straight from the source for one hour on Saturday night is a far cry from say, Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on independent media in Russia,” Margaret Hartmann argued in New York magazine. “But it’s not great!” Meanwhile, Tom Jones, a media critic at the Poynter Institute, wrote that hiring the President’s daughter-in-law “felt like a line that even Fox News wouldn’t cross,” and that, in doing so, the network had handed its critics “an absolute, pardon the pun, trump card” whenever it next tries to claim that it’s a serious news outlet. Matt Gertz, of the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America, called the hire “a natural progression for a network that merged with the White House during the president’s first term and is returning to that form for his second.” The move, he added, “eliminates any subtext.”\n“Merged” does feel like an apt word to describe the new Administration’s relationship with Fox. By Inauguration Day, last month, President Trump had tapped no fewer than nineteen people with ties to the network for senior posts, most notably Pete Hegseth, a scandal-plagued host, for Defense Secretary. A similar dynamic played out in Trump’s first term, as Gertz noted: advisers went from Fox to the Administration (John Bolton) and vice versa (Tom Homan); Trump devoured Fox talking points and spat them back out, seemingly as he watched; he took hosts’ late-night calls and even tried a dubious COVID-19 cure that they had hyped. The relationship has been somewhat rockier in recent years. On Election Night in 2020, Fox’s decision desk called Arizona for Joe Biden, infuriating Trump. As he entered the political wilderness, he appeared on the network less and occasionally railed against it. Rupert Murdoch, then Fox’s chairman, seemed to flirt with supporting Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, ahead of the Republican primary that Trump would go on to win. (As recently as October, Trump blasted Fox for going “weak” and said that it had “totally lost its way.” The supposed offense? “Polluting the airwaves with unopposed Kamala Representatives,” he posted on Truth Social.)\nThe Lara hire, perhaps, solidifies a rapprochement. If anyone still feels that the network is insufficiently MAGA, she told Time this week, “I certainly hope they can take me being on the team at Fox as a very clear indication as to where Fox stands.” And it appears to be unprecedented in at least one respect: never before has a major TV network bestowed such a prominent on-air perch to the close relative of a sitting President.\nWiden the aperture a bit, and this starts to look more, well, precedented—the latest spin of the series of revolving doors that link the realms of political officialdom and TV news. And, if the revolving door between Trumpworld and Fox spins more often than most, it’s possible to see Lara’s new show as a relatively benign manifestation of the trend—certainly when compared with the elevation of Hegseth to oversee America’s military. But this isn’t to say that Lara will lack power in her new TV gig. It will give her a direct line into conservative viewers’ homes and help shape their perception of the new Administration in a world in which—thanks in no small part to her family—politics, media, and entertainment have themselves decisively merged.\nThe path from political relative to TV star is hardly untrodden, however. Several news stories about Lara’s Fox show pointed out that Jenna Bush Hager, the daughter of George W., and Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Bill and Hillary, have both worked for NBC. Neither was the child of a sitting President during their time at the network, but Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State when NBC News hired Chelsea; Meghan McCain co-hosted “Outnumbered” on Fox and “The View” on ABC while her father, John, was a senator. Being related to a sitting President may be a difference of degree here, but it is not really a difference in kind.\nSometimes, TV hosts’ family ties to politicians have created conflicts of interest. When Senator Bob Menendez’s indictment on corruption charges put his daughter, Alicia, a host on MSNBC, in a tricky spot, she recused herself from covering the story. In the early days of the pandemic, Chris Cuomo, then of CNN, did not recuse himself from interviewing his brother Andrew. Many liberal viewers seemed to enjoy the Cuomos’ on-air joshing and praised them for humanizing a scary new disease, especially after Chris contracted it himself. It later transpired that Chris got preferential access to testing from Andrew—and that he had privately helped his brother punch back against allegations of sexual harassment. (CNN eventually fired Chris. A sexual-harassment accusation against him also surfaced; both brothers have denied wrongdoing.) In the Presidential election of 2000, Fox courted controversy when its decision desk prematurely called Florida, and thus the White House, for George W. Bush—not least because the desk was headed by John Ellis, who was not only an open Bush supporter but also his first cousin. A few days later, Ellis blithely admitted to Jane Mayer, in this magazine, that he’d shared internal projections with Bush over the phone first. “Now, that was cool,” he said. (Ellis has consistently denied any impropriety.)\nPutting family ties aside, it’s common for party apparatchiks to land plum jobs on cable news. Jen Psaki and Symone Sanders-Townsend weren’t related to Biden or Kamala Harris, but they were trusted to represent them in public prior to joining MSNBC as hosts. Politicos getting network contributor contracts—whereby they are paid to be at bay to respond to the news, in what the Washington Post once described as “a sort of gray zone between full-time employees and unpaid interviewees”—is even more common. One example of this trend is, in fact, Lara, who, after serving as a senior adviser and creating digital content for Trump’s 2020 campaign, was paid to be a talking head on Fox in 2021 and 2022. By then, she had appeared as a guest on the network so often that, she joked, Fox’s security guards told her, “Maybe we should just give you a key.”\nThis revolving door may be normal, but that does not make it a good thing, necessarily. The ethical guidelines that regulate such moves can be inconsistent and hazy; Fox, for example, ended Lara’s contributor contract shortly after Trump officially started running for President again in 2022, reportedly on the grounds that her continued employment would breach network rules on political activity. But it didn’t seem to have a problem hiring her while she was still openly weighing the North Carolina Senate bid (Fox, she said at the time, had been “very generous” about it), nor with rehiring her now that Trump is actually the President. In the past, I’ve argued that it doesn’t make sense to draw up blanket rules banning politicians from working for newsrooms or journalists from getting into politics. But, in some cases, the transition is clearly inappropriate. Last year, NBC hired Ronna McDaniel, the former chair of the R.N.C., only for stars at the network to rightly rebel given her history of election denialism. The deal was scrapped.\nIn the case of Fox, however, worrying about this sort of thing brings to mind the expression about horses and barn doors. Readers may recall that Dominion Voting Systems, a voting-technology company, sued the network for spreading lies about its supposed role in the supposed subversion of the 2020 election; eventually, Fox settled the case for $787.5 million following a highly embarrassing release of records during discovery and a deposition in which Rupert Murdoch himself admitted under oath that various Fox stars had endorsed Trump’s lies and that he hadn’t put a stop to it. Even so, Trump expressed anger at the network. He will surely see a family member on staff as a welcome sign of loyalty. “What he’s learned over the years,” Lara said last year, after being named R.N.C. co-chair, “is really sometimes the only people you can truly count on are people in your family.”\nAnd yet, the on-again, off-again nature of Trump’s love affair with Fox—including offs sparked by only the slightest spasms of journalistic independence—proves that the President expects familial levels of loyalty from everyone in his political movement, and often sees it reciprocated. This dynamic is, frankly, more interesting than Fox rehiring an actual Trump family member, a move that is better seen as a symptom of current conservative politics than as some shockingly novel breach of journalistic ethics. Trump has routinely demanded that his adherents, family or not, state that black is white. Lara—who has frequently cast doubt on the 2020 election result—should, like the others, be judged primarily on those grounds, and on what she has to say now.\nLast night, that meant talking to Pam Bondi, Trump’s Attorney General; Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s Director of National Intelligence; and Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary. In a series of cloyingly friendly conversations (Lara: “People are all working together for the same goals, and I don’t know that I’ve ever experienced that with a Presidential Administration before”; Bondi: “We all adore Donald Trump”), Lara lobbed softball questions about their respective priorities: ending the “weaponization” of the Justice Department against Trump; tackling the threat resulting from “President Biden’s open borders”; figuring out “what the truth is versus what the fake-news narratives are.” She then fielded softballs of her own, posed by members of the public. An experience that has shaped her significantly? Her dad helping her to perfect a cheerleading move in high school. Her dream interview subject from history? Her great-grandmother, “who, at sixteen years old, came over on a boat by herself to Ellis Island, New York, from her home in Czechoslovakia.”\nThe final question—how does Lara handle criticism?—prompted a possibly revealing note of self-reflection. “I didn’t always have the last name ‘Trump,’ ” Lara said. “My life before meeting my husband was probably much like most kids growing up in America.” After Trump started running for President, in 2015, everything changed. “It’s probably a good lesson for all of us to remember that the people who ultimately matter, and whose opinions I hold in the highest regard, are the people who actually know me,” she said. “Everything else is just noise.” ♦","summary":"Lara Trump, the President’s daughter-in-law, now has a prime-time show on Fox.

Smith's chances of becoming the next president of the United States continue to rise after a shock new betting market listed him as the fourth favorite to become Democratic nominee. \n\nThe ESPN personality previously talked up his chances of running for the White House in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com at the Super Bowl, and rumors have continued to swirl in the weeks since.\n\nNow, in a shock new gambling market, he has been listed as one of the favorites to be the Democrats' nominee for 2028, only trailing Gavin Newsom Josh Shapiro and Wes Moore.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, a $100 bet on Stephen. A to win the race would win you $1,241, and his odds of winning the nomination are now reportedly 7.26%.\n\nIncredibly, Smith is currently tied with the likes of Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the betting on prediction market Kalshi, while he sits above Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, Mark Cuban, John Fetterman and J.B. Pritzker.\n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com in New Orleans about his chances, Smith said: 'Assuming that I'm well off, that I have lots of money, and money is no longer a concern, if the American people came to me and looked at me and said \"Yo, man, we want you to run for office\", and I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States, I'm not gonna lie. I'll think about that.\n\nStephen A. Smith is currently the fourth-favorite to become the Democratic nominee for 2028 \n\nSmith currently has the same likelihood as Pete Buttigieg (L) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (R)\n\n'But I gotta have my money. I'm not gonna go to the White House broke. I'm not gonna do that. I gotta have my money. I gotta have my home. I gotta have my financial situation completely taken care of. I have no concerns if that happens for me.\n\n'If they told me I had a legitimate, bonafide shot to win the presidency of the United States of America, I would entertain it.\n\n'Because the part that I'm not joking about is I believe I could beat every candidate on that poll. Every candidate that they mentioned, from Kamala Harris right on down to (Pete) Buttigieg and to Tim Walz. I'd beat all of them. I do believe that. I really do.'\n\nJames Carville, who worked as a lead strategist on Bill Clinton's winning 1992 campaign, recently delivered a brutal verdict on Smith's chances of taking the White House in an expletive-ridden rant on his Politicon podcast, though.\n\n'When it comes to sports, I find him to be really insightful. When it comes to politics, he don't know his a** from a hole in the ground,' Carville said. \n\n'He's on there running his goddamn mouth about how he may have to run as a Democrat because there's nothing left of the Democratic Party, and they have no talent.

The price of liberty. To stay alert, to seek the truth, and to actively participate in the fight for America’s future,’ she said as stars, such as Keke Palmer, Cynthia Erivo, Marlon Waynes, and more sat in the audience. \n\nLooking back at how the NAACP came to be, Harris compared the past to the present, adding: ‘Some look at this moment and rightly feel the weight of history.\n\n‘Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy, and ask, “What do we do now?” But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before, and we will do it again,’ she said as the crowd cheered her on. \n\n‘We use our power, we organize, mobilize, we educate and we advocate. Because, you see, our power has never come from having an easy path. Our strength flows from our faith. Faith in God, faith in each other, and our refusal to surrender to cynicism and destruction. \n\n‘Not because it is easy, but because it is necessary. Not because victory is granted, but because the fight is worth it,’ she continued. \n\nJust before walking off stage, Harris sent one last message, adding: ‘While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter of our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the Oval Office, not by the wealthiest among us. \n\n‘The American story will be written by you, written by us – by we the people,’ she said as she got a standing ovation. ‘Thank you, God bled you, and God bless the United States of America.’ \n\nPrior to receiving her award, a video played, revealing Harris’ political involvement, specifically as the first black woman and first South Asian woman to hold office in the United States. \n\nShe also served as the attorney general of California and was a U.S. senator before moving on to the White House. \n\nIn July, former President Joe Biden, 82, suddenly dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, leaving Harris to take on a 107-day campaign. \n\nOn January 20, Trump returned to the White House as the 47th president, leaving Harris and Biden packing. \n\nAfter her departure, Harris traveled with her husband and former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff to Los Angeles. \n\nWhile there, the couple attended a Lakers game, surveyed the damage from the brutal LA wildfires, and she even signed with a top Hollywood talent agency. \n\nShe signed with Creative Artists Agency, which represents top Hollywood stars including Beyoncé, Morgan Freeman ,Glen Powell and Nicole Kidman. Harris also joins Biden, who signed with the agency last month.\n\n Her agents will focus on getting her speaking gigs and publishing opportunities.\n\n‘CAA will work closely with Harris on her post-White House initiatives, creating strategic opportunities that expand her platform in support of the issues she has championed throughout decades-long career in public service,’ the agency said.\n\nHarris is weighing her next career move, which includes a possible run for governor of California next year.\n\nCAA heads Richard Lovett, Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane are prominent Democratic fundraisers.\n\nThe agency represented Harris before she became vice president.\n\nCAA helped her land two book deals: 2019’s The Truths We Hold: An American Journey and 2009’s Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer, which served as a launch pad for a book tour and presidential bid.\n\nFor her next career move, Harris also is considering a 2028 White House bid or a role outside of elective office, a person with knowledge of her deliberations told The New York Times. \n\nJust last weekend, Harris and Emhoff were spotted in New York at Studio 54 for a Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical and later at the Majestic Theater for Gypsy. \n\nShe was greeted by cheers from the crowd and received a standing ovation, but her backstage speech stirred up quite a bit of controversy online. \n\n‘In times when we’re dealing with so much in the world, um, we have to find those moments that are about joy and, and, and, shining, you know, as we say, shining a light in moments of darkness,’ she told the cast and crew of A Wonderful World.\n\n‘When we think about these moments where we see things that are being taken, but also let’s see it, you know, nature abhors a vacuum.\n\n‘Where there’s a vacancy, let’s fill it.

Written by us. By we the people.”\n\nHarris was the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the popular since John Kerry in 20 years ago. She trailed trump Trump, 78, by some 2.3 million votes — and lost every swing state.\n\nShe’s largely laid low in the public eye since Trump officially roared back into the White House last month.\n\nUnlike during the first Trump administration, Democrats are finding themselves demoralized, divided, low on energy as they attempt to counter the president’s blitz of executive orders, appointments and Oval Office directives.\n\nHarris implored attendees at the NAACP Image Awards and her supporters not to give up.\n\n“Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask, ‘What do we do now?’” Harris observed. \n\n“But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize. We mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path.”\n\nHer address came hours after Trump electrified the MAGA faithful just outside Washington, DC, at the Conservative Political Action Conference where he gloated over his victory against Harris. \n\n“I haven’t said that name in a while, Kamala,” Trump mused at CPAC during a riff about her task of tackling the root causes of the border crisis. “I bet nobody knows her last name.”\n\nDespite clear references to them, Harris did not name Trump or Musk directly during her speech at the NAACP’s 56th annual Image Awards, which took place in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.\n\n“This organization came into being at a moment when our country struggled with greed, bitterness and hatred,” she told attendees. “Those who carried its legacy forward had no illusions about the forces they were up against.”\n\nDemocratic leadership in Congress has attempted to avoid responding to every little move that Trump takes and train their focus on the middle class.\n\nBut that has left many progressive activists feeling that the party’s top brass isn’t being forceful enough and complaining about a vacuum of leadership. \n\nAfter losing the election, Harris vowed that she wouldn’t “go quietly into the night.” However, she has kept a very low profile, even as her party casts about for new leadership. \n\nLast week, it was revealed that she joined former President Joe Biden in signing up with the Creative Artists Agency, a top talent agency in Hollywood.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris reemerged in the public limelight for her first major speech since departing the White House and took not-so-subtle shots at both President Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/23/us-news/kamala-harris-snipes-at-trump-and-elon-musk-in-naacp-image-awards-speech-shadows-gathering-over-our-democracy/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/99085486.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ajEuml0n-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-23 14:28:09","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":293515236,"title":"Who Will Replace Joy Reid on MSNBC? Host's Show Canceled","text":"MSNBC plans to change its lineup including replacing host Joy Reid's show The ReidOut, according to a source familiar with the situation.MSNBC declined to comment on Sunday morning.Why It MattersThe changes come after new president, Rebecca Kutler, takes over leadership of the liberal-leaning network. The move also comes as MSNBC is set to be spun-off from Comcast as part of the new SpinCo venture, which has created uncertainty around how the network's programming will be impacted.Reid was an iconic, and often controversial, host on MSNBC. Her program has been seen as a fixture on the network, and has long included in-depth interviews with politicians and other high-profile individuals. Her commentary, which has routinely criticized President Donald Trump and Republicans, has often gone viral on social media.What To KnowThe last episode of The ReidOut will be this week, the source familiar told Newsweek.The source said that the current co-hosts of The Weekend—Symone Sanders Townsend, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez—will now take over the 7 p.m. ET slot that Reid previously hosted Monday through Friday. The show will run for two hours, from 7 to 9 p.m. on Mondays and for one hour the rest of the weekdays.The Weekend was originally created by Kutler and launched in January 2024. The show was seen to improve viewership in its time slot by more than 30 percent. This also was key to MSNBC beating CNN on weekend mornings for the first time in over a decade.Menendez will be the first Latina woman to host a primetime cable news program on MSNBC. Sanders Townsend previously served as senior adviser and chief spokesperson to former Vice President Kamala Harris after working as a senior adviser on the 2020 campaign of Joe Biden. Steele served as the chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) from 2009 to 2011 and has been a longtime Trump critic.Additional changes at the network include Alex Wagner who will no longer be an anchor but will remain at MSNBC as a correspondent. Host Jen Psaki, who served as former President Biden's White House press secretary, reportedly may be taking over the 9 p.m. ET slot. Psaki's Inside With Jen Psaki was launched in 2023 and is MSNBC most-watched weekend program.MSNBC host Rachel Maddow returned in January to host the 9 p.m. slot five days a week, after doing just one day a week. Wagner, who had been doing the other four days, was previously said to be returning to host that primetime slot in April.The network has seen its viewership grow since Trump's inauguration—with a 77 percent increase in viewers during primetime and a 34 percent increase for the total day.What People Are SayingMark Lazarus, SpinCo CEO, said of Kutler when naming her permanent MSNBC president: \"In the short time that Rebecca was the interim president, it became clear to me that she has the big-picture strategic view and the right leadership skills to ensure MSNBC delivers on its brand promise and is positioned for growth during a time of industry change.\"Christopher Webb, a social media influencer who describes himself as a life-long Democrat, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"Nooooo! @MSNBC, this is a huge mistake. The Weekend trio is [fire emoji]—they keep it real, and that's exactly what we need. But so does Joy Reid. She delivers the facts with clarity and a message we can count on. Don't lose that! Viewers are over it. Real talk: If you're looking to shake things up, replace Morning Joe. Viewers are done with their nonsense.\"Rebecca Kutler told MSNBC leaders during a meeting in February on the year ahead: \"This is going to be a really exciting time but also a challenging time. I think it's important that we as leaders are honest about that and about the challenges ahead. Our jobs are hard on a normal day, and these are not normal times.\"What Happens Next?Reid's last show will take place this week. It's unclear what other specific programming changes will take place, but more are expected under the new SpinCo venture.Kutler plans to establish an MSNBC Washington Bureau and will add a roster of domestic and international correspondents to the network in the coming months.Update 2/23/25, 10:09 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.","summary":"The cancellation of \"The ReidOut\" is part of several changes happening at the network.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/who-will-replace-joy-reid-msnbc-hosts-show-reportedly-canceled-2034981","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2593722/joy-reid.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 14:28:03","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.198},{"id":293518162,"title":"WATCH: CPAC attendees say Trump 'activated' new media conservatism","text":"Fox News Digital caught up with CPAC 2025 attendees on Saturday ahead of President Donald Trump’s headlining speech to discuss how Republicans are dominating the modern media narrative. The Conservative Political Action Conference is an annual meeting of conservative minds to discuss policy and hear from leading voices in the party. CPAC dates back to 1974, but it was Trump’s speech in 2017 that ushered the conservative conference into its modern era. Conservative media has erupted in the Trump years, and CPAC had that evidence on full display this year. Media rows, with space for everyone from legacy mainstream media to independent podcasters, spanned several floors of the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, during CPAC 2025. The Trump administration has embraced this new media landscape, most notably by opening up a coveted \"new media seat\" in the White House press briefing room for influencers, podcasters, content creators and independent journalists. The White House received thousands of media applications following White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s announcement last month. CPAC STRAW POLL REVEALS WHO CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE WILL BE 2028 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE \"I think the diversity of new media would be a great addition to the media landscape, and it's been great to see them in the press briefing room, too. I think that all the new conservative influencers who have been utilizing channels like TikTok and Instagram have really connected with the youth, and obviously, that was a new group in terms of demographics that President Trump was able to reach with this election,\" CPAC attendee Kellie Lynch told Fox News Digital. KAROLINE LEAVITT OFFERS WORDS OF WISDOM TO YOUNG WOMEN AT CPAC: 'JUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF' Trump leaned into the podcast space during his 2024 presidential campaign under the advisement of his Gen Z son, Barron Trump. Trump appeared on Theo Von’s \"This Past Weekend,\" Joe Rogan’s widely popular \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and Logan Paul’s \"IMPAULSIVE.\" The episodes amassed millions of views each, with as many as 26 million views on Rogan’s podcast. \"I was watching Joe Rogan,\" John Taber, a young CPAC attendee, told Fox News Digital. \"I listened to President Trump's interview. I listened to JD Vance's interview with Joe Rogan. I think that really spoke to a demographic that's typically not spoken to by politicians, both Republicans and Democrats. They saw hope in that interview. I think that's why a lot of conservatives flocked over to President Trump.\" \"It goes to show that Donald Trump was very open about his views. He doesn't hide behind anything, and he went on a podcast not even knowing what was going to be asked of him, and he was able to answer,\" conservative TikToker Harley Richards added. \"It's a great strategy,\" CPAC attendee Jacob Lee said. \"So many young people today are so hooked on podcasts. They love podcasts. They love Joe Rogan. They love the Nelk boys. They love all of these interactive podcast stars that Kamala Harris and the Democrats didn't really go for a lot. They did go on other podcasts that are kind of inflammatory, in my opinion, but they're not engaging. They're not engaging the younger male voter. I think that's what really put Trump over the top with younger men.\" The White House announced an official rapid response account @RapidResponse47 during Trump’s first month back in office, led by White House Rapid Response director Jake Schneider. The accounts aggregate key interview moments, share fast facts and create headlines, to highlight Trump’s best moments and clip the Democrats' worst. \"I follow the White House Trump Rapid Response, and it provides a great commentary on what's going on, and you can respond to it and debate with people who are not conservative. I find that very useful,\" Taber said. \"That's where most of the youth group is looking at right now: social media. They don't really get their news from larger news sources most of the time,\" Lee explained. Tiffany Cianci, who runs a social media channel called TikTok Town Hall, told Fox that Trump \"made his presence known on TikTok and saw the benefits of how it could connect him to his audience,\" and that during the election cycle, people \"realized they wanted that accountability\" and \"engagement with our politicians.\" \"Special government employee\" Elon Musk uses X to communicate with Americans directly, sharing information about his Department of Government Efficiency in real time. As the owner of X, Musk is the most-followed person on the app with a whopping 218.5 million followers. \"Especially with Elon Musk's purchase of X and the re-platforming of conservatives who had previously been de-platformed when it was Twitter. I think it's been great to see those voices be amplified again, and for free speech to return to X,\" Lynch said. \"Before, it would have been very difficult to say something, even moderately conservative. Now, I can't scroll on X, you know, two posts deep without seeing something to the tune of conservatism,\" another CPAC attendee, Daniel McBride, said. As social media shifts more conservative, legacy media is embracing the change too. Bill Abbott, president and CEO of Great American Media, spoke with Fox News Digital on Friday ahead of his CPAC panel about faith, family and the future of media. Recognizing a gap in the industry three years ago, the former Hallmark CEO launched his family-friendly media company. Abbott, who attended CPAC to meet his audience where they are, said viewers have always enjoyed conservative media but, now, demands are being met by a growing supply of conservative channels. \"I'm not so sure if it's a shift or people now feel free to speak up,\" Abbott said. \"I think back in 2016 or 2017, there was a tremendous fear you could get canceled if you had freedom of speech or if you actually said something that was positive about the administration or about the president or about being conservative. Those values were very much held in contempt.\" \"Now, with the election and winning in a landslide, clearly, people feel more comfortable expressing what they really think. So, I think that it's not so much a shift, but I think the majority of the country has always been in this camp,\" Abbott added.

Reid’s 7 p.m. ET program will be replaced by a show featuring Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former spokesperson to Vice President Kamala Harris, Alicia Menendez and RNC Chair turned MSNBC host Michael Steele, according to a source familiar with the plans. Reid will host the final \"ReidOut\" this week. JOY REID CLAIMS TRUMP TRANSITION TO POWER WAS 'THE MOST VIOLENT IN US HISTORY' \"The ReidOut\" cancelation won’t be the only change at MSNBC. MSNBC's new president, Rebecca Kutler, is planning to announce additional programming changes across dayside, weekends and primetime, a source familiar with the plans told Fox News Digital. Jen Psaki, current host of \"Inside with Jen Psaki,\" is expected to end up with more airtime. Alex Wagner, who was bumped from hosting a primetime program when Rachel Maddow pivoted from hosting her show once a week to nightly for the first 100 days of the Trump administration, will remain with the network as a correspondent but is not expected to host a 9 p.m. ET program going forward. MSNBC declined comment when reached by Fox News Digital. JOY REID SAYS BLACK WOMEN NO LONGER INTERESTED IN 'SAVING AMERICA' AFTER BETRAYAL BY WHITE FEMALE VOTERS \"Inside with Jen Psaki\" launched in 2023 and was the brainchild of Kutler. The show is MSNBC’s most-watched weekend program, so MSNBC giving more airtime to the former Biden administration press secretary has long been rumored. Townsend, Steele and Menendez currently host \"The Weekend,\" which was also created by Kutler and launched in January 2024. Menendez, the daughter of disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., will be the first Latina woman to host a primetime cable news program on MSNBC, as the new show will be two hours long and spill into primetime on Mondays. It will be one hour Tuesday through Friday. MSNBC is in talks to add Politico’s Eugene Daniels and New York University law professor Melissa Murray to potentially join the network, Fox News Digital has learned. More changes will come, as MSNBC is currently seeking a head of talent, head of newsgathering, a Washington bureau chief and a head of content strategy. MSNBC also plans to add a Washington bureau and beef up domestic and international correspondents ahead of parent company Comcast’s plans to spin off several NBCUniversal cable networks, including MSNBC. The move will separate NBC News from the cable network that it has long shared resources with. \"The ReidOut\" has recently struggled to attract viewers, averaging only 973,000 total viewers during February 2025 compared to 1.3 million during the same month in 2024, marking a 28% decline. MSNBC'S FUTURE A 'BIG CONCERN' FOR STAFFERS AS COMCAST MOVES TO SEPARATE LIBERAL NETWORK FROM NBCUNIVERSAL Reid has become infamous for anti-Trump rhetoric and controversial moments. Following the presidential election in November, Reid declared Black women lost interest in \"saving America\" as they grappled with the betrayal of White female voters who had a stronger-than-expected turnout in support of President Trump. Last month, Reid compared the efforts of the Trump administration to deport illegal immigrants and his policies in general to the Holocaust and Hitler's Germany. One of the most shocking events in recent media history came in 2018 when Reid famously claimed that homophobic comments on her old blog, \"The Reid Report,\" were not written by her in a story that stunned the TV news industry. She blamed hackers and claimed to enlist the FBI to investigate her implausible claim, but she became emotional on air when her story fell apart. The MSNBC host then admitted it was unlikely she was hacked, but claimed that she didn’t recall making the offensive remarks, for which she apologized anyway. The bizarre ordeal made her a punchline to many, but she continued to rise up MSNBC’s ranks and emerged as one of the network’s most prominent liberal pundits until her show was canceled on Sunday.

Exhibit A: Washington voted for Kamala Harris by 92.5%. The district’s true-blue voting record shamed leftist strongholds such as California and Vermont, which only went for the Veep by 58 and 63%, respectively.\n\nWashington also blew past other liberal cities, crushing San Francisco (85%), Detroit (84%) and Atlanta (83%) in its leftward lurch to the donkey party. (RELATED: NEWT GINGRICH: Europe’s Elites Were Finally Told To Take A Look In The Mirror)\n\nOur nation’s capital is the most liberal part of the United States. It is to Democrats what Wyoming or King’s County, Texas, is to Republicans.\n\nUnlike the 265 patriots in King’s County, the problem with Washington is that the whole town works for or with the government. Washington, D.C. has but one industry, with 375,000 people employed by the Federal government and more than a million others working as contractors. To put that in context, there are only 404,000 people in the district’s entire labor force.\n\nWhat happens when a Republican wades into the deep blue waters of the D.C. swamp? Historically, not much. That’s because the voters of Washington don’t suddenly find bipartisan religion when they go to work.\n\nAccording to a poll last month from the Napolitan Institute, nearly half of government managers say they would openly defy an order from President Donald Trump, even if it were completely legal. Forty-six percent of respondents said they’d instead, “Do what I thought was best.” 9% said they’d didn’t know what they’d do.\n\nTo be clear, that’s not civil service, but gross insubordination.\n\nYet in D.C., defying a lawful order from the president of the United States is business as usual when a Republican comes to town. For decades, D.C.’s uniparty has ignored Article II of the Constitution, “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”\n\nAnd through a combination of government bloat and collusion, blue bureaucrats have gotten away with it. A logical person might ask, “Why doesn’t the media expose this racket?”\n\nThey’re doing backstrokes in the blue pool, too. According to a 2022 survey from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, only 3.4% of journalists identify as Republicans.\n\nSo when President Trump took office a month ago, many government workers probably assumed they could safely “resist” as they had in Trump 1.0.\n\nThat might explain why Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees defied President Trump’s executive order and booked $59 million worth of rooms at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York for illegal immigrants. Perhaps they counted on such a small amount of money not being noticed by a new administration busy with other priorities.\n\nWhat they didn’t count on was Elon Musk, DOGE, and his Musk-rats using A.I. to spot irregularities. Musk called out the insubordination on X and four FEMA employees were shown the door.\n\nIt’s just one example of a GOP administration moving like never before to get a firm hold on the government. Since January, estimates vary, but it appears more than 75,000 government workers have accepted Trump’s offer of a buyout. Another 10,000 have been fired, according to a report last week from Reuters.\n\nEliminating probationary workers may jettison another 250,000 employees on top of the normal attrition of about 100,000 each year due to retirement.\n\nSimultaneously, to get a grasp on the reigns of government, the Trump Administration will undoubtedly reinstate Schedule F, where at least 50,000 federal employees in policy-making positions could be removed, reassigned or replaced at will.\n\nTrump is also dismantling unconstitutional “independent” agencies — nobody seems to know exactly how many there are, but estimates suggest as many as 80 are due to be put back under the Executive where they belong.\n\nLastly, real reform can’t just sack and replace federal employees in Washington, which is itself is the problem. In his first term, Trump sent the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to Colorado — losing 90% of the staff along the way.\n\nThat is a fourth way to drain the swamp. Pack the Department of Energy off to Texas. Send Ag to Iowa. Fly Kash Patel and the FBI to Alabama.\n\nTrump must destroy D.C.’s shadow government, which rules and represses through regulation rather than legislation. It’s the surest way to save the republic.\n\nMorgan Murphy is military thought leader, former press secretary to the Secretary of Defense and national security advisor in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The 2019 recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor offered sharp commentary, masterfully tying his recognition to the significance of the organization.\n\n“You know, look, I won a lot of awards recently, but this one tonight is probably the most special award I’ve ever gotten, because it’s from this institution that represents these people, us, people of color, black people,” Chappelle began.\n\nSpeaking to the audience at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, he continued, “My god brother is here tonight, Ben Jealous. Ben used to be the president of the NAACP, and I asked him, I said, ‘What do you think? What do you think I should say tonight?’ And Ben sent me a whole speech.”\n\nHe further reflected on the NAACP’s role in combating negative depictions of African Americans, recalling, “In 1915, the movie Birth of a Nation came out, and had a hideous depiction of African Americans. And by 1927, the NAACP had opened its first office in Hollywood. And from then, 100 years ago to this very night, they have been chipping away at this industry so that people like me can stand up in front of people and tell my story or our stories. Each and every artist in here, every opportunity we get, every time we’re on camera or on stage, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine.”\n\nAs the master of delivery that he is, Chappelle didn’t end there.\n\n“But tonight, man, tonight, I feel invigorated because all my Netflix checks clear,” he quipped, drawing a big laugh from the audience.\n\nAlso in the audience was director Stanley Lathan, who worked on projects ranging from Sanford & Son to Sesame Street to Real Husbands of Hollywood on BET. Lathan, who had directed and produced a number of Chappelle’s Netflix specials, was acknowledged by the honoree in a shout-out.\n\nBut it was the Netflix comment that served as the punchline, setting up Chappelle’s more serious reflection.\n\n“I don’t know anybody any work right now,” he said, transitioning into a more somber tone.\n\n“Every time you see me, just know I’m only up there because I want to be right up there,” Chappelle stressed to the audience in the venue, as well as those watching on CBS and BET on the East Coast. “And I hope, I hope all of us who work in this industry feel strong and inspired and not discouraged, especially because this is a very difficult time right now. And your institution is, sadly, more relevant than it’s been in a long time. We got a lot of work to do, but it feels good to know that we’re not in it alone, that we got each other. And remember, community is everything.”\n\nIn the spirit of solidarity, Chappelle added, “Shout out to everybody who lost their home or was displaced from their home, even for a time.

He does speak French, there is no question about it, but I think it will be a test for him,\" said Daniel Béland, political science professor and director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.\n\n\"People will be listening very carefully, especially people in Quebec or francophones, to not just what he says but how well he says it.\"\n\nBéland said Carney's performance Monday should indicate how well he might perform in a French debate against Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, both strong debaters.\n\nRival candidate Chrystia Freeland, an experienced debater who appears to have fallen far behind in the race, will look to stage a comeback.\n\n\"This is potentially an opportunity for her to put some gas and some energy back into her campaign, and perhaps for Liberal party members to remember why it is that they have been so fond of her for so many years,\" said Liberal strategist Carlene Variyan of Summa Strategies.\n\nCarney currently leads in endorsements, polling and fundraising, and he's the subject of frequent attacks from Poilievre and his caucus — but that doesn't mean he's got the leadership sewn up.\n\n\"Anything can happen because this is a campaign,\" said Variyan. \"I wouldn't be prepared to rule anything out, particularly because of the unpredictable and erratic nature of decisions that come from south of the border and (U.S. President) Donald Trump.\"\n\nFormer government House leader Karina Gould and former Montreal MP Frank Baylis will also take the stage to make their pitches to the Liberal grassroots.\n\nVariyan said she is eyeing Gould because she could have the most to gain from a solid debate performance.\n\n\"She has been a force in this race that I don't think a lot of political observers perhaps would have predicted at the outset,\" she said.\n\n\"What would be very interesting now would be to see whether the race for second truly becomes competitive between Gould and Freeland. That to me is the big story of this leadership campaign — who Karina Gould is and what she'll do next when this is over.\"\n\nAn English-language debate is set for Tuesday in Montreal.\n\nNelson Wiseman, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, said that while debates on their own don't often matter that much in determining the outcome of leadership races, they can occasionally offer make-or-break moments and help turn around political fortunes.\n\nWhile Kamala Harris's sharp debate performance against Trump didn't help her much at the U.S. polls last year, Jack Layton's performance in the federal French debate in 2011 helped lift the NDP to official Opposition status, Wiseman said.\n\nThe other wild card, he said, is the state of the candidates' get-out-the-vote machinery, which is difficult to assess before the voting is over.\n\n\"We could still have surprises, and that's because of the method that the Liberals are using to select the leader,\" Wiseman said.\n\nEach riding is worth 100 points in the race — which means ridings where the Liberals typically do badly are great places to shop for votes. Freeland has spent time in rural Quebec wooing dairy farmers and in rural Alberta and elsewhere rallying Ukrainians.\n\n\"She's playing it very smart to do that,\" said Wiseman, pointing to the 2004 Conservative leadership race won by Stephen Harper. \"Belinda Stronach came in second, ahead of Tony Clement. How did she come in second? She swept all these Quebec ridings.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, immediately following the debates, advance voting opens for party members.

He notes that despite Republicans holding all three branches of the federal government, Trump has mainly used executive orders and other decrees to impose his will instead of using legislation. “They’re trying to create a precedent that presidents cannot be constrained at all,” he says of the party’s strategy. He also faults Democrats for failing to effectively oppose the administration. “What is the Democratic Party for? What does it support? What does it advocate for? There’s not really much of an answer right now.”'\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.\n\nOne month into Donald Trump’s second presidency, he’s mostly governed through executive orders and carried out his agenda with sweeping cuts by the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, the billionaire, and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, all of which has generated a slew of protests, lawsuits, judicial rebukes.\n\nThis week, Trump shared an illustration of himself wearing crown, with the headline “Long Live the King” — it looked like a Time magazine cover — as he cheered his administration’s move to end congestion pricing in New York.\n\nOn Tuesday, Elon Musk defended his work to gut whole agencies across the federal government in a joint interview with President Trump on Fox News.\n\nELON MUSK: I think what we’re seeing here is the sort of — the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, a court filing from the White House Office of Administration lists Elon Musk as a senior adviser to the president who’s serving as an employee of the White House office, not DOGE, which the White House previously said he was leading.\n\nTo discuss this and much more, as Elon Musk holds up a chainsaw at the CPAC summit that just took place, we’re joined by David Sirota, founder and editor-in-chief of The Lever, former senior communications adviser and speechwriter for Bernie Sanders. His recent pieces for The Lever are headlined “Trump Just Limited Your Payout for Airline Mishaps,” “Elon Doesn’t Want You to Know His DEI Past,” and “Musk Just Scored More Government Cash While Pushing Education Cuts.”\n\nWell, you’re here for a big podcast convention. You were talking about climate. But talk about what’s happening right now and the level of resistance.\n\nDAVID SIROTA: I think what we have to understand is that — and the question that we have to ask is: Why is Donald Trump behaving the way he’s behaving when his party already controls Congress and the courts? What is the point of trying to do what he’s doing without going through the normal process of legislating? Right? If you want to close down the Department of Education, if you want to close down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the way to try to do that is through legislation, through passing it through Congress, having the law upheld in court. His party controls those institutions. So why hasn’t the White House tried to do that through the normal process?\n\nAnd I think if you step back, what you see is what they’re trying to do is create the precedent that a president can do whatever a president wants, that it’s not a coequal branch of government, that essentially it is a king, an elected king. And I think they’re relying on the idea that people, or at least their base, doesn’t necessarily know or care about what the difference between a president in a coequal branch of government is versus an elected monarch. They’re trying to create a precedent that presidents cannot be constrained at all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And your response to Elon Musk saying, “We’re talking about the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy”? I mean, you watch Fox, and all they’re talking about is laughing about people getting “DOGEd.” They’re cutting the fat out. You’re not hearing about what the services are that are being slashed, sliced and diced across this country.\n\nDAVID SIROTA: This is an old tactic. This reminds me of the Gingrich era. Newt Gingrich, when he rose to power in Congress, would come out and pick out one or two science projects that sounds, on its face, ridiculous. “Oh, the government’s spending $2 million to study cow flatulence. Oh, this means that the entire government is wasteful.” Meanwhile, there’s a reliance that there’s not an understanding of what scientific research ends up developing. And I think they’re applying that across the board.\n\nAnd we have to ask the question: Well, why? The richest man in the world is also one of the largest government contractors. So there’s an inherent conflict of interest — or, in the case of the Trump administration, I guess, an alignment of interest. The more you cut public services, the more it creates, essentially, the impetus to hire private contractors. And the guy who’s doing the overseeing of the cutting happens to be one of the largest private contractors.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You recently said on social media, quote, “It’s not really a political party at this point. It’s better understood as a country club, with status perks for its emeritus leaders,” and referring to the Democratic Party, in response to news that former VP, presidential candidate Kamala Harris had signed with CAA to represent her on her post-White House initiatives, including speaking engagements and possible book deals.\n\nDAVID SIROTA: Look, the Democratic Party doesn’t seem to be interested in changing, at least not yet. They reelected their same leaders who oversaw the policy and party positioning that led to Trump’s reelection. That’s the same leadership that led to Trump’s first election in 2016. The party doesn’t seem interested in changing how it approaches its own voters or its own effort to win elections. There’s some lip service to the middle — to the working class, but there’s not really a change in policy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: What do you make of Senator Sanders now going around the country and speaking in red districts that are most vulnerable? He says, “If we can turn around three,” he says, they’ve ended their extremely narrow lead in the House.\n\nDAVID SIROTA: Yeah, look, I think Bernie Sanders is doing the right thing. It’s an example of what the Democrats at large should be doing, which is actually going into and trying to speak to the disaffected working class, that used to be the base of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe problem is that the Democratic Party, its leaders, are caught between the demands of their donors and the demands of voters, which is why so often the Democratic leadership sounds incoherent. If you’re trying to address what voters want, but also trying to enrich or appease your donors, you often sound like you stand for nothing. I mean, can we actually explain or answer the question: What do the Democrats stand for right now, other than, in theory, rhetorically being against Trump, even though they’re giving votes to confirm some of his nominees? Like, I think the average person has trouble even articulating: What is the Democratic Party for? What does it support? What does it advocate for? There’s not really much of an answer right now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You had a recent piece on Elon Musk’s previous support for DEI policies at Tesla.\n\nDAVID SIROTA: Yeah. Well, look, only a few years ago, Tesla was touting itself as weaving DEI into its DNA. That’s a quote out of a large report that came out from Tesla. Obviously, the politics have shifted. Donald Trump is trying to demonize DEI as a way to appeal to the working class, and the Democrats haven’t made an effective argument on economics to also try to appeal to the working class. And right now if both parties aren’t really making an economic appeal, then Trump is relying on making an identity appeal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: In this last 20 seconds, what do you think is most important right now?\n\nDAVID SIROTA: The most important thing is for the Democrats to try to gum up the works, to stop what’s going on. They don’t have a lot of power. And it’s also important to understand that if Donald Trump is going outside of the institutions of government, then the Democrats are going to have to rely on different kinds of tactics that don’t just rely on just press conferences in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Do you think it’s possible Republicans in the House and Senate will turn on Trump?\n\nDAVID SIROTA: I don’t believe it’s going to happen. I just — there’s no historical precedent for the Republicans to bail out on their own president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: David Sirota, founder and editor-in-chief of The Lever, we want to thank you so much for being with us, and we will link to your articles at democracynow.org.

But it reflects how disinformation, amplified online, now courses through almost every element of public life in the US.\n\nThe reality of the shortage is far more mundane, if no less devastating for the industry.\n\nIt stems from an outbreak of avian influenza H5N1, which is present in Ireland also, that has led to the loss of tens of millions of poultry and a massive slowdown in US egg production.\n\nCombined with soaring feed, fuel and labour costs, this has seen egg prices more than double over the past year.\n\nThe debacle is also reflective of the current polarisation in US politics. The soaring price of eggs was used by Donald Trump and JD Vance to bash the previous administration.\n\nLast September, Vance stood in a grocery store in Pennsylvania, holding a carton of eggs, which he said was more expensive “thanks to Kamala Harris’s inflationary policies”.\n\nNo mention of the outbreak. The US government’s handling of the avian flu issue could have been criticised (Mexico hasn’t suffered to the same extent because of a vaccine programme) but that wasn’t the point.\n\nIt was about using any tool on the shelf to convince the US electorate that inflation, and the higher cost-of-living was Joe Biden and Harris’s fault. \n\nNow the price of eggs, the cost of living and the country’s stubborn inflation issues are Trump’s problems. And his policies look set to fan prices rather than tame them.\n\nTrumponomics is an economic experiment riddled with contradictions. He stood for election on a pro-growth platform but with ostensibly anti-growth policies. The interplay between tariffs and inflation, immigration controls and economic growth are key flashpoints to watch for.\n\nImposing blanket tariffs on imports is almost certain to trigger inflation. It’s one of the few things economists agree on. And Trump was elected to alleviate cost-of-living pressures not add to them. \n\nThe Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady last month reflected the uncertain inflationary outlook.\n\nTariff increases will translate into higher production costs for US firms as they incur higher import costs or have to use more expensive domestic sources.\n\nMany US importers of steel, for instance, won’t be able to switch to domestic suppliers when the new 25 per cent tariff on steel imports comes in next month, meaning they will have to suck it up, and, in many cases, pass on the increased cost to their customers.\n\nTrump’s economic team will argue that the tariffs imposed during his first presidency weren’t inflationary but they were more limited in scope. \n\nThey were also imposed in an entirely different economic environment before supply chains were impacted by the pandemic and before the energy price shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. \n\nWhen asked if tariffs would complicate the Fed’s interest rate trajectory, Fed chairman Jay Powell paddled through an answer.\n\n“We don’t know for how long or how much, what countries,” he said. “We don’t know about retaliation. We don’t know how it’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers,” he said.\n\nThe market wobble in reaction to the announcement of US tariffs against Canada and Mexico last month was instructive on what business thinks.\n\nBut Trump sees trade as a conflictual, zero-sum game which the US is losing hence the protectionist pivot. \n\nThe other plank of this protectionist agenda, mass deportations and tighter immigration controls will shrink the supply of labour, potentially denting growth. \n\nUS population growth is one of the main factors behind the US’s current growth momentum. And net immigration accounted for more than 80 per cent of the population growth over the last two years, more than twice the usual share.\n\nOne calculation suggests immigration policy under Trump will reduce US growth by up to 0.4 per cent this year. \n\nTrump’s protectionist agenda is politically rather than economically motivated and comes with inherent tensions.\n\nIronically the new administration’s attempt to trim the federal government through mass firings and funding freezes is already said to be hampering the ability of public health professionals to respond to the avian flu outbreak. \n\nTrump’s threat of mass deportations could also in theory discourage farm workers from getting tested for the virus.\n\nTrump’s tech bro Elon Musk also faces contradictions. \n\nAs a maker of electric vehicles and batteries, he has allied himself with an administration that is intent on reversing the previous government’s commitment to less carbon-intensive transportation.\n\nOf course from this vantage point his support for Trump’s low tax, less regulation agenda – combined with his proximity to policymaking in Washington – has supercharged Tesla’s share price and Musk’s net wealth in the process.\n\nBut he has already clashed with Maga Republicans on immigration and the visa programme to bring in skilled workers to the US.\n\nThe first month of Trump’s presidency has been about shock and awe but sooner or later these policies will have to be measured against real outcomes.","summary":"US president stood for election on a pro-growth platform but with ostensibly anti-growth policies","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2025/02/23/trump-and-his-contradictory-economic-agenda/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/ZIQ7VJHOFCPFWEX3MPK6F36VS4.jpg?auth=aa57107b77aec5b41c2d3dd87b9a32d0a8578d688c7af3007e8fc4eba014f3c6&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 12:47:22","author":"Eoin Burke-Kennedy","authors":["Eoin Burke-Kennedy"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":293485816,"title":"Carney under pressure as Liberal leadership candidates prepare for French debate","text":"Presumed Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney faces a major test Monday in Montreal, when he and his rivals square off in person for the first time in a French-language debate.\n\nCarney is new to federal politics and his performance will be under the microscope. He’ll have to prove to Liberals that he can think on his feet in French — and since he has the most to lose, he’s expected to spend most of his time on defence.\n\n“Especially after his inaugural speech in Edmonton, some people criticized his French, saying it was not that good. He does speak French, there is no question about it, but I think it will be a test for him,” said Daniel Béland, political science professor and director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.\n\n“People will be listening very carefully, especially people in Quebec or francophones, to not just what he says but how well he says it.”\n\nBéland said Carney’s performance Monday should indicate how well he might perform in a French debate against Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, both strong debaters.\n\nRival candidate Chrystia Freeland, an experienced debater who appears to have fallen far behind in the race, will look to stage a comeback.\n\n“This is potentially an opportunity for her to put some gas and some energy back into her campaign, and perhaps for Liberal party members to remember why it is that they have been so fond of her for so many years,” said Liberal strategist Carlene Variyan of Summa Strategies.\n\nCarney currently leads in endorsements, polling and fundraising, and he’s the subject of frequent attacks from Poilievre and his caucus — but that doesn’t mean he’s got the leadership sewn up.\n\n“Anything can happen because this is a campaign,” said Variyan. “I wouldn’t be prepared to rule anything out, particularly because of the unpredictable and erratic nature of decisions that come from south of the border and (U.S. President) Donald Trump.”\n\nFormer government House leader Karina Gould and former Montreal MP Frank Baylis will also take the stage to make their pitches to the Liberal grassroots.\n\nVariyan said she is eyeing Gould because she could have the most to gain from a solid debate performance.\n\n“She has been a force in this race that I don’t think a lot of political observers perhaps would have predicted at the outset,” she said.\n\n“What would be very interesting now would be to see whether the race for second truly becomes competitive between Gould and Freeland. That to me is the big story of this leadership campaign — who Karina Gould is and what she’ll do next when this is over.”\n\nAn English-language debate is set for Tuesday in Montreal.\n\nNelson Wiseman, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, said that while debates on their own don’t often matter that much in determining the outcome of leadership races, they can occasionally offer make-or-break moments and help turn around political fortunes.\n\nWhile Kamala Harris’s sharp debate performance against Trump didn’t help her much at the U.S. polls last year, Jack Layton’s performance in the federal French debate in 2011 helped lift the NDP to official Opposition status, Wiseman said.\n\nThe other wild card, he said, is the state of the candidates’ get-out-the-vote machinery, which is difficult to assess before the voting is over.\n\n“We could still have surprises, and that’s because of the method that the Liberals are using to select the leader,” Wiseman said.\n\nEach riding is worth 100 points in the race — which means ridings where the Liberals typically do badly are great places to shop for votes. Freeland has spent time in rural Quebec wooing dairy farmers and in rural Alberta and elsewhere rallying Ukrainians.\n\n“She’s playing it very smart to do that,” said Wiseman, pointing to the 2004 Conservative leadership race won by Stephen Harper. “Belinda Stronach came in second, ahead of Tony Clement. How did she come in second? She swept all these Quebec ridings.”\n\nOn Wednesday, immediately following the debates, advance voting opens for party members. The winner will be named March 9.","summary":"Carney currently leads in endorsements, polling and fundraising, and he's the subject of frequent attacks from Poilievre — but that doesn't mean he's got the leadership sewn up.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11031400/carney-under-pressure-as-liberal-leadership-candidates-prepare-for-french-debate/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/35b5640d8e5146c8399506a5162816b6040503be39126871ad8c6bbaeb2f7db3_417f8c.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 12:44:18","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Canadian Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.277},{"id":293486024,"title":"Top Biden advisor says Dem party ‘lost its mind’ after debate: ‘It melted down’","text":"A top advisor to former President Joe Biden said the Democratic Party “melted down” after his poor performance in the June 2024 debate against President Donald Trump and insisted Biden should have remained the party’s candidate.\n\nBiden’s rough performance and weak voice at the CNN Presidential Debate sparked immense fear about his re-election odds, and the left’s top leaders called on him to withdraw from the race.\n\nBiden was replaced as the Democratic candidate by Vice President Kamala Harris less than a month later on July 21.\n\nShe lost to Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“Now, lots of people have terrible debates,” former Biden senior advisor Mike Donilon said during a discussion at Harvard University. “Lots of people have terrible debates.

It didn’t get bigger.”\n\nHe discussed focus groups that convened on the night of the debate, noting while they believed Trump won overall, they voiced concerns about both candidates.\n\n“They will say they’re worried about Biden’s age, but they’ll also say something else,” Donilon said. “They were really worried about Trump. They were worried about the fact he said he wouldn’t accept the results of the election. They were worried that he said, ‘I had nothing to do with Jan. 6.’ The sense from him was that he was not on the side of people.”\n\nWhat really happened, according to Donilon, was not as devastating as the conventional wisdom became. \n\n“I said this to Biden the morning after the debate: Sometimes you can lose the campaign about the campaign,” he said. “And that’s what happened to us.”\n\nHe insisted the former president was not mentally impaired but acknowledged the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021 and inflation contributed to Biden’s downfall.","summary":"A top advisor to former President Joe Biden said the Democratic Party “melted down” after his poor performance in the June 2024 debate against President Donald Trump and insisted Biden should have remained the party’s candidate.

As John reports, the first Trump administration and congressional Republicans previously seemed supportive of the same groups and initiatives they’ve recently come to vilify. “Indeed, the federal government has been asking religious nonprofits to care for unaccompanied minors for decades. The Trafficking Protection Victims Act, passed in 2000 and reauthorized in 2008, establishes special protections for minors who arrive from countries that do not share a border with the United States. Under that U.S. law, minors from Canada and Mexico may be quickly deported if there are no signs of trafficking, but the removal process for minors from other countries goes through a lengthier adjudication. Sometimes the government relies on nonprofits to shelter, feed, and educate those unaccompanied minors, or help reunite them with their family members. If the children are allowed to stay, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act requires home studies to ensure those minors are going to a safe place, and the government often relies on religious nonprofits to do that vetting. During Trump’s first term, his administration gave hundreds of millions of dollars to secular and religious groups to care for unaccompanied minors, and Melania Trump visited one of the Lutheran charities caring for unaccompanied minors in 2018. When the arrival of unaccompanied minors first reached crisis levels during the second term of the Obama administration, Republicans viewed religious nonprofits as part of the solution to the humanitarian crisis. ‘I want to thank Catholic Charities that are working to care for these children and care for these families,’ Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said during a 2014 visit to McAllen, Texas.” John caught up with Cruz recently and tried repeatedly to press him on his views of such groups now. “Asked a second time if he now thinks charities are a cause of the border crisis, Cruz said before stepping into an elevator: ‘There are more than a few NGOs that were actively complicit in the invasion of our Southern border, and it is why it is Democrat policy to funnel billions to the NGOs where in many ways Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were the last mile of the human trafficking network that resulted in such egregious abuses.’”\n\nPart of the zeitgeist for some religious writers on the right has included a questioning of the so-called “postwar consensus” that has shaped moral and political commitments in the West since World War II—such as the concept of universal human rights. Critics of the postwar consensus, such as First Things editor R.R. Reno, have argued that its commitment to ideal such as secularism undermines the whole project. But in the journal Ad Fontes, John Ehrett argues that much of the postwar consensus—while by no means perfect—sprang from Christian thought seeking to correct errors made by Christians rationalizing the horrors of fascist regimes. He does so by mining both contemporary arguments against the postwar consensus and writings of German Christians seeking to make their peace with the Third Reich: “To connect the dots: on this account, God’s will becomes coterminous with the will of the political collective, with the collective’s striving toward a common end. That is a theological problem. It is a problem which follows from confusing, tacitly, two different conceptions of that which is divine: transcendent authority, and the bond by which the collective coheres. The deep theological ambivalence of this latter—the-sacred-as-collective-effervescence—is something which the ‘postwar consensus’ rightly reacted against at the level of principle. In Christian terms, absolutizing the latter sacred can (and did) lead to idolatry: divinizing, as the ‘Will of God,’ a particular constellation of historically contingent Völker, and denying any possibility of exit or critique. This was not the faith for all once delivered to the saints. Construing Nazism (and the German Christian movement, and its sympathizers) as a specifically theological problem can help explain why, in the postwar period, so many players understood the emergence of the postwar consensus in specifically Christian theological terms—as a theological correction of deficient theology. It may come as a surprise to those highly invested in denouncing the ‘postwar consensus’ today, but as legal historian Samuel Moyn has recently argued in great detail, the regime of ‘human rights’ so basic to this postwar consensus was, in fact, elaborated as an integrally Christian project—as a response to the way in which Nazi ‘theology’ went awry.”\n\nReports of young people turning to older Christian traditions such as Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism have been part of the recent milieu, but for Religion News Service, Richa Karmarkar writes that similar occurrences are happening with Hinduism. “Amid confusing times, says devotional musician Gaura Vani, Generations Z and X have found a way to articulate their complicated emotions and feelings through the call-and-response style of kirtans, the devotional songs commonly associated with the Hare Krishna faith. ‘This is almost a miraculous thing to say, but in this world of social media and phone addiction and all that, the kids in the Krishna community are doing the craziest thing: Without anyone telling them to, they will find a weekend where everyone’s free, they will dress to the nines together, and find a temple or a space where they will do kirtans for, like, 10 hours straight,’ he told RNS. ‘It’s crazy. It makes no sense in the modern world, but they’re doing it.’”","summary":"Both are virtues, and both must be evident in virtuous societies.","url":"https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/dispatch-faith/justice-mercy-virtues-christianity/","image":"https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/The_Dispatch_-mercy-justice_cmyk.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 12:00:00","author":"Michael Reneau","authors":["Michael Reneau"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":293469922,"title":"NAACP Image Awards 2025: See the Complete Winners List","text":"The 2025 NAACP Image Award winners are in! \n\n On Saturday, Feb. 22, a star-studded 56th annual ceremony hosted by actor-comedian Deon Cole, airing live on BET and CBS from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles, concluded several days of exciting winner announcements.

Usually, the party doesn’t lose its mind, but that’s what happened here. It melted down.”\n\nCNN and the BBC ran headlines calling the performance “disastrous” and “incoherent.”\n\n“If Joe Biden loses November’s election, history will record that it took just 10 minutes to destroy a presidency,” CNN senior reporter Stephen Collinson wrote in an article. “It was clear a political disaster was about to unfold as soon as the 81-year-old commander in chief stiffly shuffled on stage in Atlanta.”\n\nCollinson went on to describe Biden as giving the weakest performance in televised debate history.\n\nNew York Times columnist and Biden supporter Thomas Friedman wrote the debate made him “weep” and called on Biden to step aside.\n\n“I cannot remember a more heartbreaking moment in American presidential campaign politics in my lifetime — precisely because of what it revealed: Joe Biden, a good man and a good president, has no business running for re-election,” Friedman wrote.\n\nDonilon, who has known Biden for more than four decades, described the Democratic Party’s reaction as “insane.”\n\n“I think the party lost its mind,” he said. “If you ask people about this period of time, they’ll tell you Biden was losing the polls, he was going to lose. … They were saying this in a margin-of-error race.”\n\nHe added he had never seen a situation where a candidate was down three points nationally in the summer of a general election and his party decided he could not win.\n\n“But that’s what happened, right?” Donilon said. “If you actually go and look at the polling in the first couple of days after the debate, the margin between Trump and Biden got closer. It didn’t get bigger.”\n\nHe discussed focus groups that convened on the night of the debate, noting while they believed Trump won overall, they voiced concerns about both candidates.\n\n“They will say they’re worried about Biden’s age, but they’ll also say something else,” Donilon said. “They were really worried about Trump. They were worried about the fact he said he wouldn’t accept the results of the election. They were worried that he said, ‘I had nothing to do with Jan. 6.’ The sense from him was that he was not on the side of people.”\n\nWhat really happened, according to Donilon, was not as devastating as the conventional wisdom became. \n\n“I said this to Biden the morning after the debate: Sometimes you can lose the campaign about the campaign,” he said. “And that’s what happened to us.”\n\nHe insisted the former president was not mentally impaired but acknowledged the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021 and inflation contributed to Biden’s downfall.","summary":"\"Sometimes you can lose the campaign about the campaign,' a Biden senior advisor said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/23/us-news/top-biden-advisor-mike-donilon-says-party-lost-its-mind-after-debate-it-melted-down/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/newspress-collage-7dvmnf6h5-1740307095147.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1740289145&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SymBpEI7-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-23 11:31:18","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.542},{"id":293520440,"title":"Fight Club Knockout Stories: Cocaine Mitch's Reign of Error Comes to an End","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters \n\n BREITBART\n\nUkraine Peace Push\nJust DOGE It\nHamas Horror\n\nL.A.

She encouraged people to remain strong and keep their faith alive during President Donald Trump’s term.\n\nAddressing the audience after accepting the NAACP’s Chairman’s Award, Harris acknowledged the challenges ahead in the current chapter of America’s history. She emphasized that the course of the nation will not solely be determined by the president or the wealthy elite, but by the collective efforts of the citizens.\n\nThe 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.\n\nHaving lost the presidency to Trump in the previous year’s election, Harris made history as the first woman and person of color to hold the position of vice president. Prior to this role, she had served as a senator in California and as the state’s attorney general.\n\nIn her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump’s actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nHarris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America’s future.\n\n“Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask ‘What do we do now?’” Harris said. “But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path.”\n\nOther winners of the Chairman’s prize have included former President Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.\n\nNAACP Hall of Fame\n\nHarris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family. The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.\n\nKeenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.\n\nMarlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock’s “Bel-Air” was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family’s rise.\n\n“He raised us all like Jedis,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for our big brother.”\n\nMarlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, ”Boy, I’ve known you your whole life, and you ain’t never said nothing funny. That’s the funniest thing you’ve said.”\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.\n\nThe family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series “In Living Color” in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof “Scary Movie,” which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in “White Chicks” in 2004. Damon Wayan’s had a starring role in the 1995 comedy “Major Payne,” and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom “Poppa’s House,” which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show.\n\nDamon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: “Happy Endings” and “New Girl.” Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama “Pariah.”\n\nEntertainer of the year\n\nKeke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.\n\n“Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn’t think I was going to win,” said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo’s Oscar-nominated performance in “Wicked.”\n\nPalmer starred in the buddy comedy “One of Them Days,” which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC’s “Password.”\n\n“It’s such an amazing category to be in with all these people,” Palmer said. “It’s a beautiful night. It’s Black History Month, y’all. It’s so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another.”\n\nOther nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe.\n\nAwards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires\n\nImage Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January’s devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.\n\nA video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage.\n\n“Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozens souls gone forever,” said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu.\n\n“But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,” said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded.\n\nCole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West’s wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.\n\nThe opening act was a lead-up to the evening’s first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in “The Equalizer.”\n\nChappelle honored\n\nDave Chappelle was honored with the President’s Award for his “thought-provoking humor.”\n\nAccepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP’s push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation.\n\n“Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine,” he said.\n\nPast recipients of the President’s Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, Former Vice President Kamala Harris gave a serious message&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris awarded prestigious Chairman&#8217;s prize at NAACP Image Awards first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/kamala-harris-awarded-prestigious-chairmans-prize-at-naacp-image-awards/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kamala-Harris-receives-prestigious-Chairman039s-prize-at-NAACP-Image-Awards.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 11:16:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.231},{"id":293469844,"title":"Minnesota Muslims and Somali Americans speak out on politics, faith and being open to Trump in 2024","text":"In Minnesota, Muslims and Somali Americans talked politics, religion and how their votes were swayed in the 2024 election. Some showed a new affinity for the Republican Party under Donald Trump. \"Somalis were inherently Democrats,\" Salman Fiqy told Fox News Digital. Fiqy explained further that the first wave of Somali immigrants came to the U.S. in the late 90s and engaged in politics during the Obama era. \"So that's why they saw themselves aligned with Democrats and then things have changed for the worse with the Democrats,\" Fiqy said. TRUMP EARNS ENDORSEMENT FROM 'HIGHLY RESPECTED' MUSLIM LEADERS IN BATTLEGROUND STATE Fiqy is an outspoken Republican and conservative who has publicly endorsed President Donald Trump. He confidently told Fox News Digital that many Somalians voted for President Trump. The top issue was education, the Minneapolis local said. \"The LGBTQ agendas pushing towards kids, where we tend to have big families, we value kids and … We see things from a conservative lens,\" Fiqy said. A majority of the Somali population is Muslim, government data states. Somali Americans' support for the Democratic Party has dropped since the 2020 presidential election of President Joe Biden. In Cedar-Riverside in Minnesota, the home to many Somali immigrants, support for Democratic Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris dropped 14 points. Over 25,000 Somali Americans live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many fled their country’s civil war in the 1990s. The Cedar-Riverside neighborhood has traditionally been home to immigrants, including Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes. Currently, Somalians are the predominant group in the community, establishing several businesses and a \"Somali Mall\" in Cedar-Riverside. \"They [Somali Americans] were very scared of how their children would be brought up in that situation, and they preferred to vote for Trump with those views, even though they knew Trump was coming with the baggage, and they preferred to take on the baggage,\" Fatmata told Fox News Digital. A \"copy practitioner,\" Fatmata owns a business in Karmel Mall, located in the Whittier neighborhood in Minneapolis. Karmel is the first Somali shopping center in the U.S., hosting a plethora of Somali businesses, including barbershops, restaurants, clothing stores, electronic retail and hair salons. Fatmata is not Somalian and identifies as Black. She told Fox News Digital that she is Muslim and often engages with the Somali community. Her business provides copy that \"aligns more with the Islamic view of copying.\" She planted her business in the Somali shopping center because it was easier to find clients. She added that Muslim values drove her counterparts and Somali Americans to vote. \"I think one of the main issues with Muslims voting … specifically voting for Trump, is because of issues that align with their religious values, that they felt like things were going too much to the right, and they did not agree with those things,\" Fatmata said. UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA STUDENTS RAIL AGAINST COLLEGE LEADERSHIP OVER WISHY-WASHY STAND ON ICE Trump also gained Muslim voters last election, more than his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, an exit poll from The Council on American-Islamic Relations states. Fatmata told Fox News Digital that many Somali Americans did not like Trump’s rhetoric on deportations, yet still voted for the Republican candidate. \"We knew it was coming. It was those choices we had to make knowing that these are the things he stands for, that perhaps we don't agree as the minority community.\" One business owner in Karmel told Fox News Digital that he voted for Trump because of his pro-business policies. \"I support and I voted [for] Mr. Trump last time. A few things … [I] think it was better for the business because, since I'm a business guy and the tax break that he was giving us also. Yeah, that was the reason that I support it,\" a business owner who did not want to disclose his identity told Fox News Digital in an audio recording. Over in Cedar-Riverside, Fox News Digital spoke with a neighborhood pharmacist who said that Somali Americans don't have anything in common with Trump. \"I don't think any Somali person, including me or my family, or even as a Somali in general, supported him. I mean, what does he have in common with the Somali community? What are you going to ask for yourself? I mean, there's no commonality,\" said a pharmacist who worked at Cedar Pharmacy in the Somali Mall. \"I don't see any illegal immigrants here. The United States has always been a country for immigrants from the beginning,\" the Somalian pharmacist said. Across the street from Cedar Pharmacy, another business owner named Salah who ran a restaurant called Barakalaa Somali Cuisine shared a conflicting statement. When asked whether Somalians supported Trump, he responded \"yes.\" \"I see everybody all together in the community vote for the candidate,\" Salah said. Fatmata said that the choice was not easy for Muslims and Somali Americans. \"Do we vote for him to protect our children's religious views, plus everything else that he has? Perhaps, last time it was the Muslim ban and those things. Do we still vote for him versus do we sell out our children's religious upbringing and take that? So, it's a lot. But, people had to weigh that,\" Fatmata said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The ones who voted for him.

The buys will support former Republican state Attorney General Brad Schimel in the fight against liberal-leaning circuit court Judge Susan Crawford.\n\nMusk first weighed in on the race in January, when he said on X that it was “very important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud,” referring to the majority-liberal court allowing absentee voting to proceed last cycle. \n\nThe election will take place on April 1. It's unclear if Building America’s Future will make additional contributions before then, but the flood of cash already spent may push Schimel over the edge in a state President Donald Trump carried by less than 1 percent. \n\nBuilding America’s Future — one of many PACs Musk used to drop more than $250 million on Trump last year — spent over $33 million on races in 2024, per OpenSecrets.\n\nThe group spent millions on disinformation ops, funding a set of contradictory ads in predominantly Muslim communities professing Vice President Kamala Harris’s support for Israel paired with messages of support for Gaza in predominantly Jewish communities. Another initiative from the group, Progress 2028, falsely presented itself as a left-leaning answer to Project 2025.\n\nThe first ad from the group in Wisconsin race aired on Feb. 20, invoking a similar bellicose style to the group’s prior efforts. The 30-second spot attacks Crawford, the liberal-leaning candidate, for a 2018 sentence in which she gave four years in prison to a man convicted of making sexual contact with two children in a public swimming pool, deeming her “dangerous” for Wisconsin.\n\nIn a statement to Salon, Judge Crawford said Schimel has \"proven he is for sale, literally confessing to groveling on his knees for support from deep-pocketed, far-right donors.\"\n\n\"Schimel took money from big drug companies and then refused to sue opioid manufacturers to hold them accountable for harming our communities, and gave a lenient plea deal to a man with a huge cache of child pornography after his lawyer gave thousands to his campaign,\" she said. \"Elon Musk and other right-wing billionaires are pouring money into this race because they can bank on Brad Schimel to protect their corporate dominance, restrict reproductive freedoms, and take our state backward at the expense of ordinary Wisconsinites.\"\n\nIn an appearance at Marquette University Law School earlier this week, Schimel addressed Musk’s contributions and said he “can’t do anything to stop the money that comes into these races.” He added that he construed donations as a sign that donors “like the things that you stand for not because they're buying some end result.”\n\nMusk isn’t the only deep-pocketed donor to intervene in the race, however. On Crawford’s side, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and philanthropist George Soros donated $500,000 and $1 million, respectively, via the state Democratic party. Schimel also received nearly $1.7 million from Midwest business magnates Diane Hendricks, Liz Uihlein and Joe Ricketts via the state Republican party.\n\nJay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, told Salon the last state Supreme Court race in 2023 “was the highest spending judicial election in the history of the United States.” April's race could top that.\n\nTwo years ago, a liberal justice ended a 15-year conservative reign on the bench, in part fueled by millions in ad buys from Super PAC A Better Wisconsin Together, a progressive advocacy organization, and other groups. Spending on both sides surpassed $50 million.\n\n“There's no reason why we're not going to see the spending continue in huge amounts in future elections,” Heck told Salon. \n\nHeck said that in the decade since Wisconsin made sweeping changes to allow more outside cash to pour into its election campaigns — allowing unlimited party-to-campaign cash transfers, raising individual contribution limits, and upping PAC restrictions — the state has become “a wild west in terms of campaign spending.”\n\n“There’s no limit on what political parties can give to the campaigns of the Supreme Court justices,” he said, adding that more than any other race, big money poses ethical issues for judges and their ability to be impartial. “There needs to be more assurance on the part of candidates and Supreme Court justices that they're going to be able to render decisions from the court unencumbered by the pressure of campaign millionaires.”\n\nHeck didn’t rule out another cash drop from Musk, or even a direct donation to the state party. Representatives for Building America's Future did not yet respond to a request for comment.\n\n“They've dropped $1.6 million, I don't know if there'll be more. I suspect there'll be more money dropped in,” he told Salon. “He's the richest man in the world. He's got the unlimited capacity to be able to spread his money around.”\n\nAnd there’s a big incentive to get involved for the ultra-wealthy. With Crawford’s win, liberal leaners could cement a majority on the court until at least 2028, Heck told Salon.\n\nLocal Democrats are condemning the effort from the DOGE boss — currently hard at work dismantling the federal bureaucracy — to reshape the Badger State’s top court.\n\nIn a statement, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler warned that Musk’s “attempt to buy Wisconsin’s Supreme Court is a red alert that his attack on democracy isn’t limited to gutting the federal government.” Wikler also argued that a right-wing court could restore gerrymandered legislative maps and influence future election rules and certification fights.\n\nBut others point out that Musk could have lucrative business before the high court soon enough. Musk’s Tesla sued Wisconsin earlier this year, per Wisconsin Public Radio, arguing it should be exempted from a state law banning auto manufacturers from owning car dealerships. A hearing in Outagamie County Circuit Court is set for next month, and attorneys for Tesla argue a ruling in their favor would dramatically expand sales in the state.","summary":"Wisconsin is a \"wild west in terms of campaign spending,\" with the last high court race shattering spending records","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/02/23/elon-musk-and-other-right-wing-donors-are-pouring-money-into-wisconsins-race/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/02/elon_musk_2200924661.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 10:45:04","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":293444516,"title":"Kamala Harris receives prestigious Chairman's prize at NAACP Image Awards","text":"LOS ANGELES -- Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of President Donald Trump.\n\n“While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us,” Harris said after receiving the NAACP’s Chairman's Award. “The American story will be written by you.

President Trump is for you.” \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris had previously voiced support for taxpayer-funded gender-transition surgeries for transgender prisoners, and Trump capitalized on the absurdity of that position.\n\nTrump also campaigned on overturning the Biden-Harris administration’s misguided mission to undermine the entire premise of Title IX by prioritizing gender over biological sex in the law that prohibits discrimination based on sex at schools that take federal money.\n\nThe president didn’t waste time fulfilling his campaign promises to women and girls. \n\nTrump signed on Feb. 5 an executive order, “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” to prevent transgender athletes from choosing to play on female teams and enter private spaces like locker rooms. \n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn recent years, female athletes have spoken out and filed lawsuits in regard to how unfair – and even unsafe – it is for them to be forced to compete against biological males. \n\n“From now on, women’s sports will be only for women,” Trump said at the signing, where he was aptly surrounded by cheering girls and women. \n\nOpinion:One month down in Trump's presidency, 47 to go. Democrats better buckle up.\n\nTrump's order has immediate impact for female athletes\n\nTrump’s executive order was not merely performative. It had immediate results.\n\nThe next day, the National Collegiate Athletic Association issued a statement officially changing its policy on transgender athletes. The leading U.S. college athletic organization will now limit “competition in women’s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.”\n\n“The NCAA is an organization made up of 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states that collectively enroll more than 530,000 student-athletes,” NCAA President Charlie Baker stated. “We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today’s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions. To that end, President Trump’s order provides a clear, national standard.”\n\nThe NCAA’s previous policy was much more lenient to transgender student participation and had led to a high-profile lawsuit last year by multiple female athletes who believed their rights had been violated, in part by having to compete against transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. That lawsuit is still ongoing. \n\nOpinion:These women say transgender rules discriminate against them. So they're suing the NCAA.\n\nFormer collegiate swimmer turned conservative activist Riley Gaines is the lead plaintiff in that lawsuit, and she’s pleased with the NCAA’s change – and grateful for Trump’s intervention.\n\n“I’m thrilled to see the NCAA taking steps to align with Donald J. Trump’s recent Executive Order,” Gaines, an ambassador for the Independent Women's Forum, said in a statement. “While it’s unfortunate that it took women losing opportunities, facing exploitation in locker rooms, and suffering injuries for leaders to recognize the importance of single-sex spaces, this is still a victory worth celebrating.”\n\nMore work must be done to secure women's rights\n\nWhile Trump’s order sets an important new tone, the president must continue working with Congress to ensure that these protections for female sports are crystalized into law. The House has already passed a bill that would do just that, and the Senate shouldn’t delay taking action. Encouragement from Trump would help.\n\nThe courts also are standing for women’s rights. Last month, a judge overturned former President Joe Biden’s Title IX rewrite that undermined biological sex.\n\nOpinion:Liberals want to erase women. Trump is standing up for our most basic rights.\n\nThe day before Trump signed his executive order, another group of female athletes filed a lawsuit against Harvard University, the NCAA, the University of Pennsylvania and the Ivy League Council of Presidents. \n\nThe plaintiffs are three former University of Pennsylvania swimmers who were teammates of Thomas, the transgender swimmer. The women say that they were discriminated against, and that they were “repeatedly emotionally traumatized” for having to share locker rooms with Thomas.\n\nBravo to all these young women who have been brave enough to stand against this injustice and to bring it to the public’s attention.\n\nAnd bravo to Trump for standing up for them. \n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.
