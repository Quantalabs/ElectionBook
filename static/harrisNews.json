Vice President Kamala Harris, she said, “had an incredibly good day in revealing her economic plan,” while former President Donald Trump was “ranting and raving” at his golf club. Tarlov noted that Harris, unlike President Joe Biden, mentioned in her speech Friday that the price of bread has gone up 50%, adding that Harris is adopting more of a Bill Clinton-esque “I feel your pain” approach. “I think that this was an incredibly good day for Kamala,” Tarlov continued. “She was able to introduce herself to the American public in a way she hadn’t before.” The TV host then compared Harris’ speech to the one Trump gave on Thursday: “You had President Trump, someone who grew up a millionaire, became a billionaire, standing in front of his golf club, ranting and raving about everything, lying about everything from GDP rates to poverty rates to energy production, et cetera.” “You have Kamala Harris, someone talking about her middle-class upbringing, the fact her family rented throughout their lives so she knows what it means for people out there who can’t get on the property ladder, someone who worked at McDonald’s through college,” Tarlov continued. “You couldn’t have a starker juxtaposition between these two candidates.” However, Jeanine Pirro dismissed Harris’ plan to end price gouging as “communism” and compared her to former Soviet Head of State Joseph Stalin. She also wondered why Harris, a former Attorney General of California, hadn’t already convened all the states’ AGs to fix price-gouging at the state level. “No, she waits until now,” Pirro said.

Rampell, a columnist for the Washington Post and a CNN economics and political commentator, argued the plan was \"bad\" for various reasons, from practicality to effectiveness. \"Well, first of all, nobody can explain what price gouging means,\" she said on CNN, saying the idea of \"excessive\" prices or profit margins is subjective and thus \"very hard to pin down what this would actually mean.\" CNN ANCHOR SAYS HARRIS' PRICE CONTROL PLAN ‘SOUNDS’ LIKE A ‘PLOY:’ ‘IS IT REALLY POLICY?’ She also blasted Democratic legislation that would \"likely be the template\" for Harris' policy proposal as \"especially bad.\" \"If you look at the legislation that, as I mentioned, is already in the Senate, led by Senator Warren and Senator Bob Casey and a slew of others, the particular way that this is written, which is likely to be the template for any proposal that Harris would eventually embrace, is especially bad in that it just bans excessive prices, grossly excessive prices, grossly excessive profit margins, and says that the Federal Trade Commission can use any the metric it deems appropriate to decide what that — what that would mean,\" she said, knocking the idea of \"the FTC to be deciding, like, how much Kroger charges for eggs in Michigan.\" Furthermore, she argued, the plan would be \"very bad for markets,\" and could lead down the same failed path as socialist and communist governments.

Wages have also risen sharply since the pandemic, and have outpaced prices for more than a year. Still, surveys find Americans continue to struggle with higher costs. “We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed,” Harris said Friday in Raleigh, North Carolina. “But our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.” Will her proposals do much to lower prices? And what even is “price gouging”? The answers to those and other questions are below: What is price gouging? There is no strict definition that economists would agree on, but it generally refers to spikes in prices that typically follow a disruption in supply, such as after a hurricane or other natural disaster. Consumer advocates charge that gouging occurs when retailers sharply increase prices, particularly for necessities, under such circumstances. Is it already illegal? Several states already restrict price gouging, but there is no federal-level ban. There are federal restrictions on related but different practices, such as price-fixing laws that bar companies from agreeing to not compete against each other and set higher prices. Will Harris’ proposal lower grocery prices? Most economists would say no, though her plan could have an impact on future crises. For one thing, it’s unclear how much price gouging is going on right now. Grocery prices are still painfully high compared to four years ago, but they increased just 1.1% in July compared with a year earlier, according to the most recent inflation report. That is in line with pre-pandemic increases. President Joe Biden said Wednesday that inflation has been defeated after Wednesday’s inflation report showed that it fell to 2.9% in July, the smallest increase in three years. “There’s some dissonance between claiming victory on the inflation front in one breath and then arguing that there’s all this price gouging happening that is leading consumers to face really high prices in another breath,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. In general, after an inflationary spike, it’s very hard to return prices to where they were. Sustained price declines typically only happen in steep, protracted recessions. Instead, economists generally argue that the better approach is for wages to keep rising enough so that Americans can handle the higher costs. So why is Harris talking about this now? Probably because inflation remains a highly salient issue politically. And plenty of voters do blame grocery stores, fast food chains, and food and packaged goods makers for the surge of inflation in the past three years. Corporate profits soared in 2021 and 2022. “It could be that they’re looking at opinion polls that show that the number one concern facing voters is inflation and that a large number of voters blame corporations for inflation,” Strain said. At the same time, even if prices aren’t going up as much, as Harris noted, they remain high, even as supply chain kinks have been resolved. Elizabeth Pancotti, a policy analyst at Roosevelt Forward, a progressive advocacy group, points to the wood pulp used in diapers. The price of wood pulp has fallen by half from its post-pandemic peak, yet diaper prices haven’t. “So that just increases the (profit) margins for both the manufacturers and the retailers,” she said. Did price gouging cause inflation? Most economists would say no, that it was a more straightforward case of supply and demand. When the pandemic hit, meat processing plants were occasionally closed after COVID-19 outbreaks, among other disruptions to supply. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine lifted the cost of wheat and other grains on global markets. Auto prices rose as carmakers were unable to get all the semiconductors they needed from Taiwan to manufacture cars, and many car plants shut down temporarily. At the same time, several rounds of stimulus checks fattened Americans’ bank accounts, and after hunkering down during the early phase of the pandemic, so-called “revenge spending” took over. The combination of stronger demand and reduced supply was a recipe for rising prices. Still, some economists have argued that large food and consumer goods companies took advantage of pandemic-era disruptions. Consumers saw empty store shelves and heard numerous stories about disrupted supply chains, and at least temporarily felt they had little choice but to accept the higher prices. Economist Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, called it “seller’s inflation.” Others referred to it as “greedflation.” “What a lot of corporations did was exploit consumers’ willingness” to accept the disruptions from the pandemic, Pancotti said. Is banning price gouging like instituting price controls? During the last spike of inflation in the 1970s, both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations at times imposed price controls, which specifically limited what companies could charge for goods and services. They were widely blamed for creating shortages and long lines for gas. Some economists say Harris’ proposal would have a similar impact. “It’s a heavy-handed socialist policy that I don’t think any economist would support,” said Kevin Hassett, a former top economic adviser in the Trump White House. But Pancotti disagreed. She argued that it was closer to a consumer protection measure. Under Harris’ proposal, the government wouldn’t specify prices, but the Federal Trade Commission could investigate price spikes. “The proposal is really about protecting consumers from unscrupulous corporate actors that are trying to just rip the consumer off because they know they can,” she said.","summary":"Grocery prices are still painfully high compared to four years ago.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/kamala-harris-calls-for-price-gouging-ban-high-grocery-bills-inflation-2024/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2166259224-e1723852658274.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 00:00:36","author":"Christopher Rugaber,The Associated Press","authors":["Christopher Rugaber","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.562},{"id":254293764,"title":"Supreme Court rejects Biden’s Title IX regulations in states where governors oppose","text":"The Supreme Court denied the application of President Joe Biden’s new Title IX sex discrimination and education regulations in states where courts blocked them in a 5-4 decision Friday.

All justices agreed the disputed changes, including the new definition of “sex discrimination” to include “gender identity” and the restrictions on same-sex spaces, could remain blocked. “All Members of the Court today accept that the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief as to three provisions of the rule, including the central provision that newly defines sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,” the Supreme Court said in its unsigned opinion.

She emphasized the importance of addressing the financial burden that weighs on voters, which former President Donald Trump is trying to attribute to her. Speaking in the pivotal state of North Carolina, Harris highlighted her commitment to bolstering the middle class as a key priority of her presidency. She outlined her proposal to introduce a federal restriction on price gouging by food producers and retailers. Comparing Harris to Trump, Wallace expressed her view that the vice president advocates for the interests of the middle and lower classes, while the former president favors policies that benefit those with significant wealth, allowing them to pursue their desires unrestricted. Polls nonetheless show that Americans are more likely to trust Trump over Harris when it comes to handling the economy: Some 45 per cent say Trump is better positioned to handle the economy, while 38 per cent say that about Harris. About 1 in 10 trust neither Harris nor Trump to better handle the economy, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. Riding a resurgence of enthusiasm since the Democrats’ campaign reboot, Harris has embarked on a battleground state blitz in recent weeks that has broadened the number of races viewed as competitive by strategists. In North Carolina, Democrats are navigating renewed energy with caution in an economically dynamic state that hasn’t been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since Barack Obama in 2008. Gov. Roy Cooper told Friday’s crowd, “I have that 2008 feeling.” “That’s the last time we voted for a Democratic nominee for president, Barack Obama,” Cooper said. North Carolina State University political science professor Steven Greene said that the state “went from a situation where Joe Biden was almost surely going down in defeat here, whereas Kamala Harris has a very real chance of winning,” Deborah Holder, a 68-year-old Raleigh resident who runs six McDonalds restaurants, said of the vice president, “Her culture is something that is going to be a huge strength for her, because she’ll be able to look at the rest of us not just as her constituents, but as people that she has dealt with in all walks of life,” Harris is trying to strike a balance in defining her own image and economic agenda while still giving credit for the Biden administration’s track record. Her speech in North Carolina came a day after the president was asked if Harris might distance herself from his economic record and responded, “She’s not going to.” In their first joint speaking event since Biden dropped out, he and Harris were in Maryland on Thursday where they showcased successful negotiations to lower prices for Medicare recipients on 10 prescription drugs. But Harris spent far more time talking about Trump than Biden in North Carolina, promising “to build an America where everyone’s work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy.” “And where everyone has the opportunity,” she said “not just to get by, but to get ahead.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris unveiled a comprehensive set of economic measures on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris suggests reducing food and housing expenses to push back against Trump&#8217;s criticisms first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/harris-suggests-reducing-food-and-housing-expenses-to-push-back-against-trumps-criticisms/","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/RVKnTlI_FAtffpeX5AjIxu5CVE8=/0x97:5325x3092/500x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F9a524b57-d1b3-47ea-b676-5decae415f17","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:39:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":254292600,"title":"Letters: Vibrant Fremont | Harris-Trump debate | Voters’ check | Not alike | Bringing light | Christian nation | ‘Pro-democracy’?","text":"As mayor, Bacon will deliver a vibrant Fremont The city of Fremont, despite its recent exponential growth, has yet to establish its own character.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are scheduled to debate each other on Sept. 10.

Karen Lee Cohen Walnut Creek Voters offer a check on U.S. senators Re: “Biden’s court talk is election-year politicking” (Page A6, Aug. 13). In his Letter to the Editor, Daniel Mauthe points out that Joe Biden served 36 years in the Senate while Biden has proposed Supreme Court justices only serve 18 years. Daniel then asks “Rules for thee, but not for me?” Well, yes, there are different rules for each. Per the U.S. Constitution, a senator is elected by voters every six years, while a Supreme Court justice serves for life (or until they retire). Having a choice for your senator every six years gives us a chance to vote out incompetent, corrupt or just plain crazy people. The rules for the Supreme Court do not allow this to happen. So “Rules for thee, but not for me” … true. If one would like the same rules to apply, perhaps the Supreme Court justices should be elected every six years — not that I agree with that. Bob Wheeler Walnut Creek Justices serve for life, unlike senators Re: “Biden’s court talk is election-year politicking” (Page A6, Aug. 13). Mr. Mauthe missed the point of Joe Biden suggesting term limits for the members of the Supreme Court. Once selected and confirmed they are there for life. They never face an election or even a performance review again. During Biden’s more than 50 years in politics, mostly in the U.S. Senate, he has had to be reelected every six years. There are limits imposed to his length in office as president and the voters are able to review his performance before reelecting or rejecting him. Not so with the Supreme Court. Regardless of their performance, they are there until they retire. Ruth Miller Alamo Team could bring light to Washington Re: “Harris taps Walz” (Page A1, Aug. 7). The pernicious effect of “MAGA” has become clear: Instead of becoming Great Again, the relentless drumbeat is on how bad we are: Elections are being stolen, the entire U.S. government is corrupt, and good people are being persecuted. Eventually, we will begin to feel guilty about being Americans. What we need now is a sunny-side team that is proud of being American. George Doddington Walnut Creek U.S. as a Christian nation is a bad idea There is a political move these days to declare the United States a Christian nation and to bring Christian religion into our public schools. I think these are bad ideas. Why? Though I grew up in the Methodist Church and the Methodist Youth Fellowship was very formative for me, and though my parents, rest their souls, were pillars of that church, and though many of the nation’s founders were Christians (whose sects violently disagreed), declaring the United States a Christian nation goes against our nation’s proud emphasis on freedom and denies the diversity of its current citizens. And to little purpose, there being agreement among most faiths on the important morals, generally derivable from the golden rule. Schools, churches, synagogues, mosques, etc., are great for providing support, fellowship, the comfort of community and the development of moral living, but the practice of a particular faith should be left to churches. Wallace Clark Concord ‘Pro-democracy’ crew silent on ousting Biden Irrespective of his performance as commander in chief, the decision to replace Biden was made solely by a few people, not unlike dictatorships we see around the world, and certainly not per the Constitution nor a representative democracy.

As we teeter on the edge of this real possibility, we need to face the reality that the US military has lost its edge as the world’s most powerful under the Biden administration. And it would only get worse under a Harris presidency. This month, Kamala Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, a man who’s repeatedly fudged details of his own military career and who infamously slow-rolled activation of the National Guard as his state went up in flames following George Floyd’s death. With Walz joining Harris on the ticket, a Democrat victory would prove disastrous for the military. As tensions flare across the world, we need a commander in chief who’ll protect our nation through strength and allow our military to prioritize operational readiness over the leftist social agenda the Biden administration has ushered into the ranks. Though we were promised “DEI will make us stronger,” the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. A Harris-Walz administration would continue to decimate the Defense Department at one of the most precarious moments in our nation’s history. Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, conflict and outright hot wars have flared throughout the world. Russia’s war in Ukraine has killed over 80,000 Ukrainians and cost the US more than $175 billion. Israel is fighting Hamas — and Iran. China torments Taiwan and others in its neighborhood. Under the Trump administration, Vladimir Putin was restrained. He also bested President Biden and Harris in an unprecedented prisoner exchange this month, trading Russian murders and spies for the release of innocent Americans. The Biden-Harris administration even reportedly allowed $3.8 billion worth of US currency to funnel into Taliban-led Afghanistan since December 2021, months after Biden’s catastrophic withdrawal. That disorganized and deadly retreat was, indeed, one of the most embarrassing moments in American military history. Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel is also a significant US military failure. It’s the job of the president to ensure his military and counterintelligence agencies detect and defend against such attacks, including those against allies, particularly when US citizens are at risk — as they were. The US military had other priorities. During the lead-up to the attack, it was instead focused on DEI and liberal politics. In early 2022, the Biden-Harris Pentagon bragged that US service members had spent nearly 6 million man-hours on “stand-down” days and DEI training since Biden took office a year prior. Expect more of the same under Harris, who has triumphantly stated that she believes in equity of outcome as opposed to equality of opportunity and meritocracy, essential bedrocks of our military. America’s armed forces now face a recruiting crisis because the administration has abandoned the military dominance our nation could once claim. Today, our military looks more like a grand experiment in wokeism than a fearsome fighting force. Compare that to Trump, who commanded a military that neutralized terrorists, added an entirely new branch of service, inspired fear among enemies and gave soldiers a long overdue pay raise. Think about it: President Biden has declared global warming the biggest threat to our nation — not China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, terrorists or even the prospect of nuclear war. Harris regularly touts the Green New Deal as the solution to our nation’s troubles. Her administration insists the military be carbon-neutral by 2050 — in line with Walz’s record as governor of Minnesota, where he signed a law that mandated 100% fossil-free electricity by 2040. Don’t be surprised to see Team Harris-Walz reduce flight-training missions, keep ships in ports and convert our fleet military vehicles to all electric, all in the name of climate activism — and at the expense of military readiness and fighting prowess. Harris and Walz’s records on LGBTQIA+ issues similarly align with the military’s current obsession with them. Under Biden, the military organized drag-queen story hours on military bases and hired drag queens as recruiting ambassadors — all while eliminating tests of skill — to appease far-left activists. The cost to our safety is yet undetermined, but as Marine Gen. George Smith Jr. has said, “Our future enemies will be the arbiters of such decisions.” The president is more than the commander in chief, but without a strong military leader to ward off the real and growing threat of WWIII, the rest of it may not matter much at all.

Tim Walz is getting national attention. So is Minnesota.","text":"It’s not just Gov. Tim Walz getting attention due to his rising profile in national politics. So is Minnesota — and Minnesotans, including Rachel Malone. “Just got back from the Olympics and on my 10-hour flight, had a man from (the) UK asking all sorts of things,” Malone emailed the Pioneer Press in response to a query. “Like what’s our best food, best cycle ride, (what our) education system (is) like, etc., etc., because of Walz.” 11 days It was less than a month ago — on July 21 — when Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race for the White House. On that same day, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate. Sixteen days later, Walz bounded onto the stage of a rally in Philadelphia as Harris announced she had picked the governor of Minnesota as her running mate. In the 11 days since, the national media has shown images of our governor enjoying life in Minnesota, from holding a piglet at the Minnesota State Fair to relishing a fall day at the dog park to walking in a field during a pheasant hunt. Politics aside, these images have sparked curiosity about our section of “flyover country.” This includes clicking on Explore Minnesota, Minnesota’s tourism-related site that directs people to everything from fall colors to festivals and more. “With this recent news, Minnesota has certainly been on the top of people’s minds,” wrote Chris Morgan, communications and media relations manager at Explore Minnesota in an email to the Pioneer Press. “There is more curiosity about what Minnesota has to offer. As people do their research and explore the attractions and destinations available they are expressing a pleasant surprise. “For us here at Explore Minnesota, it’s great to see the state get more exposure as people begin to realize all of the things we have been showcasing,” Morgan wrote. “In general, Minnesota destinations have been gaining more national attention and recognition recently. This has become another positive catalyst for continued interest in Minnesota.” Maybe even … moving here? “Since August 6, when Tim Walz was announced as VP, we’ve seen a 91% increase in organic sessions to our website’s ‘Move to Minnesota‘ page,” Morgan said. The good life It’s not the first time a governor has spotlighted life here amidst the 10,000 lakes. In 1973, then Gov. Wendell Anderson made the cover of Time magazine, dressed in a plaid shirt, smiling while holding up a northern pike, a lake in the background. The headline read, “The Good Life in Minnesota.” Inside, the story reported on Anderson’s progressive policies, describing Minnesota as “a state that works.” Fast forward more than 50 years, and our “good life” and “progressive policies” have been keywords in this governor’s national headlines, along with more controversial ones, of course, such as the handling of the chaotic aftermath of George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police officers and the food fraud cases involving defendants charged — and some now convicted — with stealing millions of dollars of pandemic aid meant to be used to feed children. Social media On social media, Minnesota-related sites and pages have been fielding comments from people who are reportedly nowhere near any of our 10,000 lakes. “Tennessean here,” someone posted on the r/TimWalz community on Reddit. “I’ve been watching Minnesota for the last couple of years and I’d wish so much that Walz was my governor.” “Native Texan here,” another person wrote on r/minnesota, “seeing Tim Walz as the VP Candidate Brings back warm memories of spending time in your lovely state.” “West Coast liberal here: don’t hate me- are there any vegetarian hot dishes?” someone queried a Facebook group called “Wholesome Tim Walz Memes.” (The response: Just use lentils, or simply use “fake chicken” or omit the chicken, bacon or other meats from the recipe.) Are they making fun of us? Do people want to move to Minnesota, stop by for a visit — or do they just want to make fun of us? Ope. Barb Danger of Eden Prairie is not pleased with Stephen Colbert’s take on Minnesota right now. “I like Stephen Colbert,” Danger told the Pioneer Press, “but the other night he did a bit with two supposed ‘Minnesotans,’ portraying them as stupid hicks. It was such a nasty portrayal of this progressive state that I still plan to write to the show. They spoke like the characters in the original movie ‘Fargo.’ We don’t need that kind of attention.” Was it really so bad, though? This Fargo native with an accent checked out the clip on YouTube. “Walz’s superpower is his wholesome Minnesota charm,” Colbert said during the segment. “But, what do Minnesotans really know about Minnesota? For instance, all I happen to know is that it appears to be Iowa’s chef hat.” (Hey, look at a map, he’s right.) During the segment, Colbert played a clip of Walz at an out-of-state rally, wondering if people had to google “Minnesota” the week he was picked by Harris (“It’s true,” Colbert said). Colbert then brought on two of his writers, Gabe Gronli and Ariel Dumas, who apparently have Minnesota roots. They came bearing big smiles — and bars and tuna noodle hotdish. You betcha, sounds accurate. With their obviously exaggerated, campy accents, they talked about our most famous Paul Bunyan statues. “It has two giant Paul Bunyuans?” Colbert asked of Minnesota. “Oh, that’s just two of the top five,” Dumas said. “Sounds fun, guys,” Colbert quipped. It is! So is reading the comments on the YouTube clip (there are currently more than 1,000 at youtube.com/watch?v=ls_gDmKtEiY), including this one that sums up pretty darn well: ” …so…. Minnesota is one of those few demographics where we ACTUALLY DO know each other,” a commenter wrote. “I went (to) K-12 with Ariel Dumas – her family has the BEST apple Orchard !!!!” A connection on a plane Just like Walz, many Minnesotans are easy to talk to, and perhaps that’s why the stranger from the United Kingdom had a nice conversation with Malone on their flight over the pond recently. Malone, 36, of Currie, Minn.

Half (50 percent) of likely U.S. voters expect most reporters to help Harris ahead of the November presidential election, while 14 percent say they will help Trump. Roughly a quarter (26 percent) believe most reporters will offer unbiased coverage, and 10 percent say they are unsure, the survey found. “Looking ahead at the campaign, 66 percent of Republicans, 34 percent of Democrats, and 50 percent of unaffiliated voters expect most reporters to try to help Harris,” according to the poll report. “Thirty-eight percent (38 percent) of Democrats say most reporters will offer unbiased coverage instead, but only 14 percent of Republicans and 26 percent of unaffiliated voters agree.” The survey found that 60 percent of respondents believe most reporters try to help their preferred candidate when covering political campaigns, up from 51 percent during the 2020 election cycle. Nearly three in ten (28 percent) disagree and say most reporters are unbiased, and 12 percent are unsure. Democrats (44 percent) are more likely than Republicans (16 percent) and unaffiliated voters (23 percent) to say reporters try to offer unbiased campaign coverage. In contrast, 74 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of unaffiliated voters, and 45 percent of Democrats think reporters shill for the candidate they want to win, the survey found. Nearly six in ten (57 percent) say Harris has received the best treatment from the media so far, while 29 percent say the media have favored Trump. Thirteen percent are undecided. “Majorities of every political category – 65 percent of Republicans, 53 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of unaffiliated voters – say Harris has received the best treatment from the media so far,” the poll report reads. President Joe Biden’s strongest supporters are more likely to think the media are unbiased. More than half (55 percent) of voters who “strongly approve” of Biden’s job performance think most reporters try to give unbiased campaign coverage. Only seven percent of voters who “strongly disapprove” of Biden feel the same way. The survey was conducted with 1,158 likely U.S. voters between August 12-14, 2024. The margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points with a 95 percent level of confidence.","summary":"A majority of voters think news reporters are trying to help far-left Kamala Harris into the White House over former President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe post Poll: Majority of Voters Say Media Are Shilling for Kamala Harris appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/08/16/poll-majority-of-voters-say-media-are-shilling-for-kamala-harris/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/53893654938_2580f3bff7_o-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:14:03","author":"Katherine Hamilton","authors":["Katherine Hamilton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":254292182,"title":"Tim Walz Joins TikTok With a Signature Dad Joke","text":"Tim Walz is following Vice President Kamala Harris‘ lead and joining TikTok. On Friday, Harris’ running mate launched his own account on the platform — and got his started with one of his silly dad jokes. “Hey everybody, Tim here with Scout at the dog park along the Mississippi doing our first entry into TikTok,” he said, before joking: “Or as he and I say: TimTok.” Walz then looks down at his dog and says “Right, Scout?” while chuckling. Within a few hours, his account garnered a quarter million followers. Walz went viral earlier on Friday for a video of him and Harris conversing about how he eats “white guy tacos” as Harris poked fun at her vice presidential pick for not using seasoning. Hannah Flom, Walz’s digital director, told Variety on Friday that the platform will be used to showcase Walz’s “authenticity” as they connect with Gen Z voters. “Our campaign is focused on one thing: bringing the stakes of this election directly to the voters who will decide it,” Flom told the outlet. “Getting the Governor up on TikTok ensures that the incredible number of voters on the platform get to see exactly who he is — a teacher, a coach, a veteran, a father and a leader who is, along with VP Harris, doing the hard work to make Americans’ lives better.” Harris officially joined TikTok in late July as she went viral for coconut tree memes and Brat-inspired fan edits. The Vice President has already garnered more than 4.5 million followers on the platform since then. “Our job as a campaign is to break through the noise and make sure we’re talking to voters wherever they are — TikTok is one of those landscapes, and we’re leaving no stone unturned,” deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said at the time. “Getting the vice president up on TikTok means she’ll be able to directly engage with a key constituency in a way that’s true and authentic to the platform and the audience.”","summary":"Joining the platform \"ensures that the incredible number of voters on the platform get to see exactly who he is – a teacher, a coach, a veteran, a father,\" said Walz's digital director","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/tim-walz-joins-tiktok-dad-joke-1235082210/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165604133-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:13:16","author":"Tomás Mier","authors":["Tomás Mier"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.331},{"id":254292712,"title":"Powerful United Auto Workers union pledges $1.5M to help Kamala Harris, taking aim at Donald Trump","text":"ANN ARBOR, Mich. — The United Auto Workers leadership is aggressively backing the Democratic presidential nominee, with the union announcing the launch of a digital and field campaign to take on Donald Trump this November and promising an “all-out effort to elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.” UAW is also pledging $1.5 million to the Democratic National Committee, the Detroit News reports — and that’s on top of a labor lawsuit it’s filed against the ex-prez for comments he made in a viral X Spaces interview with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The charges relate to a short exchange in which Trump told Musk, “I look at what you do. You walk in and say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike. I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s OK. You’re all gone.’” Musk’s response was a simple “Yeah,” but that was enough for the union to file federal labor charges against the pair. “Employers need to be held accountable in this country when they break the law,” UAW President Shawn Fain told CBS. “It is a federal right of workers to go on strike. They cannot be fired for that.” Fain carries considerable political clout in the Wolverine State, which is home to 134,000 UAW members and 300,000 auto workers — and he’s more outspoken than ever in his opposition to Trump. It’s difficult to discern how individual UAW members will vote in November, but both Trump and Harris are courting this politically divided demographic in Michigan, a must-win midwestern state. One UAW member told CNN in June he estimates about 40% of the union’s members support Trump. Still, the powerhouse auto union’s top brass has stood fiercely opposed to Trump and his candidacy, drawing the ire of the former president, who has called for the Fain to be canned. ​​”The leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately, and every single auto worker, union and non-union, should be voting for Donald Trump,” Trump told the Republican National Committee audience last month. Trump and the GOP have sought to win over union members this election cycle and scored a major point in their column with the appearance of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien at the RNC. Last month, in a good sign for Trump and his party, O’Brien implied his union could work with Republicans.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., issued a note to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Friday concerning information on the Chinese groups and persons who engaged with Walz on these trips. Along with that, pertinent documents and comms between the democratic candidate’s office, along with any FBI ties, have been requested. According to The Hill, it is unknown whether the FBI had any communication with Walz over these matters. The outlet reported that Walz taught high school in China for one year back in 1989; later, as a high school teacher, along with his wife, Gwen, in Nebraska and Minnesota, the two held field trips to China. The New York Times further noted that Walz visited China over 30 times. National File has reported extensively on Walz’s engagements with China and the CCP, including his delegations through the globalist NGO Global Minnesota, which sponsored at least one of his trips. Comer’s letter asks the FBI if they provided any standard defensive briefs to Walz, whereby informing politicos if they are being targeted or influenced by the CCP. Comer also wishes to flag any of Walz’s contacts within the Chinese government, including any other entities. Walz criticized the Chinese government, although he met with Consul General Zhao Jian as early as March 2024, as indicated in the post below on X.

Republicans are twisting basic facts and desperately lying to distract from the Trump-Vance agenda: praising dictators, and sending American jobs to China. Vice President Harris and Governor Walz will ensure we win the competition with China, and will always stand up for our values and interests in the face of China’s threats. Tschann touted Walz as America First, adding he “has stood up to the CCP, fought for human rights and democracy, and always put American jobs and manufacturing first.” RELATED: KAMALA’s VP PICK TIM WALZ HAS A LONG RECORD OF VERY CLOSE TIES TO COMMUNIST PARTY IN CHINA The significant question here, noted by Rep.

So far, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have tip-toed around the politically fraught topic, with each promising not to cut benefits. That position is popular across the political spectrum but doesn’t address the program’s looming financial shortfall. Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill have recently introduced multiple bills that would fix part of the solvency issue by expanding the payroll tax to high earners. Congressional Republicans have criticized that plan while offering few specific alternatives. “Will [Republicans] go behind closed doors and have a package that has some cuts? Or will they do it out in the open and do what the Democrats want to do? I think that’s what’s really at stake,” said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a progressive advocacy group in favor of expanding the system. Here’s what each party has put forward on Social Security recently. What Democrats have called for Lift the payroll tax cap Democrats want to address the Social Security shortfall by extending the payroll tax to those with higher incomes. The Social Security 2100 Act, sponsored by Representative John Larson, D-Conn., would subject income above $400,000 to Social Security payroll taxes — the program’s main funding source. Today, the 6.2% tax only applies up to $168,600. The proposal mirrors the Biden-Harris administration’s plan, which called for extending solvency “by asking the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share.” A 2022 poll of registered voters suggests lifting the payroll cap to include higher wages would have broad support, with 79% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats in favor. Critics of the plan, like Brian Riedl at the conservative Manhattan Institute, point out that uncapping the payroll tax would still result in a deficit after just five years. He said the plan would “dramatically raise taxes not just on the rich but also the upper middle class.” Other Democratic-backed legislation introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., sets the income threshold lower, imposing the payroll tax on earnings above $250,000. As a senator, Harris co-sponsored that legislation. Boost in benefits and changes to the COLA formula Larson’s bill, which has the support of most House Democrats, would increase benefits by 2% across the board for all Social Security beneficiaries. It would also boost benefits specifically for lower-income seniors, as well as widows and widowers. If passed, the plan would tweak how the government calculates the annual cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) to ensure the formula accounts for the Consumer Price Index for Elderly Consumers (CPI-E). That index weighs health care costs more heavily, which could mean higher annual bumps for retirees. To pay for those changes, the legislation would extend the payroll tax to include incomes above $400,000 and add an additional 12.4% net investment income tax (NIIT) for taxpayers making over $400,000. Eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security Earlier this year, Representative Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced a bill to eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors. Today, individuals who earn above $25,000 pay income tax on up to 50% of their Social Security retirement benefits. For seniors who earn above $34,000, an additional 35% of benefits are taxable. Nine states also collect taxes on Social Security. Like other proposals, the legislation addresses revenue concerns by extending the payroll tax, in this case to incomes above $250,000. So far, none of the bills have gained much traction in Congress. What Republicans have called for Republicans have been less upfront about their vision for Social Security but insist they won’t cut benefits for seniors. On the campaign trail, Trump has vowed not to slash benefits or raise the retirement age. The official Republican Party Platform adopted at the Republican National Convention echoed those promises. Trump has also called for an end to federal taxes on Social Security benefits but hasn’t explained how he would address the subsequent revenue shortfall. “There’s some ideas floating out there, but not something actually being introduced into Congress,” Richard Johnson, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said of the GOP’s approach to Social Security. For now, the most comprehensive GOP plan comes from the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) 2025 budget proposal. The RSC, which comprises nearly 80% of all House Republicans, proposed raising the retirement age for those not near retirement “to account for increases in life expectancy.” The plan would also “limit and phase out auxiliary benefits for high income earners” who are not near retirement. In the proposal, Republican lawmakers blasted the “reckless spending policies” of President Biden and Congressional Democrats, arguing that their political opponents would accelerate Social Security benefits cuts for seniors. The GOP lawmakers said the Democrats’ payroll tax plan would eliminate job opportunities in the U.S. and “fail to make Social Security solvent.” Instead, the RSC said its budget would address concerns by increasing payroll tax revenues through “pro-growth tax reform” and “pro-growth energy policy that lifts wages” as well as “regulatory reforms that increase economic growth.” “We will not now or ever support cutting or delaying retirement benefits for any senior in or near retirement,” the RSC said. The RSC called on President Biden to “stop the political gamesmanship” and asked him to start “engaging with Republicans on sensible reforms.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n( ) — Social Security recipients will see their benefits cut in roughly&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: What is the Democrats&#8217; and Republicans&#8217; stance on Social Security? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/what-is-the-democrats-and-republicans-stance-on-social-security/","image":"https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66a71520716965.89471794.jpeg?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:05:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":254291900,"title":"RFK Jr. Refutes Report That He Approached Harris for a Cabinet Position","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. refuted a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said he would drop out of the race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in exchange for a cabinet position if she wins in November. During an Aug. 15 Latino Town Hall on TikTok, he told the moderators that the story is “fake news.” “I didn’t ask for a cabinet position,” Kennedy said. “I want to meet with all candidates about dampening down the rhetoric and unifying our country.” Kennedy said candidates, including former President Donald Trump and Libertarian presidential nominee Chase Oliver, have met with him. “Kamala Harris said she doesn’t want to [meet],” he said. Kennedy has repeatedly said at campaign stops and in interviews with media outlets and on podcasts that he would always welcome conversations with opposing candidates, media outlets, and podcasters who do not share his views. He told The Epoch Times that many Democrats and Republicans acknowledge the division in America but then get mad “if you meet with Trump or Kamala Harris.” He said he is “willing to take the heat by working to build a bridge between both sides.” Kennedy, who is attempting to get on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, met with Trump last month in Milwaukee during the Republican National Convention. The Washington Post reported that Kennedy discussed dropping out of the race to back the former president and join his administration if he returns to the White House. The purpose of meeting with President Trump was to talk about the chronic disease epidemic and children’s health, Kennedy said. He denied that he would end his presidential bid and support the former president. Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed concern that Kennedy could take away votes from their respective presidential candidates. Earlier this year, the DNC hired Lis Smith, a veteran Democrat strategist who managed Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, to spearhead an aggressive communication plan to combat Kennedy, independent Cornel West, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. In recent months, the DNC and Clear Choice, a super PAC aligned with Biden to counter third-party presidential candidates, have objected to Kennedy’s appearance on the ballot, making legal filings in multiple states. Last week, a New York State Supreme Court judge ruled that Kennedy falsely listed that he was a New York resident on his nominating petitions. As a result, he was removed from the state’s general election ballot, a decision Kennedy has appealed. The DNC has called Kennedy a “stalking horse” to “prop up” Trump. Kennedy, meanwhile, has accused the DNC of trying to win the election in courtrooms and keep voters from having another choice. Regarding the report that Kennedy sought a meeting with Harris, Matt Corridoni, a DNC spokesman.said, “No one has any intention of negotiating with a MAGA-funded fringe candidate who has sought out a job with Donald Trump in exchange for an endorsement.” David Carlucci, a former Democratic New York state senator who is now a Democratic strategist, told The Epoch Times that Kennedy’s attempt to reach out to Harris “speaks to the issue that many voters already know: Kamala Harris will be elected as our next president.” Kennedy’s actions during his campaign have “repeatedly shown that his judgment is not suitable for the presidency or any other leadership role in government,” he said. Stefanie Spear, Kennedy’s press secretary, told The Epoch Times in a statement that “Mr. Kennedy is willing to meet with leaders of both parties to discuss the possibility of a unity government” and has done so since he entered the presidential race.","summary":"The independent candidate, however, says he would always welcome conversations with opposing candidates.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/rfk-jr-refutes-report-that-he-approached-harris-for-a-cabinet-position-5707256","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/07/id5701326-RFK-JR-5_JF_06122024-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:03:35","author":"Jeff Louderback","authors":["Jeff Louderback"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":254291718,"title":"Mark Cuban Posts Flurry of Responses to Kamala Harris Economic Plan","text":"Billionaire and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban promoted Vice President Kamala Harris' economic policies in a flurry of social media posts Friday afternoon.Harris introduced several proposals aimed at bringing down the cost of groceries, the housing market and other essential goods during a rally in North Carolina on Friday. The Democratic nominee's plan includes tax cuts, a federal ban on price gouging by food producers and offering down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers who qualify. As the Associated Press (AP) reported, the policies are largely built off the Biden administration's priorities.\"As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food,\" Harris told supporters Friday. \"We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed. But our supply chains have improved and prices are still too high.\"Cuban, a frequent critic of former President Donald Trump, shared his two cents on Harris' proposals to X, formerly Twitter, including addressing criticism that the vice president has received for promising to go after price gouging as a way to tackle inflation. Trump has called the plans similar to \"Maduro-esque price controls,\" comparing the plan to the Venezuelan leader's policies that crippled the country's economy.Bloomberg columnist Matthew Yglesias wrote to X on Friday, \"I'm pretty sure Harris did not in fact propose price controls on groceries—just kind of vaguely said that antitrust enforcement is good (it is good).\"Cuban responded to Yglesias' post, \"This is a fact.\"\"Did you also notice that she said that the 25k credit only applies to NEW homes? Did I hear that right?\" he wrote in a separate response to Yglesias.Cuban posted another statement a few minutes later praising Harris' plans to bring down health care and drug costs, writing, \"And my favorite of course, did anyone else hear @VP say she was going to bring TRANSPARENCY to pharmacy and healthcare middlemen? The root cause of almost all that is wrong with healthcare pricing?\"According to AP's report, Harris' price gouging attacks include instructing the Federal Trade Commission to penalize any \"big corporations\" that engage in price spikes. But economists previously told Newsweek that the plan could backfire, and likely does not address the root problems of inflation.\"The idea of a political solution to an economic non-problem is flawed,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., during an interview with Newsweek. \"There's very little evidence that corporate greed or price gouging is responsible for high grocery or housing prices.\"\"Preventing price increases sounds good, but what do investors and farmers do when they can't guarantee a return on investment or cover their costs?\" Lincicome added. \"They cut back on investment, leading to reduced supply and even higher prices or outright shortages.\"Harris also attacked Trump's economic proposals during her rally on Friday, including critiquing the GOP candidate's calls for increased tariffs on imports.The vice president said that Trump \"wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries.\"\"It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs,\" Harris added, per AP's report. \"A Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication.\"Cuban also praised Harris as a \"pro-business candidate\" during his string of posts to X.Newsweek reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment on Friday evening.","summary":"Harris unveiled several policy proposals at a North Carolina rally on Friday that aim to bring down the cost of essential goods.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mark-cuban-posts-flurry-responses-kamala-harris-economic-plan-1940604","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2451998/cuban-posts-flurry-responses-harriseconomicplan.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:59:48","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.636},{"id":254291660,"title":"Harris still needs to address the major question: Politics Desk Update","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill. In today’s edition, “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker looks at the big question Vice President Kamala Harris will seek to answer at the Democratic National Convention next week. Plus, national politics reporter Bridget Bowman explores how the race for control of the House has changed with Harris at the top of the ticket. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. The big question Harris still hasn’t answered: What’s her vision for the country? By Kristen Welker Kamala Harris ran for president in 2020. She’s the current vice president of the United States. And she’s set to accept the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination next week. And yet, there are still major questions about her vision for the future of the country. What is her goal beyond defeating Donald Trump? That is a part of the backdrop as Harris prepares for her address at the Democratic National Convention, which is now just days away. Among the questions voters may want her to answer when they hear from her next Thursday: Would her presidency be a continuation of President Joe Biden’s policies and programs? Where does she disagree with Biden?Where do her allegiances lie in the Democrats’ progressive-vs.-establishment fight?What would be her top priority if Democrats win full control of Congress?Where would she compromise with Republicans?How would she wield power?And how does she handle defeat and victory? (Unlike past modern presidential nominees, she’s never won a presidential primary or caucus.) Nearly four weeks into her ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket, we don’t have an answer to any of those questions. Yes, she’s outlined her position on the Israel-Hamas war (she’s committed to Israel’s right to exist and defend itself, but will speak up about Palestinian suffering). Yes, she’d sign that bipartisan border deal into law. And, yes, she announced economic proposals during a speech in North Carolina today like a federal ban on corporate price-gouging in the food and grocery industries and a $6,000 child tax credit. But on those big questions — that “vision thing” that former President George H.W. Bush talked about — we still don’t have an answer. There’s nothing equivalent yet from Harris like Barack Obama’s “hope” and “change,” or Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again.” What’s Harris’ bumper-sticker-sized vision for the country? (The campaign did debut “A New Way Forward” message on Friday.) That’s her challenge heading into next week and what will be the biggest speech of her political career so far. NBC News’ Sahil Kapur has more from Harris’ speech today, where she outlined her plans to tackle food, housing, medicine and child care costs. ‘A roller coaster’: Harris’ sudden rise resets a tight battle for the House By Bridget Bowman Harris’ ascension to the top of the ticket has reset the battle for the House, with Democrats feeling hopeful they can ride a new wave of energy to the majority and Republicans tempering their dreams of dramatically expanding the playing field. Biden’s exit from the presidential race, both parties are bracing for an even tougher fight centered on a small group of competitive districts, as Democrats need to net just four seats to take control of the House. The president had been struggling in key battlegrounds even before his disastrous June debate performance, and he recently acknowledged to CBS News that his potential down-ballot drag contributed to his decision to drop out. That drag had given some House Republicans confidence that they would not only hang on to their narrow majority, but push deeper into Democratic territory this fall. Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said at a Politico event at the Republican National Convention last month that the party was eyeing districts Biden won by double digits in 2020, noting, “I think we can expand the map.” Now, Hudson told NBC News in an interview this week, “I do think we’re in a different reality where the environment has tightened some,” acknowledging internal polling has shown the Democratic base consolidating around Harris. Hudson, who described this election cycle as “a roller coaster,” was still confident that Republicans will keep their majority and pick up seats. He argued that voters will pin concerns about the cost of living and immigration on the Biden administration, and that Harris’ past liberal positions will turn off swing voters. Among Democrats, however, there is palpable optimism among candidates and strategists about winning back House control. It’s a marked shift from just a few weeks ago, when vulnerable party lawmakers were dodging reporters at the Capitol to avoid questions about Biden. When Biden was in the race, Democrats still saw a path to the majority, noting that their candidates often performed better than him in the polls. But now, there is less pressure to outrun the top of the ticket with a more popular presidential nominee. “We were in a strong position,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Suzan DelBene of Washington told NBC News this week. “We’re in a stronger position now.” That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

Harris said at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina: There’s a serious housing shortage in many places. It’s too difficult to build and it’s driving prices up. As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing. We need both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape including at the state and local levels. And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class. Harris did not explain how those new homes were to be built in a high-interest-rate environment. She also did not explain whether she meant 3 million units in addition to those that would already have been built, or three million units total. Nearly 1.5 million homes were built in the U.S. in 2023, so 3 million over four years would actually mean construction had slowed down by 50%. Presumably, she meant 3 million additional homes — 750,000 extra per year. That would match or exceed the pace of the peak housing boom of the post-World War II period. But Harris has a track record against which to measure her promise, and it is the failure of the Biden-Harris administration to build the electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that it promised to build under the infrastructure bill of 2021. at a cost of $7.5 billion. The goal was 500,000; two-and-a-half years later, as of May 2024, only eight EV stations had been built. The situation is even worse when it comes to the Biden-Harris administration’s promise to build new broadband Internet connections. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr told Breitbart News earlier this week that despite $42.5 billion in the infrastructure bill for broadband, the effort had yet to connect one American to the Internet — and Vice President Harris was supposed to be in charge of the project. The prospects of Harris’s housing boom look doubtful. Joel B.

Similar increases were seen around the world.Inflation, however, has recently been decreasing. The U.S. Labor Department announced on Wednesday that the year-over-year rate stood at 2.9 percent in July, the lowest since March 2021.While Furman and other economists who previously spoke to Newsweek argued that the Harris price gouging plan has major flaws, opinions on the matter are not unified, with some instead offering praise.University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor Isabella Weber told The New York Times that companies were following competitors by raising prices during the pandemic, which in some cases allowed them to increase their profits.She warned that the practice may continue even without similar pandemic-era economic conditions.\"If the worst of times for ordinary people ends up being the best of times for corporations ... Some sort of basic social contract is kind of crumpling,\" Weber said, while praising Harris for the price gouging proposal.Other proposals in the Harris plan include $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, tax credits for developers who build affordable rental units and starter homes, expanded earned income tax credit, expanded child tax credits and stopping \"predatory\" investors from colluding to raise rent prices.Harris and former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, have expressed support for eliminating taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers, a proposal that economists and tax experts also expressed doubts about in previous comments to Newsweek.","summary":"Harris has vowed to enact the \"first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ex-obama-economic-adviser-casts-doubt-kamala-harris-plan-1940566","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2451982/kamala-harris-economy-price-gouging-plan-criticism.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:41:04","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"business","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":254294172,"title":"Three Things to Watch for at the DNC","text":"Before the DNC kicks off on Monday, let’s quickly recap the sheer eventfulness of the past few weeks for the Democratic Party. Less than one month ago, President Joe Biden announced that he was exiting the presidential race. Almost at once, Vice President Kamala Harris became the heir apparent to the party nomination. Just over two weeks later, she became the official nominee; the next day, she named Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. This timeline means that the typical flow of a first-time nominee’s presidential campaign has been scrambled. But after a summer full of surprises and switch-ups, Harris will take the expected step of a Democratic nominee: appearing at the Democratic National Convention. The convention, which has had varying degrees of significance in recent presidential races, could be of particular consequence this time around. Here are three key things to keep in mind as you follow the news next week. This convention will be light on procedurals, and will focus on refining the political message of a relatively new campaign. Major-party conventions usually serve some bureaucratic purposes: Delegates vote to confirm the party’s nominee, and candidates sometimes announce their running mate (as Donald Trump did during his party’s convention last month). All of this has already happened for the Democrats—Harris was nominated in a virtual roll call, an unusual process for the party, in early August, and she picked Walz soon after. Those following along at home aren’t paying much attention to the procedures, though—they’re watching for the speeches and political narratives. Conventions serve to unite a political party around a coherent story. The party strategizes about which guests, and what message, will both speak to undecided Americans and excite the base. Family members of the candidates will attempt to humanize them and help them appear relatable. The full lineup of speakers has not yet been released, but President Biden is expected to play a role. Rumors and speculation about which celebrities may appear have also been swirling. Harris will be looking to reintroduce herself to the American public. Despite her name recognition, many people lack a clear sense of who Harris is and what she stands for. As my colleague Elaina Plott Calabro, who has profiled Harris, wrote last month, “After years of struggling to find her political voice, Harris seems to have finally taken command of her own story.” Harris once seemed ambivalent, even apologetic, about her image as a prosecutor, but now she seems to be starting to own that part of her past, using it as a point of contrast with Trump’s status as a felon. Harris lacked the testing ground of a contested primary—she is the first nonincumbent to win a major-party nomination without a primary race since 1968—which means she didn’t have the opportunity to sharpen her messaging before the general election. As my colleague Ronald Brownstein wrote recently, her relatively undefined image “gives Harris a chance to benefit more than usual from the Democratic gathering in Chicago … if she can flesh out her story in an engaging way.” Conventions in recent cycles haven’t led to drastic movement in polls. But as Ronald notes, the convention has been a game changer on at least one occasion in the past: Bill Clinton’s 1992 convention speech helped turn around voters’ perceptions that he was elitist, in part by emphasizing his modest roots; he saw a remarkable 16-point post-DNC jump in the polls. Experts told Ronald that Harris is unlikely to see a poll bump of more than a few points, but, he wrote, “she might be able to reach the upper end of the convention bump still available in this polarized time.” Harris’s campaign is also hoping to reach more viewers than is average for a convention by streaming it on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. The convention could help clarify the role of policy conversations in this election. Harris’s campaign has been criticized for its lack of substantive policy discussion so far. This afternoon, she presented her most robust proposals yet: In a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, she laid out plans for combatting the high cost of living for Americans, which included tax cuts for new parents, a federal ban on price gouging, 3 million new housing units during her time in office, and $25,000 in downpayment support for first-time homeowners for the next four years. More details on her platform, economic and beyond, are expected at the convention and in the coming weeks. Given how far along we are in the race, voters may be more focused on the big picture and the themes of the campaign than on the kinds of details that may come up during a primary. In some ways, Harris’s shortened runway makes things easier for her: As my colleague David Graham wrote in a recent article about the unknowns around Harris and her politics, “If Democrats believe Harris can beat Trump, they may not care about much else, at least for now.” Related: Here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Today’s News Dispatches Explore all of our newsletters here.

The plans include eye-catching proposals such as a ban on grocery price gouging and a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers. Economists who spoke to ABC News offered up a mixed assessment of the newly released agenda. Some experts lauded the effort to slow rising costs and restrain corporate power in key sectors, while others criticized what they consider a misguided attempt to override market forces that risks worsening the nation's debt. Less than three months before the presidential election, the economy tops lists of voter concerns. Growth is slowing but remains solid. Price increases have cooled dramatically but remain higher than the Federal Reserve's target level. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Here's what to know about how economists assess three key pillars of Harris' economic plan: fighting inflation, recalibrating the housing market and cutting taxes for families. Fighting inflation The campaign aims to rein in price increases for everything from groceries to prescription drugs to homes. Harris points to the market power of large corporations as a key cause of rapid price increases for essential goods, saying companies use their outsized role in a given market to raise prices without fear of a competitor offering a comparable product at a more affordable price. Consumers, the Harris campaign says, are left with nowhere to turn. The grocery industry exemplifies the damage caused by mega corporations, according to the campaign. \"Extreme consolidation in the food industry has led to higher prices that account for a large part of higher grocery bills,\" the campaign said in a statement on Friday. Grocery store profit margins surged in 2021 and rose even higher two years later, even after price increases had begun to cool, a Federal Trade Commission study in March showed. To control the price hikes, Harris proposed a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. While details remain limited, the plan could resemble price-gouging bans in place in 37 states, which prohibit a sudden spike in prices for scarce goods. Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collective, in a statement on Friday echoed the Harris campaign's criticism of the broken market for groceries. \"Price gouging, price fixing, and just plain profiteering are rampant in the food and grocery sector,\" Owens said. \"There is still more the government can do to reduce food and grocery concentration and stop the cheating that is costing families dearly.\" Some economists, however, rejected the notion of corporate power as an important cause of inflation, saying a limit on price hikes could result in shortages of goods. \"Most of the inflation over the past few years has been caused by increases in costs,\" Steven Hamilton, a professor of economics at George Washington University, told ABC News. Hamilton acknowledged that price increases for some groceries may owe to corporate concentration, but said it doesn't stand as a primary cause of overall inflation. \"You have to be careful not to cherry pick,\" Hamilton said. Michael Jones, an economics professor at the University of Cincinnati, said a government-imposed ceiling on prices could cause stores to run out of goods in times of scarcity. \"If there's a restriction on the prices that companies can charge for products, they simply won't supply them,\" Jones told ABC News. Fixing the housing market In recent years, the housing market has suffered from a convergence of high mortgage rates and elevated home prices, shutting out prospective buyers with high costs. The Harris campaign proposed restoring affordability through a combination of boosting home supply and easing the price pressures for some homebuyers. Plans to grow the supply of homes include a tax incentive for companies that build starter homes and affordable rental homes, the Harris campaign said. The campaign's plans to aid buyers feature a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers. Economists who spoke to ABC News lauded the Harris campaign's effort to boost housing supply, but offered differing opinions about the support for homebuyers. \"The reason that housing prices have gone up in most places in America is that supply is limited,\" Hamilton, of George Washington University, told ABC News. \"That commitment to increase supply is rare among politicians but it's something that economists should praise. Some economists said the subsidies for homebuyers threaten to undermine the price cuts achieved through additional supply. If prospective buyers know they'll receive a subsidy of $25,000 from the government, they'll boost their asking price by that amount, said Jones, of the University of Cincinnati. As a result, he added, home prices will rise. \"If they have $25,000 more to spend on a house, they'll submit bids up to $25,000 higher for the home,\" Jones said. \"That policy in particular is a bad idea because it won't bring the price of housing down.\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the combination of supply growth and homebuyer support could work effectively as long as Harris focuses on boosting supply before she bolsters consumers. \"You've got to put the horse before the cart,\" Zandi said. \"It's a matter of timing.\" Cutting taxes for middle-class families The Harris campaign said it aims to keep some money in middle-class consumers' pockets by reducing their tax burden. The plans include a restoration of the expanded child tax credit of $3,600 per child that expired in 2022. Harris also proposed an additional, new $6,000 child tax credit for families with a child in the first year of life. The tax cuts for families drew wide support from economists who spoke to ABC News, though some emphasized the importance of accompanying those proposals with revenue-raising measures that will offset the tax reductions. \"A child tax credit expansion is fantastic and I would fully support it, as long as they find way to pay for it,\" said Hamilton, of George Washington University. \"This is a policy targeted toward people who really need it, and families who really need it.\" For its part, the Harris campaign said on Friday that it would safeguard the federal government's financial health, in part by increasing taxes on wealthy individuals as a means of offsetting middle-class tax cuts. Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president, will \"fulfill their commitment to fiscal responsibility, including by asking the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations to pay their fair share,\" the campaign said. Zandi, of Moody's Analytics, voiced support for the tax cut but also urged caution about the potential loss of tax revenue. If the tax credits end up adding to the national debt, it would undermine the savings for consumers by risking an increase in overall inflation. \"I don't think you can do anything without it being paid for,\" Zandi said. \"That would be counterproductive.\"","summary":"Proposals include a ban on grocery price gouging and subsidy for homebuyers.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/harris-unveils-economic-plans-inflation-housing-economists/story?id=112892305","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/cd12bedd-5483-4a5f-8ed2-e20232d6879e/biden-kamala-campaign-rt-lv-240815_1723759216675_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:30:11","author":"Max Zahn","authors":["Max Zahn"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":254290616,"title":"Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi to Guest on Stephen Colbert’s Live DNC Episodes","text":"Stephen Colbert has a star-studded list of guests slated for his live Late Show episodes tied to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week, with Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and Pete Buttigieg all slated to appear on Monday through Wednesday next week.

JD Vance (R-Ohio) is running on it. But one of Vance's U.S. Senate colleagues is calling him out for failing to actually get it enacted when he had the chance. According to Semafor reporter Joseph Zeballos-Roig, an \"arms race\" is now underway between the two candidates in regard to the child tax credit. During her economic speech in Raleigh, North Carolina on Friday, Harris proposed a $6,000 tax credit for parents of newborns, and making the enhanced child tax credit President Joe Biden approved during the Covid-19 pandemic permanent. That pandemic-era expansion raised the tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child, and included 17 year-olds in the covered group. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, that expanded child tax credit kept an estimated 500,000 children out of poverty across the country. Senate Republicans – with the help of Sen. Joe Manchin (I-West Virginia), who was a Democrat at the time — blocked a previous effort to prolong the higher child tax credit.

President Trump has been on the record for a long time supporting a bigger child tax credit, and I think you want it to apply to all American families.\" However, Ohio's junior U.S. senator was notably absent when he had the chance to transform his campaign proposal into concrete legislation, as he was campaigning for Trump on the southern border. In a Friday tweet, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) reminded his followers that \"JD Vance was a no-show on the vote for my bill to expand the child tax credit when it was on the senate floor two weeks ago.\" \"My bill failed after Republicans blocked it, leaving 16 million kids worse off,\" Wyden tweeted.

While the election is still nearly three months away, one op-ed suggests Republicans are taking Democrats' policies seriously when it comes to their own families. In an essay for Newsweek, Bethany Mandel — a former Heritage Foundation writer — wrote that as a mother of six children, she's noticed that Democrats are so far the better party for parents. She specifically cited the example of Vance skipping out on the vote to expand the child tax credit. \"Just last week, Senate Republicans blocked an effort to expand child tax credits, especially those targeted at low-income Americans. [JD] Vance, a United States Senator who could have voted for child tax credits now, skipped the vote, as did a half dozen other Republican senators,\" she wrote. \"I'm not one to give credit to the Democratic Party on anything, but credit where credit is due,\" she added. \"And it's going to hurt the Republican ticket, especially when it tries to paint itself as pro-family.\" READ MORE: 'Didn't care about us': Company JD Vance bankrolled known for 'nightmare' work environment","summary":"Former President Donald Trump is now proposing an expansion of the child tax credit as both he and Vice President Kamala Harris roll out their respective policy platforms, and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen.

They just disagreed, almost entirely, on when and how that power should be used. In Raleigh on Friday, Ms. Harris began to put her own stamp on the brand of progressive economics that has come to dominate Democratic politics over the last decade. That economic thinking embraces the idea that the federal government must act aggressively to foster competition and correct distortions in private markets. The approach seeks large tax increases on corporations and high earners, to fund assistance for low-income and middle-class workers who are struggling to build wealth for themselves and their children. At the same time, it provides big tax breaks to companies engaged in what Ms. Harris and other progressives see as delivering great economic benefit — like manufacturing technologies needed to fight global warming, or building affordable housing.","summary":"Both candidates embrace expansions of government power to steer economic outcomes — but in vastly different areas.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/business/economy/harris-trump-economy-inflation.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/us/16dc-harris-trump-econ-combo/16dc-harris-trump-econ-combo-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:13:17","author":"Jim Tankersley","authors":["Jim Tankersley"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":254290778,"title":"Harris takes a populist tone on the economy. Will it help with young voters?","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris struck a decidedly populist tone when she unveiled her economic policy in Raleigh, North Carolina on Friday. The vice president made housing the core part of her policy rollout, pledging to build three million new homes. As part of that, she has proposed a tax incentive to build starter homes. This comes as nearly 1 in 10 homes are now worth more than $1 million, which is a record high. Harris also proposed providing a $25,000 payment support to help people buy a home for the first time. “There’s a serious housing shortage in many places. It’s too difficult to build, and it’s driving prices up,” she said on Friday. “We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well. Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough.” The policy rollout comes just as Harris will head to Chicago for the Democratic National Convention. Much of the focus has been on whether she will face a revolt from younger voters because of her and President Joe Biden’s support for Israel amid its war with Hamas that has led to thousands of deaths in Gaza. Indeed, Harris has confronted protesters at some of her early rallies, to varying levels of success. But as Inside Washington has noted before, polling has shown that young voters tend to prioritize the economy, particularly the cost of living and housing, while not nearly as many consider the war in Gaza to be of similar salience. Indeed, when The Independent interviewed Black voters in Milwaukee during the Republican National Convention before Biden stepped aside, they cited inflation and “high as hell” rent as primary reasons for dissatisfaction with Democrats. Harris’s decision to make housing a core part of her first major economic policy rollout shows that she sees it as a winning issue in November. Lee Miringoff, the director for the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, told The Independent that Harris is trying to combine the new-found energy that her ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has given the party with policies focused around potential Democratic voters who may have wandered away because of a hypothetical rematch between Biden and Donald Trump. “So there's no doubt that young people have concerns about inflation and their ability to also become homeowners,” Miringoff said. “Harris is trying to take that on front and center to to show that it's not just that she's young, more energetic and new generation and all that, but that she's also got some policies that she would like to put forth.” Harris’s decision to deliver the speech in Raleigh is not an accident either. North Carolina has had an influx of residents moving in from states like California and New York, which have exorbitant housing prices. Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, said that the housing market has never fully recovered from either the 2008 housing crisis – which led to Harris suing big banks as California attorney general – and the boom in housing purchases during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when mortgage rates dropped before they went back up and made housing unaffordable. “So even though the Biden-Harris administration can point to a lot of successes in the economy, the housing market is the glaring problem,” she told The Independent. “And because it's, you know, the American dream to own a home, it's something that really does matter if you're going to claim success on the economy.” Republicans for their part have tried to talk about the cost of housing. But Republicans like Kari Lake, who is running for Senate in Arizona, have sought to blame illegal immigration for the rising costs. Trump for his part has offered few solutions on housing. While he has said his administration would “target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issue[s],” he has offered little in terms of specifics. On top of that, during a rally in Bozeman, Montana, he pledged “There will be no low income developments built in areas right next to your house.” During his nonsensical press conference on Thursday where he displayed boxes of Cheerios, bacon and coffee, he offered little in terms of specifics to counteract inflation. “Definitely some race and class connotations there,” Fairweather told The Independent about Trump’s rhetoric on housing. “It's definitely more of a fear mongering message than one of tackling the problem. So definitely different approaches.” At the same time, Fairweather said that there is a divide in how coastal voters think about housing affordability compared to swing state voters.","summary":"Polling shows young voters care about the cost of housing","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-economy-young-voters-b2597625.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/16/22/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Harris_77810.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zJgii2PR-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:10:55","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.014},{"id":254289916,"title":"JD Vance updates: Republican vice presidential nominee addresses the Milwaukee Police Association during campaign stop in Wisconsin","text":"MILWAUKEE (WLS) — Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance campaigned Friday in Milwaukee.

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7.

That didn’t stop both supporters and opponents of the Trump-Vance campaign from showing up to make their voices heard. “It is very important, especially for younger conservatives like myself, to get out here, all across the state, and chase ballots, get low propensity Republicans to turn out and show our presence, especially in a place like Milwaukee, where I think we have a very, very good chance to narrow the margin,” Nolan Jackett said.

The issue was fixed, and the plane took off soon after it returned to Milwaukee. Wisconsin is one of the key battleground states that both parties will be heavily courting over the next three months. And, in fact, Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, are scheduled to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday, as they make their way to Chicago for the Democratic National Convention. The president of the Milwaukee Police Association said the Trump campaign reached out to them about two weeks ago, saying they were looking forward to hearing their concerns, which, much like those of CPD, surround retention and recruitment issues, at a time when the city is still coming down from its COVID-era highs, as it relates to crime. “We want to know that we’re being supported, and, that obviously, back the blue, that people have our backs, because we are the ones that have the community’s back, you know,” Alexander Ayala said. “Know that police work, by its nature, is not always pretty, but it’s necessary, and people that hurt the most are the community when they don’t have enough police to answer those calls.” Milwaukee police will have a role to play during the DNC next week. The police association president said a contingent of around 100 of their officers will be heading down to Chicago to help out, as needed.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMILWAUKEE (WLS) &#8212; Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance campaigned Friday in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: JD Vance updates: Republican vice presidential nominee addresses the Milwaukee Police Association during campaign stop in Wisconsin first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/jd-vance-updates-republican-vice-presidential-nominee-addresses-the-milwaukee-police-association-during-campaign-stop-in-wisconsin/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-JD-Vance-news-Republican-VP-candidate-speaks.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:10:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":254293760,"title":"Harris Lays Out Her Economic Vision, Casting Trump’s as Backward-Looking","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris unspooled her economic agenda on Friday in her first major policy address, casting her vision as one for the future and former President Donald J.

Anyone who is a danger to society should be detained regardless of how wealthy they are,\" Singer said. During her public life as district attorney in San Francisco, California attorney general and U.S. senator, Harris' position on cash bail has varied. 'STUPID' ABOLISHMENT OF CASH BAIL MEANS ILLINOIS STREETS ARE 'NEVER GONNA BE SAFE' AGAIN: RESIDENTS In 2019, when she unsuccessfully ran for president, Harris made her position known a little more forcefully. \"End money bail. Our bail system is unjust and broken,\" Harris wrote in a post on Medium. \"450,000 Americans sit in jail today awaiting trial because they cannot afford to pay bail. Excessive cash bail disproportionately harms people from low-income communities and communities of color,\" she said. \"Black defendants are more likely to be detained before trial and less likely to be able to post bail compared with similarly-situated White defendants. And Black men pay higher bail than similarly-situated White defendants,\" she continued. ILLINOIS ENDING CASH BAIL A ‘BACKDOOR’ DEFUND MOVEMENT THAT WILL SPARK POLICE EXODUS: EXPERTS But in 2004, she said one of her top \"priorities\" during the first 100 days of serving as a DA would be to make bail more expensive, the Washington Free Beacon reported. \"On a daily basis, the work I have to do and where I have to put my mind in terms of my priorities is on things like sitting down with Russ [Guintini] my chief assistant and talking with him about the fact we are going to change the bail schedule in San Francisco,\" Harris said in an interview. \"We are in the process of asking the bench, the judiciary, to reevaluate the fact that we require people who have been arrested to pay a lot less than other counties.\" She also commented that individuals were coming to San Francisco \"to commit crimes because it's cheaper to do it.\" AFTER ONE YEAR, 'AMERICA'S MOST DANGEROUS LAW' IS DAMAGING POLICING PROFESSION IN ILLINOIS, SAYS LOCAL SHERIFF \"You know, we have to do something about that,\" she said. \"Those are things I'm spending my time on.\" Later in 2014, while she was attorney general, Harris' office argued against the release of nonviolent criminals because they wanted to keep them for cheap labor, the Washington Examiner reported. \"Extending 2-for-1 credits to all minimum custody inmates at this time would severely impact fire camp participation — a dangerous outcome while California is in the middle of a difficult fire season and severe drought,\" lawyers from Harris’ office wrote in a filing. Abolishing cash bail is generally considered a progressive approach to criminal justice. But as such reforms have been implemented in states like New York, data shows that bail elimination can lead to higher recidivism rates. The Data Collaborative for Justice concluded in February that \"the elimination of money bail increased recidivism for people charged with nonviolent felonies, with recent criminal history, and with a recent violent felony arrest, while it decreased recidivism for people charged with misdemeanors and people with no recent criminal history.\" Critics of Harris have said she has a pattern of flipping her positions on possibly controversial policies depending on what will favor her politically.

DNC employee David Strange filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday asking the commission to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot. The election commission's attorney, Angela O'Brien Sharpe, wrote to Strange on Friday saying she had dismissed the complaint because it names commissioners as respondents and they can't ethically decide a matter brought against them. Dismissing the complaint clears the way for a potential lawsuit seeking to keep Stein off the ballot. A spokesperson for the DNC had no immediate comment Friday. The Stein campaign didn't immediately respond to a message sent to their media email inbox. The bipartisan elections commission unanimously approved ballot access for Stein in February because the Green Party won more than 1% of the vote in a statewide race in 2022. Sheryl McFarland got nearly 1.6% of the vote while finishing last in a four-way race for secretary of state. Strange argued in his complaint that the Green Party can't nominate presidential electors in Wisconsin because no one in the party is a state officer, defined as legislators, judges and others. Without any presidential electors, the party can't have a presidential candidate on the ballot, Strange contended. Stein's appearance on the ballot could make a difference in battleground Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between 5,700 votes and about 23,000 votes. Stein last appeared on the Wisconsin ballot 2016, when she won just over 31,000 votes - more than Donald Trump's winning margin in the state. Some Democrats have blamed her for helping Trump win the state and the presidency that year. The Wisconsin Supreme Court kept Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins off the ballot in 2020 after the elections commission deadlocked on whether he filed proper nominating signatures. The latest Marquette University Law School poll conducted July 24 through Aug. 1 showed the presidential contest in Wisconsin between Democrat Kamala Harris and Trump to be about even among likely voters. Democrats fear third-party candidates could siphon votes from Harris and tilt the race toward Trump. The elections commission plans to meet Aug. 27 to determine whether four independent presidential candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, have met the prerequisites to appear on the ballot. Strange filed a separate complaint last week with the commission seeking to keep West off the ballot, alleging his declaration of candidacy wasn't properly notarized. Cornel's campaign manager countered in a written response any notarization shortcomings shouldn't be enough to keep him off the ballot. That complaint is still pending. Michigan election officials tossed West off that state's ballot Friday over similar notary issues.","summary":"Wisconsin elections officials dismissed a complaint by a Democratic National Committee employee to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot.

She now leads in most national polls and in many recent swing state polls. Momentum is clearly on her side. What most analysts have overlooked, though, is where her support is coming from. While she has made up ground among all demographics from President Biden’s dismal post-debate standing, she remains well behind historic levels of Democratic support among blacks and Latinos. That means the reason she’s in the lead is that she’s doing historically well among whites, especially college-educated whites. So her already slim lead is much more tenuous than it looks. The Cook Political Report’s polling average makes this clear. It shows Harris with a thin lead nationally, 47.3% to 46.9%. It also shows her with wide leads among blacks (75-19) and Hispanics (53-41). An average reader would see those data and think she leads because of those demographics. The political pro immediately makes the opposite conclusion, because these margins, as large as they are, are much smaller than Democrats traditionally win. Cook helpfully provides some data from 2020 that subtly makes this point. Biden beat Trump 90-9 among blacks and 60-37 among Hispanics. Trump got roughly 47% of the vote in 2020, so he should be doing better than that in the polls now given that that he’s polling much better among these groups, which cast over 20% of all votes in 2020. Yet he’s only running even with his 2020 showing despite these impressive gains — because he is losing votes among whites. Polls by Emerson College, Ipsos and Survey USA show Trump leads by either 13 or 14 points among whites in a one-on-one race with Harris. But Trump won whites by 17 points in 2020, per the exit poll. Republicans have done even better with white voters in other recent presidential races. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 21 points with white voters in 2016; Mitt Romney trounced Barack Obama by 20 points with them in 2012. Harris’ deficit among whites is only slightly more than the 12 points that Barack Obama lost them by in 2008. That was a year when the stock market was collapsing, the world was falling into recession and the incumbent Republican president had a job approval rating of just 28% on Election Day. It boggles the mind that Harris could nearly equal Obama’s result, given that she is the incumbent vice president for an administration whose own job approval ratings are dismal. Trump’s own unpopularity is not likely the cause. He remains disliked by more people than liked, but his current 44.3% favorability rating is over 2 points higher than it was on Election Day 2020. Nor is Harris herself especially popular. She, too, is disliked by more people than like her, and her 45.5% favorability rating is only slightly higher than Trump’s. The factors point to a simple reason for her standing: hype. She’s been the subject of massive amounts of uncritical attention for the past month. This has fueled a rise in her favorability rating, but it also presumably has helped persuade people who dislike both candidates to reluctantly favor her in a showdown with Trump. So there’s reason to think Trump can fight back. The campaign has already booked tens of millions of dollars of ads in the swing states to run over the next three weeks. That alone could cause some of the hype to fade there. Trump can also use personal appearances to make the case that Harris is too liberal and too weak to be president. That, however, would require more effort and discipline than he has shown in recent weeks. If he can do that, though, it wouldn’t take much to propel him into the lead. Whites will cast roughly two-thirds of all votes this year. Winning them by 16 points rather than 13 may not seem like much of a difference, but that small change shifts the national margin by about two percentage points in Trump’s favor. It’s the difference between victory and defeat. Whites are even more decisive in the key Midwestern swing states. They cast between 81% and 86% of the vote in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Given Trump’s gains with non-white voters, Harris has to run better than Biden with whites to have a prayer of winning any of those states. There are still about 11 weeks until Election Day. In a race as close as this, anything can happen. Once the Democratic convention and Harris’ honeymoon period end, don’t be surprised if some white voters move back to Trump and the polls tighten even further.

A survey says that’s possible, with oil and gas policies from the last few years to blame. New polling of seven swing states shows the Biden-Harris administration’s energy policies could crimp the vice president’s electoral hopes in November — and the former president’s ability to bring cheap gas to American pumps may be a winning message down the stretch. The battleground state survey, which Morning Consult conducted for the American Petroleum Institute, finds voters drawing a direct connection between the high cost of living and impractical energy and environmental guidelines courtesy of the Democrats in the White House. “The U.S. continues to be a global leader in energy production, but the American people recognize that our leaders in Washington must advance an agenda to grow our nation’s energy advantage for decades to come,” API President and CEO Mike Sommers said. “With geopolitical tensions rising and inflation remaining a top concern, we need policies that reinforce the role of American energy on the world stage and support access to the affordable, reliable energy consumers need.” The polling data show inflation is a massive issue across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as affirmed by 91% to 94% of voters in all seven states. Previous polling has shown nearly 60% of Americans blame the administration for increasing inflation. Vice President Kamala Harris is rolling out plans to repair what her administration has done, but former President Donald Trump says her “Maduro plan,” which includes a proposal to fix grocery prices, is “like something out of Venezuela or the former Soviet Union.” But this poll indicates voters know lowering gas prices is essential to reduce the cost of living, suggesting the California Democrat may need to read the room better in the battlegrounds where this election will be decided or risk losing the race due to an inauthentic message at odds with what voters experience in the Biden-Harris economy. Consider this: At least 80% of people in all seven states polled “agree that producing more oil and natural gas here in the U.S. could help lower energy and utility costs for American consumers,” per API. The high-water mark is Georgia’s 88%. In must-win states like Pennsylvania, where 85% say to “drill, baby, drill,” Harris’ previous opposition to fracking doesn’t sit well. And the teleprompter speech has yet to offer a defense of her unpopular policy position from when she ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Indeed, swing voters want energy independence, per this survey, with four out of every five saying they “support leveraging America’s domestic resources rather than relying on other regions of the world.” This includes a staggering 89% of Michiganders, many of whom remember the Trump administration showcasing the Wolverine State as an “incubator” of an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy abandoned by the Democratic incumbent’s team. And it’s not just about cheap supply. It’s also about national security. More than four out of every five voters in all states surveyed believe energy security is key to holding America’s enemies at bay, including 91% in Georgia, 89% in Arizona and 88% in North Carolina who believe “producing oil and natural gas here in America helps make our country more secure against foreign adversaries.” The Biden administration has broken with historic best practice regarding energy, failing to restock storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while releasing stock from it this summer not due to an emergency but whim and political expediency. Of course, that kind of fast-shuffle may not have been necessary if President Biden hadn’t moved to put the kibosh on the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Voters are also rejecting the Biden administration’s electric-vehicle mandates and moves to phase out petroleum engines, and just like with the rest of the survey, the numbers are compelling, particularly in the blue-wall states Harris must win. Eighty percent of Michiganders, 78% of Wisconsinites and 77% of Pennsylvanians say they “oppose government mandates that restrict consumer choice, including banning new gasoline, diesel and hybrid vehicles.”","summary":"Is a Kamala-crisis imminent?

Tim Walz have tapped 16 Hollywood-loved designers for their latest merch drop. Following the viral Chappel Roan-inspired camo cap, the Harris-Walz campaign released the Designers for Democracy collection featuring apparel and accessories by Sergio Hudson, Thom Browne, Joseph Altuzarra and other labels worn by Harris, former First Ladies Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton and countless stars. Reproductive rights, climate change and voting awareness are among the themes of the 2024 campaign collection ($35 to $85) of tees, tanks, long-sleeved shirts, hoodies, sweaters, tote bags and more. Pieces include a floral terry cloth hoodie by Ulla Johnson emblazoned with “Our Bodies” and “Our Vote” along the sleeves, a Victor Glemaud tank top with the phrase “we are not going back / kamala” across the chest, a gray “Kamala.” sweater by Willy Chavarria and a black T-shirt by poet and artist Cleo Wade featuring a photo of the Democratic presidential candidate as a young girl with the words, “the first but not the last.” Other items include a retro “America Is an Idea” tee and two pairs of ribbed socks by Brother Vellies designer and 15 Percent Pledge founder Aurora James (her pieces are now sold out), graphic totes by Tory Burch and Brett Heyman and an American flag-inspired “Let’s win this” reversible scarf by Thom Browne. Gabriella Hearst created an ombré pink and purple baseball cap and sweatshirt with the words “democracy, women’s rights and climate,” while Chloe Kristyn designer Bettina Benson’s white tee features “we choose freedom” across illustrated flowers. Jonathan Cohen, Prabal Gurung and Vera Wang also contributed designs to the collection. Per the website, garments are American-made and union-printed. Items are available for presale and orders ship in early October. Kamala HQ senior campaign advisor Meaghan Burdick told Vogue, “Vice President Harris and Governor Tim Walz are fighting for a future that strengthens our democracy, protects reproductive freedom and ensures every person has the opportunity to not just get by but to get ahead. The Designers for Democracy are a group of beloved American designers who believe in that vision and are working to get Harris and Walz to the White House.” Of her T-shirt design, James explained on Instagram, “America is a beautiful, strange and bountiful place. America is also an idea. And exactly whose idea she is will be voted on up and down the ballot all across the country this November. For too long people that look like me were made to feel that we didn’t belong here. But America belongs to all of us, equally. And we belong to her, too. She is our home; she is our heart; she is our idea.” Sergio Hudson became a household name after former First Lady Michelle Obama wore a head-to-toe plum look by the Los Angeles-based designer to President Joe Biden’s 2021 inauguration. Harris also wore a custom sequin cocktail dress with a floor-length tuxedo overcoat by the designer later that evening for her first appearance as Vice President; most recently she donned a bright blue suit set by the designer at the 2024 Essence Festival of Culture. The former First Lady wore a checkered tailored dress by Thom Browne to President Barack Obama’s 2013 inauguration. And Hillary Clinton sported a red gown by Altuzarra at the 2022 Met Gala.

Let’s face it: President Joe Biden was former President Donald Trump’s clearest path to victory. And the gift that kept on giving has laid its last golden egg. Biden is gone. It’s incredible how poor a candidate he was. And it took his exit to fully realize just how bad off the Democrats were with him at the top of the ticket. Enter Vice President Kamala Harris, and the euphoria that was pent up has been released like water over Niagara Falls. I get that. Political flaks know what a honeymoon looks like. They know what to do: Weather that slight bump but continually rage against the machine — in this case, the Democrat machine that is now Harris/Walz. It’s at this stage of the presidential campaign that Trump’s limited political experience has failed him. Sure, he is surrounded by a team of experts with years of being on the campaign trail. But I’ve seen enough presidential races to know that it takes a veteran at the top — the candidate himself — to recognize when the ship of state is listing and in need of a course correction. Even candidates who didn’t go on to win the White House adjusted and pivoted to match the shifting winds of the electorate, to respond to the zeitgeist of the day. I have yet to see the pivot. And frankly it must come from the candidate himself, not even his VP pick. Trump needs a course correction … and quickly. As I type this, the first ballots in Pennsylvania get mailed out in less than 38 days. If there is one state every election watcher has their eye on, it’s Pennsylvania. So technically, both sides have weeks, not months, to begin to make their marks on a small map impacted by the Electoral College. Three things are a political imperative to get the Trump Train back on its tracks: — Stay on mission. The Biden-Harris administration is the mission. Harris is Biden’s standard-bearer. Everything he touched during his term, he put into the ditch. Inflation, the economy, jobs (see the stock market last week?), fentanyl, immigration, housing, the list is endless. No one — and I mean no one — believes they are better off under Biden and Harris. So attack her. Toss in Biden for good measure. He reminds even wobbly Democrat voters what they almost were stuck with. Michigan has 800,000 Arab American voters. Remind them of how bad Biden/Harris was for their agenda. Don’t get distracted with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. He’s a proxy for her terrible policies. When both start doing press conferences, be ready to attack everything they say, because their responses will not match what is keeping American families up at night. Please, no more talk of stolen elections. Look presidential and keep the main thing the main thing: Harris is scary. — Help down-ticket races. Finally a different twist — take this message to West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, Nevada and New Mexico, and help your party down-ticket. Ohioans, for example, love Trump. Help out the Senate race there. Trump will help himself, I promise. The same is true in at least four or five other states and in some key congressional districts across the country. Don’t miss the opportunity to grow an incoming majority in the Senate. This race is far from over. And both sides will take their fair share of lumps while doling out a hefty amount of political ordnance. The winning side will be the one that makes the fewest mistakes and stays on mission. It won’t be easy, but it will be simple.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton called for a halt to accepting humanitarian refugees from war-torn Gaza. This call came hot on the heels of his recent visit to Israel, sponsored by the Australia Israel and Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC). On that visit – and in Parliament this week – Dutton has repeatedly stated that Israel is an “ally” of Australia. In fact, Australia does not share an alliance treaty with Israel, which is the reason Australian prime ministers describe Israel as a “friend” and not an ally. Dutton called Israel our “ally” when he “pledged to ‘rebuild’ Australia’s relationship with Israel”. In doing so, he not only showed his lack of knowledge of Australia’s global alliances but also used the opportunity to plant the seed that the relationship needed rebuilding. Traditionally, national security and defence issues such as these have largely received bipartisan support in parliament and on the world stage from travelling Opposition MPs. Rarely do Opposition Leaders go on sponsored trips just to cosy up to the Government of the day — most have had more respect for democracy than that. This week in Parliament, whilst moving a motion to suspend standing orders, Dutton misled the House and the Australian people by again calling Israel our “ally”. The Opposition Leader told the House of Representatives on Thursday: “They are an ally of our country.” Dutton’s calls for the halt to accepting refugees from Gaza had been dutifully echoed by the Coalition throughout the week with similar question after question on Palestinian immigration from members on the Opposition benches. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese repeatedly told members that immigration procedures currently in place are identical to those of the previous Government. The Prime Minister accused the Opposition of undermining Australia’s national security measures and workforce. During Question Time this week, the PM said: \"The arrangements that we have in place are the same that were in place under the former Government. The role of ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]; the use of the movement alert list; the processes we use to vet visa applicants are all unchanged.\" Despite this, Opposition questions on the issue continued unabated. Nationals’ Leader David Littleproud held a press conference to defend calls to halt humanitarian refugees from Gaza. It received national attention because Greens’ Senator Sarah Hanson-Young walked through it and suggested Littleproud, “say something about the children being slaughtered” — a reference to the thousands of innocent Palestinian children who have been killed, maimed or orphaned by Israeli bombs and missile strikes in recent months. On Thursday morning, during Dutton’s attempt to suspend standing orders, Independent Member for Warringah Zali Steggall told the Opposition Leader to “stop being racist” — a comment which Dutton demanded she withdraw. “Racist” is a term that has dogged Peter Dutton throughout his political career and it has done so again this week. As reported by the ABC: 'On Thursday, Dutton reaffirmed his position in a heated interview on Nine’s Today Show in which he rebuffed accusations he was \"racist\" or \"heartless\".' Though he continues to suggest otherwise, Dutton’s comments over the years have been interpreted by the media and many others as racist. He has opined that Lebanese immigration was a “mistake” and walked out of the Stolen Generations Apology to First Nations people. He held hardline positions on the Biloela Family when he was Home Affairs Minister in the Coalition Government, calling their children “anchor babies”. Neither has Dutton shown humanity to asylum seekers fleeing persecution, but, rather, has joked about the effects of climate change on our Pacific neighbours and made false accusations about Melbournians being overwhelmingly afraid of “African gangs”. Peter Dutton’s humanity is rarely seen — though was most notably shown to White South African farmers and au pairs when he was a minister. In 2016, Dutton was Minister for Immigration during the Baby Asha affair, when a one-year-old baby was brought from detention in Nauru for medical treatment of burns. At the time, parallels were drawn with the “children overboard affair”, which played a significant role in the election that first saw Dutton voted in. Then-Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said in October 2001: “A number of children had been thrown overboard, again with the intention of putting us under duress”. This claim that asylum-seeker parents were deliberately throwing their children overboard was later proven to be untrue. Dutton was elected one month after Ruddock made this spurious claim, echoing similar claims by then-Defence Minister Peter Reith at the time. The Howard Government was re-elected in November 2001 after the children overboard lie — the election came before the truth was revealed. Peter Dutton cut his political teeth in this unethical environment, which goes some way to explain his chequered political career and inability to be a significant electoral threat to Anthony Albanese. In the case of Baby Asha, Dutton was accused by Greens Leader Adam Bandt of inferring the child had been deliberately injured by her parents so as to get to Australia. In another case, Dutton maintained his incorrect account of an incident on Manus Island involving a young boy, despite his account being rejected by detainees and police. In all these cases involving asylum seekers, Dutton argued that his motives for such hardline stances were based purely on national security, not racism. Again, this week, he has repeated these same arguments but this time to a growing backlash, inside and outside of Parliament. Recently, in the wake of similar pushes towards right-wing hardline stances like Dutton’s on immigration and other issues, there has been a global shift in popular support for humanitarianism and peaceful outcomes. In the UK, violent racist protests were met with much larger peaceful protests. The hardline Right failed at the recent French and UK elections, and the elevation of current U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris as a presidential candidate has turned the tide on the U.S. presidential campaign. Australian polls and political commentators are predicting a possible minority Labor Government at the next Federal Election, with Liberals likely to lose more ground to Independents and minor parties. Neither polls nor the mainstream conservative media are brave enough to speculate that the Coalition will be electorally competitive under Dutton, even if Dutton’s Liberal candidates do manage to nominate on time — unlike their NSW local council candidates who missed the deadline for nominations this week. After 23 years as a politician, Dutton’s pleas that he is not racist are becoming increasingly tedious and more difficult to believe. Australians know there is simply too much evidence to the contrary littered throughout those years. Humanitarians don’t have to constantly explain to others that they are not racist, yet this is something that Dutton has become well versed at doing — again and again and again. Questions remain: how many believe him? When will he be accused of making racist remarks again? If history is anything to go by, it shouldn’t be long.

The latest crisis at Seattle-based Starbucks began with three consecutive quarters of disappointing results, including declining same-store sales and earnings in its two most recent quarters. The recent revenue misses are the first in about 15 years, when the 2007-2008 Great Recession was ravaging the economy. The challenge today, according to a recent Bloomberg report, is in part due to inflation—the company “is bleeding customers who no longer want to shell out for high-priced coffee drinks.” That’s hardly unique to Starbucks. What is unique and much more difficult to address is that “the once-consistent in-store experience has also deteriorated: Wait times have ticked up, and customers are abandoning online orders.” Any discussion about Starbucks inevitably revolves around the marketing genius who took a small regional chain of a dozen or so coffee bars in 1987 and built a global juggernaut—Howard Schultz. Much as Steve Jobs gave Apple its innovative culture, and Ray Kroc was the soul of McDonald’s, Schultz has been the keeper of the Starbucks flame from the start. He retired in 2000 but returned in a rescue CEO role in 2008 during another economic crisis—the Great Recession. Then, as now, a premium cup of coffee was becoming an extravagance during lean times, and the brand was showing signs of fatigue. A report in the New York Times sounds a lot like the latest Bloomberg critique: “[M]any people are now abandoning the product, if not the lifestyle that goes with it. … Four percent fewer people visited Starbucks stores, and on average, the ones that did spent 3 percent less on items like mocha cappuccinos and chocolate croissants than customers in the same period a year ago.” MORE FOR YOU Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Friday, August 16 Harris Will Propose $25,000 In Down Payment Aid For First-Time Homebuyers As Part Of Economic Agenda Kamala Harris Addresses Economy In Speech—Here’s What To Know About Her Policy Agenda Fast forward to 2017 when Schultz, having driven annual revenue from less than $10 billion to nearly $23 billion, retired for a second time. Then the pandemic hit, and out of the turmoil, in 2022, Schultz returned for a third stint, this time as interim CEO to train his pick to be the next CEO, a former PepsiCo executive, Laxman Narasimhan. But the revolving door turned again this month when the board suddenly fired him and hired Brian Niccol, former CEO of Chipotle, who is credited with turning that company around after a disastrous 2016. Will Schultz be invited back for a third time? Unlikely. According to press reports, he has been emailing and otherwise complaining to the board and investors that “the shine was off the brand.” In a long, fascinating interview on the podcast “Acquired” in June, Schultz spoke in detail about the history of Starbucks and said he has no desire or intent to return as CEO of Starbucks, opining that the company is drifting “towards mediocrity.” So, what’s ailing Starbucks? The answer is embedded in the podcast interview and is worth a full listen as Schultz goes into detail about how the company got started and the basis of its success. He said he saw the potential in Starbucks when he noticed that many of the same people got their morning caffeine fix every day and that those customers were interacting with each other. Schultz says, “That's when I started talking about the language of community. Of course, it was the romance of espresso, but it was the sense of community. In our first stores, you could see what people would do after they bought the coffee. You could just feel the relationship that people were having with one another around human connection. There was something … some magic going on, and coffee was the conduit.” A key element of sustainable success in retailing is knowing the customer. The product matters (100% of the time), but what also creates an enduring brand is a sense of understanding. Starbucks has become a store that sells fancy coffees that feel like an extravagance when consumers are struggling to pay for the basics—rent, mortgages, car insurance, and groceries. And its customer has changed. We will see if Brian Niccol is interested in listening and understanding how the customer has changed to fix it, or if he will just be another overcompensated long shot.

The number of children with disabilities is on the rise: According to the Department of Education, 7.5 million children received services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act during the 2022-2023 school year, a figure that accounts for 15% of all students and is the highest number on record. As Colin Farrell made clear in his recent interview about his own son—who has Angelman syndrome and is nonverbal—caring for a child with a disability is a lifelong commitment, and more parents than ever are worried about their children outliving them. Implementing a long-term financial plan for their care is, therefore, crucial, but it can be hard to know where to begin. To that end, I recently interviewed financial planner Melissa Weisz; she has a Chartered Special Needs Consultant designation and specializes in working with families who have a loved one with a disability. We first wrote about Weisz last year and she came to the Forbes office last week to break down the difference between the different types of Special Needs Trusts and also tax advantaged ABLE accounts, why it’s advisable for families to consult a financial planner and a lawyer when making these plans, and how to find extra money in a tight budget for a better savings cushion. “I understand the strain on families, I’ve been there,’’ she says (Weisz has a son on the autism spectrum). “My job as their planner is to integrate—the personal is financial.” You can watch our full conversation here, and read the 2023 interview with Weisz here.

Maggie McGrath Exclusive Forbes Profile: This Kinder, Gentler Bill Collector Is Helping People Keep The Lights On CODY PICKENS FOR FORBES Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins built Promise into a $520 million powerhouse by helping municipalities and utilities collect unpaid bills with zero-interest payment plans. “We are committed to zero interest. You have to make a decision. Are people not paying because they don’t want to or because they can’t?” Ellis-Lamkins says. “If you fundamentally believe people aren’t paying because they can’t, you can’t charge them 30% interest rates. Thirty percent interest rates are punitive. Who wants to charge interest to someone in pain or struggling?” ICYMI: News Of The Week Promise was one of the 25 companies that made the cut for this year’s Next Billion Dollar Startups, the Forbes list of U.S. venture-backed companies most likely to reach a $1 billion valuation. This week marked the release of the 10th annual edition of the list, and not to brag, but our track record in unicorn prognostication is none too shabby: Of the list’s 225 alumni, 131, or 58%, became unicorns, including DoorDash, Figma, Anduril, Benchling and Rippling. Former YouTube chief and Silicon Valley pioneer Susan Wojcicki died Friday at the age of 56 after a two-year battle with lung cancer. She served as the video sharing platform’s longest-serving CEO during some of its most formative years, and her passing provoked an outpouring of support and condolences from YouTube creators, technology executives, and leaders across the nation. A ballot measure on legalizing abortion in Missouri officially qualified for the ballot Tuesday, less than a day after a similar measure was made official in Arizona, two of eight states that are now set to have abortion on their November ballot—including some where the procedure is now banned. Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate on the presidential ticket is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and he’s received the nickname “Tampon Tim” by some political opponents. ForbesWomen editor Maggie McGrath spoke to the founder and executive director of the Pad Project, Melissa Berton (she was also on the 2021 50 Over 50 list!), about why this nickname isn’t the insult that some people think it is, and also what the world needs to know about menstrual equity in 2024. IndiGo, one of the largest airlines in the world, has introduced a feature allowing female passengers to select seats next to other female travelers. The Indian airline’s initiative, currently in its pilot phase, enables women to view the gender of other passengers on the seating chart during check-in. The Checklist 1. Ditch assumptions about work commitment based on family choices. Human resource studies have found that childfree employees are expected to work more overtime than parents are—and other studies indicate that these employees are sometimes viewed as less reliable than their parent counterparts. These stereotypes are lazy at best and harmful at worst; here’s how we can all do better. 2. Get unstuck. After a few years, even the most exciting job can start to feel a bit routine. But before you consider job hopping, consider one of these three strategies instead. 3. Batch your emails. According to McKinsey, the average professional spends about 28% of their workday reading and responding to emails—which adds up to more than 11 hours per week. Continuously checking this deluge can waste your time and break your focus on more important work. Instead, consider breaking the time in your inbox into just two or three daily batches.
