After making its world premiere this fall at New York’s SoHo Playhouse, tickets are available online for the Off-Broadway musical satire’s final show on Sunday, Oct. 13, concluding its run ahead of the 2024 presidential election. “We are so grateful for the dozens of running mates, our remarkable cast and creative team, and everyone who put their heart and soul into creating this production which has provided a unique and theatrical window into a presidential year like no other,” said producers Jason Rose, Lynn Londen and Max Fose in a statement. “We are proud to have played our unconventional part in the political conversation. Thank you, and God bless Off-Broadway.” Ghost of John McCain finds the late senator in the afterlife, which turns out to be inside Donald Trump’s brain. Accompanied by a “Greek Chorus” of iconic figures, including former Secretary Hillary Clinton, Roy Cohn, Eva Perón, Teddy Roosevelt, Lindsey Graham, Tiffany Trump, Grizabella from CATS, Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Joe Biden, Sarah Palin, Eric Trump and Kamala Harris, they rebel against the former president’s relentless demands for affirmation. The musical stars Jason Tam as McCain, along with an ensemble that includes Lindsay Nicole Chambers, Ben Fankhauser, Zonya Love, Luke Kolbe Mannikus, Aaron Michael Ray and understudies Gisela Adisa, Joshua David Robinson and Anthony Zambito. Co-conceived by McCain’s first chief of staff, late Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods — who was a eulogist at McCain’s funeral in 2018 — Ghost of John McCain features a book by Scott Elmegreen and a score by Drew Fornarola, directed by Catie Davis with choreography by Sunny Min-Sook Hitt. The producers extended an invitation to the late senator’s daughter Meghan McCain, who previously called the project “trash” when it was announced, and “nothing more than a gross cash grab by mediocre desperate people… I hope it bombs.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Ghost of John McCain is ready to cross over.

The ex-president was rallying his base in Saginaw on Thursday, as he fights for wins in key \"blue wall\" battleground states. Trump praised his supporters for turning up in numbers, asking them: \"Only MAGA. Who else can fill up big places like this at three o'clock in the afternoon? \". Yet, videos shared by attendees tell a different story, revealing a sparsely filled venue. \"For a campaign that often points out when opponents' venues don't look full, this visual is striking,\" noted Spectrum News reporter Taylor Popielarz, as he posted a video showcasing the actual crowd size. In last month's presidential debate, Vice President and election rival Kamala Harris seemed to get under Trump's skin when she hinted that people were ditching his rallies early because of his lengthy speeches. Just last week, Harris threw another dig at Trump during a Los Angeles fundraiser, quipping to donors that her \"crowds are pretty big\" while she's on the campaign trail. Trump, nonetheless, keeps bragging about his rally turnouts, insisting he pulls the biggest crowds. \"I've spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me,\" Trump claimed in August, according to the Express US. In August, the Republican presidential nominee wrongly alleged that a photograph depicting thousands of supporters awaiting Harris' campaign rally at Detroit's airport was artificially tampered with. Harris' campaign team vehemently denied these claims, asserting that the photo was not manipulated. The rally at Detroit airport saw an impressive turnout of 15,000 people.","summary":"Donald Trump has bragged about the size of his rally crowd in Saginaw, Michigan - but video evidence shows a partially empty venue as the ex-President faces another humiliation","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-boasts-massive-rally-33817842","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article33817841.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_republican-candidate-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:31:31","author":"Housnia Shams,Joseph Wilkes","authors":["Housnia Shams","Joseph Wilkes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.097},{"id":258399462,"title":"Kamala Harris joins Liz Cheney at birthplace of GOP — says 2024 election is also about Ukraine","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the birthplace of the Republican Party Thursday to say that the 2024 election is not only about the US — but also about the war in Ukraine — as she hyped a double endorsement from the Cheney family. “Democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home. They are also at stake around the world,” Harris, 59, said in Ripon, Wis., after an introduction from Cheney, the fiery anti-Donald Trump former congresswoman from Wyoming. Harris told the crowd of her meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, in which she said she told him, “I stand with Ukraine and I always will.” “I want to Ukraine to prevail,” the vice president went on, noting that Trump, 78, did not say he wanted Ukraine to “win” in their presidential debate last month and suggesting he’d hand a strategic victory to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Harris said that Trump wants Ukraine to give up sovereign territory, which she said is a “bedrock principle upon which we stand and fight for.” The campaign stop in Ripon with the younger Cheney, 58 — whose father Dick Cheney served as vice president to George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 — focused on Trump’s place in the Republican Party. Both Cheneys have come out in support of Harris. The former congresswoman took several digs at Trump, saying, “I was a Republican before Donald Trump began spray-tanning” — as she recited her well-worn denunciation of the former president’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when he urged a mob to march on the Capitol to challenge his loss in the Electoral College. “He summoned a mob to Washington, DC, with his lies, and he sent the armed mob the United States Capitol in an effort to stop the counting of electoral votes as the violent mob attacked our Capitol,” said Cheney, who served as vice chair of the House investigation into the riot. Cheney, who was born in the swing state, spoke at length about being a Ronald Reagan-style Republican and cited passages from the newly unsealed court filing from Wednesday in which special counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting Trump for his actions challenging his loss, alleged that Trump said “so what” in reaction to then-Vice President Mike Pence being evacuated during the riot. Harris gave Cheney, with whom Trump frequently clashed on foreign policy, a glowing review, saying they are aligned for their love of country, despite being from different parties. “We may not see eye to eye on every issue,” she said, “and we’re going to get back to a healthy two-party system … but we both love our country and democratic ideals.” Retiring President Biden also heaped praise on Cheney, who has been coy about her own presidential ambitions within a post-Trump Republican Party. “She made one of the most consequential speeches I’ve ever heard,” Biden raved to reporters. “She has character. I know her dad,” he added. “We argue like hell, but I always admired his courage and honesty. What she did not took only political courage, but physical courage… I was really incredibly proud of her.” Biden added, “She and her father have character, character, dammit.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the birthplace of the Republican Party Thursday to say that the 2024 election is not only about the US — but also about the war in Ukraine — as she hyped a double endorsement from the Cheney family. &#8220;Democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home....","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/us-news/kamala-harris-goes-to-the-birthplace-of-the-gop-to-say-2024-election-is-also-about-ukraine/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/democratic-presidential-nominee-vice-president-90971212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KoIHffAa-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:25:36","author":"Diana Glebova,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.186},{"id":258399460,"title":"Kamala Harris, Donald Trump tied in North Carolina — but voters believe he’s the stronger leader","text":"With two weeks before early voting begins in North Carolina, the presidential race is too close to call. That’s according to a new High Point University survey, which finds Donald Trump and Kamala Harris knotted at 48% a piece among 589 likely voters. This is just the latest poll of the southern swing state to suggest a close race. The RealClearPolitics polling average shows just a 0.6 point Trump lead, factoring in a batch of tied polls and not including a single survey with either candidate leading by more than 3 points. The dead heat is remarkable in a sense given that 67% of likely voters think the country is on the wrong track under the Joe Biden administration, with 55% disapproving of the president’s leadership, along with 50% who aren’t happy with Harris’ performance in her current post (against 45% approval). But despite the Democratic nominee being underwater as vice president, survey participants are marginally more favorable to her as a candidate for the top job, with 50% approving of the campaign version of Harris against 47% disapproval. Conversely, Trump is seen unfavorably as a candidate by 52% of respondents; 47% regard him favorably. So why the tie? Despite the gap in personal approval ratings between Trump and Harris, the issues that matter most to Tar Heels play to the former president’s strengths. Thirty-one percent see improving economic conditions as the most important consideration when they vote, while 16% identify illegal immigration as their primary preoccupation. Those are the only two concerns more than 10% of respondents say matter most. On both issues, Trump is the favored option over Biden’s understudy. By a margin of 50% to 45%, the ex-prez is seen as the champion of economic growth in this election. And when it comes to managing immigration, 55% of North Carolina voters say Trump is better suited for the job than “Border Czar” Harris, whose administration has presided over prolonged failures in border security. Only 37% of respondents believe Harris can do as president what she failed to do as veep. Voters also think Trump is a stronger leader than Harris, by a 47% to 40% spread. They’re also more convinced Trump will do what’s right rather than popular, 46% to 42%. And they believe, by a 50% to 39% margin, he’s better at taking action rather than just talking. The poll was in the field between Sept. 20 and 29, as Hurricane Helene and a front that preceded it ravaged the state but before people in the western part of the state were compelled to reckon with a glacial response to the unprecedented disaster.","summary":"With two weeks before early voting begins in North Carolina, the presidential race is too close to call.

The International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance, an industry group representing ocean freight companies and port owners, have come together on a deal, the union said in a statement. Under its terms, the two sides have agreed to extend the current master contract until Jan. 15, at which time they will \"return to the bargaining table to negotiate all other outstanding issues.\" The current strike, which began Tuesday morning and affects all U.S. ports from Maine to Texas, will end \"immediately\" and all work covered by the contract will resume, the ILA said. Dockworkers began setting up picket lines at waterfront facilities along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, marking the first coast-wide strike by the longshoremen in nearly 50 years. The strike affected some 24,000 workers and at 14 ports, raising fears of the damage it would potentially cost the U.S. economy. Both President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party nominee to be his successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, voiced support for the striking dockworkers this week. Biden on Thursday hailed news of the agreement, saying, \"Today's tentative agreement on a record wage and an extension of the collective bargaining process represents critical progress towards a strong contract. \"I congratulate the dockworkers from the ILA, who deserve a strong contract after sacrificing so much to keep our ports open during the pandemic. And I applaud the port operators and carriers who are members of the U.S. Maritime Alliance for working hard and putting a strong offer on the table,\" he said. The president, who spent most of Thursday touring devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene in Florida and Georgia, added that the agreement is especially timely in light of the disaster recovery efforts that will be needed. \"I want to thank the union workers, the carriers, and the port operators for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding,\" Biden said. \"Collective bargaining works, and it is critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.\"","summary":"Striking East and Gulf Coast dockworkers and U.S. port operators have reached a tentative agreement on wages, ending a two-day-old work stoppage, the longshoreman's union announced Thursday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/10/03/Dockworkers-strike-ends-union-freight-companies-reach-tentative-deal/7971727998839/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7971727998839/2024/upi_com/c1dab498ec89c003431063effffb6f1e/v1.2/Dockworkers-strike-ends-as-union-freight-companies-reach-tentative-deal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:19:39","author":"Don Jacobson","authors":["Don Jacobson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":258399384,"title":"Desantis Deploys National Guard to Ports","text":"DeSantis said during a press conference on Thursday that the strike has the potential to affect hurricane recovery.

He called it “unacceptable” for the Biden-Harris administration “to allow supply chain interruptions to hurt people who are reeling from a Category 4 hurricane.” Meanwhile, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp suspended the state gas tax to provide relief to those affected by the hurricane. “The storm has been catastrophic,” Cooper said in a statement. “The scope of our challenge is unprecedented, but so too is our response.” Meanwhile, FEMA has offered $750 for people who need immediate assistance with things such as food and baby formula, Vice President Kamala Harris announced during a trip to Augusta, Georgia, to survey the damage. To date, FEMA has shipped more than 8.8 million meals, more than 7.4 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 225,000 tarps to the region, the agency said on Wednesday. “FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season,” Mayorkas said, adding that another hurricane is expected to hit the United States.","summary":"Florida Gov.

Per the report, Emhoff slapped his then-partner who was flirting with another man. The story goes on to say he followed her into her car as she fled. The victim of the alleged assault was unnamed in the article and did not comment to the publication. The allegations have picked up steam amongst right-wing media and commentators, with Megyn Kelly and Trump aide Stephen Miller chiming in. “If this were a Republican, it would be leading every news channel,” Kelly said on her SiriusXM radio show on Wednesday. \"Most of us would have left it alone if he hadn’t then paraded himself out there — and let the media parade himself out there — like he was the ideal husband on steroids.” Emhoff’s office vehemently denied the allegations in a statement to Semafor on Thursday. “This report is untrue,” the statement said, adding that “any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.” Emhoff, who married Harris in 2014, has taken a prominent role in her campaign for president, adopting a “wife guy” persona, that he was asked about in a recent interview with MSNBC's Jen Psaki. “To me it’s the right thing to do– support women,” Emhoff said. “I’ve always been like this.”","summary":"The Second Gentleman's office denied allegations published by the Daily Mail claiming Emhoff hit his former partner","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/10/03/doug-emhoff-denies-allegation-that-he-hit-ex-girlfriend/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/08/doug_emhoff_kamala_harris_2166816483.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:11:49","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":258399274,"title":"Christine McGuinness puts on an eye-popping display in plunging yellow gown with daringly high slit as she arrives at charity dinner in London","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Friday, Oct 4th 2024 1AM 7°C 4AM 7°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Fantastic Four star Ioan Gruffudd's bitter war with ex-wife Alice Evans takes bizarre twist as she accuses him of 'fraternizing' with lawyer who calls her 'Malice' Country music legend Garth Brooks is accused of raping wife's makeup artist in hotel room More than 1.6 million Brits set to get 'King Kong' of fat-busting jabs for free on the NHS New theory that could explain 'disturbing' rise in young people with stomach cancer - doctors suspect a common infection could be to blame I know why vengeance-seeking crusader Amanda Abbington won't stop, writes JAN MOIR RICHARD EDEN: The fascinating 'freebie' reason the Beckhams have ditched the Sussexes - as my source tells me Victoria 'never really liked' Meghan Teacher found half naked in layby with pupil, 17, says: 'I've been stigmatised by my sex offence' 'Traumatizing' horror sequel leaves moviegoers vomiting in theatres after the last film caused mass walkouts and puking Neighbours and shattered relatives detail the squalid lives of four home-alone brothers killed by inferno while their mother shopped as questions mount for timid social workers - and the boys' heart-tearing final words are revealed 'Blood on its hands': Veteran soldier's family opens up after Army offers apology for 'not doing enough' before armoured vehicle rolled and killed him Prince Harry discusses purpose and 'finding your flow' with former basketball star Pau Gasol for his mental health charity BetterUp Do they think it's all over?

Christine looked on cloud nine as she arrived at the charity event, after returning home from a romantic sun-soaked getaway last week She shared a slew of snaps from her trip to Ibiza, including of her lounging on a bed strewn with rose petals candles and balloons, however her companion remained a mystery It comes fresh of the heels of Christine's night out with model Roxxxan in London as she again put on a busty display in a series of photos she shared to her Instagram after enjoying a stay at the ME hotel in London The blonde beauty shared a picture of her and the model getting cosy, with Christine standing behind Roxxxan, 33, and beaming while Roxxxan lifted her leg up She admitted: 'I really don’t think so. For me I’ve done it. I’ve had the big wedding and I think anyone who gets married, you don’t ever imagine it ending, but if it does happen you get through it but marriage is the last thing you want to do when you get through it. 'Even though we’ve had an amicable divorce, there have been times when it’s been really draining and challenging. It’s a lot to deal with when you’ve got to get up every day and smile for your children.' Christine has also spoken openly about her unique living arrangement with Paddy, with the couple still living together with their three children. She explained: 'He’s not home a lot because he’s so busy with work but we just get on so well and we know we need to be a team for the children. 'I’m the calmest I’ve ever been. I didn’t realise how unsettled my nervous system was before. I’d always have a kind of shakiness, anxiety, inside me. A lot of that was down to the fear of change. Christine has admitted she has been seeing someone new since June in the wake of her split with her comedian husband Paddy McGuinness (pictured together in 2019) 'It’s only this year that I’ve felt ok about the changes following divorce. I kind of feel I live on my own anyway because Patrick works so much do when that does happen I know I will be ok. 'He’s an amazing dad, so hands on at home and so good at what he does. He’s an amazing provider but it does take a lot. I’m the constant at home for the children. 'We’ve never had an argument. We’ll have difficult, challenging conversations but we don’t argue but that’s just not in me. We’re got a pretty good balance and when he is at home then I know I can go away for a couple of days and it’s guilt-free because it’s daddy’s time with the children. 'I do get a lot of couples in my DM’s who are going through separations and they always ask for help and advice. I always say, no matter what’s happened between you you have to put your children first. As a parent, they are your priority.'

The TV personality, 36, looked sensational as she flaunted her incredible figure in an bright yellow satin gown, with a dramatic train and plunging neckline. She barely contained her ample assets in the corsetted bodice, which cinched her in at her tiny waist and was adorned with sparkling gemstones.

The mother-of-three opted for minimal jewellery, adding several dainty silver necklaces and rings and sported a full face of glamorous makeup.

She shared a slew of snaps from her trip to Ibiza, including of her lounging on a bed strewn with rose petals candles and balloons, however her companion remained a mystery. It comes fresh of the heels of Christine's night out with model Roxxxan in London as she again put on a busty display in a series of photos she shared to her Instagram after enjoying a stay at the ME hotel in London The Sun reported. The blonde beauty shared a picture of her and the model getting cosy, with Christine standing behind Roxxxan, 33, and beaming while Roxxxan lifted her leg up. The pair seemed to be very close and wrapped their arms around each other while dressed in matching black outfits. Christine has admitted she has been seeing someone new since June in the wake of her split with her comedian husband Paddy McGuinness. The star, who has candidly discussed her relationships and her life following the split, also admitted she would never marry again. The model split from her husband Paddy, 50, in 2022, and revealed she has no desire to walk down the aisle again after going through a divorce, even though it was amicable.

Read More Christine McGuinness puts on VERY busty display as she enjoys a night out with model Roxxxan after revealing she has been 'dating a mystery partner since June' She began: 'I met them on my birthday through mutual friends and we’ve been dating since June. It’s someone I know. I wasn’t thinking anything at the time but we kept in touch and it’s so nice and laidback.' The TV personality added: 'There are no labels and that’s what’s been amazing. Paddy hasn’t met them. It’s still new and early days. 'After having a relationship in the public eye for so long I’m not sure I want the relationship to be public. I’ve only ever known what it was like to have a relationship that’s in the public. This is nice. 'I’ve been really open and honest from the beginning about where I’m at and they’re ok with that. 'I feel like I’m in good company. I don’t get a lot of time to myself but when I do it’s lovely and we laugh loads.' Christine revealed she was dating again during an appearance on Loose Women in August, but has insisted she is unlikely to marry again.

For me I’ve done it. I’ve had the big wedding and I think anyone who gets married, you don’t ever imagine it ending, but if it does happen you get through it but marriage is the last thing you want to do when you get through it. 'Even though we’ve had an amicable divorce, there have been times when it’s been really draining and challenging. It’s a lot to deal with when you’ve got to get up every day and smile for your children.' Christine has also spoken openly about her unique living arrangement with Paddy, with the couple still living together with their three children. She explained: 'He’s not home a lot because he’s so busy with work but we just get on so well and we know we need to be a team for the children. 'I’m the calmest I’ve ever been. I didn’t realise how unsettled my nervous system was before. I’d always have a kind of shakiness, anxiety, inside me. A lot of that was down to the fear of change. Christine has admitted she has been seeing someone new since June in the wake of her split with her comedian husband Paddy McGuinness (pictured together in 2019) 'It’s only this year that I’ve felt ok about the changes following divorce. I kind of feel I live on my own anyway because Patrick works so much do when that does happen I know I will be ok. 'He’s an amazing dad, so hands on at home and so good at what he does. He’s an amazing provider but it does take a lot. I’m the constant at home for the children. 'We’ve never had an argument. We’ll have difficult, challenging conversations but we don’t argue but that’s just not in me. We’re got a pretty good balance and when he is at home then I know I can go away for a couple of days and it’s guilt-free because it’s daddy’s time with the children. 'I do get a lot of couples in my DM’s who are going through separations and they always ask for help and advice. I always say, no matter what’s happened between you you have to put your children first. As a parent, they are your priority.'

Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to Trump's office via email on Thursday night.To support her argument, the ex-congresswoman referenced a particularly jarring moment taken from a redacted court filing of Smith's federal election subversion evidence against Trump, which was unsealed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan this week.Smith's evidence says that Trump called then-Vice President Mike Pence on the morning of January 6, 2021, pleading with him not to certify President Joe Biden's election win during a joint session of Congress later that day. Pence refused to do so and Trump was allegedly \"incensed.\"After Trump supporters angered over the election result stormed the Capitol, the former president complained in a post to Twitter, now X, that Pence \"didn't have the courage\" to overturn the result. Rioters later chanted \"Hang Mike Pence.\"One minute after Trump posted the tweet denouncing Pence, the Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police took the vice president to a secure location inside the Capitol.According to Smith's evidence, an unnamed White House aide then ran to tell Trump that Pence had been taken to a secure location \"in hopes that (Trump) would take action to ensure Pence's safety.\"Trump allegedly replied: \"So what?\" and appeared unconcerned about Pence's safety as the rioters walked around the Capitol looking for him.\"When he learned that Vice President Pence was not going to abandon his oath and help Trump seize power, Trump sent out a tweet attacking and further inflaming the mob,\" Cheney said on Thursday, recalling Smith's evidence.\"Shortly after that ... [a Trump] aide received a phone call alerting him that the vice president had been evacuated for his own safety,\" she continued. \"After this aide delivered that news, Donald Trump looked up at him and said, 'So what.'\"","summary":"Cheney, a Republican former congresswoman and an outspoken Trump critic, has endorsed Harris in this year's election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/liz-cheney-mentions-jack-smiths-trump-evidence-harris-rally-1963636","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2487252/liz-cheney-campaigns-kamala-harris-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:03:03","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":258398536,"title":"Harris campaigns with Liz Cheney","text":"Harris campaigns with Liz Cheney Vice President Kamala Harris Thursday appeared with one of the highest-profile Republicans to endorse her — former Rep.

The commander-in-chief, 81, stood in silence during sweltering heat when a Ray City farmer concluded his remarks at a post-hurricane event with a prayer. Biden and senior Washington officials stood and listened in front of rows of massive upturned pecan trees behind him, their leaves brown just days after Hurricane Helene tore through. Ray City is around 18 miles north of Valdosta, one of the areas that suffered the biggest hit from Helene and where Donald Trump visited earlier this week. Most of the area is still without power and residents are picking up the pieces from the deadliest hurricane since Katrina that has killed 200 people so far. At least 33 have died in Georgia. ‘Lord this is your creation,’ Shiloh farm property manager Buck Paulk said, with Biden and lawmakers gathered behind him. ‘There ain’t a twig or leaf or branch or root that you don’t hold account of,’ he said in his Georgia drawl. ‘Lord, we need the help – it all comes from you.’ Farmers here are looking for another kind of help from Washington, D.C., and Biden said they would get it. The president took a question about an emergency supplemental bill, something he has said may be needed soon to provide relief. Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier that other legislation already refilled a FEMA fund. ‘Can’t wait, can’t wait. People need help now,’ Biden said. ‘At moments like this, it’s time to put politics aside,’ said Biden during his own remarks. He called to ‘break down this rabid partisanship that exists,’ then said funds in some of his infrastructure legislation went more to red states than to blue ones. ‘It’s not one state versus the other, it’s the United States. You know, there’s no Democrats or Republicans out here … only Americans are here. I’ve been committed to being president for all Americans’. Earlier this week, Trump accused Biden of going out out of his way to not help Republicans hit by the storm. At a rally on Thursday he said the response has been worse than that of Hurricane Katrina. ‘There’s nobody that’s handled a hurricane or storm worse than what they’re doing right now,’ Trump said. ‘Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants. Many of whom should not be in our country Biden name-dropped Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, thanking him and saying they spoke earlier Thursday. Kemp has already vouched for their contact, But Kemp was not there in person for the presidential tour of his state. The event featured Sen. Rafael Warnock, a Democrat who helped give Democrats their majority, as well as Rep. Austin Scott, a Republican who Biden also acknowledged. ‘FEMA has been down here. Coordination has been pretty good,’ Scott told DailyMail.com on the farm. He said the damage to the overall pecan crop was ‘somewhere around $500 million.’ On an earlier storm tour in Florida, Biden met with people who lost their homes. Some houses were completely gone, with only bare pilings standing in what had been a community of retirees and vacationers near Big Bend, where the storm made landfall. The president was accompanied by Sen. Rick Scott, who was there in jeans and his familiar Navy ballcap from earlier storm duty. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn’t there, despite an apparent effort by the White House to get in touch. Asked why DeSantis wasn’t there, Scott told DailyMail.com, ‘I don’t know.’ DailyMail.com has reached out to the governor’s office for comment. DeSantis has been with Biden during other disasters, including after the Surfside building collapse, which came when the two were eying a potential presidential battle. The governor, who endorsed Donald Trump after a bitter primary that ended in his defeat, may be mindful of a famous event with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie famously toured Hurricane Sandy damage weeks before the 2012 election. Observers said it bolstered Obama in his reelection. The trip to Georgia was the latest by a top politician to a damaged battleground state, with Vice President Kamala Harris also getting in on the action with a visit to North Carolina. Trump got the jump on both Biden and Harris with his Monday visit, where his unfounded claim that the administration was brushing off Kemp drew White House pushback. If ‘rabid partisanship’ was on Biden’s mind in Georgia, he issued an emphatic statement to reporters upon landing near D.C. minutes after former GOP Rep. and Trump nemesis Liz Cheney endorsed Harris onstage in Wisconsin. ‘She made one of the most consequential speeches I’ve ever heard. She has character. I know her dad … We argue like hell, but I always admired his courage and honesty,’ Biden told reporters after returning on Air Force One. ‘What she did not took only political courage, but physical courage… I was really incredibly proud of her.’ But he bristled when DailyMail.com asked him what he would do to bring more Republicans over to Harris. ‘I am not making that judgment. I’m talking about her… She and her father have character, character, dammit. There’s not enough of it.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden bowed his head during a tearful prayer at a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden responds to Trump&#8217;s criticism of his handling of Hurricane Helene and urges for an end to extreme political divisions. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/biden-responds-to-trumps-criticism-of-his-handling-of-hurricane-helene-and-urges-for-an-end-to-extreme-political-divisions/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/03/22/90433051-0-image-m-14_1727992288955.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:54:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.572},{"id":258399548,"title":"Ex-GOP Rep.

Cheney shared that Wisconsin is special to her, because in 1966, a very young Dick and Lynne Cheney were graduate students, and she was born in Madison. \"Coming back always feels to me more than a little bit like coming home,\" she said. Cheney jabbed the MAGA leader, telling rally-goers she was a Republican \"even before Donald Trump started spray tanning,\" to laughs. She described herself as a \"Ronald Reagan conservative,\" and supporter of low taxes, limited government, a strong national defense, and that family — not the government — is the \"most important structure in society.\" But Cheney said that security and freedom depend upon a world in which America and its allies lead. \"And above all else, I know that the most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our Constitution,\" she said. Cheney added: \"I have never voted for a Democrat. But this year I am proudly casting my vote for Kamala Harris,\" she said to loud applause and more, \"Thank you, Liz\" chants. \"Mostly,\" she continued, \"we're not going back.\" Harris is \"standing in the breach during a critical moment\" in the nation's history, said Cheney, and is trying to unite what she called reasonable people across the political spectrum. Cheney praised Harris for dedicating her life to public service and said Harris loves the country and will be a president for all Americans. \"I am honored to join her in this urgent cause,\" said Cheney. Cheney then launched into a desperate plea to her party, saying the \"republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before.\" She slammed Trump for trying to stay in power and refusing to accept lawful results confirmed by dozens of courts. \"In this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty,\" she declared, noting that the peaceful transition of power is \"at the very heart of our republic's survival.\" \"Violence does not and must never determine who rules us,\" she said. \"Voters do.\" Among the president's \"solemn\" obligations is to ensure and guarantee that power, she said. That obligation has been honored each election since the beginning of the republic until Trump lost the 2020 election. \"I don't care if you are a Democrat or a Republican or independent. That is depravity. And we mustn't become numb to it. Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again,\" said Cheney. \"He is petty and he is vindictive and he is cruel,\" she said.","summary":"Former Wyoming Republican Rep.Liz Cheney made the case for why the \"party of [Abraham] Lincoln\" should join her in casting their ballots this year for Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump, as she scorched the former president over his \"depravity\" and threat to the republic.\n\nTaking to the podium in Wisconsin, \"Thank you, Liz\" chants broke out in Ripon, Wisconsin, the birthplace of the party.

Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas, who also oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, announced Wednesday that “FEMA does not have the funds to make it” through the rest of hurricane season — because it’s already emptied its emergency kitty on illegal-migrant expenses. It’s now sending Helene victims $750 checks to finish off of a fund of just $10 million to help hurricane survivors buy groceries. President Biden’s answer: Have Congress give FEMA a fresh cash infusion. Meanwhile, FEMA’s devoted $641 million this year just to help state and local governments handle the influx. (Of course, Mayor Adams will point out that this federal help is far short of what localities need to cover their migrant costs. But Biden’s not asking for an appropriation to pay for that, because then he’d have to admit the cost of his open-border policies: Far better to just deplete FEMA’s funds, then tell Adams and other mayors to just suck it up, or else). To be fair, it’s not just Mayorkas who didn’t prep properly for this year’s hurricanes: Kamala Harris reportedly skipped the annual pre-storm-season briefing, indeed has opted out every year she’s been veep. Meanwhile, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has his own Helene gripe with the Biden-Harris team: He says he was “outraged” when FEMA initially designated just 11 counties as post-hurricane disaster areas, which allows victims to file for federal assistance, when he saw “such devastation in up to 90 counties.” He rang up the White House and got another 30 counties listed, with a chance for more to qualify. (Hmm: If Georgia weren’t a swing state, would the response have been as helpful?) Also drawing critical fire is Pete Buttigieg’s Transportation Department, which on Tuesday ordered the grounding of all private drones in the North Carolina flood zone — even though drones have been delivering insulin, baby formula and other crucial supplies to isolated flood victims. Apparently, people are supposed to wait for official help: Tell that screaming infant to be patient. But don’t expect any of this to rise to the PR disaster that Hurricane Katrina proved for the George W. Bush administration: Too much of the media is running interference for Harris ahead of Election Day. Even if another hurricane hits hard and Mayorkas has to explain there’s no money left to help, we’re sure Harris & Co. will find some way to insist it’s Donald Trump’s fault.","summary":"The next Americans to get slammed by the Harris-Biden border disaster: hurricane victims!","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/opinion/sorry-hurricane-victims-harris-biden-already-spent-your-relief-funds-on-migrants/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/HHU1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:51:04","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.66},{"id":258398054,"title":"Filmmakers of ‘No Other Land’ Return to West Bank and Israel Amid Escalating Middle East Violence","text":"EXCLUSIVE: The Israeli and Palestinian directors of No Other Land, the award-winning documentary set in the West Bank, are abandoning a U.S. tour and heading home as violence explodes in the region. Basel Adra, Yuval Abraham, and Rachel Szor cut short what was to have been a month-long visit. (Fellow director Hamdan Billal stayed back in the West Bank and didn’t make the U.S. trip). Adra, a Palestinian from the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta, and Abraham, a Jewish Israeli from the city of Be’er Sheva in Southern Israel, participated in a Q&A at the New York Film Festival last Sunday. They were to have taken part in a second Q&A Tuesday night, hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israel in apparent retaliation for Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. That attack, coupled with Israel’s ground invasion of Southern Lebanon, prompted the filmmakers to give up plans to attend the Woodstock Film Festival, AFI Fest in Los Angeles, and SFFILM’s Doc Stories in San Francisco. In an exclusive interview with Deadline before they headed to the airport, the filmmakers explained how they arrived at their decision. “I spoke with my parents, Basel spoke with his, and we’re very much afraid and worried for their safety,” Abraham said. “Just in the past 24 or 48 hours, things escalated again very dramatically. Eight Israelis were killed in Jaffa. More than 70 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, and in Basel’s community in Masafer Yatta, [Jewish] settler attacks began escalating again; Iran’s missiles — which killed a Palestinian from Gaza in the West Bank. And we were worried that we will be stuck in the United States, that we won’t be able to even get back.” Abraham added, “At the end of the day, we are activists and our purpose in life is to be there and to work for change from there. So, it felt like the right thing to do, and I guess above all else is to be with the people we love.” As an Israeli, Abraham can fly into Ben Gurion International Airport, located between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. However, Palestinians require special permission to do so; for that reason, Adra is flying to Amman, Jordan and will attempt to reach his West Bank home from there. Adra described his priority once he reaches Masafer Yatta: “Being with family and [doing] the work that we do, being in the field with the families, with the people. For me, at least in my area, be with those who face settlers, soldiers’ violence as well.” No Other Land, winner of the top prize for documentary at the Berlin Film Festival, provides a ground-level view of what it’s like to live day to day in Masafer Yatta, a collection of 19 hamlets in a mountainous area south of Hebron. For two decades, Palestinians in Masafer Yatta have fought a decree from the Israeli government ordering them off their land to make way for an Israel Defense Forces live-fire training ground. The expulsion order, one of the largest since the 1967 war, was upheld by Israel’s supreme court in 2022. The film shows the IDF demolishing Palestinian homes, a school, and sealing up a well as part of the expulsion. The film also explores the perhaps unlikely friendship between Adra and Abraham, who have spent years in common cause to highlight the reality of life for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. But it also shows the different circumstances in which they live; as a Palestinian, Adra is subject to Israeli military law and faces restrictions on his movements; Abraham, as a Jewish Israeli, can move freely and lives under civilian law. In a statement signed by Adra, Abraham, and Szor announcing their decision to shorten their U.S. trip, the filmmakers described No Other Land as “both a document of a war crime happening now in the occupied West Bank, and a plea for a different future, one without occupation and oppression, one which is based on empathy, respect for international law, and true security and equality between Palestinians and Israelis. It has never been more urgent.” Yuval expanded on the film’s themes in conversation with Deadline. “It’s very much about the West Bank and the military occupation in the West Bank, but still, we believe as a [filmmaking] collective of Palestinians and Israelis, that the only way forward is a political solution… Especially with regards to the relations between Israelis and Palestinians, it is not something sustainable that you have millions of people who cannot vote, who are living under a foreign military rule. And this has been going on for decades, much before October 7th.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised retaliation for Iran’s missile strike. “Iran made a big mistake tonight — and it will pay for it,” he said following the launch of upwards of 200 missiles. Abraham ascribed cynical motives to Netanyahu’s decision to expand hostilities into Lebanon, as well as his continued prosecution of the war in Gaza, following the Hamas terror attack on Israel almost one year ago. “This, in my mind, is Netanyahu’s attempt basically to remain prime minister for a very long time,” Abraham said. “It has been clear that if the war [in Gaza] ends and there’s a ceasefire, there will be elections and he will not remain prime minister. He knows that the more time that passes from October 7th, the more the Israeli public will — and it’s already happening — forget or forgive him for the big security collapse on his part [of October 7th].” Abraham further alleged, “I also think he has an interest, honestly, to try to create a context in the United States where it’s more likely that Donald Trump will be elected [president] and the more the U.S. is dragged into the escalation, the more likely it is that people in swing states will not vote for Kamala Harris.” The filmmaker also faulted the Biden administration for failing to use its leverage to interrupt fighting in Gaza, where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since last October, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hamas continues to hold dozens of hostages seized on October 7th and has not released the bodies of 39 more who are believed to have died in captivity. “I don’t think they [the Biden administration] took forceful action to actually enforce those ceasefires,” Abraham said, referring to fitful efforts to mediate between Israel and Hamas. He maintains the White House should push for an end to the killing of civilians and press for a political settlement to hostilities. “I think the United States foreign policy is not helping it happen.” Adra said international focus on the widening conflict has obscured frightening developments in the West Bank. He told Deadline Israeli settlers and troops are ramping up violent assaults on Palestinians. “In Area C, such as Masafer Yatta, many Palestinians were shot to death by Israeli settlers and during pogroms where they come to burn homes, properties, attacking people and killing Palestinians. In my specific village, on October 13th — it’s in a video in the movie — a settler and one soldier and another settler enter my community and shot my cousin in the stomach after that Friday prayer,” he said, adding, “[People in] six communities in my area fled from their homes because of settlers, soldiers’ attacks.” No Other Land will open at Film at Lincoln Center on November 1 for an exclusive one-week run. However, it does not have formal U.S. distribution, despite winning awards at film festivals around the world, from Berlin to CPH:DOX, Sheffield DocFest, Millennium Docs Against Gravity, Visions du Réel and more. “We have very strong distribution all over Europe and Southeast Asia, and I think it’ll be a very big pity that the U.S. audience, the millions of people living in the states who are, for us at least, one of the most important target audiences that we believe should watch the film, will not get a chance to do so if there will not be strong distribution,” Abraham said. “We are still hopeful that this will happen… We are in touch with several distributors. Nothing is now yet concrete, but there are conversations happening.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The Israeli and Palestinian directors of No Other Land, the award-winning&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Filmmakers of &#8216;No Other Land&#8217; Return to West Bank and Israel Amid Escalating Middle East Violence first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/filmmakers-of-no-other-land-return-to-west-bank-and-israel-amid-escalating-middle-east-violence/","image":"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2175531087.jpg?w=300","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:49:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.186},{"id":258398404,"title":"Tranh luận trước bầu cử Mỹ bất ngờ ‘đổi gió’","text":"Hai ứng viên phó tổng thống Mỹ có cuộc tranh luận về hàng loạt vấn đề căng thẳng trước thềm bầu cử, nhưng tránh những lời côn.g kíc.h cá nhân. Nhiều khán giả theo dõi cuộc tranh luận sáng 2.10 (giờ VN) đã bất ngờ trước thái độ ôn hòa và thân thiện giữa 2 ứng viên phó tổng thống Mỹ, gồm Thượng nghị sĩ bang Ohio JD Vance (đảng Cộng hòa) và Thống đốc bang Minnesota Tim Walz (đảng Dân chủ). Hai ứng viên tập trung tranh luận các vấn đề chính sách và tránh những màn côn.g kíc.h cá nhân như từng diễn ra trong cuộc tranh luận giữa cựu Tổng thống Donald Trump và Phó tổng thống Kamala Harris hồi tháng trước. Có gì trong màn tranh luận của phó tướng Harris-Trump Hòa nhã nhưng quyết liệt Ông Walz đến từ bang Minnesota còn ông Vance đến từ bang Ohio, đều thuộc vùng trung tâm nước Mỹ vốn tự hào về thái độ lành mạnh và thân thiện, theo Reuters. Mỗi người đều đem lại một sự đa dạng về địa lý cho ứng viên tổng thống của đảng mình, với ông Trump đến từ Bờ Đông còn bà Harris đến từ Bờ Tây. Ông Vance và ông Walz (phải) bắt tay nhau tại cuộc tranh luận. ẢNH: AFP Tuy nhiên, quan điểm của 2 ứng viên tổng thống đã phủ bóng lên cuộc tranh luận của 2 “phó tướng”, khi ông Walz chỉ trích rằng ông Trump là “mối đ.e dọ.a đối với nền dân chủ và không phù hợp để lãnh đạo Mỹ trên trường quốc tế”. Trong khi đó, ông Vance chỉ trích bà Harris về những vấn đề kinh tế và nhập cư lậu. Theo tờ Politico, 2 ứng viên phó tổng thống dành phần lớn thời gian trong cuộc tranh luận 90 phút được tổ chức bởi Đài CBS News để bảo vệ ứng viên tổng thống của đảng mình. Về vấn đề nhập cư, ông Vance bảo vệ những chính sách biên giới của ông Trump, trong khi ông Walz chỉ trích vị cựu tổng thống về việc chỉ xây chưa đến 2% bức tường biên giới với Mexico khi đương nhiệm. Về kinh tế, ông Vance ca ngợi thành tích ông Trump trong việc tăng lương và giảm lạm phát, đồng thời chỉ trích bà Harris về kinh tế. Về y tế, 2 ứng viên tranh cãi về đạo luật Chăm sóc sức khỏe hợp túi tiề.n và chi phí thuố.c kê toa. Về đối ngoại, họ thay phiên nhau đổ lỗi cho đảng của đối phương về việc làm xấu đi sự bất ổn toàn cầu. Ông Trump kêu gọi luận tội và truy tố bà Harris Tiếp tục tranh cãi Sau cuộc tranh luận, ông Trump khen ông Vance thể hiện tốt và “chúng ta sẽ làm nước Mỹ vĩ đại trở lại”. Tờ Independent dẫn thông cáo do chiến dịch tranh cử của đảng Cộng hòa đưa ra cho rằng ông Vance đã “phác thảo một cách ngắn gọn kế hoạch Trump – Vance nhằm khôi phục sự thịnh vượng, an toàn và an ninh cho người dân Mỹ sau 4 năm bị hủy hoại dưới tay bà Harris”. Về phía đảng Dân chủ, chiến dịch Harris – Walz ra thông cáo đề nghị ông Trump tranh luận lần 2 với bà Harris. “Sự lựa chọn mà người dân Mỹ phải đối diện vào tháng 11 đã được thể hiện đầy đủ vào đêm nay, giữa việc vạch ra một con đường mới để tiến về phía trước, hoặc quay lại. Phó tổng thống Harris tin rằng người dân Mỹ xứng đáng được chứng kiến bà và ông Trump lên sân khấu tranh luận thêm một lần nữa”, theo thông cáo. Ngoài ra, thông cáo cho rằng ông Walz đã thể hiện sự tương phản trong tranh luận, khi là “một người nói thẳng, tập trung vào việc chia sẻ các giải pháp thực tế, trước một chính trị gia đã dành cả đêm để bảo vệ sự chia rẽ và những thất bại của ông Trump”. Trong động thái phản ứng, ông Trump nói rằng bà Harris đưa ra đề nghị tranh luận một lần nữa “vì họ thua cuộc thật tồi tệ trong đêm nay”. “Nó giống như một võ sĩ thua cuộc, đứng dậy và nói rằng mình muốn đấu lại. Tôi đã đán.h bại (Tổng thống Joe) Biden, sau đó tôi đán.h bại bà ấy và tôi không định làm lại điều đó”, ông Trump viết trên mạng xã hội Truth Social. Bầu cử Mỹ: Các bang chiến địa vẫn chưa rõ ủng hộ bà Harris hay ông Trump Liên quan cuộc tranh luận Walz – Vance, Đài CNN dẫn khảo sát với sự tham gia của 574 cử tri cho thấy 48% đán.h giá ông Walz đề cập nhiều hơn đến những nhu cầu và vấn đề phải giải quyết. Theo một khảo sát khác của CBS News với sự tham gia của 1.630 cử tri, đa số đều cho rằng cuộc tranh luận diễn ra tích cực. Khoảng 42% cho rằng ông Vance thắng trong tranh luận, trong khi tỷ lệ này dành cho ông Walz là 41%. Khảo sát có biên độ sai sót 2,7 điểm phần trăm. Ông Trump lo bầu cử bị tác động Tờ The Hill ngày 2.10 dẫn lời nhóm luật sư của cựu Tổng thống Trump cáo buộc Công tố viên đặc biệt Jack Smith đang cố gắng tác động cuộc bầu cử tổng thống, khi tìm cách đưa ra những lờ.i kha.i và bằng chứng mới liên quan vụ án âm mưu lật ngược kết quả bầu cử năm 2020. Ông Trump đã bác bỏ mọi cáo buộc trong vụ án và cho rằng cần phải biên tập thêm nội dung trong văn bản của ông Smith. Trước đó vào tháng 8, ông Smith ra cáo trạng mới, truy tố ông Trump trong vụ án. Đến ngày 26.9, ông Smith chuyển đến tòa án một văn bản về những vấn đề pháp lý và bằng chứng mới. Dự kiến Thẩm phán Tanya Chutkan sẽ quyết định việc có công khai văn bản này hay không.

In a video posted to her X account on Thursday morning, the former first lady defended women's \"individual freedoms\" to do what they want with their bodies. \"Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,\" she said in the video. \"Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?\" The video appears to confirm excerpts of her self-titled memoir reported by The Guardian on Wednesday. The former fist lady's views conflict with the GOP's anti-abortion platform and with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. In her memoir, she argues that the decision to end a pregnancy should be left to a woman and her doctor, \"free from any intervention of pressure from the government\", according to the published excerpts. \"Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?\" she wrote, according to The Guardian. \"A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.\" Melania Trump writes that she has \"carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life\". Ms Trump has rarely publicly expressed her personal political views and has been largely absent from the campaign trail. Last week, she sat down with Fox for her first interview in more than two years. Abortion rights a key election issue Democrats have blamed the former president for the severe deterioration of reproductive rights as abortion bans were implemented in large swaths of the country following the overturning of the landmark case, which had granted a constitutional right to abortion. The national anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America denounced the former first lady's views on abortion, including her comments on abortion later in pregnancy, but said their \"priority is to defeat Kamala Harris\". \"Women with unplanned pregnancies are crying out for more resources, not more abortions,\" the organisation's president Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement to the AP. \"We must have compassion for them and for babies in the womb who suffer from brutal abortions.\" Vice-President Kamala Harris's campaign noted Trump's role in ending Roe v Wade in a statement reacting to Melania Trump's defence of abortion rights. \"Sadly for the women across America, Mrs Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. \"Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.\" Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject. Abortion rights advocates are sceptical, however, saying Trump cannot be trusted not to restrict reproductive rights. Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday about Melania Trump's book or video. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the memoir was another example of \"the Trumps playing voters like a fiddle\". \"As president, [Trump] made it his mission to get Roe v Wade overturned,\" she said in a statement. \"Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue. Read between the lines.\" Democratic strategist Brittany Crampsie told the Associated Press the memoir's release was a \"clear attempt to appeal to more moderate voters and to moderate JD Vance's very clearly extreme views on the issue\". But she is sceptical that the move would work in favour of Trump, saying his shifting views \"have already confused voters and sowed distrust\". Melania Trump also defends abortions later in pregnancy, asserting that \"most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother,\" she writes. \"These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor.\" While her husband, who has often parroted misinformation about abortions later in pregnancy, falsely claiming that Democrats support abortion \"after birth\", though infanticide is outlawed in every state. Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who focuses on reproductive rights law and history, said it was unclear if the memoir's release so close to the election was an attempt to help Donald Trump. Donald Trump promoted his wife's book at a September rally in New York, calling on supporters to \"go out and get her book\". It is unclear if the former president has read the book. \"Go out and buy it,\" he told the crowd. \"It's great. And if she says bad things about me, I'll call you all up, and I'll say, 'Don't buy it.'\" Opinion polls consistently show that a large majority of Americans support abortion rights.

The English singer-songwriter, 37, was among those in attendance at the star-studded bash in London on Thursday. Ellie showed off her ample cleavage in a daring linger-inspired ensemble, consisting of a black sheer corset bodysuit with a striped skirt attached. She paired the look with a Venezian-style mask and a pair of platform heels, with her blonde locks left down in natural waves. Meanwhile Smile singer Lily, 39, donned an equally daring outfit as she arrived in a see-through white lace strapless gown, complete with a boned corset, floral appliques and a silver belt. Ellie Goulding put on a very racy display as she joined Sienna Miller and Lily Allen at the Chiltern Firehouse 10th anniversary party on Thursday Meanwhile Smile singer Lily, 39, donned an equally daring outfit as she arrived in a see-through white lace strapless gown Lily finished off her look with a pair of silver stilettos and carried a clutch bag to match her gown, sweeping her red locks into an updo. Actress Sienna, 42, was another star in attendance who opted for a sheer look exposing her underwear. Sienna looked chic in a see-through black transparent kimono-style gown, which had a gold sequined bra design. Visible under the dress was a pair of thigh-high leather boots and black briefs, as the star carried leather bag with a gold ring handle and covered her eyes with a sequin mask. Idris Elba's wife Sabrina also stepped out for the evening, in a far more conservative ensemble. The Canadian model, 35, looked effortlessly chic in navy belted blazer dress with sheet tights and stilettos.

I did not as vice president. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to open up more fracking leases,\" she added, referencing her role as vice president in getting the so-called Inflation Reduction Act through the deadlocked Senate. In 2020, Harris was asked about fracking during her vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, but did not reveal a reversal of her stated 2019 opposition to fracking, instead simply saying that Biden would not ban fracking as president. \"Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that,\" Harris said. \"I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact,\" she added during another portion of the debate. CNN FACT CHECKER HITS KAMALA HARRIS FOR CLAIMING SHE 'MADE CLEAR' IN 2020 SHE WOULDN'T BAN FRACKING On Tuesday, Harris said, \"My perspective on this is grounded in a number of things, including that we don't have to ban fracking to do the work that we can do to also invest in a clean energy economy.\" She then made multiple promises to American voters. \"I'm going to bring jobs back to rural communities. I'm going to make sure that we invest in those communities that have done the kind of work that you have in mind when you talk about Pittsburgh, when you talk about the greater aspect of Pennsylvania,\" she pledged. \"And I'm going to keep doing that work.\" \"That's where I stand, period.

Trump leads in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.Silver noted in Thursday's Silver Bulletin that the election is in \"a steady phase,\" and that recent surveys have not found significant changes in the candidates' prospects for victory. Per the pollster's forecast, Harris has a 56.7 percent chance of winning the necessary 270 electoral votes in November, while Trump trails with 43.1 percent.Below is a breakdown of how each swing state has shifted over the past week, according to Silver's model.ArizonaTrump continues to hold a slight lead in the Grand Canyon State, and polling over the past week has also gone in his favor.Per Silver's tracking, Arizona shifted by 0.1 percentage points in Trump's direction since September 26. The former president has improved by 0.6 percentage points overall in the past month.FiveThirtyEight's tracker finds Trump ahead in Arizona by 1.2 percentage points on average across statewide polling as of Thursday. By Silver's tracking, Trump is up by 1.1 percentage points (48.6 percent to 47.5 percent).PennsylvaniaIn the Keystone State, which Silver finds has the highest chance of tipping the election out of any swing state, Harris holds onto a small lead of 1.3 percentage points (48.8 percent to 47.5 percent) on average. But over the past week, Silver's tracking finds that Pennsylvania polls have shifted by a slim margin, 0.2 percentage points, toward Trump.FiveThirtyEight's polling averages find Harris leading Pennsylvania by just 0.8 points as of Thursday. As Newsweek previously reported, that average is a slight dip for Harris, who on September 3 was leading in Pennsylvania by 1 percentage point.GeorgiaThe race in the Peach State has not budged over the past week, per Silver's tracking, with Trump still leading by 1 percentage point (48.8 percent to 47.8 percent) as of Thursday.The former president has seen positive shifts in Georgia over the past month, however, with Silver finding the state shifting by 2 points in Trump's favor since the start of September.Similarly, tracking from FiveThirtyEight shows that Georgia has flipped over the past month. While Harris led by 0.3 points on average September 3, as of Thursday, Trump is up by 1.2 points on average.MichiganThe Great Lakes State is among Harris' best-performing swing states, per Silver's forecast, with the vice president ahead by 2 percentage points on average as of Thursday's update. Over the last week, however, Trump has improved by 0.3 percentage points across polling.Per FiveThirtyEight's tracking, the state of play in Michigan has been relatively steady over the past month. While Harris is up by 1.6 percentage points as of Thursday, on September 3, she led the race by 1.8 points.NevadaSilver's tracking also finds Harris holding a steady lead in the Silver State, where the vice president is up by 1.8 points on average. The past week of polling has also shown a bump in Harris' direction by 0.8 points, and Silver finds that Harris has improved by 1 point overall in Nevada since the start of September.FiveThirtyEight's tracking finds that Harris is up by 1.1 percentage points on average as of Thursday in Nevada. In comparison, on September 3, she was up by 0.5 percentage points.North CarolinaThe tightest race among the seven swing states is the Tar Heel State, where Trump is ahead by just 0.4 percentage points on average, according to Thursday's Silver Bulletin.Harris has also seen some positive signs over the past week, with polls shifting by 0.1 percentage points in her favor since September 26, per Silver's tracking.North Carolina has the chance of becoming a tipping-point state in November. Trump won there in 2016 and 2020, although the gap in the race has been neck-and-neck since Harris launched her campaign.Per FiveThirtyEight's tracker, Trump is up by just 0.5 percentage points in North Carolina as of Thursday. The past month has seen virtually no changes, with Trump leading by 0.6 points in the state on September 3.WisconsinSilver's tracking finds that Harris also holds one of her best leads in the Badger State, where the vice president is up by 2 percentage points on average.Over the past week, however, polling has slightly shifted toward Trump, by 0.2 points, per the Silver Bulletin. Since the start of September, Trump has improved by 1.2 percentage points in Wisconsin.FiveThirtyEight's tracker finds that Harris was up by 2.8 percentage points on September 3 across statewide polling. As of Thursday, her lead has been cut to 1.7 points.","summary":"The overall race for the White House remains \"steady,\" Silver wrote in Thursday's forecast update.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silvers-swing-state-forecast-shows-new-movement-1963629","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2487234/nate-silvers-latest-swing-state-forecast.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:15:30","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.02},{"id":258396762,"title":"The massive U.S. port strike is ending just days after it started","text":"A sweeping strike by tens of thousands of U.S. dockworkers came to a quick close late Thursday, with their union saying they would be back on the job Friday as they near an agreement with port operators and shipping companies. About 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) had walked out of ports across the East and Gulf Coasts early Tuesday, after months of negotiations with companies, terminal operators, and port associations represented by the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) did not lead to agreement on a new contract. The ILA said in a statement late Thursday that workers and USMX had “reached a tentative agreement on wages” and agreed to extend their previous contract until Jan. 15 “to return to the bargaining table to negotiate all other outstanding issues.” The effects of the strike had threatened to be far-reaching, causing ripple effects in industries that rely on materials such as steel and lumber and raising new economic fears just weeks before the 2024 presidential election comes to a close. The ILA has said workers are demanding higher wages that would compensate them for their contributions to “enriching their employers and the industry” and a salary that addresses the rising inflation that “eats away” at their current salary levels. Workers have also been pushing for protection against automation and new technology devices in terminals. Had it stayed in effect, the strike was likely to have major consequences for the broader U.S. economy. Just about every industry relies on major ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to deliver shipments of equipment, food, and supplies each day. Ports and facilities handling approximately 51% of the nation’s overall port capacity are affected by the walkouts, according to the Mitre Corporation.

In an unprecedented joint appearance with the former House GOP conference chair in Ripon, Wisconsin — the where the Republican Party was first formed more than 150 years ago — Harris said upholding the US constitution should be a “basic requirement” for seeking and holding the highest office in the United States. And citing Trump’s efforts to block the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election four years ago, she warned that Trump “must never again, stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.” “The tragic truth that we are facing in this election for President of the United States is that there is actually an honest question about whether one of the candidates will uphold the oath to the Constitution of the United States,” she said. “I know the vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land. I know the vast majority of us, regardless of your political party, agree we must hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power,” Harris said. “If you share that view, no matter your political party, there is a place for you with us and in this campaign, because those principles I know unite us across party lines, and in this election, I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans,” she added. Harris promised that as president, she would not “not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self interest,” nor would she view America as “an instrument for [her] own ambitions” or “some spoil to be won.” “The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised, the nation that inspired the world to believe in the possibilities of a representative government. And so in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment, people of every party must stand together,” she said. Harris took the stage to the strains of Beyonce’s “Freedom” after a rousing introduction from Cheney, the daughter of a Republican vice president and a lifelong member of the GOP. Cheney, who recalled how she’d first voted for a Republican presidential candidate when she cast a ballot for Ronald Reagan in the 1984 election, told the crowd in Ripon that this year, she is “proudly casting [her] vote” for Harris because the Democratic vice president is “standing in the breach at a critical moment in our nation’s history” and “working to unite reasonable people from all across the political spectrum.” “Vice President Harris has dedicated her life to public service. I know, I know that she loves our country, and I know that she will be a president for all Americans, as a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause,” she said. The former Wyoming congresswoman, who served as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the January 6 attack of the Capitol that Trump fomented after he lost the 2020 election, said the American republic “faces a threat unlike any we have faced before” in the GOP’s presidential candidate, “a former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our Republic, by refusing to accept the lawful results —confirmed by dozens of courts — of the 2020 election.” “We cannot turn away from this truth in this election,” she said. “Putting patriotism ahead partisanship is not an aspiration — is our duty.” Cheney added that the “peaceful transfer of power” that Trump attempted to subvert is “at the very heart of our survival as a republic.” “Donald Trump was willing to sacrifice our capitol to allow law enforcement officers to be beaten and brutalized in his name and to violate the law and the Constitution in order to seize power for himself. I don’t care if you are a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent, that is depravity, and we must never become numb to it,” she said. “Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again.” Continuing, she said of the former president: “He is petty, he is vindictive, and he is cruel, and ... is not fit to lead this good and great nation. The joint appearance by Harris and Cheney is the latest expression of the Harris-Walz campaign’s effort to rally Republicans and republican-leaning voters who’ve become disillusioned with the direction of the Party of Lincoln in the age of Donald Trump. The campaign has been organizing a formal “Republicans for Harris” effort for months, and has thus far been successful at organizing high-profile endorsements for the vice president from members of the GOP. Not one of the living former Republican vice presidents has endorsed Trump’s re-election bid, and Cheney’s own father — former vice president Dick Cheney — has formally endorsed Harris, calling Trump the greatest threat the American republic has faced from any individual. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he said. Other former Republican elected officials who have endorsed Harris include former Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, who served with Liz Cheney on the House January 6 committee, and former Republican senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. But the ranks of former GOP diehards who’ve thrown support behind Harris goes beyond former elected officials. In September, more than 200 former staffers for Republican presidential candidates — including former presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush, Utah Senator Mitt Romney and the late Arizona Senator John McCain — issued an open letter calling on “moderate Republicans and conservative independents” to join them in backing the Democratic candidate against Trump, calling the ex-president’s potential return to the White House “simply untenable.” Numerous officials who served in the Trump administration have endorsed Harris or have declined to endorse Trump’s third bid for the presidency on the grounds that he is unfit to serve because of his disregard for the US constitution. At the only debate between Trump and Harris in September, two top Trump White House officials — ex-communications director Anthony Scaramucci and former vice presidential homeland security adviser Olivia Troye served as surrogates for the vice president.","summary":"Cheney is one of the hundreds of prominent Republicans who are backing Harris over Donald Trump this year","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-wisconsin-cheney-endorsement-b2623595.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/04/00/AP24277827554843.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:08:18","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.313},{"id":258396076,"title":"Top Justice Dept. official warns of \"onslaught\" of foreign election interference","text":"Just 33 days ahead of the election, a top Justice Department official is warning of an \"onslaught of foreign election interference\" from Russia, Iran and China. Matthew Olsen, head of the department's National Security Division, said in an interview with CBS News that the U.S. is facing a multi-pronged offensive from the three nations. Among the lines of attack is a barrage of propaganda from Russia to sow division in a highly polarized U.S. electorate, persistent cyber-intrusions into the campaigns of both former President Donald Trump and Vice president Kamala Harris, and a \"grave\" Iranian assassination plot targeting Trump. \"They see this as a period of vulnerability for us,\" Olsen told CBS Evening News Anchor and Managing Editor Norah O'Donnell. \"They are looking at ways at which they can change the outcome of our election, or to find issues that divide us in ways that support their national interests at the expense of ours.\"Olsen's comments are expected to be the Justice Department's last word on the subject of election interference, honoring a policy of refraining from public statements in the 30 days before an election to avoid influencing the outcome. In a wide-ranging interview, he characterized the threats as \"sophisticated,\" utilizing advanced technology \"to target our politics.\" In Russia, he says malicious actors are leveraging artificial intelligence to manufacture content, such as fake videos of the vice president meant to spread disinformation. Moreover, he said, Moscow has upped its game in another way –laundering Kremlin talking points through U.S.-based social media influencers who have large online followings.Olsen described a brazen effort by Russia to help Trump win the election. \"What we're seeing with Russia is clearly a preferred outcome,\" Olsen said. \"Russia has been seeking to boost the candidacy of the former president and to denigrate the candidacy of the vice president.\"Contrary to messaging from the Trump campaign, which has consistently disputed reports of Kremlin interference, Olsen said the Russian initiative was real in 2016, and is even more robust now.\"Russian interference in the [2016] election was not a hoax. It was actually happening then. It is actually happening now,\" Olsen said. \"There is no question about it.\" Olsen said the intelligence and law enforcement communities learned a lesson from 2016, when officials were highly protective of the intelligence indicating the Russians were aggressively meddling in the election. This cycle they made a conscious decision to be far more transparent with the public. \"We've learned at the Justice Department, but this especially true for the intelligence community, and that is to be as open and transparent as we possibly can about the nature of the threat,\" Olsen said. In September, the Justice Department seized 32 internet domains they say Russia used as part of their \"doppelganger\" online campaigns aimed at influencing elections worldwide, including the upcoming presidential election here in the U.S. Olsen pointed to the case as an example of ways the department is working to \"dismantle the infrastructure\" of Russia's propaganda operation. The seizure targeted Russian entities, including the Social Design Agency (SDA), which since 2022 has allegedly been responsible for coming up with the propaganda strategy that included impersonating legitimate news entities, like Fox News or the Washington Post.\"They created these fake websites. They look very real,\" Olsen said. \"It is hard for the average American to understand the sophistication of these efforts. But that's why we're trying to be as transparent as possible about the nature of the threat.\"Olsen pointed to a specific case brought by the Justice Department where they uncovered \"talking points\" of people \"at the highest level of the Kremlin, people within [Vladimir Putin's] inner circle\" who have stated their goal of Trump prevailing. Olsen said that in addition to its goal of bolstering Trump's campaign, Russia is closely focused on sowing division among American voters on hot-button issues. Chief among them is the war in Ukraine, where Moscow is intent on diminishing popular support among Americans for Ukrainian independence. But Olsen said that the Russians also see domestic issues as ripe targets for its disinformation campaign. He pointed to immigration, one of the most contentious policy fights in the 2024 election. The Russians, he said, are \"highlighting immigration as a wedge issue.\" Russia is not the only country looking to \"sow discord\" ahead of the election. Among the Justice Department's biggest worries, according to Olsen, is credible evidence that Iran wants to \"compromise\" Trump's campaign and is actively plotting to assassinate Trump, something that he says they are monitoring \"with intense focus.\"\"Among the countries in the world, there are few countries that pose the range and significance of threats that Iran does,\" Olsen said, noting that this effort is related to the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by an American airstrike in 2020. \"They are determined to retaliate for Soleimani's killing. And they have targeted U.S. officials who they believe are responsible for that decision.\"In the past few months there were two attempts on former President Trump's life, and in a separate case, a Pakistani national with ties to Iran was charged with allegedly plotting a murder-for-hire scheme targeting current and former U.S. officials –a list that sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News may have included Trump. Olsen declined to comment about whether the government's case against Ryan Wesley Routh, who has been charged with attempting to assassinate the former president at his Florida golf course in September, has any ties to a foreign government, citing the ongoing nature of the case. Routh has pled not guilty. Last month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence briefed Trump on \"real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him.\"As for China, while the volume of activity is less than that coming out of Iran and Russia, their interest in the upcoming election seems more focused on congressional and state office campaigns, where they aim to find candidates who may fall \"more in line with the interests of China,\" rather than the presidential race.Olsen said he hasn't seen any foreign efforts to manipulate voting machines or other election infrastructure. But one of his biggest worries is what happens in the aftermath of the election, particularly given the likely delays in determining the vote results. \"I do think that our adversaries will continue to see this time period as an opportunity for them to shape the outcome of the election or to sow discord within the country,\" Olsen said, warning, \"that is really the biggest issue that I see right now.\"","summary":"In an interview with CBS News, the head of the Department of Justice's National Security Division said the U.S. is facing a multi-pronged offensive from Russia, Iran and China.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-official-warns-foreign-election-interference-russia-iran-china/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/03/569f5658-7026-4bf3-90b1-90dc62fe918a/thumbnail/1200x630/9750c87ee8cd2086254930096eb5a192/ap24079677785156.jpg?v=0736ad3ef1e9ddfe1218648fe91d6c9b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:02:14","author":"Clare Hymes,Daniel Klaidman,Michael Kaplan","authors":["Clare Hymes","Daniel Klaidman","Michael Kaplan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":258395948,"title":"Hundreds of national security officials, ex-Cabinet members, Gold Star families endorse Trump","text":"More than 400 national security and foreign policy officials, ex-Cabinet members, retired military officers and Gold Star families endorsed former President Trump on Thursday.

Rob Rennie Los Gatos Voting for Trump is voting against vets Twice a year, on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, Americans profess gratitude to their veterans and the fallen. The rest of the year … Six times a Vietnam War draft dodger has run for president (Bill Clinton twice, George W. Bush twice, Donald Trump twice) and five times has been elected. Two of these “victories” were over Vietnam veterans (Al Gore and John Kerry). Trump is running again for president. Trump considers all veterans, not just the fallen, to be “losers” and “suckers.” He mocks Gold Star mothers, disrespects POWs, desecrates the hallowed ground at Arlington, and doesn’t want to be seen with the disabled. And Trump may win election this year. America once again will show how it really feels about veterans.

At the time of our founding the state of New York’s much larger population would have elected every president.

But then-President Donald Trump reportedly nearly declined to approve federal aid because of the state’s political makeup. Trump changed his mind, however, after he was shown voter registration data from Orange County where Republicans then had an edge over Democrats, Politico reported. In a phone call Thursday, Mark Harvey, who served as a special assistant to the president for matters related to domestic crisis at the time, confirmed to the Southern California News Group the exchange reported by Politico. The former National Security Council employee is among the more than 100 former Republican national security officials who have backed Vice President Kamala Harris in this election. In all, nearly 2 million acres burned in California in 2018 and 100 people died, according to Cal Fire. While Northern California was impacted the most, Southern California was hit with the Holy fire in August of that year, burning more than 23,000 acres in Orange and Riverside counties and destroying homes and cabins. “We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas … to show him these are people who voted for you,” Harvey told Politico. In October 2018, 541,665 people (34.72%) in Orange County were registered Republican voters, 523,624 (33.56%) were registered Democrats and 429,675 (27.54%) were no party preference. Statewide, however, nearly 8.6 million (43.45%) registered voters in 2018 were Democrats, 5.4 million (27.52%) no party preference and 4.7 million (24.04%) were Republicans. As of Sept. 6, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in Orange County, 37.03% to 33.99%, with 22.77% of voters registered as no party preference. Southern California, and Orange County particularly, is home to multiple tight congressional races this year that will determine which political party controls the House in 2025. A campaign spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Trump has been highly critical of California and its handling of wildfires in 2018. “I think California ought to get their act together and clean up their forests and manage their forests because it’s disgraceful,” Trump said during an August 2018 Cabinet meeting. “So I say to the governor or whoever is going to be the governor of California: You better get your act together,” Trump said. “Because California, we’re just not going to continue to pay the kind of money that we’re paying because of fires that should never be to the extent …” The Washington Post in 2018 reported that the then-president’s response to disasters was “colored in red and blue,” comparing his trips to the Gulf Coast and North Carolina after hurricanes to his criticism of California post wildfires. The report noted that Trump took to social media to criticize what he called California’s “gross mismanagement of the forests,” only acknowledging the victims 14 hours later. After initially angering California officials with his social media response to the fires, Trump ultimately approved an expedited disaster declaration request. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Irvine, called the report about Trump’s initial leanings on disaster relief for California “abhorrent.” “When Orange County needed help, Donald Trump left us to fend for ourselves,” Porter said on X, formerly Twitter. “Our leaders should look out for every person they represent, not just the people who voted for them.” In recent days, Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration, including Harris, for its handling of the destruction in the southeast caused by Hurricane Helene. He has said, without evidence, that the Biden administration and Democratic officials were not helping people in Republican areas. At a rally in Michigan on Thursday, he claimed that the administration had no money to deal with the disaster because it had spent too much on migrants. President Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, lambasted Trump on Thursday. “You can’t only help those in need if they voted for you,” Biden said on X. “It’s the most basic part of being president, and this guy knows nothing about it.” “A glimpse into the future if we elect (Trump),” said an X post from Newsom. Last month, Trump was critical of both the state and federal governments for their handling of the reactivation of an ancient landslide complex on the Palos Verdes Penninsula. Speaking to reporters from his golf course on the cliffs of Ranchos Palos Verdes, Trump said officials were “missing in action” and called California a “mess.”","summary":"The former official, who now supports Vice President Kamala Harris, says Trump changed his mind about aid when he saw the numbers.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/03/trump-reviewed-oc-voter-data-before-approving-california-disaster-aid-in-2018-former-official-says/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OCR-L-TRUMPOC-1004.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:59:43","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":258396070,"title":"Harris eyes Republican voters in Wisconsin with Liz Cheney event","text":"Harris eyes Republican voters in Wisconsin with Liz Cheney event Former President Donald Trump rallied in Michigan a day after a judge unsealed a court filing that gives insight into the federal election interference case against him.

FEMA does, however, have enough money to provide “shelter and services” to illegal aliens. Biden DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose jurisdiction includes both FEMA and the Secret Service, told the press that FEMA’s almost out of cash and won’t be able to make it through this year’s storm season, saying that the government is “expecting another hurricane hitting” and “FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.” The Mayorkas comments came in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which has killed hundreds ranging from Florida to Virginia and has caused billions of dollars in damage and destruction across the Southeastern United States. In response to Hurricane Helene, the federal government has announced that victims who’ve lost everything will receive a one-time check for $750 from the feds, to help with “groceries” and “home repairs.” Many Helene victims are calling the checks a slap in the face, especially when the other things the federal government, specifically FEMA, is spending money on come into focus. According to a July report from the New York Post, a FEMA program for migrants, called Shelter and Services, is pulling in a whopping $650 million per year and recently received a nearly $300 million funding boost. As part of the program, cities across the country are receiving millions of dollars to accommodate illegal aliens and local officials are telling the feds that they need even more money than they’re already getting. According to the New York Post report, city officials and politicians are asking it be funded by as much as $3 billion.” And the FEMA program is just the tip of the iceberg. In all, the Biden Administration has spent more than an estimated $150 billion on America’s border crisis and the mass relocation, sheltering, and servicing of illegal aliens, according to the House Budget Committee. The lackluster Hurricane Helene response from the Biden-Harris federal government, and the revelation that FEMA money that could be helping Americans has been handed to illegals, has given a renewed burst of momentum to the Trump campaign. In a campaign press email, Karoline Leavitt, the Trump Campaign National Press Secretary, was quoted as saying “FEMA has run out of money for the rest of hurricane season because Kamala Harris used the funds for free giveaways to illegal immigrants. This is inexcusable and yet another example of Kamala Harris putting Americans LAST!”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLast Updated on October 3, 2024 With hundreds of Americans dead after&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FEMA is running low on hurricane funding due to open borders first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/fema-is-running-low-on-hurricane-funding-due-to-open-borders/","image":"https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/nyp-600x306.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:58:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.463},{"id":258396850,"title":"ILA ends port strike","text":"The end of the strike was confirmed by ILA Local 1422 President Charles Brave to Live 5 News.

The ports covered by the strikers are responsible for significant parts of the United States supply chain, leading to fears of a supply chain nightmare before the holidays.

The strike was over disagreements in pay and automation.

The Longshoremen, who play a vital role transporting essential goods across America, deserve a fair share of these record profits.” “American workers should be able to negotiate for better wages, especially since the shipping companies are mostly foreign flag vessels, including the largest consortium ONE,” Trump said.

Reached by Fox News Digital, a DOT spokesperson said civilian drone pilots are permitted and are assisting in rescue and recovery efforts, and previous \"temporary flight restrictions\" have since been lifted. Some X users — collectively with millions of followers — reacted adversely to a message addressed to drone pilots and with accompanying video from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg shared by the department earlier this week. The message and video argued the restrictions would prohibit civilian volunteers from legally searching for victims or survivors when response time matters most or capturing their own footage of the disaster. \"The USDOT tweet from yesterday was referring to temporary flight restrictions that were in place but were lifted late last night,\" a DOT spokesperson told Fox News Digital Thursday, citing the FAA. TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED' The spokesperson explained the FAA \"is not banning drones from providing Hurricane Helene disaster relief and recovery assistance.\" \"At times, local authorities and law enforcement request the Federal Aviation Administration issue a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) in order to ensure safety for aircraft or drones operating in certain areas,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"These restrictions occur at the request of local authorities or law enforcement. FAA does not put these into place without requests.\" The spokesperson said such restrictions apply to both manned and unmanned aircraft, or drones. \"With proper authorization, drones (and other aircraft) are permitted to operate within a Temporary Flight Restriction,\" the statement continued. \"These are only for limited areas identified by law enforcement and local authorities. \"Relief operations, including civilian operations and volunteers, that are coordinated with emergency responders can still access the airspace during these restrictions. Anyone looking to use a drone or other aircraft to assist in Hurricane Helene disaster relief and recovery efforts should coordinate with first responders and law enforcement on scene to ensure they do not disrupt life-saving operations.\" The clarification comes after the DOT posted to X Wednesday, writing: \"Drone pilots: Do not fly your drone near or around rescue and recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene. Interfering with emergency response operations impacts search and rescue operations on the ground.\" In an attached video message, Buttigieg said, \"Our goal is to make sure that funding is no obstacle to very quickly getting people the relief that they need and deserve. \"There's also some safety issues that come up. For example, temporary flight restrictions to make sure that the airspace is clear for any flights or drone activity that might be involved in helping to allow those emergency responders to do their jobs.\" The post pointed to the account for FAADroneZone, the Federal Aviation Administration's site for drone activity. \"Interfering with emergency response efforts may result in fines or criminal prosecution,\" FAADroneZone wrote, reposting Buttigieg's remarks. \"Always check Temporary Flight Restrictions before you fly.\" The posts quickly received heavy criticism on social media. \"The statement from Buttigieg comes as the federal government continues to shuffle its feet to help people in need,\" Trending Politics co-owner Collin Rugg wrote to his 1.5 million followers on X.

Thanks to the unending disaster of Harris-Biden policies, even our northern border is no longer secure. Illegal crossings of the Swanton sector, which covers about 200 miles of land between Maine and New York’s St. Lawrence River, stood at 365 in 2021. Now? They’ve hit 19,222, more than the last 17 years combined. That marks a 50-fold increase since Wave ‘Em In Joe and the current Dem nominee for president came into office and obliterated every meaningful measure of border security while beckoning illegals with infinite government support. Overall northern crossings have gone up sixfold, hitting 190,000 in fiscal 2023 — with fiscal 2024 on track to hit that same grim target. It’s obscene. But by far the worst part is that it’s only a drop in the bucket compared to the overall border crisis, which has seen illegals totaling many multiples of this already monstrous figure jump across since Biden took office. Adding to the obscenity is the fact that the Department of Homeland Security brazenly admits that illegal immigrants with terror ties will continue streaming into the country, with some 422 let in through July in the current fiscal year. Almost 300 of these potential terrorists came across the Canadian border. One nearly pulled off a murderous plot: Muhammad Shazeb Khan, a Pakistani legally in Canada on a student visa, who allegedly plotted to cross that border to commit a mass shooting of Jews in celebration of Oct. 7. That plot was foiled, but no thanks to Biden — the man currently charged with protecting Americans from all enemies, both foreign and domestic. Worse, the ugly numbers plainly show it’s a question of when, not if, a terror attack happens as long as Joe, Kamala Harris and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas keep letting millions in no matter how big a risk they present.","summary":"From Canada, would be terrorists are streaming south as illegal crossing jump 50 TIMES -- you read that right -- since Kamala Harris and Joe Biden opened the northern border.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/opinion/kamala-harris-opened-the-northern-border-for-terrorists/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-5znljqzuy-1727995244537.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727980917&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:51:30","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":258395508,"title":"Trump refuses to release medical records as concerns about him being the oldest possible president grow","text":"Since Donald Trump first emerged on the scene of American politics in 2015, he has refused to provide a glimpse into his medical records. If Trump, 78, succeeds in November, he will become the oldest person ever to serve as president, ousting the current record-holder, Joe Biden. When his potential second term ends, he will be 82 years old. Despite his advanced age, Trump has refused to provide any glimpse into his records. When asked about his health in 2015, he provided a four-paragraph letter from his doctor, who claimed he would be the “healthiest person ever elected to the presidency.” Age has already played a major role in the 2024 presidential election; concerns over Biden’s cognitive health culminated with his decision to step away from the race, clearing the path for Vice President Kamala Harris to step up to carry the Democratic banner in November. But Biden’s decision came after his party colleagues collectively expressed their concerns over his health; there are few — if any — calls from prominent Republican leaders asking if Trump has the ability to lead as he approaches 80, and it’s unclear if those calls would deter the former president anyway. What little is known of Trump’s health comes from the 2018 White House physician Ronny Jackson. That year, he provided a glimpse into Trump’s cardiac health, the New York Times reports. According to the doctor, Trump’s blood pressure and an ultrasound of his heart were normal, but he noted concerns that his cholesterol was too high and that he was only 0.1 points below the threshold for medical obesity. According to Jackson’s report, Trump’s cholesterol was 143, despite the fact that he was reportedly taking a drug used to lower high cholesterol levels. At 143, cardiologists openly worried that he might be at risk for a stroke or a heart attack. A year after that report, Trump’s weight increased from 239 to 243, making him medically obese based on his height. His cholesterol fell to 122, which was an improvement but still too high to be considered healthy. The following spring the White House claimed Trump’s LDL had fallen to below 100. Last year, Trump’s weight was listed as 215 when he was booked at the Fulton County jail in Atlanta, but that was a number given by his aides, not an official weight taken from a scale. The last official statement on Trump’s health came in a three-paragraph letter from his new personal doctor, Dr Bruce Aronwald. That letter was sent in November 2023, and praised the former president’s weight reduction, but did not actually state his weight or provide any further details about what medications he takes or if he had taken any tests. It simply said that his blood work was “well within normal range,” and that his health was both “excellent” and “exceptional.” Perhaps more troubling that his physical health is his cognitive health. Trump’s father suffered from Alzheimer’s, which can be passed down through genetics. Trump previously claimed he had “aced” cognitive tests and regularly attacked Biden based on his cognitive performance. While Biden was often criticized for his verbal slips, Trump has shown some of the same issues; he has frequently referred to both Hillary Clinton and Biden as the “Obama administration,” and makes frequent mistakes about people and places. At rallies, he frequently speaks in bizarre non-sequiturs to the point that he has come up with a term he uses to describe his ostensibly intentionally disjointed speaking style, calling it “the weave.” “If there’s one area that needs to be 100 per cent in a chief executive — especially chief executive of the United States — it’s cognitive function,” Anand Kumar, a geriatric psychiatry expert at the University of Chicago, told the Times. Trump received a CT scan after a failed assassination attempt in July left him with a wounded ear, but the results of that test were never made public. It’s not just Trump who has been cagey about his health; Harris has not released any of her basic health information, and Biden regularly brushed off concerns about his health while he was still running for president.","summary":"Trump is nearly 80-years-old, loves steak and Big Macs, was hospitalized with Covid-19, and has been shot, but has maintained his health is fine","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-medical-records-doctor-refuse-b2623586.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/03/19/SEI224101864.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/znuemOAP-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:50:05","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":258395196,"title":"Bruce Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris: Donald Trump is ‘dangerous’ candidate","text":"US singer Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, calling Donald Trump “the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime”.

Biden delivered remarks after surveying the damage in Ray City, Georgia, condemning “rabid partisanship” while defending the federal government’s response efforts. “In moments like this, it’s time to put politics aside,” Biden said. He emphasized the need to unite as Americans during disaster recovery. He said that his administration’s major spending initiatives have benefited red states more than blue states over the last 3.5 years. “Our job is to help as many people as we can. And by the way, when we do that, I hope to break down this rabid partisanship that exists. I mean that sincerely. There’s no rationale for it.” Biden defended rescue efforts, stating that he deployed “extensive resources” before Helene made landfall and approved emergency declarations. Before heading to Georgia, Biden took an aerial tour of Florida’s coast, surveying the flooded areas near the small town of Perry, which is about an hour’s drive from Tallahassee. Later, he took a driving tour of the Keaton Beach community, where the wreckage was severe, including collapsed power lines and demolished homes. The day before, Biden traveled to North and South Carolina, while Vice President Kamala Harris toured Georgia to survey the damage. The White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on the way to Florida that both Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to join Biden’s tour, despite being invited. “I want to thank Governor Kemp, who I spoke with again this morning,” Biden said during his remarks. He made no mention of DeSantis. During Biden’s visit, DeSantis was holding a press conference at Anna Maria Island, which was among the areas hit hard by Hurricane Helene. Since the recovery efforts began, DeSantis has tried to draw a contrast between the state’s response and the federal government’s, saying that the state was able to move much faster. “If you look at how this response went—the prep and the immediate response—this was overwhelmingly state and local, and that’s how we view it,” the Florida governor said during a press conference on Oct. 2. “We don’t want to be waiting on the feds. We want to be able to lean in.” Biden was accompanied on his Florida tour by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). While there, he spoke with first responders and local officials. He received an operational update on response efforts and went on a walking tour. According to the White House, he spoke with a couple who lost their home in the hurricane and are currently living in their RVs parked in their driveway. “We can’t wait. People need help now,” Biden said in response. Johnson also said Congress had already authorized the disaster relief funds needed for the immediate response. In comments made before prepared remarks at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 1, Johnson said the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) relief fund was replenished with the three-month stopgap spending bill that Biden signed into law last week. “Congress has previously provided FEMA with the funds it needs to respond, so we will make sure that those resources are appropriately allocated,” Johnson said. Several lawmakers in states hit by Hurricane Helene are pushing for Congress to return from its October recess to pass additional disaster relief. Congress is not slated to return to Washington until after the November presidential election. More than 50 counties across Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, including land owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, have been designated as major disaster areas by Biden. Recovery efforts at the federal, state, and local levels have been underway for nearly one week. More than $10 million has been provided directly to those affected by Hurricane Helene, the White House said on Oct. 2.","summary":"He emphasized the need to unite as Americans during disaster recovery.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-criticizes-rabid-partisanship-while-touring-hurricane-damage-in-georgia-5734929","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/03/id5734832-GettyImages-2175613039-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:45:02","author":"Emel Akan","authors":["Emel Akan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":258395768,"title":"Judge blocks California law that targeted deepfake campaign ads","text":"With deepfake video and audio making their way into political campaigns, California enacted its toughest restrictions yet in September: a law prohibiting political ads within 120 days of an election that include deceptive, digitally generated or altered content unless the ads are labeled as \"manipulated.\" On Wednesday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the law, saying it violated the 1st Amendment. Other laws against deceptive campaign ads remain on the books in California, including one that requires candidates and political action committees to disclose when ads are using artificial intelligence to create or substantially alter content. But the preliminary injunction granted against Assembly Bill 2839 means that there will be no broad prohibition against individuals using artificial intelligence to clone a candidate's image or voice and portraying them falsely without revealing that the images or words are fake. The injunction was sought by Christopher Kohls, a conservative commentator who has created a number of deepfake videos satirizing Democrats, including the party's presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. Gov. Gavin Newsom cited one of those videos — which showed clips of Harris while a deepfake version of her voice talked about being the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and professing both ignorance and incompetence — when he signed AB 2839, but the measure actually was introduced in February, long before Kohls' Harris video went viral on X. When asked on X about the ruling, Kohls said, \"Freedom prevails! For now.\" The ruling by U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez illustrates the tension between efforts to protect against AI-powered fakery that could sway elections and the strong safeguards in the Bill of Rights for political speech. In granting a preliminary injunction, Mendez wrote, \"When political speech and electoral politics are at issue, the 1st Amendment has almost unequivocally dictated that courts allow speech to flourish rather than uphold the state’s attempt to suffocate it.... [M]ost of AB 2839 acts as a hammer instead of a scalpel, serving as a blunt tool that hinders humorous expression and unconstitutionally stifles the free and unfettered exchange of ideas which is so vital to American democratic debate.\" Countered Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, \"The 1st Amendment should not tie our hands in addressing a serious, foreseeable, real threat to our democracy.\" Weissman said that 20 states had adopted laws following the same core approach: requiring ads that use AI to manipulate content to be labeled as such. But AB 2839 had some unique elements that might have influenced Mendez's thinking, Weissman said, including the requirement that the disclosure be displayed as large as the largest text seen in the ad. In his ruling, Mendez noted that the 1st Amendment extends to false and misleading speech too. Even on a subject as important as safeguarding elections, he wrote, lawmakers can regulate expression only through the least restrictive means. AB 2839 — which required political videos to continuously display the required disclosure about manipulation — did not use the least restrictive means to protect election integrity, Mendez wrote. A less restrictive approach would be \"counter speech,\" he wrote, although he did not explain what that would entail. Responded Weissman, \"Counter speech is not an adequate remedy.\" The problem with deepfakes isn't that they make false claims or insinuations about a candidate, he said; \"the problem is that they are showing the candidate saying or doing something that in fact they didn’t.\" The targeted candidates are left with the nearly impossible task of explaining that they didn't actually do or say those things, he said, which is considerably harder than countering a false accusation uttered by an opponent or leveled by a political action committee. For the challenges created by deepfake ads, requiring disclosure of the manipulation isn't a perfect solution, he said. But it is the least restrictive remedy. Liana Keesing of Issue One, a pro-democracy advocacy group, said the creation of deepfakes is not necessarily the problem. \"What matters is the amplification of that false and deceptive content,\" said Keesing, a campaign manager for the group. Alix Fraser, director of tech reform for Issue One, said the most important thing lawmakers can do is address how tech platforms are designed. \"What are the guardrails around that? There basically are none,\" he said, adding, \"That is the core problem as we see it.\"","summary":"AB 2839 aimed to label AI-generated content in political ads as \"manipulated.\" A federal judge says the law violates the 1st Amendment.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-03/judge-blocks-california-law-that-targeted-deepfake-campaign-ads","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1240b72/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4342x2280+0+308/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Fdf%2F60abe9a848efbd0a5afcd896e004%2F1472058-na-0821-dnc-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:42:22","author":"Jon Healey","authors":["Jon Healey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":258395322,"title":"Donald Trump pledges to prevent states from prohibiting gas-powered vehicles in bid to win over key Michigan voters with auto industry proposal","text":"Former President Donald Trump promised Thursday that no state would be allowed to ban gas-powered cars if he is elected in November. He delivered the pledge during a rally in Saginaw, Michigan, an area that once produced components for Detroit’s auto industry but has fallen on hard times with the decline of American manufacturing. The 78-year-old Republican nominee is seeking to wrest the state back from Democrats and made a series of car-friendly promises to an audience of thousands in a cavernous university sports hall. ‘When I am president no state will be permitted to ban gas powered cars—and I guarantee it,’ he said to cheers of approval. He notably steered clear of his latest legal woes, a federal filing that reveals new evidence of what prosecutors said were his ‘increasingly desperate’ attempts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election. Instead, he set out his economic priorities, including forcing foreign car companies to build models in the U.S. or face punitive tariffs on imports. Trump has railed against efforts by the Biden administration to speed the transition to electric vehicles with a mix of carrots and sticks. And his arch enemy Gavin Newsom, governor of California, has promised to ban the sale of all gas cars and trucks in his state by 2035 and phase them out entirely by 2045. But Trump has recently moderated his opposition to electric vehicles in general, saying that the choice should be left up to consumers. On Thursday, he promised that Michigan’s economy would boom when he had the chance to choke off foreign imports. ‘This is supposed to be the car capital of the world. I call it the lack of car capital,’ he said. ‘It will end up being bigger and better and more beautiful than it was at its height. His claims will likely meet skepticism in Michigan. Analysis by the Detroit News this week revealed that the number of jobs in vehicle and parts manufacturing in Michigan declined during Trump’s first term, according to Department of Labor statistics. And it found that the proportion of U.S. auto production in Michigan fell from 22 percent in 2013 to 14 percent by 2020. In a speech lasting a little under 90 minutes, Trump also hit all his usual talking point an falsehoods: That he won the 2020 election, inflated crowd sizes, that European nations aren’t paying their NATO bills, that there would be no war in Ukraine if he was president. He slammed his rival Kamala Harris, saying she would be devastating to the economy. And he promised to take action on rising prices. ‘Starting on day one of my new administration we will end inflation, and we will make America affordable again, it’s not affordable. They kill you,’ he said. Trump was spending the third of four days in little over a week in what Democrats see as their Mid-West blue wall. After vistiing Wisconsin twice in the past week he is back there again on Sunday for a rally. On Thursday he was on the opposite side of Lake Michigan, in not just a swing state but the swingiest of swing counties. In 2016, Trump claimed Saginaw county by 1.1 percentage points over Hillary Clinton on his way to taking Michigan by only 11,000 votes. It flipped to Joe Biden in 2020 as he went on to win the state back. ‘So goes Saginaw county, so goes Michigan,’ runs a local expression. The area was closely linked to the state’s auto industry. Parts manufactured here would be assembled into cars in Detroit. But the industry’s decline brought decline to Saginaw. A day earlier, Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance was in the area, campaigning on the state of the economy and Michigan’s auto industry.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump promised Thursday that no state would be allowed to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump pledges to prevent states from prohibiting gas-powered vehicles in bid to win over key Michigan voters with auto industry proposal first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-pledges-to-prevent-states-from-prohibiting-gas-powered-vehicles-in-bid-to-win-over-key-michigan-voters-with-auto-industry-proposal/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/03/22/90433413-13918261-image-a-1_1727992363273.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:38:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":258394322,"title":"Trump Refused Disaster Relief Until He Knew It Helped GOP Voters—Ex-Aide","text":"Mark Harvey, ex-aide to former President Donald Trump, said that while in office, Trump initially refused to provide disaster relief for California due to the state's Democratic lean, according to Politico's E&E News.Harvey, senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council during the Trump administration, said in the article published Thursday that the former president only decided to provide relief after Harvey showed Trump that Orange County, ravaged by wildfires in 2018, had a high number of Trump supporters.\"We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas ... to show him these are people who voted for you,\" Harvey told the outlet.A person familiar with the matter told Newsweek,\"There was a consistent pattern of delay that required us to pull together all information we could to help move disaster aid quickly,\" during the Trump administration.In response to the report, Trump campaign manager Steven Cheung told Newsweek in an emailed statement, \"None of this is true and is nothing more than a fabricated story from someone's demented imagination.\"Orange County, just south of Los Angeles, has traditionally been considered more supportive of Republican presidents until the last two election cycles. In 2016, the county backed the Democratic candidate, with 50.9 percent of voters choosing Hillary Clinton versus 42.3 percent for Trump. In 2020, a majority of the county again voted blue, as 53.5 percent of voters backed President Joe Biden, with 44.5 percent supporting Trump.According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, \"The 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record in California, with a total of over 7,500 fires burning an area of over 1,670,000 acres, the largest area of burned acreage recorded in a fire season.\"Harvey recently endorsed Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, and is a critic of Trump, similar to former aide Olivia Troye, who supported Harvey's claims pertaining to the wildfires. Harvey last month signed a letter saying that Trump is \"unfit to serve.\"Troye, who served as White House homeland security adviser during Trump's administration, added that the Republican presidential nominee is politicizing Hurricane Helene, which ravaged the Southeast last week, killing more than 200 people and leaving millions without power.Trump on Monday claimed during a stop in Valdosta, Georgia, which was pounded by Helene, that Governor Brian Kemp was \"having a hard time\" calling Biden on the phone to discuss federal emergency relief.The former president told reporters that he had heard the Biden administration was \"not being responsive\" to requests from Kemp, a Republican who endorsed Trump in November over Harris. But Kemp earlier on Monday had said that he spoke with Biden on Sunday evening on the phone, and that the president was ready to provide Georgia with any aid necessary.\"He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,\" Biden said in response to Trump's comments, according to a pool report from the White House.\"I've spoken to the governor, spent time with him, and he told [Trump] he's lying,\" Biden added. \"I don't know why [Trump] does it ... that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible.\"Biden on Thursday afternoon replied to Politico's E&E article on X, formerly Twitter, writing: \"You can't only help those in need if they voted for you. It's the most basic part of being president, and this guy knows nothing about it.\"Disaster relief funding is at the forefront of political discourse this week, as Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday said there is not enough money available for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to meet the needs of the communities devastated by Hurricane Helene.The funding shortfall has come under scrutiny, as at least $640 million in agency funding has been allocated to assist communities across the country dealing with an influx of migrants.","summary":"Trump initially refused to provide disaster assistance to California in 2018 due to the state's voter makeup, an ex-Trump aide says, as another agrees.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-refused-disaster-relief-until-he-knew-it-helped-gop-votersex-aide-1963600","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2487177/wildfire-2018-california.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:37:08","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":258394402,"title":"Bruce Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris, slams Donald Trump as ‘dangerous’","text":"The Boss is born to vote Democrat. Music legend Bruce Springsteen offered a full-throated endorsement to the Harris-Walz ticket Thursday, in what he called “one of the most consequential elections in our nation’s history.” In a three-minute Instagram endorsement video, the 75-year-old rocker sits at the counter of a New Jersey-esque diner wearing a plaid flannel jacket to offer up praise for Vice President Harris and Gov. Tim Walz — and criticism for President Donald Trump. “Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime,” he began in a takedown of the 2024 GOP candidate, echoing many of liberal cable news’ favorite talking points. “His disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from holding the office of president ever again.” The “Born to Run” singer lamented the deep divisions among Americans today, saying the country hasn’t been as “politically, spiritually and emotionally divided” since the Civil War. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” he added. The New Jersey native rattled off a list of what he believes “makes America great” in addition to its economic and military might, including “freedom, social justice, equal opportunity and the right to be and love who you want.” Springsteen has been a dependable Democratic booster for years, backing John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden before throwing his support behind the 2024 Democratic ticket. “Everybody sees things different and I respect your choice as a fellow citizen. But like you, I’ve only got one vote. And it’s one of the most precious possessions that I have. And that’s why come Nov. 5, I’ll be casting it for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” he concluded. For his part, former President Trump has said on the campaign trail that he’s no big fan of Springsteen, and is seemingly well aware the feeling is mutual. During a speech in Atlanta in August, Trump told the crowd he’s “not a huge fan” of Springsteen, before admitting to having “a bad trait” where “I only like people who like me.”","summary":"Music legend Bruce Springsteen offered a full-throated endorsement to the Harris-Walz ticket Thursday in what he called \"one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/us-news/bruce-springsteen-endorses-kamala-harris-slams-donald-trump-as-dangerous/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/90968766.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:36:45","author":"Chris Nesi","authors":["Chris Nesi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.144},{"id":258394712,"title":"Bruce Springsteen endorses Harris for president","text":"The move didn’t come as much of a surprise.

He has been targeting both immigrants and Kamala Harris. Trump has also criticized the Biden administration’s border strategy, aiming at the undocumented immigrants committing crimes. Last week, while speaking at Trump Tower, Trump claimed that migrants can communicate directly with Harris through a phone app. With this remark, his speech also blamed President Joe Biden and his team for the current migrant issue. As reported by The Independent, Trump said, “In addition through her phone app, something totally new now, it’s a phone app for migrants, where migrants call in. She’s allowed them to press a button and schedule an appointment to be released into the interior of our county.” He also repeated these claims this weekend during his Wisconsin rally speech. As per HuffPost, he said, “They have a phone app, so the people can come into our country. These are smart immigrants, I guess because most people don’t have any idea what the hell a phone app is. But they do, these are very intelligent immigrants.\" In an earlier online statement, Trump vowed to dismantle the controversial phone app he claims is supporting illegal immigration. He took to his Truth Social account and wrote, \"As President, I will immediately end the migrant invasion of America. We will stop all migrant flights, end all illegal entries, terminate the Kamala phone app for smuggling illegals (CBP One App), revoke deportation immunity, suspend refugee resettlement, and return Kamala's illegal migrants to their home countries (also known as remigration).\" As reported by Newsweek, he added, \"I will save our cities and towns in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across America. MAGA2024!\" Trump has relentlessly targeted both Biden and Harris—tasked with handling border affairs—for undermining national security and encouraging illegal immigration. He’s blamed them for building a system that rewards the lawbreakers. Meanwhile, his remarks have drawn intense backlash on the social media platforms. One X user wrote, \"Every reasonable American knows Trump’s lying. However, those attending his rallies take every word he says as the gospel truth. His lies aren’t subtle, they’re blatant & outlandish. How can someone so abhorrent manipulate so many people into trusting him? It is incomprehensible.\" Another X user said, \"He just learned what an app is, now he has to use the word in his conversation to show he is with it.\" A third person said, \"Trump just learned what an app is, so of course he had to invent a conspiracy theory that would allow him to use his new 'word' to impress his ‘sheeple.'\" Trump was reportedly referring to the CBP One app. In 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection implemented it. The topic of immigration and border security is still very important in American politics, and Trump's remarks will undoubtedly draw more attention to it.","summary":"“I will immediately end the migrant invasion of America,” Donald Trump recently claimed.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-bizarrely-suggests-migrants-have-a-phone-app-to-connect-with-kamala-harris","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/718113/uploads/58abc9d0-7f96-11ef-95ad-fd77c11c50b7_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:30:42","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":258394054,"title":"Word games can’t conceal the ‘third world’ truth about open borders","text":"Politically incorrect words don’t kill, but Venezuelan gangs do. Donald Trump this week warned rally-goers in a small Wisconsin community that “if Kamala is reelected, your town and every town . . . will be transformed into a third-world hellhole.” He’s repeatedly said that Biden-Harris open borders are turning New York into a “third world nation” and America into a “third world disaster” — and the rhetoric makes left-wing elites apoplectic. Never mind the violence perpetrated by migrant gangs and the societal disorder caused by open borders: Their problem is with the words. NPR says the term “third world” is “offensive.” Foreign Policy columnist Howard French calls it “utterly racist rhetoric.” It’s an intentional distraction. People watching their neighborhoods being degraded know what they are seeing with their own eyes — and they have no problem calling the conditions as they see them. “We’ve got a third-world country now here in New York City, with third-world crime,” says Republican New York City Councilwoman Vicki Paladino. She estimates that 60% of the arrests in her Queens district involve what she calls “illegal aliens.” Queens resident Ramses Frias, a former Democrat turned Republican, complains that commercial streets have become a “third-world market,” with illegal vendors hawking stolen merchandise and half-naked sex workers strutting in plain sight of children walking to school. Roosevelt Avenue is so overrun with recently arrived hookers that it’s been dubbed the “Market of Sweethearts,” an American copy of Bangkok’s sordid Patpong market. The Trump campaign got backlash for a recent post on X showing side-by-side photos: One of a quiet, clean street lined with single-family homes, the other of hundreds of migrants huddled on the sidewalk outside the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan. “Import the third world. Become the third world,” the caption reads. The NAACP responded sharply: “They are showing us all how racist they are.” No, bedlam is being imported to the area around the hotel, once a Manhattan landmark. Businesses are fleeing. The migrants pictured are mostly black, but commuters of all races dread walking past the chaos to get to Grand Central Station. Trump was tagged a racist for calling migrants who rape and murder “animals” during last Saturday’s campaign stop in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. “Just this month, right here in this beautiful town,” he said, “police arrested an illegal alien, a member of the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Agua” for “holding a woman and her daughter against their will and sexually assaulting them again, and again, and again.” Trump called the alleged assailant “an animal” — not, it should be noted, all migrants. When he used the same word in April to describe the Venezuelan illegal immigrant who raped, bludgeoned and killed Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, Reuters accused Trump of wrongdoing for “resorting to the degrading rhetoric he has employed time and again.” Ridiculous. The issue isn’t Trump’s choice of words. It’s the loss of life caused by Harris’ open border. Similarly, leftist elites turn a blind eye to the impact of prostitution on business owners and families trapped in close proximity to the city’s new brothels, as most Democratic politicians — except Mayor Eric Adams — incredibly align themselves with the sex workers. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortes, whose Queens district is overrun with street prostitution, has insisted in the past that “sex work is work” and generally favors its decriminalization. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, too, supports decriminalization, even as prostitution spreads in his Manhattan district. Kamala Harris backed the idea of legalizing sex work as recently as 2019. A Democratic bill in Albany would decriminalize buying and selling sex, operating a brothel and sex tourism — never mind the impact on existing neighborhoods. “This legislation would make NYC a major sex tourism destination,” says Sonia Osorio of the National Organization for Women, who has documented the explosion of exploitative migrant prostitution. Trump was accused last week by The Washington Post of alarming voters by depicting an “imaginary and frightening world.” Frightening, yes. But not imaginary. Felonies are up 35% in New York City since 2019, and an estimated 75% of arrests in midtown Manhattan for assault and other crimes are illegal migrants. Street sex sells for as little as $50, according to NOW. As early as 2015, Trump insisted that uncontrolled illegal immigration would produce third-world conditions here at home. His dire warnings have now materialized — and we’ll get four more years of this mayhem if Harris is elected president.
