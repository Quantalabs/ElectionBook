I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it’s in my bones. And there are many ways to serve. I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I’m doing right now.”\n\nHarris was also pressed on her political odds in the White House race after bookmakers placed her behind celebrity figures such as actor and former wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.\n\nHarris remained unfazed, saying, “I’ve never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here in this interview.”\n\nHarris became the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024 after Joe Biden dropped out of the White House race following his disastrous debate with Trump, during which he appeared to stumble over his words and lose his train of thought, prompting concerns about his age and fitness for office. Harris went on to face Trump, who soundly defeated her in the November election.\n\nWith the next presidential race three years away, media have speculated that possible Democratic contenders in the 2028 election could include Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAmong Republicans, Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are widely regarded as the most likely key contenders. Trump himself has hinted he might seek a third term, although the US Constitution bars any president from being elected more than twice.","summary":"Kamala Harris has suggested she could “possibly”

the defense of Trump’s new ballroom: ‘A shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere’","text":"The Washington Post’s editorial board has jumped to the defense of President Donald Trump and his $300 million ballroom in its latest op-ed for the newspaper.\n\nJeff Bezos is the owner of the Post and the CEO of Amazon, one of the tech giants that has contributed funds toward Trump’s ballroom, along with Apple, Google, HP, Microsoft and Meta.\n\nTrump’s new project has prompted widespread criticism this week after crews began demolishing the White House’s historic East Wing, contrary to assurances the president made earlier in the year that the building would not be impacted by the lavish plans. \n\nNow it has been razed to the ground to make way for the ballroom, which will dwarf the 55,000 square-foot White House at 90,000 square feet.\n\nWhile the newspaper’s board noted that Trump has pursued the project “in the most jarring manner possible,” it also stated the move was “a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere” in the op-ed published Saturday evening.\n\nThe acronym stands for “not in my back yard” and is often used to describe opposition from local residents over development and real estate projects.\n\nThe Post’s editorial board agrees with Trump’s team that it is “absurd” tents need to be erected on the South Lawn to accommodate larger state dinners where guests are “forced to use porta-potties.”\n\nUnder Trump’s grand plans, the ballroom will seat 999 guests. “The next Democratic president will be happy to have this,” the op-ed read.\n\nThe board also dismissed concerns that Trump has bypassed the usual process required for major federal renovations.\n\n“The truth is that this project would not have gotten done, certainly not during his term, if the president had gone through the traditional review process,” the op-ed said, adding that it has become “far too difficult to build anything in America.”\n\nParroting the defense Trump officials have given this week, the Post’s board closed its case by arguing other presidents also left their mark on the White House.\n\nThere were nearly 700 comments underneath the op-ed within an hour of publication, with many pointing out the apparent conflict of interest.\n\n“Why didn’t you mention that Amazon is a funder of the ballroom?” the top comment on the op-ed said.\n\n“Looks like Jeff Bezos is now writing OpEds for the Post!” another joked.\n\n“Did Jeff Bezos write this?” said another reader.\n\n“I honestly don’t recognize this version of The Post,” someone else commented.\n\nJournalists at the paper expressed concern earlier this year that Bezos is currying favor with Trump by softening the Post’s coverage of him. The backlash began when the Amazon founder blocked the editorial board’s endorsement of then-vice president Kamala Harris just days before the 2024 election.\n\nA quarter-million readers canceled their subscriptions after Bezos pulled the Harris endorsement.\n\nThen, staffers were enraged in February after Bezos announced a shocking new direction for the paper’s opinion content that resulted in a top editor resigning.\n\n“We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” he noted. “We’ll cover other topics too, of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\n\nIt later emerged that Bezos dined with Trump just hours after he unveiled the new mandate, the president revealed in an interview.","summary":"The newspaper’s editorial board argued in an op-ed that other presidents have also left their mark on the White House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bezos-washington-post-defense-trump-ballroom-b2852309.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/24/00/Pictures_of_the_Week_Global_Photo_Gallery_32452.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uLJJBGgb-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-26 00:24:30","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":372585808,"title":"Kamala Harris’ bold presidential plan","text":"The former vice president teased she could launch another campaign in 2028, just days out from marking one year since her loss to Donald Trump.\n\nAsked in a BBC interview if being leader of the free world was still one of her goals, Ms Harris said her grand-nieces would, “in their lifetime, for sure”, see a female president.\n\n“I am not done,” she said, after suggesting she could “possibly” make another bid.\n\n“I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it’s in my bones.”\n\nGet all the latest news from US President Donald Trump and what it means for Australia — download the news.com.au app direct to your phone.\n\nA recent poll showed Harris was not the favourite to run on the Democratic ticket in the 2028 US election.\n\nFormer transportation secretary Pete Buttigeg had 16 per cent of Democratic Party voters while the former VP was behind on 13 per cent.\n\nNext in line was California Governor Gavin Newsom who will step down in 2027 after serving the constitutionally mandated maximum of two terms.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro had five per cent of the votes each, but 23 per cent overall were unsure.\n\nAnother survey in August showed Hollywood actor Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson had more chance of being the Democratic contender in three years’ time.\n\nAsked about the bleak outlook, Ms Harris dismissed the polls.\n\n“I think there are all kinds of polls that will tell you a variety of things, I’ve never listened to polls,” she said in response.\n\n“If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office – and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”\n\nShe added she has not decided what to do next “beyond what I am doing right now”.\n\nMORE: Harris’ secret plan after White House exit exposed\n\nIn the same interview, she took aim at Donald Trump and said she felt vindicated about her comments during the 2024 election, saying the President has been acting like a fascist and running an authoritarian government since he returned for his second term. \n\n“He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice – and he has done exactly that,” the ex vice president to Joe Biden said.\n\n“You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists … His skin is so thin he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process.”\n\nA teaser of the interview – which is set to air in full on Sunday morning (UK time) – saw Ms Harris mocked online after expressing her presidential ambitions.\n\n“They didn’t want her then, nobody wants her now.

She tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join her ticket.\n\n The pair won 48.3% of the popular vote and 226 electoral votes, losing to Trump and his vice presidential pick, JD Vance.\n\n Harris previously announced in July that she would not seek higher office in 2026 after many expected her to run for California governor.\n\n The former vice president and 2024 presidential nominee would have been the automatic front-runner in the 2026 gubernatorial race had she sought to succeed outgoing Gov. Gavin Newsom. California term limits prohibit Newsom from serving more than eight years.\n\n \"In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their governor,\" she said in a statement at the time. \"I love this state, its people and its promise.

Asked if America would see a woman in the Oval Office in her grandnieces’ lifetimes, she said yes, then admitted it could “possibly” be her. It’s her strongest signal yet that she might launch another campaign in 2028 following her loss to Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nWhen asked about her low polling numbers among Democrats, Harris brushed it off. “If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office, and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here,” she said, stressing that her political career has always been about defying expectations.\n\nThe former vice president also used the interview to double down on her warnings about Trump’s governing style. Harris said her previous predictions about his “authoritarian tendencies” have proven right, arguing that he has “weaponized the Department of Justice” and other federal agencies against critics. She pointed to the recent suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after comments about conservative commentator Charlie Kirk’s death, saying Trump “couldn’t endure criticism from a joke and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process.”\n\nHarris didn’t stop there. She also called out business leaders and institutions that she says have been too quick to bend to Trump’s authority. “There are many that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant,” she said. “I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.”\n\nWhile she emphasized that no decision has been made, Harris made it clear she’s not ready to fade from political life. Her recent media appearances and upcoming book tour have fueled speculation that she’s testing the waters for another national run. With name recognition, fundraising connections, and historic significance on her side, she remains one of the most prominent Democrats on the national stage.\n\nOf course, challenges remain. Harris continues to divide Democrats—some see her as the future of the party, others as a symbol of its missteps in 2024. Still, her resilience and refusal to exit the conversation suggest that she’s not done fighting.\n\nFor now, Harris is keeping her cards close. But her message was unmistakable: she’s not finished, she’s not discouraged, and she’s not stepping aside. “I am not done,” she said. And in Washington, that sounds a lot like the start of something.","summary":"Kamala Harris signals she’s far from finished in politics.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/im-not-done-kamala-harris-drops-major-hint-about-future-presidential-run","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kamala-Harris-is-promoting-her-new-book.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 22:29:49","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":372584276,"title":"When ‘Fact-Checkers’ Are Weaponized Partisan Public Relations","text":"Every once in a while, the “fact-checkers” at PolitiFact publish reader comments, and this one stuck out: “Your site seems to be mostly about Trump all the time,” read one comment. “How about a little less Trump, and write more about any other falsehood subjects?”\n\nPolitiFact’s audience chief Ellen Hine acknowledged they’ve published over 1,000 “fact checks” on President Donald Trump—1,124, to be precise. But then she trotted out the false claim that their targeting is nonpartisan: “Without keeping count, we try to select facts to check from all sides of the political spectrum. At the same time, we more often fact-check the party that holds power or people who repeatedly make attention-getting or misleading statements.”\n\nThat “without keeping count” is an obvious excuse. Anyone who attempts to count what they’re doing will quickly realize they’re very partisan in their targeting—and in their ratings on truth and falsehood.\n\nIn the first five months of 2025, PolitiFact performed 68 “Truth-O-Meter” fact checks on Republicans to just 23 on Democrats. Even so, this website found the Republicans “Mostly False,” “False” or “Pants on Fire” liars in 85% of those articles, while the Democrats landed on the false side only 39%.\n\nBut let’s focus on presidents. From Jan. 1 through Oct. 22, Trump landed on the false side of the “Truth-O-Meter” 50 out of 54 times, or 92.5% of the time. The other four were “Half True” ratings, meaning he was rated “True” or “Mostly True” on zero occasions. It’s been more than a year—Oct. 18, 2024—since Trump drew a “Mostly True.”\n\nInstead, PolitiFact rated Trump as a “Pants on Fire” liar 13 times this year, 24% of the time. Since they began in 2007, PolitiFact has written up 217 “Pants on Fire” claims on Trump, to just seven on former President Joe Biden over those years.\n\nIf you take the same time period in 2021, Biden drew 34 checks, but they found him on the false side just 14 times, or 41% of the time. Biden was “True” or “Mostly True” 10 times.\n\nIn those first months of the Biden presidency, the liberal Democrats of PolitiFact were inflamed against Trump about election denial and the Jan. 6 riot, so Trump drew nine “Pants on Fire” ratings in 24 checks during that time period—and one “Half True,” and nothing on the true side.\n\nThe tilt in targeting is so obviously partisan. In 2025, when the “Pants on Fire” tag has been applied to individuals and not social media sites, every single target was on the right. In addition to the pile of attacks on Trump, the flaming list was Pam Bondi (twice) Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, Kevin O’Leary of the TV show “Shark Tank,” and Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nLet’s stipulate that some of these fact checks are identifying unfactual statements. But the aggression is overwhelming. The right side is nearly always wrong and blatantly lying, while the left side supposedly stumbles into falsehood every once in a while.\n\nTrump is tagged as “False” when he calls New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a “communist,” and Mamdani has never been fact-checked. Trump was “Pants on Fire” when he called Kamala Harris a “communist,” but the Democrats can call him a “fascist” daily and there is no checking.\n\nThis isn’t “independent fact-checking.” It’s weaponized public relations.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Email sabrina.penty@dailymail.co.uk \nBy RITA SOBOT and SABRINA PENTY, FOREIGN NEWS REPORTER \n Published:20:44 BST, 25 October 2025 |Updated:21:02 BST, 25 October 2025 \n\nA British tourist has died in the Canary Islands after plunging nearly 20ft when the railing of a hotel balcony reportedly gave way.\nAnother holiday-maker also fell and was seriously injured in the same incident in the Lanzarote resort town of Costa Teguise.\nThe tragedy, which has shaken the tourist town, happened in the early hours of Saturday morning.\nThe two Brits, aged 56 and 54, fell from the height when the railing collapsed, according to local media. \nThe 56-year-old man died on the spot while the other was admitted to the ICU of the Doctor José Molina Orosa Hospital, where he remains in critical condition. \nEmergency services rushed to the scene after receiving reports of a fatal fall at around 1.30am.\nUpon arrival, the health teams could only confirm the death of one of those affected, while the other was stabilised and rushed to hospital.\nThe Civil Guard has opened an investigation to determine the exact causes of the event and assess whether there was negligence in the maintenance of the railing or in the security of the hotel.\n\nA British tourist has died in Lanzarote after plunging nearly 20ft when the railing of a hotel balcony reportedly gave way. File photo: Tourists enjoy a beach day in the resort town of Costa Teguise in Lanzarote, where the incident unfolded\nAccording to the first information, the railing that gave way was in an elevated area of the hotel complex.\nThe name of the hotel has not been revealed. \nIt is unknown whether the two Brits were related in any way.\nDaily Mail has approached the Foreign Office for comment. \nThe tragic incident comes a month after a British pensione plunged to his death from a balcony in Thailand.\nCops were called to the D-Beach Hotel in the Thai 'Sin City' Pattaya after the 74-year-old man allegedly fell from the 10th floor on the evening of September 6. \nThe holidaymaker, from Wales, was found lying face-down in a pool of blood, next to a busy road.\nPolice blocked the scene with white cloth as they collected evidence from the area.\nPhanuthat Thanakasemphakin, a Pattaya Special Affairs officer, said he was working around 20ft away when he heard a loud bang 'like a transformer explosion'.\nPolice Lieutenant Manasak Ponyiam of the Pattaya City Police Station said: 'We have inspected the scene and collected evidence.\n'The deceased had been staying on the tenth floor of this hotel. We checked his room and found no trace of assault or ransacking.\n'We also checked the security camera for the entire previous day, which showed no one entering or leaving the room except for the victim until his death.\n'We still do not know if it was an accident or suicide.\n'The body was sent to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for a post-mortem exam. We will question hotel employees to determine the cause of death.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritish tourist, 56, is killed in fall from Canary Islands hotel balcony 'after railing broke' - with fellow holiday-maker, 54, left critically injured\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Ex-Vice President hints she is considering another Presidential run","text":"AgenciesKamala Harris and Donald Trump\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said that her time in politics has not come to an end, offering her strongest indication to date that she would consider a third presidential run.In an interview with the BBC, Harris said she remained confident a woman will become president one day and that it could \"possibly\" be her. \"I am not done,\" she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"Harris made the remarks on \"Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg,\" a prime weekend political show in Britain, as part of a media blitz promoting the book she released last month that recounts her 107-day campaign for the White House.Harris stressed that she has made no decisions about the 2028 campaign, which is widely expected to feature an expansive field of ambitious governors, members of Congress and political outsiders.She dismissed early polls showing her trailing in the potentially crowded contest. \"If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office or my second office -- and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" she said.Live EventsEven in the midst of her book tour, Harris has taken a relatively cautious approach to the Trump administration. Earlier this year, she announced that she would not run for governor of California, declining to make a bid for one of the country's most powerful perches to push back on the administration and set the future direction for the Democratic Party.While Democratic governors like JB Pritzker of Illinois, Gavin Newsom of California and Tim Walz of Minnesota, who ran with Harris on the 2024 Democratic ticket, have been vocal critics of the president, Harris has carefully picked her moments to speak out.In the interview, she argued that her predictions during the 2024 campaign that Trump would run an authoritarian government had come true.\"He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice -- and he has done exactly that,\" she said.She reiterated her criticism of corporations, universities, media companies and law firms that she said had capitulated to Trump's demands, citing ABC's decision to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel over his remarks following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist.Her husband, Doug Emhoff, is a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which was one of the first law firms that cut a deal to avoid being sanctioned by the Trump administration. Emhoff has said he disagreed with the decision by his firm to pledge $100 million in pro bono legal work for causes the president has championed.FAQsQ1. Who was Vice President to Joe Biden?A1.

Smith responds to savage putdown from Kash Patel over 'dumb' claim Donald Trump is behind NBA mafia gambling probe\n\nREAD MORE: Shaquille O'Neal attacks NBA stars charged in Mafia gambling ring\n\nBy OLIVER SALT, US ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR\n\nPublished: 19:41 BST, 25 October 2025 | Updated: 20:04 BST, 25 October 2025\n\nA defiant Stephen A. Smith insists he stands by his claim that Donald Trump is behind the NBA mafia gambling probe, despite FBI boss Kash Patel branding it 'the single dumbest thing' he's ever heard.\n\nThe NBA was shaken to its core Thursday after Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier were among more than 30 people arrested in connection to an FBI investigation into Mafia-led illegal sports betting and rigged poker games.\n\nAnd following the bombshell news, Smith sparked fury by claiming the investigation is politically motivated and backed by Trump amid his thirst for revenge over the NBA, an assessment Patel took issue with.\n\n'That may be the single dumbest thing I've ever heard out of anyone in modern history and I live most of my time in Washington DC,' he told Fox News. 'I'm the FBI director. I decide which arrests to conduct and which not to conduct.'\n\nSmith, who has flirted with a run for the White House over the past year, earlier suggested this investigation was the latest evidence that 'Trump is coming.'\n\nAnd the ESPN First Take host is refusing to back down despite Patel's put-down.\n\nStephen A. Smith stands by his claim that Donald Trump is behind the NBA gambling probe\n\nFBI director Kash Patel branded his comments 'the single dumbest thing' he's ever heard\n\nSmith alleged the FBI's explosive investigation into illegal sports betting is backed by Trump\n\nChilling messages reveal mafia henchmen allegedly threatened and attacked victims of rigged poker\n\n'I would say he’s the director of the FBI, let’s just say I’m not trying to get on his bad side,' Smith said on his YouTube channel. 'But having said that, I still stand by what I said. And I’m not changing my mind.\n\n'In the interest of being real and making you understand who I am as a journalist and a commentator spanning 30 years, I just want you all to know that it’s customary for people to say I don’t know what the hell I’m talking about, that I’m off my damn rocker, only to come down the pike weeks months later and say, \"Yeah, it was true\" or the facts bear those things out.\n\n'This investigation has been going on when [Joe] Biden was in office. They talked about how this stuff has been going on since 2019, which is when Trump was in office. \n\n'I’m not implying that Kash Patel doesn’t have any legitimacy to the case that he’s pursuing against these individuals, and I’m not about to argue with an FBI director. I’m simply making the point that in the end, you have a president in place that has a lengthy connection to the sports world, rife with friends and enemies. And those who are his enemies, he doesn’t mind inconveniencing one bit. And when it comes to the NBA brand, it doesn’t bother him.'\n\nSmith's initial comments earlier in the week sparked a furious backlash from viewers on social media, who rightly pointed out that the investigation began well before Trump started his second term in the White House.\n\nOne commented: 'This isn't a guy being dumb. This is Stephen A. Smith intentionally making a provocative statement he knows is misleading. The FBI director showed up because this is a huge mob related arrest. The FBI always shows up. You'd have to live under a rock or be dumb as dirt to believe what he just said. TDS (Trump derangement syndrome) is a real thing.'\n\nAnother posted: 'The issue with this take is that they literally said this is an investigation that started and has been spanning 4 years So this started well before Trump'.\n\nA third added: 'Uhhhh, I highly doubt Trump had anything to do with this. Investigation was ongoing for years. Only political angle is Patel jumping in front of a camera for some personal PR, but that's it lol.'\n\nThe ESPN star, who voted for Kamala Harris, delivered his verdict on First Take on Thursday \n\n'The investigation started years ago and has nothing to do with Trump, but leave to Stephen A to make it political,' a fourth posted. \n\nOne Trump fan commented: 'Why is everything made political? This investigation started before Trump got into office. So the FBI cracks down on illegal mafia and illegal gambling racket in the NBA but Trump is still a bad guy.' \n\nSix defendants are accused of participating in an insider sports betting conspiracy that exploited confidential information about NBA athletes and teams, said Joseph Nocella, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\n\nHe called it 'one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalized in the United States.'\n\n'My message to the defendants who´ve been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended. Your luck has run out,' Nocella said. \n\nThe second case involves 31 defendants in a nationwide scheme to rig illegal poker games, Nocella said. The defendants include former professional athletes accused of using technology to steal millions of dollars in underground poker games in the New York area that were backed by Mafia families, he said.\n\nIn the sports betting scheme, players sometimes altered their performance or took themselves out of games early, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.\n\nIn one instance, Rozier, while playing for the Hornets, told people he was planning to leave the game early with a 'supposed injury,' allowing them to place wagers that raked in thousands of dollars, Tisch said.\n\nThe indictment of Rozier and others says there are nine unnamed co-conspirators, including a Florida resident who was an NBA player, an Oregon resident who was an NBA player from about 1997 to 2014 and an NBA coach since at least 2021, as well as a relative of Rozier.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups leaves a courthouse in Portland, Oregon\n\nNBA star Terry Rozier is pictured leaving court in a hoodie and colorful shorts on Thursday\n\nRozier and other defendants 'had access to private information known by NBA players or NBA coaches' that was likely to affect the outcome of games or players´ performances and provided that information to other co-conspirators in exchange for either a flat fee or a share of betting profits, the indictment says.\n\nThe NBA, which had investigated Rozier previously, told Daily Mail in a statement: 'We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today. Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities.\n\n'We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.'\n\nRozier was in uniform as the Heat played the Magic on Wednesday in Orlando in the season opener for both teams, though he did not play in the game. He was taken into custody in Orlando early Thursday morning.\n\nThe case was brought by the U.S. attorney´s office in Brooklyn that previously prosecuted ex-NBA player Jontay Porter. The former Toronto Raptors center pleaded guilty to charges that he withdrew early from games, claiming illness or injury, so that those in the know could win big by betting on him to underperform expectations.\n\nBillups was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame last year. The five-time All-Star and three-time All-NBA point guard led the Detroit Pistons to their third league title in 2004 as NBA Finals MVP. Boston drafted the former Colorado star with the No. 3 pick overall in 1997.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStephen A.

I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones,” she told the BBC during an interview to be aired on “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.”\n\nIn keeping with the possibility of another try at the presidency, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an also-ran behind California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the Democratic nominee in the next presidential election.\n\n“If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here,” she told the network.\n\nNewsweek reported a few of the latest surveys:\n\nA Politico-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab survey, conducted between July 31 and August 11, put California Governor Gavin Newsom ahead with 25 percent support among Democrats and independents, compared to Harris’ 19 percent.\nAnalysis on Friday by pollster Lakshya Jain showed that Harris has one of the highest unfavorability ratings among senior Democrats, with 54 percent saying they have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of her.\n\nIn the interview, Harris replayed her 2024 campaign message criticizing President Donald Trump as an authoritarian, adding some new shots based on his ten months in office.\n\nShe brought up the suspension of late night ABC host Jimmy Kimmel for lying about Charlie Kirk’s murder, placing the host’s layoff at Trump’s feet, though no evidence has emerged to date that the president was involved in ABC’s decision.\n\n“You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists…” she told the Sunday show. “His skin is so thin he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process.”\n\n“He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice,” she also claimed. “And he has done exactly that.”\n\nHarris also slammed business leaders and others for too easily supporting Trump and agreeing to his wishes.\n\nShe told the network, “There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.\n\nWhen the British network asked for a response to Harris’s comments about the president, a White House spokesperson dismissed former vice president’s remarks\n\n“When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should’ve taken the hint — the American people don’t care about her absurd lies,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the network.\n\n“Or maybe she did take the hint and that’s why she’s continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.”\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

Harris, who was defeated by President Donald Trump in last year’s election, told the BBC that she is keeping her options open and dismissed polls that view her as a 2028 outsider. She also branded the president as a \"tyrant.\" \"I am not done,\" she told the United Kingdom outlet. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.\" CNN PANEL SHREDS HARRIS' COLBERT INTERVIEW FOR HER LACK OF SOLUTIONS AFTER 'SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE IT OUT' Harris lost the electoral college to Trump 312 to 226 and went down by 2.3 million votes in the popular vote. She was catapulted into the race as the Democratic primary nominee following then-President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the election in the wake of a disastrous debate performance. Since the defeat, Harris kept a low enough profile until the publication last month of her book, \"107 Days,\" detailing her short, failed presidential campaign. In the book, she argues she had too little time to define her message or distance herself from Biden’s record. She also cited Democrat infighting and a lack of donor confidence. In her BBC interview, Harris left the door open to another White House run, saying her grandnieces would \"in their lifetime, for sure\" see a female president. When asked if that person could be her, she replied, \"possibly,\" signaling she’s considering another bid. Harris said she hasn’t made a decision but still sees herself as having a political future. \"I am not done,\" she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.\" There is no clear frontrunner to lead the Democrats into the 2028 election and a potential crowded list of nominees includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, among others. Harris said she was undeterred by unfavorable polls. \"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" she said. The full interview will air on Sunday, but the BBC released excerpts on Saturday. Harris said that her concerns that Trump would act like an authoritarian have come true. KAMALA HARRIS DECISION NOT TO RUN IN 2026 OPENS DOOR TO POSSIBLE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2028 \"He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice — and he has done exactly that,\" Harris told the BBC. She pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of Charlie Kirk. Kimmel’s show was suspended by ABC, after Trump-appointed FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened broadcasters, and the move was celebrated by Trump. Kimmel appeared to falsely suggest the alleged assassin was a MAGA supporter and was brought back on air the following week. \"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists… His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process,\" Harris said. Harris labeled Trump a \"tyrant,\" accusing business leaders and institutions of cozying up to the president and bowing to his demands. \"There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation,\" Harris said. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The White House was dismissive when asked by the BBC for a response to Harris’s comments. \"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should’ve taken the hint — the American people don’t care about her absurd lies,\" spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the outlet. \"Or maybe she did take the hint and that’s why she’s continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\" Fox News Digital has also asked the White House for comment.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris teases a 2028 presidential run, dismisses bad polls and calls President Donald Trump a &quot;tyrant&quot; in a BBC interview.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-doesnt-rule-out-another-presidential-run-new-interview-i-am-not-done","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 18:32:27","author":"Michael Dorgan","authors":["Michael Dorgan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":372546256,"title":"Former '60 Minutes' producer says he was pressured to apologize over Harris interview","text":"Former \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens said that he was pressured to apologize over the program's interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which was the subject of President Donald Trump's lawsuit against CBS, and said he refused. \"I said, I’m not apologizing for anything.

The program ran a segment on former Biden officials in the State Department who left their positions over the administration's handling of the war. \"She didn’t like the story,\" Owens said.

Trump accused the outlet of deceptive editing and election interference. Paramount and CBS agreed to settle with the president in July, with Trump receiving $16 million upfront to cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes.

Email: john.james@dailymail.co.uk \nBy JOHN JAMES, SENIOR REPORTER and SAM WRIGHT, VIDEO JOURNALIST \n Published:19:15 BST, 25 October 2025 |Updated:19:15 BST, 25 October 2025 \n\nCyclists are jumping red lights, mounting pavements and putting pedestrians at risk at some of London's busiest accident hotspots, a Daily Mail investigation has revealed.\nOur reporter visited three notorious roads in the capital during the peak of rush hour, after damning figures from the Department of Transport (DfT) revealed cyclist-caused injuries to pedestrians are at a record high.\nThe busy districts of Aldgate, Oxford Street and Shaftesbury Avenue are the most dangerous places to be a pedestrian in the capital, according to research.\nPosing as both a cyclist on a Lime bike and as a pedestrian crossing the road, our reporter's hidden camera footage caught riders flagrantly ignoring the highway code.\nOn one occasion our journalist even came close to be crashed into by a cyclist who had jumped a red light. \nOur footage comes as this year ten times more cyclists than drivers have been fined for running red lights in one of London's busiest districts. \nMoreover, one in six bike riders admit to frequently ignoring traffic light signals to stop despite the very real danger this can cause to pedestrians and motorists.\nFor the year 2024 police recorded 603 accidents where a civilian was injured in a bike collision, Department for Transport road casualty figures show.\nLast year also made a record for the most casualties involving cyclists on pavements and at zebra crossings as 321 incidents were recorded - a nine per cent increase from the 292 in 2023.\n\nWe strapped a GoPro to our reporter to find out how lawless London's roads are \n\nIn the short ride from Oxford Street to Shaftesbury Avenue, our reporter saw countless cyclists ignoring red lights\n\nWhat happened when we joined the cyclists? \nWe joined London's cyclists on a morning commute. Our reporter strapped a GoPro to his chest and hired a Lime Bike, before merging into the throng that snakes its way through the capital each morning. \nDuring the short journey, we would be subjected to all of the same hazards and dangers the average cyclist risks each day. \nThese include terrifying close passes, aggressive drivers, brainless pedestrians walking out into the road and mind-numbing congestion. \nBut in the short ride from Oxford Street to Shaftesbury Avenue, our reporter saw countless cyclists ignoring red lights with abandon and clocked the sneaky tactics many use to beat the traffic. \nThese include: \n\nWalking their bikes past the red lights and making a dash for it after a few cars have gone\nMounting the pavement to cut corners \nMerging into a junction after ignoring a red light on the understanding a car will brake to avoid hitting them \nCycling off 20 seconds after the light goes red when they suspect a yellow is coming\nWith all this flagrant rule breaking already being clocked from the saddle, to say we were optimistic about the rest of our experiment would be a lie. \nOxford Street \nThe chaotic junctions connecting Oxford Street are officially the most lawless place in London according to a survey from NextBase. \nAmazingly, 50 per cent of cyclists in the area were found to be running through the crossroads without stopping despite the huge number of pedestrians, buses and motorists that trundle through at all times. \n\nEXCLUSIVE Widower whose wife, 44, was killed by reckless cyclist vows he 'won't stop' putting pressure on MPs over new laws to stop killer cyclists \nIn 2017, a 73-year-old pensioner was killed after she was hit by a cyclist in the area and suffered devastating injuries in the collision. \nIn an effort to improve the Wild-West-esque roads, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has announced that soon a section of Oxford Street will be fully pedestrianised with cyclists banned from using it at certain times. \nWhen our reporter arrived shortly after 8am the area was already heaving with cars honking and pedestrians swarming across the pavements. \nIn the midst of the chaos, London cyclists were also commuting into work, some waiting patiently at the endless stream of traffic lights that divide the road. \nSome of them however, took matters into their own hands. \n\nOXFORD STREET: Two cyclists decide to jump a red light in the heart of London \nIn the short time the Daily Mail watched the junction, we saw over twenty cyclists breeze straight across the road narrowly avoiding both cars and members of the public. \nIn one moment, a woman who had ignored the red light and cycled directly into the road as cars to her right pulled off, narrowly avoided being clattered and proceeded to give the driver the middle finger in indignation. \nOther cyclists were seen pulling off when the lights were still red as they seemingly deemed the road now safe to use - despite pedestrians still crossing the road in the distance. \nShaftesbury Avenue \nOur next stop was Shaftesbury Avenue in the heart of Soho where tourists and locals meet to eat, drink and play. \nNaturally, many of the capital's more lively spots were closed when we arrived but the area was still heaving with traffic. \nAs our reporter watched the notorious crossing by the Palace Theatre, we saw countless cyclists ignoring the red lights and swerving in and around cars who were also trying to crawl along the road. \nOthers mounted the pavement to counter the traffic lights, much to the annoyance of one business owner who shouted a few expletives. \nIt is an offence to cycle on the pavement in the UK under Rule 64 of the Highway Code, however increasingly it is not something that is enforced or prosecuted by the police due to cycling lobby groups claiming the roads themselves are unsafe. \nThe survey from NextBase, completed in September, recorded more than 200 cyclist offences between Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road in just 40 minutes. \n\nALDGATE: We saw dozens of cyclists mounting the pavement and speeding through red lights\n\nALDGATE: Our own reporter was also almost knocked over when a cyclist decided they would jump a red light \n\nOur final stop was Aldgate in the heart of London's financial district. \nCity bankers have increasingly taken to cycling into their skyscrapers in the morning and the area is also frequented by young people who work in nearby trendy Shoreditch. \n\nEXCLUSIVE Just how dangerous ARE London's roads? MailOnline joined Jeremy Vine on his daily commute to find out if the capital really IS a bike death trap \nThe roads are as congested as the ones in Soho, with more vans and construction vehicles following the A11 into East London and therefore more opportunities for severe collisions. \nHorrific crashes are a feature on the road and can have brutal consequences. \nIn 2022, a female cyclist in her 50s suffered nasty leg injuries after colliding with a van outside Aldgate East station. \nDespite the threat and throngs of pedestrians also using the pavements and roads, our reporter again observed an alarming number of cyclists bending the rules. \nIn the short time we were at the junction, we saw nine riders mounting the pavement and speeding through red lights. \nIn one terrifying moment caught on camera, our own reporter was also almost knocked over. \n\nAs both a pedestrian and a cyclist, our reporter felt bothered, hassled and unsafe due to the conduct of some commuters. \nHe was almost run over crossing the road and didn't receive an apology and had to dodge multiple cyclists on the pavement.\nHe also watched as fellow cyclists dodged red lights putting their lives and the livelihoods of others in danger. \nWhat enforcement can be taken or has been already? \nThere has been some appetite for making the streets safer for pedestrians in recent years. \nLast month, the City of London announced rule breaking riders could face tougher penalties for 'dangerous, antisocial and nuisance cycling behaviours'.\nThese include issuing Community Protection Warnings and Notices to provide stronger sanctions than the £50 Fixed Penalty Notices currently handed out. \nIn January, it was also announced some cyclists would face education courses or fixed penalty notices for ten new offences such as cycling on a road without due care and attention or not using a light at night.\n\n Busy pedestrian crossing in London where more than HALF of cyclists jump red lights \nThe new UK laws make an attempt to tackle antisocial cycling, but the plans would see penalties for dangerous cycling and ignoring school crossings downgraded.\nUnder proposals put forward by the Home Office, those breaching the new rules could have to take a 30-minute e-learning course by the National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme (NDORS) for a £100 fee instead of receiving a fine or points.\nCyclists are currently exempt from needing to follow the national speed limit but they can be prosecuted for cycling dangerously.\nHowever, the changes would see ignoring school crossings, dangerous cycling and hitching rides from moving cars dealt with by a more educational approach.\nThe new offences also relate to cycling behaviour in London's Royal Parks such as Bushy Park, Hyde Park and Regent’s Park.\nThe Home Office report said: 'Such courses are offered as an alternative to an offer of a fixed penalty notice, and therefore a driver who successfully completes a course is not required to pay a fixed penalty amount in relation to the offence, or to have points endorsed on their driving record.\n'The operation of the NDORS allows the police the discretion to deal with low level driving offences without reference to the courts by offering training courses as an alternative to prosecution.' \n\nNew offences also relate to cycling behaviour in London's Royal Parks such as Regent’s Park\nThe Home Office is looking to amend Schedule 3 of the Road Traffic Offender Act 1988 as well as the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 and Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n What are the ten new cycling offences?\n\nOffences under Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988:\n\nFailure to stop at a school crossing patrol*\nCyclist holding on to a vehicle while in motion on a road for the purpose of being drawn along*\nCycling on a road dangerously*\nCycling on a road without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road.\nProposals are for offences marked * to be dealt with through a course and no longer receiving points on driving record or a fine \nOffences under Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989:\n\nUsing a pedal cycle without lights between sunset and sunrise.\nUsing lamps so as to cause undue dazzle or discomfort to other persons using the road.\nUsing a non-motor vehicle with any lamp so as to cause undue dazzle or discomfort.\nOffences under Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997:\n\nFailure to comply with any direction given by a constable or by a notice exhibited by order of the Secretary of State regarding the use of a pedal cycle in a Royal Park or other specified land.\nUsing a pedal cycle in manner that endangers or is likely to endanger any person in a Royal Park or other specified land.\nUsing a vehicle or pedal cycle between sunset and sunrise, or in seriously reduced visibility between sunrise and sunset, with no lights in a Royal Park or other specified land. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means there will be penalties for ten new offences relating to dangerous riding. \nThese include cycling on a road dangerously, cycling without due care and attention, not using lights after dark, failure to stop at a school crossing patrol, holding on to a vehicle while in motion for a tow, using lamps that cause undue dazzle or discomfort to others, cycling in Royal Parks without following directions and cycling in a manner that endangers others in Royal Parks. \nOffences such as cycling without due care or cycling on a road dangerously are already offences but their inclusion means riders could face an education course or fine.\nA consultation period over the changes has since finished with it receiving 14 responses that threw up a number of issues. \nBoth the Metropolitan Police and Transport for London raised concerns about the inclusion of dangerous cycling. \nThe report said: 'Three respondents were concerned that the list of offences in the proposal included both dangerous and careless cycling offences, which they felt could set a bad precedent. \n'They highlighted that there is already confusion and overlap between these offences and the careless and dangerous driving offences, and questioned whether any road user behaviour sanctioned as \"dangerous\" should be dealt with out of court.' \nIn response to the consultation, the Government said: 'In response to the feedback received to this consultation, the government has carried out further engagement with NPCC and UKROEd to discuss the concerns which have been raised, including which offences are suitable to be added to the list of offences for which an NDORS course may be offered.\n'The above offences cover a range of behaviours which would impact on the nature of the safety risks presented (e.g. the dangerous cycling could have taken place on an empty road or in a busy area with lots of other vehicles and pedestrians). \n'It is therefore right that the police officer should decide on the appropriate penalty, taking into account the circumstances of each case.'\nIn May last year, campaigners voiced their support for a proposed law change, with cyclists who caused death by dangerous driving face life in prison.\n\nMatt Briggs has been campaigning for nearly a decade for harsher prison sentences after his wife Kim (pictured together) was killed by a reckless teen rider in east London in 2016\nMatt Briggs was among those who had been campaigning for nearly a decade for harsher prison sentences after his wife Kim, 44, was killed by a reckless teen rider in east London in 2016 as she crossed the road on her lunch break.\nThe plan, put forward by Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was supported by the government at the time to form part of the Criminal Justice Bill, awaiting approval from the House of Lords.\nIn 2022 a court heard a cyclist killed an 81-year-old woman after he crashed into her while trying to overtake her as she walked with a friend along the River Thames towpath in Oxford. And in the same year, Brian Fitzgerald was doing up to 29mph in a 20mph zone when he hit Hilda Griffiths while she crossed the road with her dog at 7am in London's Regent's Park.\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) issues traffic offence reports to cyclists who breach road traffic regulations, including those who fail to comply with red traffic lights. \n'Riders can be offered an online education course or issued with a fined. The MPS operates a dedicated Cycle Safety Team, which engages with cyclists at events and across London, to promote safe riding and raise awareness of the risks posed by unsafe riding, both to cyclists themselves and to other road users.\n'In partnership, Transport for London (TfL) funds borough councils to deliver cycle training for children and adults, focusing on safe riding practices and adherence to the Highway Code. These combined approaches have proven effective in improving cycling behaviours.\n'The MPS is committed to working in partnership with TfL and other key stakeholders to achieve the Vision Zero goal of eliminating deaths and serious injuries on London’s transport network. \n'Using a data led approach, the MPS provides a proportionate policing response to identified risks across the road network. While the majority of collisions involve motor vehicles, addressing dangerous cycling remains an important priority.\n'Members of the public can report dangerous, illegal, or antisocial road user behaviour directly to the police via the online reporting tool available on the Met Police website. These reports help identify hotspot areas and support the effective deployment of policing resources.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRevealed: Cyclists are jumping red lights, mounting pavements and putting pedestrians at risk at London's busiest accident hotspots\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The former vice president said her grandnieces would \"see a female president in the White House in their lifetime, for sure,\" adding that it could \"possibly\" be her.\n\nWhile Harris stopped short of confirming a 2028 campaign, she emphasized that her political ambitions remain alive. \"If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" she said, brushing off concerns about her polling numbers.\n\nHarris also criticized President Donald Trump, calling him a \"tyrant\" and accusing him of \"weaponizing the Department of Justice\". She added, \"He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice, and he has done exactly that.\"Tough PollingThe next Democratic primary battle is expected to define the future of the party, which has suffered declining favorability since losing control of Congress and the White House to Trump in last year's election.\n\nRecent polling has shown a divided Democratic electorate. A Noble Predictive Insights survey conducted October 2–6 found Harris leading the Democratic field with 33 percent of support among Democrats and 27 percent among independents. However, a Politico–Citrin Center–Possibility Lab poll from July 31 to August 11 showed California Governor Gavin Newsom ahead, with 25 percent support compared to Harris' 19 percent.\n\nPollster Lakshya Jain's analysis, released Friday, October 24, indicated that Harris continues to face significant challenges, noting that 54 percent of respondents hold a somewhat or very unfavorable view of her — one of the highest unfavorability ratings among prominent Democrats.'The Most Qualified Candidate'Despite the mixed data, Harris remains publicly undeterred. Earlier in October, during an on-stage interview with journalist Kara Swisher, she gave a coy response when asked if she would run again: \"Maybe. Maybe not.\"\n\nIn that same appearance, she described herself as \"the most qualified candidate ever to run for president,\" saying, \"Some people have actually said I was the most qualified candidate ever to run for president,\" which drew applause. \"I was just speaking fact,\" she added.\n\nHowever, in her memoir 107 Days, Harris wrote that she had \"no immediate plans to pursue another major political office,\" adding, \"I'll no longer sit in DC in the grandeur of the ceremonial office. I will be with the people… rebuilding trust, empathy, and a government worthy of the ideals of this country.\"","summary":"Kamala Harris said her career in public service is 'in her bones' and that her grandnieces will see a female president 'in their lifetime'.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/vice-president-kamala-harris-teases-2028-run-america/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/nLiKlaYj5/0x0/vice-president-kamala-harris-teases-2028-run-america-1761411125933.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 18:15:00","author":"Joshua Wilburn","authors":["Joshua Wilburn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":372552006,"title":"Kamala Harris leaves door open for 2028 presidential run","text":"Several potential candidates are already taking steps to get to know voters in key states, including California Gov.

Speaking to the BBC, the former Vice President believed she would be 'President' one day, adding that there will be a woman in the White House in the future. In a statement, Harris said, \"I am not done. I have lived my entire career a life of service and it’s in my bones. There are many ways to serve. I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now.\" Kamala Harris Targets Donald Trump Taking aim at her 2024 competitor and now the 47th US President, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris termed him a tyrant, adding that her warnings about him have been proven right. She asserted that predictions about Donald Trump being a fascist and running an authoritarian government have come true. \"Like when Donald Trump said he would weaponise the Department of Justice and he’s exactly doing the same,\" she said. \"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists. His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process,\" Kamala said. When asked about her belief that there will be a woman in the White House and whether that woman could be her, Kamala Harris said 'possibly,' hinting at a second run for the top job. However, she also mentioned that she has not made a final decision yet, though she does see herself in politics in the future. Responding to a question about polls suggesting she is an outsider, Kamala Harris said she has never listened to polls. \"If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" Kamala Harris said. If Kamala Runs in 2028, Will She Face Donald Trump Again? Donald Trump, back in March this year, hinted that he may run for a third term as US President, and his team was reportedly exploring options despite the US Constitution’s 22nd Amendment, which does not allow more than two terms for a President. In an interview with NBC, President Donald Trump said that his team has been looking for 'methods' to serve another term as President, despite the 22nd Amendment limiting presidential terms in the US to two. Reasserting his seriousness, the 78-year-old said in the telephone interview that \"he is not joking.\" Given that the Republican, born on June 14, 1946, is already 78, a third term would mean he’d be 82 at the time of the next election in 2028 and if he indeed becomes President, he would finish his term in 2032 at the age of 86. And indeed, if he did run for a third term, and Kamala Harris for her second, it would be the second time the two face each other.

But she dismissed the suggestion that she’d face long odds.\n\n“I have lived my entire career a life of service and it’s in my bones. And there are many ways to serve,” she said. “I’ve never listened to polls.”\n\nShe’s recently given a series of interviews following the September release of her book, “107 Days.” It looks back on her experience replacing then-President Joe Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race.\n\nShe ultimately lost to Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press last week, Harris, 60, also made clear that running again in 2028 is still on the table. She said she sees herself as a leader of the party, including in pushing back against Trump and preparing for the 2026 midterms.\n\nAsked in an Oct. 17 interview with AP whether she had plans for a 2028 bid, Harris said, “I haven’t decided. Sincerely. I have not decided. I may or I may not. I have not decided.”\n\nAsked specifically whether she still wanted to do the job itself, she used the past tense, saying, “It’s a job I wanted to do.” But she noted that the only way to do it “is to run” and win.\n\nMeanwhile, political jockeying among Democrats for the 2028 presidential contest appears to be playing out even earlier than usual.\n\nSeveral potential candidates are already taking steps to get to know voters in key states, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, term-limited Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and California Rep. Ro Khanna. Upwards of 30 high-profile Democrats could ultimately enter the primary.","summary":"The former vice president said she expects a woman will be president in the coming years.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/25/kamala-harris-leaves-door-open-for-2028-presidential-run/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kamala_Harris_05134_ba72fe.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 17:58:08","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":372543444,"title":"‘I Am Not Done’: Kamala Harris Signals Another US Presidential Run","text":"Former US Vice President Kamala Harris has signalled another run for the US presidency.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Harris expressed that she would possibly be ‘President’ one day, suggesting she may seek the Democratic nomination in 2028.

She said warnings she made about President Trump on the campaign trail had been proved right, calling him a \"tyrant.\" She said she believed her predictions about Mr. Trump running an authoritarian government had been realized. Harris also called out businesses and universities for, in her view, toeing the line and bowing too easily to the president's demands.

Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, fewer than a third of voters endorsed her having another try.

Not college football. Nothing to do with GameDay, Big Noon, McAfee's kicking segment, or Lane Kiffin-to-UF rumors. This is about Kamala Harris' ongoing book tour, which, frankly, is my favorite thing going right now. I've written about the former VP for WEEKS now. Every weekend, she gives me new #content. One week, she's slurring her way through a campus book store. The next, she's giggling away with Hillary Clinton on stage. It's the best. I can't get enough of it. Inject it straight into my veins. This particular Saturday, Kamala took her act overseas in an interview with the BBC. Better yet, she teased ANOTHER White House run, which is maybe the best news for Republicans this year. Please, Kamala … DO IT! Do it, Kamala! Incredible. God, I need this. Please run again. Kamala vs. JD Vance would be an even bigger bloodbath than last year. What a gift for conservatives and for MAGA. I think JD's gonna be hard to beat in 2028, but with Kamala going against him? Curtains. Call it a day. Shut it down. What a typical word-salad answer from Kamala, too. Just so on point, it hurts. She says a ton, but also says absolutely nothing of substance at the same time. Her answer to the questions about the polls? Complete nonsense, and then the clip just awkwardly ends with these two staring at each other in silence. The best. What a bad look for the Dems. They have literally nobody to trot out there in 2028, with Gavin Newsom being the only possible exception. He's a lunatic in his own right, but he certainly gives them a better shot than Kamala Harris. Again, though – I don't see anyone, as of now, beating JD Vance. He's looking like PEAK Alabama right now. Mid-2010s Bama during the Saban years. Electric. They were a WAGON, and that’s what JD Vance would look like going up against Kamala Harris.

Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., lamented that former President Joe Biden’s presidency was influenced by staffers who pushed far-left policies rather than the more moderate positions of his past. Biden served in American politics for decades, but his career ended with a presidency that some argue was co-opted by a liberal agenda that were out of step with American voters. In November 2021, Manchin shared his wish that Biden \"Be normal and stop the chaos,\" warning, \"We can’t go too far left. This is not a center-left or a left country. We are a center, if anything, a little center-right country.\" In 2025, as the Democratic Party still reels from former Vice President Kamala Harris’ defeat and tries to seek a path forward, Manchin offered his analysis of the past few years to the hosts of the \"All-In\" podcast. \"I'm going to be honest with you. Ron Klain, okay? Smart guy, good guy and everything, but he had gone so far to the left and he pushed Joe left,\" Manchin claimed. \"When I first went over to the White House, I said, ‘Mr. President,’ I said ‘You have the most liberal staff that I've ever seen.’ First time I went over. And he said, ‘Well, Joe, they tell me I have the most diversified staff.’ I said, ‘We're not talking about diversity, sir. We're talking about bats--- crazy. We're talking about people I've known, I've worked with in the hallway forever, and I know where they came and where they worked before. These are people real far left.\" ATLANTIC CALLS OUT DEMS FOR FAILING TO TAKE 'OWN ADVICE' AND MODERATE THEIR POLICIES Manchin added, \"Ron put that team together. And I know that because I kept saying that ‘your staff is pushing you too far left, Mr. President. You’ve never been this far left.\" The West Virginia politician concluded that while he believes Biden is a good man, Manchin says the President \"lost the will to fight.\" When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, Klain said, \"Our agenda at the WH was the agenda the president campaigned on — no more no less. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for it other than Senator Manchin. Every one. The staff were all veterans of the Obama and Clinton WH. I respect Sen Manchin, but the staff was mainstream Democratic and the agenda was mainstream Democratic.\" Klain added that agenda items such as paid family leave and a child tax credit are \"overwhelmingly supported by the American people.\" Meanwhile, the former Senator said, \"I know how much energy it takes if you've got to fight with your staff every day to do the things you want rather than the staff saying, ‘We'll take care of that, Mr. President.’ Because I would ask him, we’d agree on something, and I'd ask him a week or two later, and nothing had happened, so, I’d know there was no follow-up. You follow? So, I knew Ron was kind of driving the train.\" Later in the same podcast, he gave a summation of his feelings about the Biden presidency, from its hopeful start to its less-than-satisfactory outcome. MANCHIN RECALLS CLOSE TIES WITH 'OUTSIDER' TRUMP, COLD SHOULDER FROM OBAMA IN NEW BOOK \"I think, ‘Boy, we got it now,\" Manchin said of his initial hopeful attitude regarding Biden’s presidency. \"Boy, was that a letdown. Went far to the left, and I don't think that was in his heart. But he came out of Iowa bad. Came out of New Hampshire even worse. Went to South Carolina, got resurrected, and within three weeks, everybody drops out. Had to make a deal, I think, with the wrong side of that and try to calm it down, and just for the sake of being president, I think he had to sign up and his people took him to the promised land of the far left — which has no return.\" When asked about how he would have loved to have been in a Democratic primary after Biden relinquished the nomination, he spoke about issues he focuses on, warning that a lack of moderation on immigration would doom the party.

He outsourced his campaign to Democrat politicos, donors, and a sycophantic media.No red state ever sought to remove Biden or former Vice President Kamala Harris from their 2024 ballots. In contrast, 25 blue states attempted to take Trump off their ballots.In 2021, Biden’s Department of Justice and FBI raided then-former President Trump’s home. They found only 102 classified documents among some 14,000 seized, but nevertheless, indicted him.There was no such SWAT raid on Biden’s multiple repositories of illegally removed classified documents.All were in less secure places than at Mar-a-Lago. Biden removed them over the course of three decades with impunity. At the time, unlike Trump, he had no presidential prerogatives to declassify them.Special counsel Robert Hur found Biden culpable for the removal of these files but declined to prosecute, claiming that he was too enfeebled to stand trial.In 2024, the same backroom donors and politicos who had conspired to ensure Biden was the 2020 nominee now, against his wishes, in coup-like fashion, removed him from his own reelection ticket.Within 48 hours and without a delegate vote, they crowned Harris as the presumed nominee. Queen Harris had not received a single delegate vote in her disastrous 2020 primary run.Trump, in 2020, did not sic his Department of Justice on his rival, Biden.Nor during his presidency did his Department of Justice indict any past or future political opponent or ex-president.In contrast, Kingly Biden’s White House helped coordinate 91 indictments of his past and future presidential rival, ex-President Trump.A mere three days after Trump announced his reelection bid on November 15, 2022, Jack Smith was coincidentally appointed special prosecutor of Trump.That same day, strangely, Nathan Wade, the Georgia county prosecutor prosecuting Trump, met with Biden’s White House counsel.On the same day, Matthew Colangelo, the former lead prosecutor in Letitia James’ case against Trump, abruptly left his DOJ post. He would soon go on to lead Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg’s prosecution of Trump.In the 2020 election, Biden’s surrogates rounded up 51 “intelligence authorities” to lie that Hunter Biden’s authentic and incriminating laptop—then verified but suppressed by the FBI—was the work of the Russians.The Biden-era FBI also joined Twitter, Facebook, and other social media to help smother any media story that might have verified the authenticity of the laptop.\n\nThe Left portrays Trump’s constitutional right to pardon as the act of a king.In his nearly five years of governance, Trump has pardoned roughly 1,700, including about 1,500 en masse for those convicted for the Jan. 6 protests.That number so far is about 200 fewer pardons than during the Barack Obama administration.Biden, in a mere four years in office, pardoned roughly 4,245 people—the vast majority through autopen signatures and without the full knowledge of Biden himself.Under the Obama and Biden administrations, admitted left-wing government lawbreakers and White House allies were never prosecuted for felonious behavior.\n\nCIA head John Brennan admitted to lying twice to Congress.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper confessed to lying under oath to Congress as well.FBI Director James Comey claimed ignorance or amnesia 245 times while under oath to a House oversight committee.Interim FBI Director Andrew McCabe lied four times, often while under oath to government investigators.A federal judge in 2020 admonished John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser and vehement critic, that he had endangered national security by removing sensitive documents to write an anti-Trump campaign-cycle memoir.He also warned Bolton that he could be subject to civil and criminal penalties.Not one of these political grandees was ever indicted by either the Obama or Biden DOJ.Trump’s White House advisors Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro were arrested in public for ignoring a congressional subpoena, convicted, and imprisoned.In contrast, top Democrat officials like former attorneys general Eric Holder and Merrick Garland both ignored congressional subpoenas and faced no such indictments.Monarchs might order assassinations of U.S. citizens abroad and surveil the phone records of Associated Press reporters. Obama did both during his tenure.Do kings monitor the phone records of their senatorial opponents?Biden’s special counsel, Jack Smith, did just that.Why then do the Democrats’ “No Kings” protests claim that Trump is a monarch?Answer: Through open and fair elections, the Left lost most of its former political power in Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court.\n\nNow in their fury and impotence, Democrats hit the streets—projecting onto their hated nemesis, Trump, their own past preferences for kingly methods.\n\n(C)2025 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

She cited Trump’s use of federal agencies against critics and highlighted the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after a political joke, which she said exemplified his intolerance for criticism.“There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant,” Harris said, pointing to business leaders and institutions in the US.who, she believes, too easily bowed to the president’s demands.Live EventsHarris dismissed polls predicting her as an outsider in the Democratic primary, saying, “If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office, and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.”When asked about her 2024 campaign, Harris acknowledged the challenges of entering the race late and struggling to connect with voters on economic issues, saying she did not have enough time to make her pitch on bread-and-butter issues like housing or childcare.Harris’s comments come as the Democratic Party continues to analyze the causes of Trump’s decisive 2024 victory, with much of the blame directed at President Joe Biden for not stepping aside sooner. Some have questioned whether Harris could have mounted a stronger campaign.The White House dismissed Harris’s remarks, with spokeswoman Abigail Jackson stating, “When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint, the American people don't care about her absurd lies. Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.”Harris, who has just published her memoir 107 Days, recounted the emotional toll of the 2024 campaign, describing her team’s shock at the election results. She also stressed her belief in the narrow margin of the popular vote, while noting her defeat in the Electoral College.Harris’s remarks leave open the possibility of another presidential campaign, signaling she may seek to remain a central figure in US politics despite her 2024 loss.With inputs from BBCAdd as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onKamala Harrispresidential campaign2028 electionDemocratic PartyDonald TrumpWhite House\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Harris responded that there would be a female president “in their lifetime, for sure.”RELATED STORY | ‘If she’s shining, he’s dimmed’: Kamala Harris recounts strained ties with Biden teamWhen asked about the long odds she would face in becoming president, she said, “If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”Harris was relatively close in the popular vote, falling to Donald Trump by 1.5 percentage points, but struggled in six key battleground states pivotal to winning the presidency.She has cited the relatively short time she had to build a campaign after then-President Joe Biden decided to drop out of the race amid concerns over his health and mental fitness. She also noted in her recent book \"107 Days\" that she had a strained relationship with President Biden's staff.Harris’ campaign raised $81 million within a day of Biden's announcement and $310 million by the end of July. But despite the historic moment — the first woman of color to lead a major-party presidential ticket — her momentum stalled.More recently, Harris squashed rumors that she was considering a run in 2026 to become California’s next governor — perhaps a sign she still has her sights set on the White House.In response to its interview with Harris, the BBC said the White House stated, “When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should’ve taken the hint — the American people don’t care about her absurd lies.”No former Democratic nominee has attempted another run for the White House since Hubert Humphrey ran again in 1972 after losing to Richard Nixon in 1968. Humphrey came well short of securing the party’s nomination.The last time a losing Democrat successfully earned the party’s nomination again was Adlai Stevenson, who was the party’s nominee in both 1952 and 1956, losing to Dwight Eisenhower both times.","summary":"Kamala Harris says she’s “not done” and may run for president in 2028, keeping focus on the White House after ruling out a California governor bid.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/not-done-kamala-harris-teases-possible-2028-presidential-campaign","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/341f12d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4495x2360+0+318/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe9%2F80%2F6758c6334ed4a8c89ec132c965e5%2Fap25212453268760.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 15:23:37","author":"Justin Boggs","authors":["Justin Boggs"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":372503466,"title":"'Humiliated' Kamala Harris's excruciating reaction as she's told Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has a better chance of being president than her... as she hints at running again","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris has hinted she may make another bid for the White House. \n\nHarris, who lost out to Donald Trump last November, told the BBC that she would 'possibly' be commander-in-chief one day.\n\nThe Democrat said: 'I am not done, I've not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now.'\n\nHarris also dismissed polls that put her as an outsider for the White House in 2028 behind former WWE wrestler turned actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. \n\nShe added: 'I think there are all kinds of polls that will tell you a variety of things, I've never listened to polls.\n\n'If I listen to polls I would not have run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here in this interview.'\n\nAccording to prediction market Polymarket, The Rock currently has a three percent chance of being the next president, Harris is ranked below him with two percent. \n\nHarris trails President Trump's daughter Ivanka, and other Democrats including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \n\nHarris was ridiculed for the interview almost immediately after it went live on social media.\n\n'Please let this be true, she will guarantee a JD victory', one commented, referring to her Republican successor JD Vance, who is leading prediction markets.\n\nAnother added: 'Hahaha, I didn't know she did comedy.'\n\nOne person said: 'Repeating the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

Back home he's facing a wave of revulsion from Americans following the surprise demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make way for his gaudy vanity ballroom, and a government shutdown that has no end in sight - and which the public blame Republicans for. So a nice few days away bragging about overseas investment, trying to avoid Mark Carney in the corridors of the ASEAN get-together is just what the President needs. Meanwhile, in Trumpworld It's starting to fall apart. Here's everything you need to know. Kamala Harris is considering running for President again, because she's \"not done.\" The former Vice President, who lost the 2024 election to Donald Trump, told the BBC she would \"possibly\" be President one day - her strongest indication yet that she is plotting another bid for the White House. She told Laura Kuenssberg she could \"for sure\" see a female president during the lifetime of her grandnieces. And asked if it would be her, she said: \"possibly.\" \"I am not done,\" she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\" While bookmakers have her as an outsider in the race to be the next Democratic Presidential candidate, polls put her out in front. A national polling average puts her 3.6 points ahead of the nearest rival, California Governor Gavin Newsom. Pete Buttigieg, who served as Biden's Transport Secretary, is a distant third on just 9.6%. Former Trump aide and whisperer Steve Bannon declared once again that the President will serve an illegal third term in office, and that's just something people need to come to terms with. He said in an interview: \"Well, he's gonna get a third term, so Trump '28. Trump is gonna be President in 28 and people just ought to get accommodated with that. There's a plan, and President Trump will be the President in 2028.\" Asked about the 22nd Amendment, which restricts Presidents to serving two terms in office, Bannon said: \"There's many different alternatives. At the appropriate time we'll lay out what the plan is. But there's a plan and President Trump will be the President in 2028.\" He went on: \"We had longer odds in 16 than longer odds in 24 than we have in 28. And President Trump will be the President of the United States, and the country needs him to be President of the United States. We need to finish what we started.\" He went on to argue Trump was literally sent by god, and is a \"vehicle of divine providence...an instrument of divine will\". Pressed for more detail on what the plan is, given Bannon's support for the text of the Constitution, he indicated a loophole could be found in the wording of the Amendment: \"We will define all those terms.\" He's been saying this for a while, but he said it in particularly stark terms. Bannon went on to suggest the only way to avoid the country falling into \"civil conflict\" is to rig elections and have the MAGA movement permanently \"seize\" the House of Representatives. I wish I was over interpreting, but here's the text of what he said: \"I think that to avoid actual civil conflict, which I think you're seeing right now, the harbinger of it, if you want to stop that you have to bind together tighter. We as a populist nationalist movement, the MAGA movement we need to do the redistricting fights, that's why I was down in Texas. We need to get the House in a situation that is permanently defendable by the MAGA movement. So it's a blocking mechanism. You move a maximalist strategy, with a sense of urgency, and you seize the institutions. And that's what we're doing right now.\" Speaking of which...the Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to keep tabs on next month's elections in California and New Jersey. Officials will watch polling operations at six counties in the two Democrat-run states - which are both holding off-year special elections in November. Jersey is holding an election for Governor, while California is holding a special referendum vote on its plan to redraw election districts - fending off Trump's boundary gerrymandering elsewhere in the country. But serious people are branding the move intimidation, election interference and a \"test run\" for next year's midterms. California's Democratic Party Chair, Rusty Hicks, called said: \"Sadly, we've come to expect it from a so-called party operating as little more of Trump fan club - [especially] in trying to rig the game before it's ever played.\" And New Jersey's Attorney General, Matthew Platkin said: \"Once again, we are prepared to ensure that all eligible New Jerseyans are able to cast their ballots without harassment, discrimination, or intimidation. Those seeking to disrupt the voting process will be held accountable.” Trump revealed yesterday that he's already raised $350m from donors to put towards his $300m vanity ballroom. So if he's raised more money than he needs to pay for the ballroom, where does that cash go? Oh, maybe on the Nazi-style triumphal 'Arc de Trump' he has planned for Washington DC. On the way to Malaysia, he told reporters: \"You know we're building the arc. Maybe we use it for the arc. We raised a lot of money for the ballroom, so maybe we'll put - the arc is going to be incredible for Washington DC, so maybe we use it for the arc.\" A company linked to Donald Trump Jr has been handed a Pentagon contract to manufacture 3,500 drone motors and other parts, the FT has revealed. Unusual Machines, in which Jr has owned a $4m stake, said the US Army had handed it a deal to make components for them next year. Jr was brought on as an advisor last November - and its share value almost tripled in price in the weeks before it was announced. It's not been confirmed whether he still holds the 331,580 shares he disclosed he owned at the time - and which would now be worth $4m. The firm says he \"did not advise or do anything else on this deal\". A spokesman added: \"Don has never communicated with anyone in the administration on behalf of Unusual Machines or about the contract in question. His advisory role with them has nothing to do with interfacing with the government.” Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker yesterday announced the creation of an \"accountability commission\" that would create a public record of what he called Trump's \"military-style assault on Chicago and our suburbs.\" The commission's members would also record the effect of the federal immigration crackdown on families and recommend actions to \"prevent further harm and pursue justice,\" he said. \"We hope to reveal to the public in Chicago, the state of Illinois, to people around the world the facts that are going on here,\" Pritzker said. \"We hope to create a detailed record of the truth.\" In response, White House Deputy Prince of Darkness Stephen Miller went thermonuclear, accusing Pritzker of 'seditious conspiracy' and threatening him, or anyone else who stands in his way, with arrest. Seditious Conspiracy is a civil war-era law, which makes it a crime for \"two or more people to conspire to overthrow, put down, or destroy by force the U.S. government, or to use force to oppose its authority, prevent the execution of its laws, or seize U.S. property.\" It was most recently used against Oath Keepers and Proud Boys leaders over the January 6th attack on the Capitol, and carries a prison term of up to 20 years. Asked what he'd charge Pritzker with on (where else) Fox News, Miller said: \"The answer I'm about to give doesn't only apply to Governor Pritzker, it applies to any state official, any local official, anybody who is acting in an official capacity who conspires or engages in activity that unlawfully impedes on federal law enforcement conducting their duties. So if you engage in a criminal conspiracy to obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws, or unlawfully order your own police officers or your own officials to try to interfere with ICE officers, or even to arrest ICE officers, you're engaging in criminal activity.\" He went on: \"Different crimes would apply. There's obstruction of justice, there is harbouring illegal aliens, there's impeding enforcement of our immigration laws, then as you get up the scale of behaviour you obviously get into seditious conspiracy charges depending on the conduct and many other offences.\" And he sent a message to ICE officers: \"You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties.

Asked outside the White House whether the administration would consider boots on the ground in Venezuela, Stephen Miller said: \"I would refer to what Secretary Hegseth said yesterday in terms of how the Department of War is viewing the issues of the strategies that have been used to fight these terrorists in the Western Hemisphere. I'll continue to reiterate that, I know you want more answers than I can provide.\" He added: \"The are terrorists and they're gonna be killed.\" Trump remains in a war of increasingly unhinged words with Canada, after a Canadian state government used Republican Party darling Ronald Reagan's own words in an attack ad opposing Trump's tariffs, which is now airing in US states. Last night, before heading to Malaysia, Trump straight up lied about Reagan's legacy, and said the video of him saying Tariffs were bad must be \"AI or something.\" \"They cheated on a commercial,\" he said. They absolutely did not. \"Ronald Reagan loved tariffs and they said he didn't.\" He absolutely didn't. \"And I guess it was AI or something,\" he mused. It was not. \"They cheated badly. Canada got caught cheating on a commercial. Can you believe it?\" No, Mr President, we can't. Because none of it is true. Don't believe us? Here's the transcript of the speech from which the ad quoted. Not a fan of reading? You can watch the whole thing below. It's not AI. Trump is taking a lot of heat from the beef industry - a very powerful lobby in the United States - after he floated the idea of bringing down grocery prices by importing more beef from Argentina. (This would have the added benefit of helping his buddy, Argentinian President Javier Milei, out of the financial hole his Trump-adjacent government has landed his country in). American ranchers, who are actually making money for the first time in ages, are understandably furious. So Trump has come up with a wizard wheeze. Government subsidies. That's right, the leader of the Republican Party is talking about direct subsidies for American businesses. Which for them is basically communism. \"We're going to subsidise them and we'll give them some money because it's not their fault,\" he said on the tarmac last night. \"They've been doing very well. They did very well under me. Even if you look at the ranchers, the ranchers for the first time in years have made some money, but the beef prices are up a little bit. So, we'll have to make a determination, but the ranchers are very happy because, you know, for many years they suffered. Now they're making a little money. They're making some money and that's a good thing. You know, I'm happy about that. So, we'll see. But we'll see beyond that point. We'll see.\" Argentina heads to the polls for a midterm election tomorrow, in which Milei is expected to be absolutely clobbered.","summary":"Steve Bannon explained how he thinks Trump will seize power again in 2028, and warned of violent consequences if that doesn't happen.

Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey as she hopes to keep Trenton in Democratic hands. Shapiro – who has announced he will run for reelection to Harrisburg in 2026 and has not officially indicated interest in a presidential bid – is one of several Democrats whose names repeatedly come up in such conversation – including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear. He was also the reported runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Kamala Harris' 2024 veepstakes. Shapiro lambasted antisemitic behavior at the University of Pennsylvania following the Hamas attack on Israel, while separately adding of Mamdani’s view of the Jewish State: \"You have to speak and act with moral clarity, and when supporters of yours say things that are blatantly antisemitic, you can’t leave room for that to just sit there.\" THE ONLY TWO DEMS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN 2025 ARE FORMER ROOMMATES WITH MIRRORING POLITICAL CAREERS While Shapiro has faced criticism from Republicans in his own state for supporting former Gov. Tom Wolf’s COVID-era shutdowns and for the current budget impasse, he’s also been a rare Democrat to earn praise from some in the GOP.

The self-defeating Russia hoax, the shameless, unnecessary politicization of Covid—both helped Mr. Trump.

If Democrats don’t understand this, America’s next leadership class won’t consist of Democrats. It will consist of Mr. Trump’s political descendants and heirs.\n\nAs usually happens in American history, and as the midway section of a president’s second (and last) term approaches, speculation is always rising to debate that president’s presumed successor.\n\nWhether George Washington or Abe Lincoln, or the 20th century’s Roosevelts, Reagan, Clinton or others, the thought always is “who is next?” And, importantly, the question underlying that is “how will the media deal with the next President?”\n\nThe hard, documented-in-reality fact is that the liberal media could not and cannot abide President Trump. From the moment candidate Trump descended that Trump Tower escalator in 2015 to the current days, the national media has had an impossible time stomaching first a potential and then an actual Trump presidency.\n\nAs noted in this space previously, just this month TIME magazine drew a presidential scolding for a cover that ran a Trump photo that was so obviously -- deliberately?-- unflattering to the President.\n\nThe question now is: How will the liberal media deal with a GOP Trump successor named J.D. Vance or Marco Rubio or someone else? For a media perpetually in love with the idea of a woman as Vice President, not to mention President, what if that person turns out to be Tennessee’s GOP Senator Marsha Blackburn? Or South Carolina’s GOP Rep. Nancy Mace? \n\n In fact, in terms of a GOP female VP or President that question has already been answered -- to the negative. As support for a GOP female on the 2008 GOP ticket with Senator John McCain rose, McCain’s choice of then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin quickly revealed the hostility of the national media to the idea of a female VP -- if, as with Palin, she was a conservative.\n\nAnd to the contrary, the selection by President Joe Biden of California’s Kamala Harris was adored by the liberal media because, in fact, Harris was a lefty.\n\nAll of which is to say, with Trump’s second and last term now underway, with the first of his last four years almost completed, there will be a subtle and sometimes not so subtle shift of media attention to the candidate emerging in the eyes of the media as the inevitable Trump successor.\n\nOne could suggest that this will be unfair, and yes it will surely be just that. But alas it will most certainly be inevitable as the liberal media starts probing what Vance or Rubio or some other potential GOP Trump successor did with that girl in the 9th grade or did they cheat on their tests to get into law school or whatever. Jen Psaki is already battering Vance as \"scarier\" than Trump, a \"little Manchurian Candidate\" with a wife that might need rescuing!\n\nSo as 2025 winds down, with the inevitable end-of-year holiday season almost at hand and the 2026 congressional/gubernatorial election season starting to dawn -- a signal in itself of the soon-to-be-looming 2028 presidential season -- be ready to read the tea leaves of media focus on who, exactly, Trump’s GOP successor may be. \n\nWill he or she become, Trump or Reagan style, such a dominating force in the media that there will be about them an air of inevitability? The belief that yet again America is about to have a President who so dominates the American and international scene that all others pale almost to insignificance?\n\nOctober has just about faded. The end two months of 2025 are arriving, with the 2026 elections dawning beyond that. Which is a signal all by itself to keep an eye on the American media and just who -- and what -- the liberal media focuses on.\n\nIn short: stay tuned. Change is on the horizon as various Republicans and Democrats jockey for position in the Post-Trump presidential sweepstakes. \n\nAnd you can be sure of one thing. As the Post-Trump era dawns? The media are watching, and ready to pounce.","summary":"The Wall Street Journal gets it.\n\nIn Friday’s edition, Journal columnist Holman Jenkins Jr. closed his column by saying, more than accurately, this, with bold print for emphasis supplied: \n\n\nI’m guessing many flyover Democrats have long seen the party’s blunder in associating itself too closely with the national media. The self-defeating Russia hoax, the shameless, unnecessary politicization of Covid—both helped Mr. Trump.
