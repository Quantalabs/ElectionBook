I don't like it...'\nA confused Ashley then responded: 'It was a compliment. Do you ever step back and think, 'Maybe, I've got that wrong?'\n'I feel like I am really, really working hard at changing how I say things, but the only thing I've asked you to change is to see me for who I am.'\nGrace then butted in to say: 'I can't do this. We're just going round the houses as we always do.'\nAshley later told the cameras: 'This girl is never going to see me for who I am and if you never see me for who I am, what am I doing here?'\nAs he left for the couple swap he then told her: 'I'm upset because I feel like I've done everything I possibly can to change your mind on the way you see me. I've just had a realisation that I don't think it's going to change.'\nAn emotional Grace then said to the camera: 'He doesn't take accountability… We clearly need some time apart because I am getting sick of it now.' \nAfter the heated rows many reacted on X saying: 'God this is red flag behaviour.',\n'Ashley needs to run asap.',\n\nAfter the heated rows many reacted on X saying: 'God this is red flag behaviour', 'Ashley needs to run asap'\n\nThe pair have clashed on their morals and values and on Monday's episode the pair spoke to the show's experts about their problems after teetering on the edge of nearly quitting the show\n\nOn Tuesday's instalment ahead of the couple swap exercise they had yet another huge argument\n'Ashley is so defeated.

One of the things that was so important to me coming into this, was being with a partner that brings out the very best in me.\n'I really felt like we were bringing out the worst in each other.\n'We'd agreed that we were both done, and when we tried to get back together, we had another huge big argument. \n'I felt like I was losing myself a little bit. I think I was focusing on the negative, when we do have so much positive.\n'Although I started to feel like I couldn't see the wood from the trees, I was getting really lost. \n'I knew if we left I would miss you so much, I don't want to be apart from you, so I have chosen to stay.'\n\nIt comes after Grace broke down in tears after the 'hardest week' of the experiment so far - and admitted that her and husband Ashley were 'bringing out the worst in each other' \nAshley went on to share his views, explaining that he was growing strong feelings and wanted to also stay. \nWhen the pair said 'I do' last month, it didn't get off to a good start as Grace burst into tears at the wedding and fans blasted the experts for a 'mismatch'.\nFeminist Grace thought that the pair had opposing views, but Ashley has changed where he can to make sure that she is happy. \nBut recently Ashley and April's interest in one another caused concern for Grace. \nMarried At First Sight Australia\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMarried At First Sight viewers brand Grace a 'red flag' as her relationship with Ashley continues down a toxic path: 'He needs to run ASAP!'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:09 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:00:09 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nThe technical challenge is always the round the bakers fear the most, and this week the semi final turned into a disaster during Tuesday's episode. \nThe four remaining contestants Toby, Aaron, Tom and Jasmine battled it out for a place in the final round as temperatures soared in the famous tent. \nThe Technical challenge saw them take on a tricky framboisier cake where Jasmine come out on top with the most impressive version.\nHowever the others weren't so lucky as fans took to Twitter deeming the challenge 'That’s the first car crash technical ever'. \nJudges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood challenged them to make the French layer cake which consisted of a pistachio mousseline, sponge cake and fresh raspberries. \nIf that wasn't enough the bake also had to be topped with a fondant flower and crystal sugar dome. \n\nThe Great British Bake Off fans have been left raging after Tuesday night's 'ridiculous' technical challenge as even judges Paul and Prue deemed the cakes a 'disaster'\n\nThe Technical challenge saw them take on a tricky framboisier cake where Jasmine come out on top with the most impressive version\nDespite it being the semi final, the bakers found themselves in a flounder as Toby's cake failed to hold shape and melted into a puddle. \nAaron's also collapsed, while both Tom and Jasmine's were missing the sugar dome the judges had asked for. \nPrue and Paul even ruled the challenge as a disaster as Prue reflected: 'The technical was a bit of a surprise. We had a couple of disasters there.' \nAs going into the Showstopper Paul commented: 'Jasmine is the only one in a fairly safe position.'\nTaking to Twitter fans criticised the choice as they penned: 'What a ridiculous technical to expect them to make. I think one of the worst'\n'Toby’s cake looks like Shrek has thrown up on his plate'; 'Poor Toby. Wanna give him a hug';\n'Tonight's #GBBO technical challenge had me in absolute stitches'; 'A ridiculous Technical Challenge this week'; 'That technical was an embarrassment !!';\n'Every single SEMI FINALIST completely messing up the technical just goes to show how stupidly difficult and fast the producers make these challenges!!!!!';\n\nDespite it being the semi final, the bakers found themselves in a flounder as Toby's cake failed to hold shape and melted into a puddle\n\nPrue and Paul even ruled the challenge as a disaster as Prue reflected: 'The technical was a bit of a surprise. We had a couple of disasters there'\n\nTaking to Twitter fans criticised the choice as they penned: 'What a ridiculous technical to expect them to make. I think one of the worst'\n\nUnfortunately Toby was sent packing after failing to impress the judges as he broke down in tears at the end of the show\n'As a Showstopper that would be ridiculous. As a technical ? I’m sorry, no home baker could do that. Kudos to those in the tent';\nUnfortunately Toby was sent packing after failing to impress the judges, while Jasmine was named Star Baker.\nAfter his exit a tearful Toby said: 'I made it a tough decision for them they said so that is good. The best thing about this tent is the other people.'\nPrue and Paul said it was the toughest decision they had to make all series so far when they picked Toby to go. \nPatisserie week saw the semi-finalists make cream horns, glass domes and showstopping macarons but only three made it through.\nFor the Showstopper they had to make a macaron tower with at least 30 macarons. The structure had to represent something meaningful to them.\nAaron was struggling after one batch went wrong and he had to quickly redo everything for his sloth-themed creation. \nViewers will have to tune in to next week's final to see who will come out on top and win the whole competition. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Great British Bake Off fans left raging after 'ridiculous' technical challenge as even judges Paul and Prue deem cakes a 'disaster'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email kylie.stevens@dailymail.com.au \nBy KYLIE STEVENS, SENIOR BREAKING NEWS REPORTER, AUSTRALIA \n Published:23:34 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:23:49 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nSunrise host Nat Barr has questioned how an elderly woman could have allegedly been left behind by a cruise ship before she was found dead on a tourist island. \nAuthorities have launched an investigation into the death of the Coral Expeditions passenger, 80, at Lizard Island off the Far North Queensland coast on Saturday.\nThe solo traveller, who was on an $80,000 trip, was hiking up to the Cook's Look summit with fellow passengers when she needed to stop and became lost while making her back to the ship.\nShe was reported missing after she failed to return to the Coral Adventurer anchored offshore, sparking a land and sea search that continued well into the night and early hours of the morning.\nHer body was located 50m off the walking track and retrieved from the mountain the following day, sparking many questions about safety protocols.\nBoaties anchored near the island on Saturday claimed that the woman was left behind by the ship before the vessel returned hours later to search for her by torchlight.\nThey also claimed that a headcount was conducted by crew when snorkelling passengers returned to the boat, but not those who had gone to the island. \nBarr asked the question on everyone's mind when a cruising expert appeared on the program on Wednesday.\n\nNat Barr has asked the question on everyone's mind after the tragic death of a cruise ship passenger on Lizard Island on Saturday\n\nThe woman's body was found 50m off the walking track on Lizard Island's Cook's Look summit Pictured is the search on Sunday\n'How does something like this happen?' she asked.\nCruising expert Adrian Tassone admitted he had no idea how it could have occurred.\n'That's something I'm really struggling to understand myself,' he said.\n'Cruise lines in normal operation will always know who is on the ship and who isn't.\n'If the reports are to be believed and this woman was left on the island, I really can't understand how that occurred.\n'It's something that most people are questioning and are trying to come to grips with.'\nMr Tassone said that many cruise companies have strict systems in place, such as headcounts, to ensure all passengers are accounted for at all times.\nThe Coral Adventurer, which has capacity for 120 guests, is currently on a 60-night circumnavigation of Australia, having departed Cairns last week.\n'It's unusual for numbers to not be known and checked, but I think what's important in this instance is that it's an expedition cruise,' Mr Tassone said.\n\nAdrian Tassone, also known as The Cruise and Travel Guy, says the tragic death of a cruise ship passenger on Lizard Island has left many unanswered questions\n\nBoaties have claimed that cruise ship crew did a headcount of snorkelling passengers returning to the vessel but not those who explored Lizard Island (pictured)\n'It's atypical from the regular cruise environment.\n'This ship held a maximum of 120 passengers, so I struggle to understand how a headcount wasn't conducted. \n'Typically, you get on a cruise ship and you scan a card that is your key card, which indicates when you're on and off the ship. Those manifests I understand are across all cruise lines. \n'I don't know if Coral Expeditions operates in a different manner to that, but I am really surprised something more robust isn't in place that should have prevented this from happening.'\nA Coral Expeditions spokesman told Daily Mail he was unable to comment further while investigations are underway.\n'While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,' chief executive Mark Fifield said in a statement on Tuesday.\n'The Coral team has been in contact with the woman's family, and we will continue to offer support to them through this difficult process.\n'We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is underway.'\n\nThe woman was reported missing hours after she failed to return to the Coral Adventurer (vessel pictured)\nThe woman was on her first stop of a 60-day, $80,000-a-ticket trip around Australia when she died.\nTraci Ayris and her partner were anchored off the island on Saturday when they began listening to radio transmissions sent from the Coral Expeditions' vessel. \n'They did headcounts for snorkellers (which we heard) but not for other guests on the island it would seem,' she told the Cairns Post.\n'The last people came down from the track and got into tender then the (ship) left very soon after that.\n'We even commented, \"Wow they left fast\".'\nShe claimed the vessel didn't return to search for the missing passenger until later that night.\nPolice are treating the woman's death as non-suspicious and will prepare a report for the Coroner.\nPopular with divers, snorkellers and hikers, Lizard Island is one of the most remote tourism destinations on the Great Barrier Reef.\nCook's Look is the highest point on the island and follows the footsteps of British explorer Captain James Cook, who is believed to be the first European to have trekked up the mountain in 1770 after his ship Endeavour struck a reef.\nLaunched in 2019, the Coral Adventurer cruise ship has a capacity of up to 120 passengers and 46 crew.\nThe ship is currently en route to Darwin, where it will be met by Australian Maritime Safety Authority officials investigating the tragedy.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNat Barr asks the question everyone wants answered after woman was allegedly left behind by a cruise ship and died on Lizard Island in Australia\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It doesn't make any sense to me that because we have to fight Trump, to become Trump. Two wrongs don't make a right.\"\n\nWhile governor, Schwarzenegger was behind a successful state ballot measure in 2010 that gave constitutional power to draw congressional maps to an independent commission and out of the hands of politicians. \n\nNewsom's Prop 50 would bypass the commission and let Democrats redraw congressional district lines, claiming in ads that it is necessary to defeat Trump's alleged influence over gerrymandering in Texas.\n\nCalifornia currently has 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans in Congress, which would likely be reduced to 3 Republican seats under the state Democratic Party's newly redrawn plan.'Extreme Gerrymandering'Schwarzenegger went on to fume about how Democrats have gerrymandered districts in other states so that there's little Republican representation in Congress despite solid support for the party. \n\n\"There is such extreme gerrymandering going on that in a state like Massachusetts, it has like 40 percent of the people voting for Trump, they only — they have zero representatives. The Republican Party has zero representatives sent to the House — think about that,\" the Predator star scoffed.\n\n\"In New Mexico, 45 percent of the people voted for Trump and vote Republican, and zero [are] sent to the House, zero representatives from the Republican Party,\" Schwarzenegger pointed out.'He Will Divide'Schwarzenegger going against a plan meant to foil Trump and Republican representation in Congress might surprise some. Despite being a moderate Republican as governor, the Austrian native openly endorsed Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris for president in 2024. \n\n\"I don't really do endorsements. I’m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don’t trust most politicians,\" Schwarzenegger began in a lengthy October 2024 post on X.\n\nAcknowledging, \"I don't like either party right now,\" the Hollywood superstar said a Trump second term would \"just be four more years of bull---- with no results that make us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.\"\n\n\"We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump won't do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger,\" the former politician added.","summary":"The former California governor got into a heated exchange with the CNN anchor over the state's Democrat gerrymandering plan.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/arnold-schwarzenegger-accuses-democrats-rigging-elections-jake-tapper/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Wc7ZmfBLn/0x0/arnold-schwarzenegger-jake-tapper-cnn-debate-gerrymandering-1761686920034.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:24:53","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":373532572,"title":"CNN anchor warns Harris will struggle with ‘authenticity,’ burned bridges if she runs again","text":"CNN host Abby Phillip warned on Tuesday's \"The Breakfast Club\" that if former Vice President Kamala Harris runs for president again, her campaign will be haunted by the bridges she burned with her tell-all book. As the Democratic Party still seeks a new leader to rally around since its defeat last November, many have speculated that Harris plans to run again. Harris and former President Biden’s occasional public appearances have received mixed reception from their Democratic allies, who often argue their post-election comments are not helpful. Harris has caused a particularly salient stir with her tell-all book \"107 Days,\" sharing her whirlwind experience of campaigning after Biden stepped down from the ticket. \"I think that there are a lot of bridges that are burned here whether she wanted to or not. And I think it will be very difficult for her to mend those fences that she'll need in order to run if she does decide to run again. I think this book read kind of like somebody who was kind of done with it. So I will be interested to see if she decides to do it,\" Phillip said. WASHINGTON POST SLAMS KAMALA HARRIS BOOK TOUR, SAYS DEMS DON'T 'HAVE TIME TO WASTE' ON FORMER VP \"I think that she still has to figure out how to tap into authenticity in how she presents herself to the public because this world is not getting more kind to politicians who cannot level with voters and cannot show up any and everywhere,\" she added. Phillip recalled a recent piece about New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani about how politicians in the modern era are expected to speak well in everything from short soundbites to lengthy interviews. \"I think that she still has work to do in that respect, and maybe this book is the first kind of foray into that, because I read her last book, and the tone was completely different,\" Phillip said. \"This is a different kind of book, and it was an opening foray into her showing people more of herself, but she's going to have to catch up to the speed and the kind of realness of media and politics that will be the bar in 2028. Like in 2028, the bar is going to be, ‘Are you a politician that can show up any and everywhere and authentically reach people?’\" \"I think she is still straddling the old world and the new world, and she's going to have to figure out which one she wants to be in,\" Phillip suggested. FROM TELL ALL TO END ALL: FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS’ 5 BIG CAREER MISTAKES She went on to warn that going forward, politicians need to be willing to take risks and do unscripted interviews with people who may be hostile, knowing some can be won over and some will not go well. \"I'm just telling you, it's that was not how they ran that last campaign,\" she said. \"No, they didn’t,\" host Charlamagne Tha God agreed. \"Period. It wasn’t,\" Phillip said. Representatives for Harris didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The CNN host went on to contrast her with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who she argued, demonstrated his ability to bring on conservatives to his podcast and endure criticism from his own side for doing so. \"You've got to prove to people that you can win the argument. And if you can't do that, it doesn't matter how polished you are, how experienced or knowledgeable you are. I think that's the baseline bar that you're going to have to cross for a lot of voters in this future media ecosystem,\" she said.","summary":"Abby Phillip says Kamala Harris must prove she can authentically connect with voters and mend damaged relationships before considering another presidential run.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-anchor-warns-harris-struggle-authenticity-burned-bridges-she-runs-again","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/KAMALA-HARRIS-SPEAKING.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:09:24","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.076},{"id":373527136,"title":"CNN host warns Harris must contend with burned bridges, struggle for authenticity if she runs again","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n3 Play Sameday October 28, 2025 00:46 \n\n CNN host warns Harris must contend with burned bridges, struggle for authenticity if she runs again \n CNN host Abby Phillip warned that former Vice President Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle if she runs again, ranging from the burned bridges after her tell-all book to the changing media landscape that demands authenticity and risk taking.\n Tags V-VIDEOMEDIAFOOD","summary":"CNN host Abby Phillip warned that former Vice President Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle if she runs again, ranging from the burned bridges after her tell-all book to the changing media landscape that demands authenticity and risk taking.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6384209154112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/0af0a779-9b59-4b02-9cf0-f639a030363a/52d41f35-31ab-4b04-b688-3418ddda4a4d/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 22:56:16","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.442},{"id":373526382,"title":"Lily Allen reveals she's back on the dating scene after split from husband David Harbour - but admits she's already been BANNED from Hinge","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogwalker who was knifed to death in Uxbridge is named as it is revealed Afghan national arrested over triple stabbing had arrived in the UK in a lorry in 2020 and been granted asylum\n\nJamaica officially declared 'disaster area' as Hurricane Melissa leaves 7 dead and 500k without power - with 25,000 tourists stranded\n\nDesigner claims she was thrown out of Hobbycraft store after questioning an employee's 'no TERFs, no Tories' badge - and says manager told her to 'read a biology textbook'\n\nRachel Reeves MUST end her wicked games over raiding your pension: Thousands are cashing in lump sums in a blind panic and don't realise the cost.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JESSICA JANES, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:22:13 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:22:38 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nIt's been a challenging year for Lily Allen following her split from husband David Harbour, after it emerged he had a three-year affair with a costume designer.\nNow, the singer, 40, who dropped her fifth studio album West End Girl last week, has revealed she's back on the dating scene.\nHowever, it seems her celebrity status is proving a problem when it comes to using dating apps in a bid to find love. \nWhen asked if she was currently seeing anyone, Lily laughed before teasing Interview Magazine: 'Maybe.'\nOpening up about navigating online dating while healing from heartbreak, she admitted: 'They're awful, especially if you're going through heartbreak.\n'There is nothing more depressing than hundreds of people that are nothing like the person that you're missing. It's just like, \"No, that's not him. That's not him. That's not him\".'\n\nLily Allen has revealed she's back on the dating scene following her split from her husband David Harbour (pictured this month)\n\nThe singer, 40, and The Stranger Things actor, 50, split in December 2024 after four years of marriage (pictured in 2023)\nThe Smile hitmaker also revealed she was banned from Hinge for 'impersonating herself', explaining that her name doesn't match the one on her ID, meaning she couldn't verify her profile.\nIt comes after Lily dropped a huge hint that she has mended her relationship with David, 50, as she insisted she doesn't want 'revenge' on him in a new interview.\nThe singer, whose new album is about her ex-husband's affair and their split, insisted that her new music isn't meant to be 'cruel' and said she didn't feel like she was being 'mean' by sharing an insight into their break-up publicly.\nDuring a chat with Interview magazine, Lily claimed she now feels 'differently' about their marriage breakdown, after first penning the record in 10 days last December. \nLily's new insight into her former relationship came as her former partner was spotted with her children, Ethel, 13, and Marnie, 12, at Epic Universe in Orlando, Florida, leading to speculation that there had been peace talks between the former couple.\nWhen asked whether the new album is a 'revenge tour', Lily said: 'It isn't. I mean, I wrote this record in 10 days in December, and I feel very differently about the whole situation now. We all go through breakups, and it's always f***ing brutal.\n'But I don't think it's that often that you feel inclined to write about it while you're in it.'\n'That's what's fun about this record; it's viscerally like going through the motions. At the time, I was really trying to process things, and that's great in terms of the album, but I don't feel confused or angry now. I don't need revenge.\n\nWhen asked if she was currently seeing anyone, Lily laughed before teasing Interview Magazine: 'Maybe' (pictured last month)\n\nShe also opened up about navigating online dating while healing from heartbreak, admitting: 'They're awful, especially if you're going through heartbreak. There is nothing more depressing than hundreds of people that are nothing like the person that you're missing' (pictured in June)\n'It's not a cruel album. I don't feel like I'm being mean. It was just the feelings I was processing at the time.'\nLily's interview comes as David was said to have been seen with her daughters in a video believed to have been taken on Sunday.\nIt was an astonishing turn of events considering the same weekend he's looking after her children, Lily released her fifth studio album, West End Girl, which publicly humiliates David and brands him a cheating 'sex addict'.\nBut this marked the first public sign of easing tension between the former couple, as it appeared David is still a part of her children's lives despite their bitter break-up.\nLily, who claimed the album is a mix of both fact and fiction, was previously asked by Vogue if David was planning on continuing his stepfather role to her kids. \nLily replied 'You'll have to ask him', but the outing suggested that David still has an active role in her daughter's lives.\nLily has caused a huge stir with her no-holds-barred record West End Girl, which details the breakdown of her marriage to the Stranger Things star.\nThe fallout from their split is revealed in explicit and brutally honest lyrics, where Lily recalls discovering he had cheated on her by finding messages on his phone.\n\nLily's marriage broke down last December after she accused David of having multiple affairs including a three-year affair with a younger costume designer (pictured in 2023)\n\n Lily Allen hints she has mended her relationship with ex David Harbour as she defends 'cruel' album and denies seeking revenge with explicit lyrics \nLily references a mistress called Madeline, who is apparently a construct of several people and seemingly lies at the heart of the issue between her and David.\nCommenting on reports of David being seen out with the children while Lily promotes her new music, some shared their confusion underneath the TikTok post.\nOne person wrote: 'So while she's out there humiliating him, Harbour is on vacation with her kids? I can't cope with this.'\nAnother said: 'So he's there with Lily's children while she promotes an album.'\nAlready at the top of the UK iTunes album charts, the songs have been streamed more than eight million times worldwide on Spotify since their release on Friday. \nTheir troubling relationship started as a dream come true for the unlucky-in-love singer.\nA year after they met, the pair wed in Las Vegas, joined only by Ethel and Marnie, and Lily shared pictures of her daughters celebrating by eating hamburgers outside the chapel with their new step-father.\nBut, as she alleges in the 'tell-all' album, her landing a role in 2:22 A Ghost Story on the West End in 2021 cemented the beginning of the end, as he was unsupportive and asked for an open marriage, but eventually 'broke the rules' and cheated on her.\nNow public enemy number one, the internet is awash with calls for David's whereabouts, imagining him hauled up in his Brooklyn apartment, ordering take-out to the Brooklyn townhouse they once shared [but are now selling] and cowering with shame.\nDavid, who has no children of his own but grew close to Allen's daughters over their four-year marriage, was reportedly not keeping a low profile and chatting to fans at the theme park as he accompanied the girls and a group of their friends.\nMeanwhile, Lily has been celebrating the release of the album, recorded in Los Angeles, by giving various interviews across the Atlantic, discussing David and her daughters.\nDavid HarbourLily Allen\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLily Allen reveals she's back on the dating scene after split from husband David Harbour - but admits she's already been BANNED from Hinge\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 50\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:22:04 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:22:15 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nThe latest Big Brother nomination results have been revealed ahead of this Friday's double live eviction with fans taking to Twitter to share their opinions. \nDuring Tuesday's episode it was revealed that Zelah, Farida and Richard will be the next housemates to face the public vote. \nFarida received five nominations from Marcus, Nancy, Richard, Teja and Zelah and Richard received five nominations from Caroline, Elsa, Farida, Nancy and Sam.\nHowever it was actually Tate who received the third highest number of nominations, after he got votes from Farida, Sam and Teja.\nHowever, on Monday Caroline purchased the Save and Replace token from the EyeDeal Mini Mart which gave her the power to save one Housemate from eviction and replace them with another. \nCaroline then decided to save Tate for 'sexual reasons' as she told housemates: 'He does cook for me and I think when we get out of here we will have sex, or at least a fumble.\n\nBig Brother nomination results REVEALED: Housemates Zelah, Farida and Richard set to face double live eviction as fans hit out at Caroline's sexual comments during Tuesday's episode \n\nCaroline then decided to save Tate for 'sexual reasons' as she told housemates: 'He does cook for me and I think when we get out of here we will have sex, or at least a fumble'\n'So I will save you for sexual reasons.' \nShe then decided to nominate Zelah for the reason that he won't get voted out. Hitting back Zelah replied: 'I don't think it's fair to pick someone because you don't think they will go out.' \nFans took to Twitter to share their disgust at her 'sexual' comment as they penned: 'did she just say she saved tate for sexual reasons??? \n'what the actual f**k, if that was a man saying that to a woman, they’d have been practically thrown out that front door';\n'Caroline: I'm saving Tate for sexual reasons Delusional much?'; 'oh god tate i am so sorry you had to hear those words from her mouth run as far as you can mate';\n'Caroline saving TATE???'.\nOthers shared their support for Richard and Farida as they penned: 'We might lose either Richard or Farida on Friday'; 'i mean we’re voting to save Farida regardless right…??' \nBut others also wanted Zelah to stay as they added: 'Time to save Richard and Zelah' \n\n Richard (pictured) received five nominations from Caroline, Elsa, Farida, Nancy and Sam\n\nFarida (pictured) received five nominations from Marcus, Nancy, Richard, Teja and Zelah \n\nFans took to Twitter to share their disgust at her 'sexual' comment as they penned: 'did she just say she saved tate for sexual reasons???'\n\nOthers shared their support for Richard and Farida as they penned: 'We might lose either Richard or Farida on Friday'; 'i mean we’re voting to save Farida regardless right…??'\n\n Big Brother viewers left in hysterics after Elsa claims she's had SEX with a demon \n'Not that I want Zelah to go but I kinda hope he does just so the whole house turns on Caroline for putting him in that position';\n'Caroline is a bully i stg and leave zelah alone man'; 'This IS TERRIBLE I want all 3 of Richard Zelah and Farida to stay'.\nVoting for Friday’s eviction opens at 10pm on Tuesday Oct 28 with viewers being asked to vote for the Housemate they wish to save from eviction. \nCaroline and Zelah came to blows earlier in the series after she was issued with a formal warning for offensive language after making transphobic comments to Zelah. \nA game of spin the bottle ended disastrously after music PR Caroline, 56, made extremely transphobic remarks. \nAs the bottle landed on Nancy, Caroline asked: 'If you could sh** anyone in the House, no no we're on a desert island and there is one person left, you might be able to make babies to get a new civilisation, who would you sh**?' \nNancy, who is pansexual, answered that she is most attracted to Zelah, who is a transgender man.\nCaroline then leapt out of her seat and made the transphobic remark, shouting at Zelah: 'She's a girl.' She later added: 'But you haven't got a willy. Is that really bad?'\n\nThe following day, Big Brother pulled Caroline into the Diary Room and reprimanded her for 'offensive and unacceptable' language and behaviour, before telling her she was on a formal warning and if similar comments were made again she would be at risk of being removed from the house. \nViewers were horrified by the scenes, writing: 'My heart broke for Zelah and it was totally out of order from Caroline. A formal warning was not enough!';\n'She should be removed for that. Blatant transphobia dressed up as ignorance. Absolutely VILE,';\n'I can just tell zelah is constantly biting his tongue, not defending himself or saying anything because he knows he’ll get painted as \"aggressive\" just because he’s trans. it’s so sad he has every right to defend himself,';\n'Caroline is a nasty piece of work. It only took one drink for her to show her true colours,';\n'Caroline should surely be removed for that comment….' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBig Brother nomination results REVEALED: Housemates Zelah, Farida and Richard set to face double live eviction as fans hit out at Caroline's sexual comments\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

A new YouGov/Economist poll released Tuesday, which surveyed 1,623 adults from October 24-27, found that inflation and prices remain the top issue for Americans, followed by jobs and the economy.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nOn his podcast, Hammer, a financial expert, audits the finances of guests who have found themselves in difficult economic situations and helps them create budgets. He disagreed with the hairstylist, identified as Lynn from Missouri, that her $40,000 in debt is “because of the last election.”\n\nLynn explained that concerns about a recession under Trump and inflation have impacted her business. Lately, people are choosing to spend their money on groceries rather than hair appointments. She said that her boyfriend’s work in the construction industry has also come to a halt. \n\nHammer said it has more to do with high interest rates than with any policy enacted by Trump, and described her explanation as a “cope.” He said he understands the argument that people may pull back on services like hairstyling, but that he feels she was “overexaggerating the potential impact of what things are like in this exact moment.”\n\n“This isn’t Great Recession,” he said.\n\nHammer said that people “think the president has a lot more impact than they do.”\n\n“People get hyperpolitical and excited online,” he said. “But you know, it’s like, it’s whatever. But we’re on the same trajectory and trend that we have been in terms of job numbers added on a monthly basis. We would be almost in a very similar economic thing we’re in right now, if [former Vice President Kamala Harris] was president as well.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks in the White House on June 5, 2025.\n\nHammer argued that personal decisions about spending and Lynn’s decision not to work at a higher-paying company had much more to do with her debt than any of Trump’s economic actions or broader economic forces.\n\nPolls do show that many other Americans remain concerned about the economy.\n\nTuesday’s YouGov/Economist poll found that 23 percent of Americans believe inflation remains the most important political issue for them, followed by 14 percent who say jobs and the economy are the most important.\n\n It found that most Americans are unhappy with Trump’s performance on the matter—57 percent of respondents disapproved of his handling of jobs and the economy, compared to only 35 percent who approved of his approach to the issue. Sixty-one percent disapproved and 31 percent approved of Trump’s handling of inflation, the poll found. \n\nThe poll had a margin of error of ±3.4 percentage points.\n\nMeanwhile, a Quinnipiac University poll found that 57 percent of Americans disapprove of the way he is handling the economy, while 38 percent gave him positive marks. The poll surveyed 1,327 registered voters from October 16 to October 20 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nCaleb Hammer said during the episode of Financial Audit: “When you’re actually interested in learning instead of immediately going into politics of good guy, bad guy, my team, your team, you actually get to learn things and blame things. Some food prices are down. Some food prices are up. Coffee is dramatically high. Eggs went high, have relatively come back down. Not perfectly. Meat is up. Some produce, berries are down.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this month: “Democrats have SHUT DOWN the United States Government right in the midst of one of the most successful Economies, including a Record Stock Market, that our Country has ever had. This has sadly affected so many programs, services, and other elements of Society that Americans rely on — And it should not have happened. I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe U.S. economy remains a key political issue the Trump administration will face going into the 2026 midterms.","summary":"A 31-year-old hairstylist sparred with &quot;Financial Audit&quot; host Caleb Hammer about whether Trump is to blame for her money woes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/woman-blames-donald-trump-40000-debt-10955302","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2218789844-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 22:00:55","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":373512010,"title":"The Great British Bake Off: Toby Littlewood breaks down after being eliminated in tense semi final as Tom, Jasmine and Aaron become finalists","text":"Home and Garden\n\nStrictly Come Dancing\n\nBig Brother\n\nGreat British Bake Off\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great British Bake Off: Toby Littlewood breaks down after being eliminated in tense semi final as Tom, Jasmine and Aaron become finalists\n\nHave YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:21:25 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:21:41 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nThe Great British Bake Off finalists were revealed on Tuesday night's episode as Patisserie Week pushed the contestants to their limits.\nThe semi-final saw Toby, Aaron, Tom and Jasmine battle it out for a place in the final round as temperatures soared in the famous tent.\nUnfortunately Toby was sent packing after failing to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith as much as the others, while Jasmine was named Star Baker.\nAfter his exit a tearful Toby said: 'I made it a tough decision for them they said so that is good. The best thing about this tent is the other people.'\nPrue and Paul said it was the toughest decision they had to make all series so far when they picked Toby to go. \nPatisserie week saw the semi-finalists make cream horns, glass domes and showstopping macarons but only three made it through.\n\nThe Great British Bake Off's Toby Littlewood broke down in tears as he was eliminated in the tense semi final on Tuesday night\n\nTom, Jasmine and Aaron have now made the last three and will battle it out at next week's tense final\nThe Technical challenge saw them take on a tricky framboisier cake where Jasmine come out on top with the most impressive version.\nFor the Showstopper they had to make a macaron tower with at least 30 macarons. The structure had to represent something meaningful to them.\nAaron was struggling after one batch went wrong and he had to quickly redo everything for his sloth-themed creation. \nViewers will have to tune in to next week's final to see who will come out on top and win the whole competition. \nA teaser at the end of the semi final teased some drama in the tent. \nIt comes after last week Iain Ross narrowly missed out on a place in the semifinals as he was eliminated.\nThe remaining amateur bakers battled it out in the tent for Dessert Week.\nUnfortunately for Iain, aka 'Yeastie Boy', he became the one to leave the show.\n\nAfter his exit a tearful Toby said: 'I made it a tough decision for them they said so that is good.

So to make it to the quarter-finals is something that I couldn't ever have thought of.\n\n The Great British Bake Off: Iain Ross eliminated from famous tent in tense quarter finals during Dessert Week as he narrowly misses out on a place in the semi final \n'We have had the best group of Bakers. We have made really really good friends, and we always have a laugh. It's just been fantastic.\n'I had accepted when Noel walked into the tent that it was going to be me going home, so I was just waiting for him to say it. \n'I felt like it was my time and I was just grateful to have gotten as far as I did.\n'The other bakers were absolute gems and we were all so close, I wasn't even really sad when it happened so we all were able to have a laugh about me getting out of doing Patisserie week!\n'We have a wee group chat where everyone writes lovely messages whenever someone leaves.\n'So it was great to see everyone's kind words!'\nHis elimination came after it was announced that medical student Jasmine was that week's Star Baker.\n\nIt comes after last week Iain Ross narrowly missed out on a place in the semifinals as he was eliminated \nDuring the show, the bakers took a trip to Spain in the Signature as they were tasked with baking the perfect Basque style cheesecake. \nIn the Technical, Prue set a particularly perilous pudding challenge with a gluten free sponge.\nFinally, for the Showstopper the bakers were faced with creating a highly elaborate free-standing trifle.\nThe week before viewers watched as Lesley Holloway was sent packing from the famous tent. \nPaul HollywoodPrue LeithGreat British Bake Off\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Great British Bake Off: Toby Littlewood breaks down after being eliminated in tense semi final as Tom, Jasmine and Aaron become finalists\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 12\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Before Ex-Veep's Humiliating Loss to Trump","text":"Former President Barack Obama was reluctant to endorse Kamala Harris after Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race.\n\nNow, RadarOnline.com can report Obama was convinced the vice-president didn't stand a chance against Donald Trump – and he turned out to be right.After Biden made his shocking decision, Obama called for patience before rushing to announce a new Democratic nominee. \n\nVeteran ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl reveals in his new book Retribution: Donald Trump and the Campaign That Changed America, Obama was hoping for an in-depth \"process\" to determine who would run.\n\nHowever, after Harris was announced as the new nominee, prominent Democrats rushed to share their approval. \n\nA senior Biden adviser, who also worked in the Obama White House, told Karl that the real reason Obama didn't want to endorse Harris automatically was because he didn't think the vice president could win. \n\n\"There's only one Black Jesus,\" the senior Biden adviser said, seemingly referring to Obama's popularity as the first Black president.Oh No, Obama!Karl writes that Obama became enraged when former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced her backing of Vice President Harris, just one day after Biden exited the race, \n\n\"The Obamas were not happy,\" a Pelosi confidant told Karl. \"This person summed up Obama's message to Pelosi as, essentially, 'What the f--- did you just do?'\"\n\nHowever, it seems Harris wasn't Pelosi's first choice either. Karl writes that Pelosi privately told Biden in 2020 that she had reservations about him picking her as his running mate. \n\nBut after several major Democrats also quickly endorsed Harris, Pelosi had to cave in as well.\n\n\"She had no choice,\" Karl wrote about Pelosi’s endorsement. \"No other candidates had stepped forward – Kamala Harris was it. The only thing Pelosi could do was try to help her win the election.\"Failure to CommunicateThe speedy endorsement surprised Obama, who thought he and Pelosi had been in \"regular communication\" about the future of the Democratic party, as it began to appear inevitable that the then 81-year-old Biden was planning to call it a day.\n\nKarl writes: \"They agreed Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged.\n\n\"Therefore, Obama and Pelosi - arguably the two most influential figures in the Democratic Party - had privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements.\"\n\nHowever, once Biden announced his stunning decision to end his campaign, Pelosi told Obama, \"That train has left the station.\"Harris 2028?Harris would go on to lose the election to Donald Trump. But the 61-year-old recently declared she is \"not done\" with public service, and still sees a future for herself in national politics – perhaps even as president. \n\n\"I am not done. I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones,\" Harris told the BBC in an interview.\n\n The former vice president said her grandnieces would \"see a female president in the White House in their lifetime, for sure,\" adding that it could \"possibly\" be her.\n\nWhile Harris stopped short of confirming a 2028 campaign, she emphasized that her political ambitions remain alive.\n\n\"If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" she said, brushing off concerns about her polling numbers.","summary":"Obama was convinced the vice-president didn't stand a chance against Donald Trump – and he turned out to be right.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/barack-obama-endorse-kamala-harris-president-trump/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/6XV0MLzNB/0x0/barack-obama-kamala-harris-1761683958499.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 21:27:02","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.555},{"id":373516534,"title":"Lesley Joseph admits best friend Pauline Quirke is 'not okay' as she gives health update on dementia stricken co-star","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogwalker who was knifed to death in Uxbridge is named as it is revealed Afghan national arrested over triple stabbing had arrived in the UK in a lorry in 2020 and been granted asylum\n\nJamaica officially declared 'disaster area' as Hurricane Melissa leaves 7 dead and 500k without power with massive storm barreling toward Cuba\n\nDesigner claims she was thrown out of Hobbycraft store after questioning an employee's 'no TERFs, no Tories' badge - and says manager told her to 'read a biology textbook'\n\nRachel Reeves MUST end her wicked games over raiding your pension: Thousands are cashing in lump sums in a blind panic and don't realise the cost.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:20:56 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:21:10 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nLesley Joseph has given a devastating health update on her best friend Pauline Quirke amid her dementia battle.\nPauline, 65, was diagnosed with the disease in 2021, but the illness only became public knowledge when her husband Steve Sheen made an announcement in January this year. \nAnd now her Birds Of A Feather co-star Lesley, 80, has admitted the actress is 'not okay' as she gave an update while chatting to Bella Magazine at the Variety Club Showbusiness Awards last week. \nShe admitted: 'Pauline is not too well after being diagnosed with dementia a while ago. She's not okay now. I haven't had time, but I'm going to go up and see her next week.'\nIt comes after Lesley admitted she feels 'tremendous guilt' for failing to spend much time with her grandchildren. \nThe actress, whose stage and screen career has spanned over sixty years, revealed she is not exactly a doting grandmother. \n\nLesley Joseph has admitted her best friend Pauline Quirke is 'not okay' as she gave a health update on the dementia stricken co-star last week\n\nSpeaking at the Variety Club Showbusiness Awards she admitted: 'Pauline is not too well after being diagnosed with dementia a while ago. She's not okay now' (pictured in Birds Of A Feather)\nLesley has largely kept her personal life out of the spotlight but she has two children, Andrew and Elizabeth, from a previous relationship with Carl Littlejohn. \n'I feel tremendous guilt for not being the grandmother my kids probably expected,' she said, as she discussed having grandchildren for the first time. \n'I've never done the school run or babysitting. I just find it hard to say no to acting jobs.' \nEarlier this year Pauline's other co-star Linda Robson shared a heartbreaking health update on her pals health as she revealed that Pauline has been having 'up days' recently and has even been asking after her. \nSpeaking on the Loose Women Podcast, in collaboration with Mecca Bingo, Linda told Jane Moore that she recently had a call from Pauline's son Charlie. \nShe said: 'Charlie rang me and said she's doing really really well at the moment. Sometimes she has down days, but at the moment she's quite up about everything.\n'They said they got really excited when she said \"where's my mate Linda Robson?\" I got quite emotional when he told me.\n'[We've known each other] since we were 10 years old. She's always been an amazing actress and my best friend. \n\nIt comes after Lesley admitted she feels 'tremendous guilt' for failing to spend much time with her grandchildren (pictured at the Variety Club Showbusiness Awards) \n\nPauline, 65, was diagnosed with dementia in 2021, but the illness only became public knowledge when her husband Steve Sheen made an announcement in January this year; pictured in 1989 with Linda Robson\n\n Lesley Joseph feels 'tremendous guilt' for failing to spend much time with her grandchildren \n'Amazing things happened to us. When Birds Of A Feather came out we started getting invited to everything. We got VIP tickets for Stringfellas and all these different places, we couldn't believe our luck.'\nBack in February, Maurice Gran, co-writer of Birds of a Feather, explained Pauline was experiencing trouble recognising her own family members. He said: 'Since the diagnosis, her condition has gathered pace.\n'She's still only 65 so your heart goes out to her. Initially, she felt she was beginning to lose her grip. Now, we understand she struggles to identify members of her own family.'\nIt comes after Linda opened up about the moment she realised that close friend Pauline 'wasn't right'. \nLinda told Bella Magazine: 'I hadn't spoken to her for a little while and I kept wondering why she hadn't returned my calls. \n'Eventually, Steve phoned me back. Lesley [Joseph] and I went for lunch with her and that's when we realised something wasn't right with her, and that was three years ago.'\nLinda found the news hard, but respected the family's privacy and kept the diagnosis confidential. \nShe said: 'I've known for the last three years that she wasn't well. I managed to keep it a secret. It was very important that I did, because it was up to her family when it was time for them to let everyone know.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLesley Joseph admits best friend Pauline Quirke is 'not okay' as she gives health update on dementia stricken co-star\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I think it is very traumatic.\n'I know that you couldn't sleep for about a week. We were home in our new house…'\nBobby then explained: 'It was so eerie, because it was just me and you. We were making pasta, having some red wine and I spilled some pasta sauce on my shirt.\n'I'm like, Oh, I'm gonna go change my shirt. So I go upstairs into my room and I see cufflinks out on the bed and some weird items that I've never even taken out of the drawer ever.\n\nKatherine Ryan has recalled her 'traumatic' home burglary experience where her husband Bobby came face to face with knife-wielding criminal as she spoke candidly on her podcast \n'So I grab a shirt, walk out of the room, and I come face to face with this masked man.\n'First words are, what the f*** and I took after him.'\n'He had your laptop in his arms I saw, so I chased him out the window.\n'We had this like kind of landing and he jumped down, went to the neighbour's garden so I saw where he went and then I heard some bushes rumbling.\n'So I saw the fence and I tucked down behind these bushes and he jumped over and I just tackled him, knocked the laptop out and then we got into a fight.\n'It seemed like it lasted a long time, but it was probably a minute long.\n'And then he went to pull up his waistband. I don't know if there was a knife or not, and that's when I backed off the fight because I had tackled him.'\nKatherine added: 'Well, he was saying, I'm gonna f****** kill you.'\nBobby added: 'But then the knife kind of came out, and I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, and then we ended up on the street, and randomly, a cop was driving along, I was pointing at the guy, like, this guy, this guy.\n'So the cop chased after him in the car down this little laneway and I gave up my pursuit.'\nShe shared the video clip which was captioned: 'All Bobby wanted was a clean shirt but found a burglar instead.' \n\nThe comedian, 42, - who just give birth to her fourth child - spoke with Bobby about the 2019 incident which left him unable to sleep for a whole week\n\nSpeaking on her podcast What's My Age Again? she said : 'I want to talk to you about the burglary, because I have told this story before.

She is also mother to her first daughter Violet, 16, from a previous relationship. \nThe week before Katherine revealed she welcomed her newborn daughter in just 45 minutes as she shared her speedy birth story after returning to her podcast.\nThe comedian held her baby girl Holland in her arms as she filmed Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything, just days after giving birth.\nThe couple chose to have their latest addition at the private maternity hospital, The Portland, which cost them a whopping £10,000.\nDays later on her podcast, Katherine shared intimate details from the day, including a moment she'd rather forget in front of her 'hot doctor', known only as 'Pat'.\nKatherine also revealed she was offered an 'opiate menu' to see which drugs she would like to take as pain relief during the birth. \n\n Katherine Ryan, 42, looks radiant and glowing as she shares adorable snaps of her newborn Holland - one week after giving birth \nIntroducing the segment on the clip, Katherine said: 'So this is our birth story. Where would you position it on the podium, take it away.\nBobby then said: 'So this one, we scheduled it. And it went according to plan and no problems.'\nAdmitting the arrival of Holland was stress free, Katherine said: 'I would call it pretty smooth sailing. The logistics of this birth were, if I hadn't given birth by Friday then we were to be induced, by a lovely, handsome doctor. Celebrity obstetrician, Pat.'\n'We won't say his full name, but those in the know, will know who he is. Everyone knows who he is. And he's not someone that you want to s**t yourself in front of.'\nBobby then quipped: 'How'd that go?'\nKatherine confessed: 'Not well. Sorry like TMI, my vag started like bubbling, bubbles were coming out of it.

Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”\n\nPelosi, a former House of Representatives speaker and prominent Democrat figure, was also quick to endorse Harris, saying she had 'full confidence' she could defeat Trump.\n\nWhile Obama did eventually endorse Harris for the presidential bid, it was widely reported at the time that the former president wanted a fully-fledged process to choose Biden's successor.\n\nABC News’ Jonathan Karl claimed in his new book Retribution how the 'Obamas were not happy' that Pelosi had endorsed Harris so quickly, with a confidant to the former House leader summing up 'Obama’s message to Pelosi as, essentially, ‘What the f–k did you just do?'. \n\nKarl penned in the book that Obama and Pelosi allegedly agreed 'Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged', with the journalist adding: \"Therefore, Obama and Pelosi — arguably the two most influential figures in the Democratic Party — had privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements.\"\n\nWhile the pair may have allegedly disagreed in this instance, a source close to Obama said the subsequent discussion Obama and Pelosi had on the phone was a 'good-natured ribbing', rather than an argument that may come across, Karl explained.\n\nThe reporter added in his latest book release: \"The former president wanted to know what had happened. Why had Pelosi issued a statement endorsing Harris so soon? Hadn’t he and Pelosi agreed days earlier that party leaders anointing the vice president as Biden’s replacement would be a mistake?\"\n\nAs big-name Democrats like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and California Gov. Gavin Newsom quickly endorsed Harris, Karl noted that Pelosi 'had no choice' but to come out publicly and back the then-vice president.\n\n\"No other candidates had stepped forward — Kamala Harris was it. The only thing Pelosi could do was try to help her win the election,\" the journalist added in the book in an excerpt obtained by the Daily Mail.\n\nUNILAD has contacts reps for Obama and Pelosi for comment.","summary":"![CDATA[A new book has claimed Obama got on the phone with Nancy Pelosi]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/barack-obama-nancy-pelosi-kamala-harris-endorsement-328883-20251028","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt4f30286629055251/690118d45c174b232caa8a2f/obama-secret-vulgar-comment-nancy-pelosi-kamala-har","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 20:57:03","author":"Callum Jones","authors":["Callum Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.514},{"id":373490682,"title":"Victoria Beckham reveals a woman has to be 'a real a*****e' for her not to get on with them amid her ongoing feud with son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHurricane Melissa chaos sees crocodiles roaming residential streets as Jamaica calls on Trump for emergency help: Live updates\n\nAfghan national who was arrested after a triple stabbing that left a dog walker dead in Uxbridge 'had arrived in the UK in a lorry in 2020 and had been granted asylum'\n\nDesigner claims she was thrown out of Hobbycraft store after questioning an employee's 'no TERFs, no Tories' badge - and says manager told her to 'read a biology textbook'\n\nRachel Reeves MUST end her wicked games over raiding your pension: Thousands are cashing in lump sums in a blind panic and don't realise the cost.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:19:47 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:20:29 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nVictoria Beckham has revealed a woman would have to be a 'real a*****e' for her not to get on with her as she spoke out amid her estrangement from her son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz. \nThe fashion designer, 51, and Nicola, 30, found themselves caught in feud rumours from the get go after the actress chose not to wear the former Spice Girl's wedding dress and opted for Valentino couture instead of Victoria's design at her nuptials in 2022.\nAnd Brooklyn and Nicola have since appeared to have washed their hands of the family after failing to attend any of his father David's 50th birthday celebrations in May and growing closer with Nicola's family. \nNow, during an appearance on Andy Cohen's radio show on Sirius XM, Victoria admitted it takes a lot for her not to get on with a woman. \nAfter Andy asked if she got on with the other WAGs earlier in her career she explained: 'I did. I'm a girl's girl. I mean you've got to be a real a*****e for me to not get on with you if you're a woman.'\nShe continued: 'Because I love, I love women, you know, and that's part of the reason why I do what I do with fashion and beauty.\n\nVictoria Beckham has revealed a woman has to be 'a real a*****e' for her not to get on with them amid her ongoing feud with son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz\n\nThe fashion designer, 51, and Nicola, 30, found themselves caught in feud rumours after the actress chose not to wear the former Spice Girl's wedding dress in 2022 (pictured in Feb 2024)\n'I want to empower women. Yes. And I want to share my tips and tricks with women.'\nIt was previously revealed how Victoria and her husband have reconciled that they won't see their eldest son for the foreseeable future.\nA source said that Brooklyn and Nicola are 'always missed' at family gatherings following the fallout which came to a head when the pair shunned all of David's 50th birthday celebrations.\nAfter the wedding dress feud between the pair, Nicola squashed the rumours and the pair went on to put on a very supportive display of one another. \nThey would praise each others work, appear at events together and even post tributes to each other on social media.\nHitting back at rumours of a falling out between the two back when this all began in 2022, Nicola explained: 'It's not a feud! I keep seeing everywhere that word, \"feud, feud, feud!?\". I mean, maybe they picked up on something? And now they're labelling it feud?'\nBrooklyn also added in an interview with Grazia magazine: 'Me and my family are really close, and my wife and her family are really close.' \n'Mine are in between London and Miami, which is really good. Thank God for the football team, so I get to see them as much as I can. We travel over to London sometimes, they come out here [to LA] and we sometimes meet in Miami.'\n\nThe Beckham clan are pictured in 2023 in happier times, alongside Nicola \n\nThe couple failed to invite any member of Brooklyn's family to their vow renewals , with reports David and Victoria heartbreakingly found out after reading about it on a US website \n\n Brooklyn Beckham cosies up to his wife Nicola Peltz at Vogue World: Hollywood amid family feud \nHowever the family haven't been pictured together since Boxing Day last year, with the couple missing both David and Victoria's birthday's and failing to support his mum after the release of her new Netflix documentary earlier this month. \nFurthermore none of the Beckham clan were present at Brooklyn and Nicola's vow renewals in August. \nThe young couple, who first wed in 2022, failed to invite any members of Brooklyn's family, with reports David and Victoria heartbreakingly found out about their big day after reading about it on a US website.\nIt's a stark contrast to Nicola's family, who had key roles at the second wedding, with her father Nelson, 83, officiating, wearing her mother Claudia's, 70, vintage wedding gown and letting her parents take centre stage once again at the after party. \nEarlier this month Victoria spoke about the 'changing dynamic' in her family in a thinly-veiled remark about the ongoing feud with her Brooklyn and Nicola.\nAppearing on the Call Me Daddy podcast with Alex Cooper she spoke about her 'close family', but did not reference Brooklyn directly.\nVictoria shared how she tries to create a 'safe forum' where her children are able to come and talk to her about any issues they may have.\nShe said: 'I mean, we're such a close family and, you know, communication is key and we always let them know that anything that they want to talk about, you know, this is a safe forum. You know, that's really important.'\nPressed on how she and David deal with the changing dynamics in their family, she insisted: 'Again, it's just about communicating.\n'We've always been that way with the kids. And I'm excited for them, they're all very different. They all like to do different things.' \n\nEarlier this month Victoria spoke about the 'changing dynamic' in her family in a thinly-veiled remark about the ongoing feud with her Brooklyn and Nicola \n\nBrooklyn is said to have become increasingly estranged from the family after failing to attend any of his father's 50th birthday celebrations in May \nBrooklyn is said to have become increasingly estranged from the family after failing to attend any of his father's 50th birthday celebrations in May. \nIn what appeared to be an olive branch to her son and his wife, Victoria included footage of Brooklyn and Nicola in her docuseries, despite their estrangement. \nIn scenes filmed at Victoria's September 2024 Paris Fashion Week show, the designer launched into an emotional monologue about her desire to make her family and colleagues proud.\nThe montage cut between images of Victoria's collaborators, with Brooklyn and Nicola seen mingling with guests in the background.\nThe rest of Victoria's family - husband David and kids Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14, all get more screen time and were shown proudly sitting on the front row ready for the show.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVictoria Beckham reveals a woman has to be 'a real a*****e' for her not to get on with them amid her ongoing feud with son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 25\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The longtime journalist compared Trump's actions to those of Breaking Bad's notorious drug kingpin Walter White, menacingly played by Bryan Cranston.Establishing a BondKarl revealed he \"started to have a series of phone calls\" and conversations with Trump shortly after the July 2024 assassination attempt on the tycoon's life in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe two began to bond after Karl told him he was \"horrified by what happened\" and made sure Trump was OK. \n\nThe ABC personality noted how Trump went on to \"win big\" on election night in November 2024. After staying up all night for news coverage and an appearance on Good Morning America, \"I do something silly. I call Donald Trump.\"\n\nKarl thought there was \"No way he's going to pick up\" and planned to leave him a congratulatory message, only to have Trump answer the call.'Say My Name'\"His voice, he hadn't slept at all. I hadn't slept,\" Karl said of their exhausted state of mind.\n\n\"I said, 'Mr. President-elect, I just want to say congratulations.' And he pauses.\" \n\nTrump replied, \"On what, Jonathan, on what? Say it,\" while imitating the New York native's famous vocal intonations. \n\nKarl went on to recall the \"great scene\" in Breaking Bad involving Walter White, \"Where it's like, 'Say name, say my name,'\" as the fictional meth lord was making a power move on a rival. \n\n\"So I said, 'On the greatest comeback victory in the history of American politics.' But he wanted to hear me say the words,\" Karl noted about the conversation.\n\nPanelist Joy Behar scoffed, \"That's so needy,\" about her arch-enemy, Trump.Easy AccessKarl praised Trump for being so available to one-on-one calls with members of the media, even though the president has called out ABC as \"fake news\" on numerous occasions.\n\n\"I've covered a lot of presidential campaigns. I've covered several presidents. There's none other that I've ever been able to call up on the phone,\" the longtime political reporter dished, saying how he'd always had to go through their \"people.\"\n\nWhile covering the 2024 race, \"It was easier to get Donald Trump on the phone than to get the deputy press secretary for the Kamala Harris campaign,\" Karl revealed.'He Loves the Engagement'The correspondent explained why he believes Trump is willing to give personal access like no other leader before him.\n\n\"He spends a lot of time talking. He loves the engagement,\" Karl said of Trump, and that the real estate magnate often had questions for him, noting he'd ask, \"What are you hearing? What's going on? How's it looking?\"\n\nWhile Karl noted that Trump had gotten \"angry\" with him a couple of times over the phone, he's for the most part \"very positive and very complimentary\" in their conversations.","summary":"The longtime White House correspondent revealed Trump made a request of him similar to drug kingpin Walter White on the AMC classic.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/jonathan-karl-compares-trump-phone-call-breaking-bad-walter-white/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/zp1Crp7r-/0x0/jonathan-karl-compares-donald-trump-breaking-bad-villan-1761681892574.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 20:27:40","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":373507204,"title":"Newsom Throws a Fit Over Joe Rogan Podcast Snub (ft.

You know, you won.’ And he picks up,\" Karl said, explaining that he called Trump early in the morning the day after he won, not thinking the president would answer. \"And I said, Mr. President-elect, I just want to say congratulations,\" Karl added, as he imitated Trump, who, he said, responded, \"On what, Jonathan? On what?\" Karl said Trump wanted to hear him acknowledge his victory and compared it to a scene in \"Breaking Bad.\" MSNBC'S LAWRENCE O'DONNELL ROASTS CNN'S JAKE TAPPER OVER TRUMP TEXT MESSAGE 'SO-CALLED INTERVIEW' \"So I said, 'on the greatest comeback victory in the history of politics.' But he wanted to hear me say the words,\" he told the hosts. Karl joined the co-hosts to discuss his new book, \"Retribution,\" about the 2024 campaign and Trump's political comeback. Co-host Joy Behar said Karl had a strange relationship with the president, and called the conversation \"weird.\" Behar and Hostin pointed out that Trump had publicly attacked Karl during interviews with the journalist.

There’s none, ever, that I have ever been able to call up on the phone. I mean, you always go through, they’ve got people, I mean, it’s like all of that. It was easier to get Donald Trump on the phone than to get the deputy press secretary for the Kamala Harris campaign on the phone,\" Karl said. When Behar asked why, Karl said it was because Trump loved \"engagement.\" \"He got angry at me a couple times over the phone, he’s gotten angry with me in private. Mostly in private, it’s very positive and very complimentary,\" Karl said. \"During the campaign, I have questions for him, and he has questions for me. 'What are you hearing? What’s going on?

Karl asked the president, \"What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she’s going to go after hate speech? Is that, I mean, a lot of people, a lot of your allies, say hate speech is free speech.\" \"She’ll probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly,\" Trump replied, speaking over Karl as he asked if that would be appropriate. \"You have a lot of hate in your heart.

The fall was bad and an ambulance was called immediately.\n'Incredibly the paramedic who came in to treat her almost fell down the exact same step because he didn't see it either.

Larry was absolutely rampant, he was a very naughty boy'. \n\nShe had been a guest at a screening of filmmaker Amanda Eliasch's new film at the hotel when the accident happened and she is now being looked after in hospital (Amanda seen at the event)\n\nAs well as her impassioned stance on their romance, she added that while they did not come from the same background, he was 'one of nature's aristocrats'. \nShe continued: 'My cousin and my brother both agreed that daddy would have loved Larry. He was decent person, intelligent, hard working. When I was 27 or 28, I had a roaring affair with Larry Lamb...\n'Larry is a great guy, he was gorgeous and is still good looking. He has impeccable manners. The fact he didn't come from our world is neither here nor there. Larry, I used to say, is one of nature's aristocrats'. \nBack in 2016, Lady C revealed that she called an end to her romance with Larry after she realised he wanted to get married.\nDivulging details, she said: 'Larry and I had a small romance in 1978 and I was about 28 and he was about 30 or 29. I think he's a year or two older than me so he was at the peak of his masculinity. He is gorgeous. I can't sing his praises highly enough.'\nRevealing how their romance came to be, she added: 'We met at the opening of the Ritz casino and he saw me across the room ... As soon as I caught his eye, he caught mine more accurately, he came over and didn't let go.'\nHowever, the blonde star wasn't prepared to jump into bed with him straight away and made him wait until she returned from her trip to Jamaica before they did the deed. \n\n EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Former I'm A Celeb contestant Lady Colin Campbell is given a luxury flat in Morocco by a mystery man \n'I absolutely [didn't go home with him that night],' she dished. 'I believe in letting a man wait. Larry is lovely and he's very intelligent and very focused. He is one of natures true gentleman.' \nAlthough she was enjoying the passionate romance, Lady C decided to call time on their relationship shortly afterwards because she realised Larry wanted to get married.\nShe explained: 'You know what men are like when they want to get married, they want to get married. I realised that wonderful as Larry was, I didn't think we were going to make it in the long haul.'\nBut the pair have remained friends and the former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! star even dished out a few tips to actor ahead of his stint in the jungle in 2016, although he failed to reply to her email and text message.\nShe explained: 'I converted him - and he was a willing convert - into a great, great, friend. And we were great, great, friends for years after.'\nThe conversation took a darker turn later in the show as she discussed her fractured relationship with her mother, Gloria. \nShe explained: 'My mother became a big problem... She was a complete narcissist. When I broke free her narcissisticness came out and it was tough to get out.'\nHowever, she revealed that after going to therapy at the age of 32 she found a way to move on from her heartache. \n'Once you realise you're carrying around lots of pain, I think go to therapy so you release yourself. You don't want to be a problem bore, poor me.' \nLady C continued: '[My mother was a witch with a b. [Speaking to] my therapist – I used to feel guilty – she said every woman needs to get in touch with her inner w with a b (b***h).' \nI'm A CelebrityLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nI'm A Celebrity...

Nancy Pelosi after she broke an agreement the pair had by quickly endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential race following Joe Biden’s withdrawal.\n\nThe ABC News correspondent appeared as a guest on “Morning Joe” Tuesday to share revelations he included in his forthcoming book “Retribution” about the 2024 presidential election, how it altered the course of history and how Harris’ nomination caused a schism between Obama and Pelosi. \n\n“The two of them had been basically working to try to get Biden out of the race,” Karl explained. “And they had been adamant that when he gets out, we need to have some kind of a process, whether it be a mini flash primary … a meeting of delegates, something, … don’t just hand it over to Kamala Harris. They had a pact on this.”\n\nHe continued, saying that once Harris announced her run, everyone flooded the internet with their support. \n\n“She gets out, and everyone endorses her within hours … [Josh] Shapiro, Gavin Newsom, they’re all endorsing her within hours,” Karl said.\n\nHe went on to say that while everyone jumped on the Harris train immediately, Pelosi at least waited until the next day, but by that point Pelosi saw that there was “nothing to hold the tide.”\n\n“So she puts out the endorsement,” Karl explained, adding that’s when Pelosi got a phone call from Obama. Karl said he spoke with someone who heard the actual phone conversation between Obama and Pelosi. \n\n“And what Obama says is basically, ‘Nancy, what was that all about?’ And clearly [he’s] irritated,” Karl said. \n\nKarl mentioned that he’s discussed the contents of the phone call with “people close to” Obama, who told him that Obama was merely “joshing with her and giving her a hard time.”\n\nHowever, he added that when he chatted with one of Pelosi’s close associates, they shared that he was actually “pissed off.”\n\n“He was angry,” Karl said. “The clear message was, ‘Why did you do that?’”\n\nAs he closed up the conversation, saying even that Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, was also taken aback by his wife’s move.\n\n“I also report that, at right about the same time, Pelosi talks to her husband, Paul Pelosi, and Paul answers the phone by saying, ‘Kamala?

Younger voters, 20 to 40 years old, identify as “socialists,” Dems 40-plus are more “progressives,” with 60 and over saying they are “liberal.”\n\nThat’s where the race for the Democratic nomination will come down to, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom with 15%, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with 14%, former VP Kamala Harris 11%, with Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear all in single digits with 8%, 6%, and 3%, respectively. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and ESPN yakker Stephen A. Smith are clinging to 1% or under.\n\nOn the GOP side, no one is even close to Vance. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is at 9%, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard 8%, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio 5%. Yet, Rubio’s favorability rating is second only to Vance’s at 58%. The VP clocks in at 77%.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Buttigieg’s favorability rating is a strong 81%, but so too is Sanders, who is a solid 72% in the blue. AOC is at 66% beating Newsom’s 58% easily. Harris comes in a distant eighth at a modest 55% favorability.\n\nThe poll was released Monday and has a sampling error rate of roughly 2.5%. The poll was taken online and via text between Oct. 16-21. The survey was evenly split between men and women, with 1,547 NH residents completing the questionnaire.\n\nThe Granite State still prides itself as home to the first presidential primary in the nation, which has come under attack. The Democratic National Committee’s Rules and Bylaws Committee is taking that very matter into consideration with a decision due this winter.\n\nPoll below has Dems on page 1, GOP page 3.

terms in Brigitte Macron cyberbullying case\n\nThe French first lady filed a complaint in August 2024 that led to an investigation.\n\n7.17pm, 28 Oct 2025\n\nShare options\n\nFRENCH PROSECUTORS HAVE sought suspended prison terms of three to 12 months for defendants accused of cyberbullying first lady Brigitte Macron by spreading unsubstantiated claims about her gender.\n\nProsecutors also requested fines of up to 8,000 euros against the 10 defendants – eight men and two women, aged 41 to 65 – who have been accused of cyber-harassment targeting the French first lady.\n\nThe heaviest sentences were sought for three defendants described by prosecutors as “instigators,” while the seven others were labelled “followers”.\n\nThe trial comes after President Emmanuel Macron and his wife filed a defamation lawsuit in the United States at the end of July, in connection with a false claim amplified and repeated online that Brigitte Macron was assigned male at birth.\n\nThe allegation has long targeted the presidential couple, alongside criticism of their quarter-century age gap.\n\nBrigitte Macron’s daughter told a French court today that unsubstantiated claims about her mother’s gender had harmed the French first lady’s health.\n\n“She’s constantly having to pay attention to what she wears, how she holds herself because she knows that her image can be distorted,” said Tiphaine Auziere, 41.\n\nThe recycled disinformation had led to a “deterioration” in her mother’s health, she added.\n\nThe first lady has stayed away from the trial in Paris but she told investigators the rumour had greatly impacted her and her family, especially her grandchildren, who were told their grandmother was a man.\n\nThe French first lady filed a complaint in August 2024 that led to an investigation into cyberbullying and arrests in December 2024 and February 2025.\n\n‘Media deep state’\n\nProsecutors sought the heaviest sentences against three of the defendants, including Aurelien Poirson-Atlan, 41, a publicist known on social media as “Zoe Sagan” and often linked to conspiracy theory circles.\n\nProsecutors requested a 12-month suspended prison sentence, an 8,000 euro fine and a six-month suspension of his social media accounts.\n\nIn court today, he defended his right to what he called “satire”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother, Bertrand Scholler, 56, said on Sunday that the trial was targeting his “freedom to think” faced with the “media deep state”.\n\nProsecutors requested a six-month suspended sentence, 3,000 euro fine, and the immediate suspension of Scholler’s social media accounts for six months.\n\nThe third is a woman already the subject of a libel complaint filed by Brigitte Macron in 2022: Delphine J., 51, a self-proclaimed spiritual medium who goes by the pseudonym Amandine Roy.\n\nFor Delphine J., prosecutors sought a six-month suspended jail term, a 4,000 euro fine and the suspension of her online accounts, also for half a year.\n\nIn 2021, she posted a four-hour interview with self-described independent journalist Natacha Rey on her YouTube channel, alleging Brigitte Macron had once been a man called Jean-Michel Trogneux, the name of her brother.\n\nThe two women were ordered to pay damages to Brigitte Macron and her brother in 2024 before the conviction was overturned on appeal.\n\nThe first lady has since taken the case to the country’s highest appeals court.\n\nUS influencer \n\nEmerging as early as Emmanuel Macron’s election in 2017, the claims have been amplified by far-right and conspiracy theorist circles in France, and in the United States, where transgender rights have become a hot-button issue at the heart of American culture wars.\n\nThe presidential couple filed a US defamation lawsuit in July against conservative podcaster Candace Owens, who produced a series titled “Becoming Brigitte”, claiming she was born a man.\n\nThe couple is planning to offer “scientific” evidence and photos proving that the first lady is not transgender, according to their US lawyer.\n\nSeveral of those on trial in Paris shared posts from the US influencer.\n\nOther high-profile women in politics have also been the target of disinformation about their gender or sexuality.\n\nThey include former US first lady Michelle Obama, US ex-vice president Kamala Harris and New Zealand ex-premier Jacinda Ardern.\n\n- © AFP 2025\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “French prosecutors seek suspended jail terms in

Nancy Pelosi after Pelosi endorsed Kamala Harris to be the Democrat presidential nominee the day after Joe Biden dropped out of the race, a new book says.\n\nIn “Retribution“, ABC News’s Jonathan Karl provides new details on how Obama did not want a quick coronation of Harris, but rather “a process” to determine who would become the Democrat nominee.\n\nObama called Pelosi shortly after her endorsement of Harris became public.\n\n“The Obamas were not happy,” a Pelosi confidant told Karl, according to the Daily Mail, which obtained an advance copy of the book. “This person summed up Obama’s message to Pelosi as, essentially, ‘What the f*** did you just do?’ ”\n\nAccording to the book Pelosi responded to Obama by saying: “That train has left the station.”\n\nObama was taken aback by the quick endorsement because, as the book relates, he and Pelosi had been in “regular communication” as it appeared then 81-year-old Biden was nearing the decision to drop out of the race, and “they agreed Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged.”\n\n“Therefore, Obama and Pelosi – arguably the two most influential figures in the Democratic Party – had privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements,” the book states.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed Harris shortly thereafter.\n\nAround 1 p.m. the next day, Pelosi endorsed Harris, leaving Obama miffed.\n\n“The former president wanted to know what had happened. Why had Pelosi issued a statement endorsing Harris so soon? Hadn’t he and Pelosi agreed days earlier that party leaders anointing the vice president as Biden’s replacement would be a mistake?” Karl wrote.\n\nA senior Biden adviser, who also worked in the Obama White House, told Karl that the real reason Obama didn’t want Pelosi to endorse Harris so quickly was that the former president didn’t think Harris could win.\n\n“There’s only one Black Jesus,” the senior Biden adviser quipped.\n\nObama and former First Lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Harris in a campaign video five days after Biden exited the 2024 race.\n\nSupport Free Press Foundation\n\n Book: Furious Obama slammed Pelosi for quick endorsement of Harris, WorldTribune.com","summary":"by WorldTribune Staff, October 28, 2025 Real World News &#8220;What the f*** did you just do?&#8221; That is what former President Barack Obama essentially said to Rep.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JESSICA JANES, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:18:57 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:19:10 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nLeigh-Anne Pinnock has candidly opened up about the challenges in her marriage to footballer Andre Gray. \nThe former Little Mix star, 34, joined Rosie and Chris Ramsey on their sh***ed, Married, Annoyed podcast on Monday, where she discussed her 'hard' family dynamic with her four-year-old twin daughters and her husband Andre, also 34.\nAndre currently plays for Turkish club Fatih Karagümrük, meaning he spends long periods away from his family home in the UK. \nDiscussing their long-distance relationship, Leigh-Anne explained: 'Even now with my husband living abroad… we probably see each other, maybe if we are lucky, three days in a month. It's so s**t.'\nConfirming that he currently lives in Turkey, she added: 'We have been doing that for three years. They (the twins) have just turned four.'\nHost Rosie then remarked: 'That’s hard, that must be hard for him as well though?'\n\nLeigh-Anne Pinnock has candidly opened up about the challenges in her marriage to footballer Andre Gray\n\nThe former Little Mix star, 34, joined Rosie and Chris Ramsey on their sh***ed, Married, Annoyed podcast on Monday, where she discussed her 'hard' family dynamic with her four-year-old twin daughters and her husband Andre, also 34\nLeigh-Anne replied: 'So hard. He’s struggling a little bit to be fair.'\nThe singer tied the knot with Andre in June 2023 after welcoming their twins together in August 2021. \nHowever, their relationship hasn't always been plain sailing. \nIn June 2024, Leigh-Anne revealed her husband Andre 'broke her heart' in the early days of their relationship in a TikTok video. \nDuring the video clip, the star implied that things weren't always plain sailing for the couple as she told how he had changed his ways to be with her. \nLeigh-Anne revealed that she 'learnt the power of forgiveness' as the footballer 'went out of his way to change for her'.\nWhen asked what she learnt about her last heartbreak, Leigh-Anne admitted she is still with the person who broke her heart. \nShe said: 'I learnt the power of forgiveness. I'm still with the person who broke my heart, and he went out of his way to change for me.\n\nAndre currently plays for Turkish club Fatih Karagümrük, meaning he spends long periods away from his family home in the UK (pictured last year)\n\nSpeaking on the podcast, Leigh-Anne explained: 'Even now with my husband living abroad… we probably see each other, maybe if we are lucky, three days in a month. It's so s**t'\n'I think if you can actually get to the other side and make it through it, it makes it all worthwhile.\n'Some people might say, oh well, why are you still with them? or why are you still giving them another chance? I guess that can be seen as a weakness and not putting yourself first, but I think only you know what is truly right for you.'\nLeigh-Anne went on to say that at the time, the couple got through the 'struggle' and now they are in a 'really beautiful place'.\nShe continued: 'If that person can really show that they want to change, you cannot change somebody, but if they go out of their way to change themselves, I really do think that kind of tells you everything you need to know.\n'For me personally, I had to go through these struggles and things in our relationship to get to the point where we are now, which is a really beautiful place.'\nThe Don’t Say Love songstress also added that it is 'OK' to forgive someone, and it doesn't have to come across as 'a weak thing to do' as it can be 'healing'.\nLeigh-Anne said: 'It is OK to give somebody another chance, but it isn't OK to let somebody take the piss out of you. \n'Make sure you have those barriers up to protect yourself and to know when enough is enough.\n\nThe singer tied the knot with her footballer beau Andre in June 2023 after welcoming their twins together in August 2021 \n\n Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Perrie Edwards send Little Mix fans wild with excitement as trio reunite for stunning snap together three years after announcing band's hiatus: 'True sisterhood never fades!' \n'It takes being hurt to sort of build that armour up to be like, I'm not going through that again. Don't see forgiveness as a weak thing to do, it can be a really powerful and healing thing.' \nIt comes after Leigh-Anne opened up about her rocky relationship with Andre in 2023. \nShe revealed at the time that 'he still had a lot of growing up to do' in their early relationship and cryptically discussed how people deal with getting cheated on by a partner.\nShe told Glamour Magazine: 'I think people often think that if something bad happens in a relationship – if you get cheated on or whatever – that it's automatically done, it's over, and that's fair enough. but in my case, I chose to work at it, and I am so happy that I did.'\nLeigh-Anne attributed some of their early struggles to the toxic masculinity within the football industry as she hinted at their past difficulties.\nShe went on: 'Unfortunately, I think a big part of it was his environment and the stereotype that comes with it. In my case, I found it to be quite true, but I've watched him grow, and we've come so far.'\n'When you know you have something special, you want to fight for it. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, but if it does, my God, it feels great,' she added. \nLittle MixTurkeyLeigh-Anne PinnockTikTok\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLeigh-Anne Pinnock admits she sees husband Andre Gray just THREE days a month as she reveals their 's**t' long-distance marriage struggles while he plays in Turkey\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Political commentators and journalists posted screenshots of the interview with the New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner, pointing to different parts of the conversation with Jean-Pierre. Journalist Josh Barro highlighted a portion of the interview where Jean-Pierre insisted the \"broken White House\" she refers to in the title is President Donald Trump's White House. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE INSISTS TO SKEPTICAL CBS ANCHORS THAT BIDEN WAS TREATED UNFAIRLY, ALWAYS SEEMED SHARP \"You’re telling me about the feelings of Joe Biden, blah, blah, blah, but Joe Biden is out of the picture. He’s out of the picture,\" Jean-Pierre told the interviewer, who said, \"Yeah, he sure is.\" Chotiner pushed back, \"This is what you wrote your book about. I am not bringing it up randomly.\" Jean-Pierre argued in the interview that the book was about the moment the country is in and said, \"So what are the Democratic leadership actually doing to beat back and fight back? What are they doing?\" \"Good Lord. Read this entire interview. It's hard to even begin to describe Karine Jean-Pierre's answers. They are largely incoherent,\" New York Times columnist David French wrote. French added that the former press secretary was obsessed with loyalty and respect. Semafor's David Weigel wrote, \"Turns out you can do a career-ending interview even after your career is over.\" \"Ruthless\" podcast co-host Michael Duncan posted, \"This is one of the most hilarious interviews I've ever read.\" The Atlantic's Jonathan Chait asked, \"How was KJP hired for her job in the first place?\" The National Review's James Lynch pointed to a portion of the interview and wrote, \"total gibberish.\" Chotiner pressed Jean-Pierre on her writing that she didn't think former Vice President Kamala Harris could win, while also taking issue with people who \"didn’t seem to think Harris could win by saying they were insulting her.\" \"I wish you could walk in my body and live my life, and then I think you could understand what I’m saying. I really do, because I think any other Black woman would understand what I’m saying. What it truly is is that it wasn’t just an open primary or a brokered convention. There was disrespect to her as well. It was discounting her and her position and who she was. That’s what it felt like,\" Jean-Pierre wrote. \"This is a very unique thing that I don’t think anyone would understand unless you walked in our bodies and lived our lives. My feeling was not about her not being qualified. It was about people not being able to see past her being Black and a woman. It’s not that confusing for us because we live this life day in and day out,\" the passage continued. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE SAYS BIDEN HEALTH TALKING POINTS WERE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AT SENIOR LEVEL CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Jean-Pierre was also asked multiple times by Chotiner if she felt Biden could have served through January 2029. \"It’s not my place to say,\" she said, as Chotiner asked what she meant by that. \"No, no, no. Wait, I’m answering the question. I did not see anything that would cause me concern. That is my answer,\" Jean-Pierre added.

So I think there is an appetite for this conversation that I'm having with the American people,\" Ms Harris told 7.30.\n\nPressed on why she thought voters would think differently about her a second time around, Ms Harris said: \"My focus is on the book tour and being out with the people and lifting their voices.\"\n\nAnd asked if American voters have an \"appetite\" for a Kamala Harris presidency, she responded: \"We will see, if I choose to run.\"\n\nMs Harris says she reproaches herself for her failure to prevent a diminished President Biden from running for a second term against Donald Trump in 2024.\n\n\"I offer a lot of candour around what I did … I reflect on not talking him out of running and why I didn't,\" she said. \n\nAsked why she and other senior Democrats left the decision entirely to Joe Biden and his wife Jill, Ms Harris concluded it was a terrible mistake.\n\n'I had concerns'\n\nIn the first half of 2024, growing concerns amongst voters about president Biden's perceived cognitive decline dragged down support for the Democratic ticket.\n\nMs Harris says she chose not to intervene because she feared such a move from her, as Mr Biden's deputy, would backfire.\n\nThe questions over Mr Biden's fitness reached a full-blown public crisis with his stumbling debate performance against Mr Trump in Atlanta in June 2024. \n\nMs Harris concedes she was wrong to have remained silent to that point.\n\n\"In retrospect it was a conversation I should have raised even if it were ill received,\" she said.\n\nBut the former vice-president insisted her concerns about the president were solely about the gruelling nature of the presidential campaign, not his capacity to perform as president for a further four years.\n\nPressed about Mr Biden's poor communication and visible difficulties marshalling his thoughts, and whether that meant she had a responsibility to the country to act, she said, \"I did not question Joe Biden's capacity to be president at all\".\n\n\"I saw him in the Oval Office, in the situation room, meeting with world leaders on a daily basis and I did not have any question about that.\"\n\nMs Harris insists her doubts were about how Mr Biden would manage the campaign against Mr Trump.\n\n'Couldn't breathe' after losing to Trump\n\nIn November 2024 Ms Harris went into election day hoping what had been viewed as a close race would go her way.\n\nBut on that evening she received a phone call from her campaign manager telling her she was not going to win.\n\nMs Harris recalled being in a state of shock.\n\n\"And so much so that the only words I could speak over and over again were, 'My God, my God, my God,'\" she said. \n\nMs Harris said she \"felt a level of grief\" similar to that of when she lost her mother.\n\n\"This was about my country and the people I knew. \n\n\"He [Trump] meant what he said about weaponising the Department of Justice against his political enemies.\n\nMs Harris wants readers of the memoir — and by extension US voters — to see Mr Trump's victory as about more than just the president's personal agenda.\n\n\"We're experiencing a high velocity event that is about the swift implementation of a plan that has been decades in the making,\" she said.\n\n\"And if we're to take lessons from the election and this moment to guide us as we go forward, we have to understand this is much bigger than that one person in the White House.\"\n\nDespite Mr Trump being a lightning rod for criticism Ms Harris wants America's traditional allies to keep faith with the USA.\n\n\"I would suggest to you and to our allies around the world that the American people still retain and deeply have a sense of our importance to the rest of the world, a commitment to our constitution, the Constitution of the United States, and to the values and principles … that we hold dear,\" she said.\n\n'Needed more time'\n\nThe title of Ms Harris' book is also its message: that the 107 days remaining to Ms Harris after Mr Biden stepped down in the presidential race were not enough.\n\nShe had lifted the Democrats' chances from the nadir that Mr Biden had reached in July 2024. \n\nHe trailed Mr Trump personally 38-41 and the voters' gloomy outlook was revealed in the bleak headline figure that 72 per cent of Americans thought the country was on the wrong track.\n\nMs Harris did make it a neck-and-neck race with Mr Trump, before ultimately late-deciding voters swung to the Republican.\n\nGiven more time she believes the outcome could have changed.\n\n\"We needed more time and had we more time, perhaps the outcome would've been different.\n\nThat is now the next question she is trying to answer. Will the Democrats decide it was enough of an achievement to warrant that rare political gift, a second chance?\n\nWatch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV","summary":"Former US vice-president Kamala Harris is contemplating another run for the presidency and says she was \"reckless\" to have not stopped Joe Biden from pursuing a second term.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-29/kamala-harris-says-she-may-run-again-for-the-white-house/105943576","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7250da1cd8a78e5ef7c0fafe8833642f?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1688&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=101&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 18:43:58","author":"Marina Freri,Sarah Ferguson","authors":["Marina Freri","Sarah Ferguson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":373461826,"title":"David Lynch collaborator who starred in Twin Peaks spotted during rare LA outing... can you guess the celeb?","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Monster' hurricane Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica as multiple people are left dead: Live updates\n\nAfghan national who was arrested after a triple stabbing that left a man dead 'had arrived in the UK in a lorry in 2020 and had been granted asylum'\n\nWilliam 'threatened to strip Eugenie and Beatrice of their titles unless Andrew and Fergie left Royal Lodge'\n\nHow Rachel Reeves MUST end her wicked games over raiding your pension: Thousands are cashing in their lump sum in a blind panic and don't realise the cost.

It goes something like this… Karine Jean-Pierre is leaving the Democrat Party and becoming an Independent because the Democrat Party treated Joe Biden so poorly when he was forced out of his 2024 reelection race.\n\nActually, this might be why the New Yorker pushed her so hard in this interview. As a Democrat, she was a sacred cow, a precious. Now that she’s left the Democrat Party, she’s no longer a precious. Instead, she’s a black, gay, learning-disabled apostate.\n\nOkay, this makes sense now.\n\nAnyway, the probing conducted by the New Yorker was nothing much, but it didn’t take much for Jean-Pierre to prove that she 1) doesn’t know her own mind or why she thinks the way she thinks about Biden, and 2) is not capable of explaining her rationale for leaving the party or even writing the book.\n\n“You feel like you had to leave the Democratic Party because of the way it treated Joe Biden. How did it treat Joe Biden?” asked the New Yorker.\n\n“I call it a betrayal,” she says. Then she makes it all about herself before answering the question. “It was an all-out, full-on campaign to embarrass him, to push him out… And I thought to myself, This man is one of the most decent people that I know.”\n\nShe adds that “objectively, objectively [Biden] did more in one term than most Presidents do in two. So I just didn’t understand why this was happening.”\n\nOkay, fair enough. But then the probing begins and she falls apart like, well — like Joe Biden did in that debate.\n\n“Why do you believe the Democrat Party was undermining Biden?” she’s asked.\n\nHer answer? I’m a gay, black woman. “This is very layered,” she explains. “There’s a period of time that I questioned what was happening and how do we treat our own, how do we treat people who are decent people?” Then it’s all about her: “And then you also have to think about how I’m thinking about this as a [b]lack woman who is part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and living in this time where I also don’t think Democrats right now, Democrats’ leadership, is protecting vulnerable people in the way that it should.”\n\nThe New Yorker then points out that after Biden’s disastrous debate, polls that had already shown Trump in a slight lead were showing Trump trouncing Biden. So, if she considers Trump such a threat, wasn’t it best to replace Biden with someone who could defeat that threat? Shouldn’t the country come before one man?\n\n“Wait a minute, wait a minute. Treating somebody with dignity is not the same as loyalty,” she protests. “I mean, the way he was treated, I had never… if you had seen something like that in the Democratic Party, please, please, point that out.”\n\nWhen asked for an example of this disrespect, she says, “I mean, it was nasty articles that were coming out daily.”\n\nThe New Yorker responds drily, “So you think asking him to step aside was O.K., but there shouldn’t have been nasty articles?”\n\nAnd this is when it all comes apart…\n\n“Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I don’t think [Biden being forced out] should have happened… I believe we should have fought to make sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won. That’s what I believed.”\n\nWhen asked about Biden’s obvious mental decline, she said, “I did not see anything that would’ve given me concern.”\n\nWhat about that debate?\n\n“What I’m saying to you is the debate for me was one time. I had never seen him like that before.”\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nJean-Pierre says it was an insult to then-Vice President Kamala Harris that people thought it would be better to have an open convention than anoint her as Biden’s replacement:\n\nI’m speaking also as a [b]lack woman and what I experienced myself as being a first. This is not just me. There are many [b]lack women who feel this. We are the backbone of the Party. We are on the front lines, and when it comes time to elevate us, or hear us, acknowledge our voice, we are largely ignored.\n\nHere’s the killshot…\n\n“So what I was confused by was you saying that you didn’t think Harris could win,” the New Yorker points out, “but then you attack other people who didn’t seem to think Harris could win by saying they were insulting her.”\n\nJean-Pierre’s answer is Woke Gold:\n\n“Yes. Well, again, I wish you could walk in my body and live my life, and then I think you could understand what I’m saying,” is her response. “I really do, because I think any other [b]lack woman would understand what I’m saying.”\n\nNEW YORKER: I’m not trying to discount what you’re saying about Harris, but Biden is not an L.G.B.T.Q. Black woman, and you have the same feelings about how he was treated. This is what you keep going back to in the book. Sometimes I worry about losing sight of the fact that we’re dealing with a Presidential election here, and the feelings of Joe Biden are less important than the fate of the country.\nJEAN-PIERRE: You’re telling me about the feelings of Joe Biden, blah, blah, blah, but Joe Biden is out of the picture. He’s out of the picture.\n\nWhat is she even talking about? Removing an old, senile white guy from the presidential race is an insult to gay, black women? Not disrespecting Kamala with an open primary is more important than winning the presidential race against a man she sees as a unique threat to the country? Look at that last quote. After basing her whole premise on how this good man Joe Biden was so poorly treated, she’s all, “You’re telling me about the feelings of Joe Biden, blah, blah, blah…”\n\nShe has no idea what she believes. None. It’s all status and buzzwords with her, and she believes the buzzwords will confirm or enhance her status in a Democrat Party that’s gone off the deep end of woke and only cares about those buzzwords.\n\nJean-Pierre’s mistake was leaving the Democrat Party under the arrogant belief others would follow her. She looks ridiculous standing out there all by herself, unable to explain herself.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

But if we waited for some personal stories about working with me and what qualities he had seen that led him to endorse me, they weren't there.\"'People Hate Joe Biden'In the first few days of her campaign, Harris admitted she was still getting her feet wet and finding her own voice. At the start, her standard stump speech would include glowing remarks about her former boss, who is now battling cancer.\n\n\"I spent the first third of my remarks effusively praising him before I launched into my own campaign speech,\" Harris wrote in her book. \"I would do that for several weeks until my campaign strategists urged me to stop: 'It's time this campaign was about you.'\"\n\nHowever, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, who was now working to help elect Harris, put it more bluntly when he told her point-blank, \"People hate Joe Biden.\"","summary":"Just one day after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, former Speaker of the House Pelosi announced her backing of Vice President Harris.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/barack-obama-nancy-pelosi-kamala-harris-endorsement/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Jj3kw9KCx/0x0/barack-obama-nancy-pelosi-kamala-harris-1761669238155.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 18:25:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":373459458,"title":"Child is killed in 'hazardous materials incident' at London flat","text":"Home and Garden\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Monster' hurricane Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica as multiple people are left dead: Live updates\n\nMoment police Taser and arrest Afghan national after triple stabbing which left dog walker, 49, dead when he 'tried to break up fight and was slashed across the neck'\n\nWilliam 'threatened to strip Eugenie and Beatrice of their titles unless Andrew and Fergie left Royal Lodge'\n\nLIZ JONES: Why I believe ruthless Kate's the driving force behind Andrew's eviction - and why no one now dares cross her\n\nI was only 35 but felt 55.

During an Instagram Live session on October 26, 2025, the rapper claimed that even sex workers were struggling to maintain their former lifestyles amid worsening economic conditions, as reported by Complex on October 27, 2025.In clips of the Instagram Live session, the Bronx rapper is heard saying\"You know how you know that the economy is bad? Because not even the prostitutes is getting fly\"The WAP hitmaker expressed some opinions on sex workers allegedly reducing their rates, calling it evidence of how the financial downturn is affecting everyone. Mispronouncing the President's name, Cardi B reportedly said, \"These are the type of things I was trying to tell y’all about when I was talking about the Trump administration… But all y’all cared about was me saying ‘Shrump\"More about what Cardi B said about Trump and his economic policiesThe rapper’s comments quickly went beyond economic metaphors to become a pointed criticism of former President Donald Trump and his supporters. In the same Live, the rapper claimed that the US president had failed to protect working-class Americans, as reported by HotNewHipHop on October 27, 2025.“Donald Trump was never for y’all poor m***********s. Donald Trump was never for the poor people.… He don’t give a f**k about none of y’all\" View this post on Instagram Instagram PostCardi B also addressed Trump’s immigration policies, accusing him of using migrants as scapegoats for the country’s economic issues. \"Now, Donald Trump was blaming the immigrants for America’s downfall. However, he was using that as an excuse for the issues that we have in this country, in this economy. Now, how many immigrants has he deported? … So, now the immigrants are deported, who are we blaming for the fact that we are practically going into a recession?\"Her remarks reportedly follow months of public frustration over inflation, high rents, and reduced federal assistance programs.Cardi B previously lashed out over food assistance cutsOn October 19, 2025, Cardi B spoke about the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act during a Twitter Spaces session. The rapper said that the Bill will cut $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a federal initiative helping millions of Americans buy groceries, as reported by Complex on October 19, 2025. “People are complaining that they have taken away food stamps. Thanksgiving is next month, no turkey for some of y’all.” . @BardisMediaLINKCardi B talks about the pause on food stamps & high prices due to tariffs from the Trump Administration via Spaces.Cardi also pointed to how tariffs and cost-of-living increases were affecting everyday people, and reportedly also apologized for encouraging people to buy her album.The rapper also added a recent experience helping a friend search for an apartment in the Bronx as an example of rising rent pressures, and that working-class people receive little support from the government.\"I hate the fact that there’s a lot of people working nine-to-five and because they’re working, they don’t get no help from the government. I always hated that.\"The rapper also added that she had previously tried to warn voters about such policy moves when she campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris in 2020.Cardi B’s political commentary is not new. The rapper has long used her platform to speak about social and economic inequality, having previously supported Bernie Sanders and later endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, according to HotNewHipHop's report from October 27, 2025. Cardi's latest statements come shortly after the release of her second studio album, Am I the Drama?, in September 2025. The record’s promotion has reportedly been overshadowed by political debates and public disputes with fellow rappers Nicki Minaj and BIA.","summary":"Cardi B used an unusual to make a point about the state of the U.S. economy.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/not-even-prostitutes-getting-fly-cardi-b-slams-trump-claims-sex-workers-reduce-rates-worsening-economy","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/10/84cb3-17616699953851-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 18:08:18","author":"Devangee","authors":["Devangee"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":373460022,"title":"Michelle Obama shares verdict on Barack’s infamous tan suit moment","text":"Michelle Obama is sharing her honest thoughts about her husband Barack Obama’s controversial tan suit. \n\nBack in 2014, the then-president sent shockwaves to the internet when he wore a light suit for a White House briefing where he discussed the U.S. military response to ISIS and Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. At the time, critics deemed Barack’s suit “unpresidential” and a “monstrosity,” arguing it wasn’t appropriate for his discussion about such a serious topic. \n\nNow, ahead of the release of her upcoming fashion-forward book, The Look, Michelle is looking back at the controversy, calling some of the criticism both she and her husband received for their wardrobe choices “pure hypocrisy.”\n\n“I could pull up pictures of Jackie O [Kennedy] in a second and see this fashion icon in sleeveless dresses as first lady,” she explained during a new interview with People, noting how her own choice to don sleeveless dresses sparked uproar online. \n\n“So at a point you’re like, ‘Oh, this is politics. If you can’t beat them, make everybody scared of them. That was the motto. If it wasn’t the clothes, it was ‘that terrorist fist bump.’ It was every word that we said. It was my husband’s tan suit,” she added. \n\nMichelle then expressed how much she “loved that tan suit” her husband wore, despite the controversy it caused. \n\n“When he had it on, I was like, ‘Oh, my God, you look so cute.’ [Then] I was like, ‘Oh you got clocked for that one. Welcome to my world,’” she continued. “That was towards the end of his presidency, so we were used to all the crazy issues that people would take with us.” \n\nCriticism of Barack’s suit, later given the name “tan-gate,” was constantly making headlines in 2014. For example, former New York Representative Peter King said at the time: “There’s no way I think any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday… For him to walk out… in a light suit, light tan suit.”\n\n“ISIS is watching,” he continued. “If you were the head of ISIS, if you were Baghdadi, if you were anyone in the ISIS, would you come away from yesterday afraid of the United States? Would you be afraid that the United States was going to use all its power to crush ISIS?”\n\nHowever, the Obama administration defended Barack’s decision. A day after the initial controversy, then-White House press secretary Josh Earnest said: “The president stands squarely behind the decision that he made yesterday to wear his summer suit at yesterday’s news conference.”\n\nBarack has since reiterated his approval of the suit, telling journalist Steve Scully earlier this year that he was “rocking” the suit. \n\nHe addressed the controversy, saying it was “kind of crazy [that] people were so mad about it.” Barack also acknowledged that photos of former Presidents Ronald Regan and George Bush wearing similar suits began to circulate online at the time. “I thought I looked better than them in it,” he laughed.\n\nIn addition, he made references to the viral look throughout his presidency, including during the opening of his final press conference in 2017. \n\n“Let me start out by saying that I was sorely tempted to wear a tan suit today,” he said. “But Michelle, whose fashion sense is a little better than mine, tells me that's not appropriate in January.”\n\nIn August 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris turned heads in her own brown suit during the first night of the Democratic convention, amid her run for U.S. President during last year’s election. At the time, people thought her outfit was a nod to Barack’s controversial look. \n\nBarack later celebrated the look on X, sharing a throwback photo of his tan suit, alongside a picture of Harris onstage at the convention. \n\n“How it started. How it's going,” he wrote. “Ten years later, and it's still a good look!”","summary":"Barack wore the controversial outfit during a White House briefing in 2014","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/obama-tan-suit-michelle-reaction-b2853866.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/28/15/36/barack-obama-michelle.jpeg?crop=2047.5,1365,x0.3,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rUmSGAIS-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-28 17:55:35","author":"Amber Raiken","authors":["Amber Raiken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":373443014,"title":"Alan Carr reveals he's no longer friends with Paloma Faith as he makes desperate plea to make amends with her after the comedian murdered the singer on Celebrity Traitors","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Monster' hurricane Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica as multiple are left dead: Live updates\n\nMoment police Taser and arrest Afghan national after triple stabbing which left dog walker, 49, dead when he 'tried to break up fight and was slashed across the neck'\n\nWilliam 'threatened to strip Eugenie and Beatrice of their titles unless Andrew and Fergie left Royal Lodge'\n\nLIZ JONES: Why I believe ruthless Kate's the driving force behind Andrew's eviction - and why no one now dares cross her\n\nI was only 35 but felt 55.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:16:37 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:17:36 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nAlan Carr has revealed he's no longer friends with Paloma Faith as he broke his silence on their feud after dramatically 'murdering' her on Celebrity Traitors. \nThe comedian, 49, admitted the pregnant singer, 44, was furious at being the first victim on the BBC show as he opened up about their real-life tension. \nAlan, who is a Traitor on the show alongside Jonathan Ross and Cat Burns, confessed that he is now desperate to make amends with Paloma. \nSpeaking on his Life’s A Beach podcast with DJ Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, he said: ‘I’m killing people willy nilly - I've got a real taste for it. I killed Paloma Faith. She’s not happy about it.’\nWhen Norman asked, 'Aren't you mates with Paloma?', Alan replied, 'Well, I was...'\nThe presenter said Paloma has made it very clear to him that she was hurt by his betrayal in the series. \n\nAlan Carr has revealed he's no longer friends with Paloma Faith as he broke his silence on their feud after dramatically 'murdering' her on Celebrity Traitors\n\nThe comedian, 49, admitted the pregnant singer, 44, was furious at being the first victim on the BBC show as he opened up about their real-life tension\n\nHe explained: ‘She said, “If you were a real friend, you wouldn’t have killed me.” But I said, “I’m the Traitor! The show’s called The Traitors - it does what it says on the tin.\"\n'There’ve been a few little TikToky things where she says I’ve let her down because I killed her in plain sight.'\nAlan insisted that despite the backlash from fans, he’d simply been playing the game - and panicked in the moment.\nHe added: ‘It’s like going on Naked Attraction and being told, what, I have to take my knickers off? You know what you’re signing up for!’\nExplaining his decision to 'murder' Paloma by touching her face with the pollen of a faux poisoned lily - as per the rules - he joked: 'I can’t start stroking Stephen Fry’s face and Celia Imrie’s - not at my age! I look creepy as it is.’\nAlan revealed he is now desperate to make amends with Only Love Can Hurt Like This hitmaker.\n‘I’m going to take her for dinner,’ he said. ‘I love her. I’m such a big fan of her and she’s the best - but no one wants to be murdered first on a show. I panicked.’\nHis podcast episode, recorded recently, was released on Tuesday - just days after Alan appeared to snub Paloma’s pregnancy announcement.\n\nSpeaking on his podcast, Alan was asked if he was friends with Paloma, he replied: 'Well I was...' before adding: ‘I’m killing people willy nilly - I've got a real taste for it'\n\nHe explained: ‘She said, “If you were a real friend, you wouldn’t have killed me.” But I said, “I’m the Traitor!

Those that don’t rank highly in the Granite State may find momentum hard to build.\n\nJoining Newsom and Buttigieg in the top three is New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has 14 percent, according to a very early snapshot in the University of New Hampshire’s poll, which was released Monday.\n\nOn the other side of the political aisle, the poll shows that Vice President JD Vance currently leads other potential Republican candidates, with a commanding 51 percent of the vote. Former presidential hopeful Nikki Haley follows, with just 9 percent.\n\nNewsom confirmed Sunday that he was specifically considering a bid for president in 2028, but added that he was first focused on helping his party win Congressional seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Governor has risen steadily in the ranks of contenders amid his online sparring with Donald Trump earlier this year.\n\nOutside of the top three current favorites in the New Hampshire primary are former Vice President Kamala Harris in fourth with 11 percent, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in fifth with 8 percent, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker with 6 percent. \n\nHowever, despite occupying the number four spot, a breakdown of favorability shows that 17 percent of voters have expressed negative views towards Harris compared with 55 percent positive. Despite this, the former VP confirmed to the BBC in an interview last week that she was also considering a 2028 bid.\n\nBy contrast, just 6 percent view Pete Buttigieg unfavorably, while 81 percent hold positive views of the former Mayor of South Bend. Some 72 percent hold positive opinions of Newsom, and 13 percent hold unfavorable opinions.","summary":"Newsom occupies second place with 15% of voters choosing him as their preferred presidential candidate, losing out to former Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has 19%","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-poll-newsom-new-hampshire-primary-b2853915.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/20/21/46/SEI264370772.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HK3HW82O-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-28 17:33:26","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.129},{"id":373443012,"title":"Apple Martin releases music video after nepo baby's singing was slammed as 'off-key drunken karaoke performance'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Monster' hurricane Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica as multiple are left dead: Live updates\n\nMoment police Taser and arrest Afghan national after triple stabbing which left dog walker, 49, dead when he 'tried to break up fight and was slashed across the neck'\n\nWilliam 'threatened to strip Eugenie and Beatrice of their titles unless Andrew and Fergie left Royal Lodge'\n\nLIZ JONES: Why I believe ruthless Kate's the driving force behind Andrew's eviction - and why no one now dares cross her\n\nI was only 35 but felt 55.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JUSTIN ENRIQUEZ, US ASSISTANT SHOWBIZ EDITOR and CIARA FARMER, ASSISTANT SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:16:41 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:17:27 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nChris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter Apple has released a new music video after her debut was slammed as an 'off-key drunken karaoke performance.'\nThe 21-year-old nepo baby has attempted to follow in the massive footsteps of her 48-year-old Coldplay frontman father as she kickstarts her music career.\nApple dropped the visuals for the single Satellites in collaboration with indie rock duo Jade Street - comprised of Eli Meyuhas and Zachary Zwelling - on Tuesday.\nGwyneth, 53, and Chris, 48, who were married from 2003 to 2016, are parents to Apple and her brother Moses, 19, who has also set his sights on the musical world. \nColdplay has scored seven Grammy Awards and nine Brit Awards and sold more than 160 million records worldwide, while her mother has also previously shown musical prowess, singing in films Duets, Country Strong, and Infamous. \nMeanwhile, the moody song featured a just as moody music video as it was filmed in black and white at the her debut gig in Nashville last week where she was criticized for her vocals. \n\nChris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow 's daughter Apple has released a new music video after her debut was slammed as an 'off-key drunken karaoke performance'\n\nHer live singing could not be heard in the clip, however, as the studio version of the song was played as the chorus goes: 'And I wanna take you away / I wanna push 'til it breaks.'\nToward the end of the clip, the aspiring star shows off a bit of personality as she dances a little bit before thanking the crowd at the conclusion of the song.\n\n Nepo-baby Apple Martin's musical debut is likened to an 'off-key, drunken karaoke performance' \nThe rock duo opened up about how the collaboration with Chris Martin's daughter happened in an accompanying press release as they said: 'We wrote Satellites around a year ago but it never quite settled into what it wanted to be. \n'It lingered in the background for months until we played it for Apple. Her voice instantly reframed the entire song and gave it a whole new identity. It was clear that she was the missing piece the song needed and from there, the rest of the recording process felt completely instinctive.'\nThe music video was filmed at the same surprise gig where Apple had been criticized for her performance. \nAfter videos of Friday's show hit social media, an influx of comments saw the nepo-baby slammed for her vocal abilities - with many insisting she had not inherited the musical talents of the Coldplay frontman. \nThe aspiring artist was on stage at Cannery Hall in Nashville alongside musical duo Jade Street - however her performance was likened to drunken karaoke singing.\nUsers on TikTok wrote: 'Nepotism has killed art,' and, 'This is a nepotism baby I don't support.' Meanwhile, another said: 'Aren't we bored with nepotism yet?'\n\nThe 21-year-old nepo baby has attempted to follow in the massive footsteps of her 48-year-old Coldplay frontman father as she kickstarts her music career\n\nGwyneth, 53, and Chris, who were married from 2003 to 2016, are parents to Apple and her brother Moses, 19, who has also set his sights on the musical world \n\nChris and Coldplay have scored seven Grammy Awards and nine Brit Awards and sold more than 160 million records worldwide (Chris pictured in August) \n\nApple dropped the visuals for the single Satellites in collaboration with indie rock duo Jade Street - comprised of Eli Meyuhas and Zachary Zwelling - on Tuesday\n\n Meanwhile, the moody song featured a just as moody music video as it was filmed in black and white at the her debut gig in Nashville last week where she was criticized for her vocals\n\nHer live singing could not be heard in the clip, however, as the studio version of the song was played as the chorus goes: 'And I wanna take you away / I wanna push 'til it breaks'\n\nToward the end of the clip, the aspiring star shows off a bit of personality as she dances a little bit before thanking the crowd at the conclusion of the song\n\nThe rock duo opened up about how the collaboration with Chris Martin's daughter happened in an accompanying press release as they said: 'Her voice instantly reframed the entire song and gave it a whole new identity. It was clear that she was the missing piece the song needed and from there, the rest of the recording process felt completely instinctive'\nWhile her Instagram post featuring the video was met with praise, some TikTok viewers appeared more scathing in their reviews of the performance. \nAccusations of nepotism were rife following Apple's performance of song Satellite, which she collaborated on with Jade Street, which is due for release on October 28. \nOn stage, the model looked chic in a cropped white top, black mini, and knee-high boots - however her vocals were deemed wholly less impressive. \nTikTok comments included: 'That’s on inheriting Gwyneth’s audacity,' and 'Sorry but she needs to leave the singing to her dad.'\nAnother said: 'Is this a joke? I’m so confused... I was hopeful for a minute there. Maybe she’s better at acting?'\nMeanwhile, one user said: 'Nepotism. Yikes. She’s not a singer.'\nA different comment read: 'Nepotism at its finest' and 'Apple fell really far from the tree.'\n\nThe music video was filmed at the same surprise gig where Apple had been criticized for her performance \n\nHer performance was met with claims that she has not inherited her father's talent \n\nThe comments saw social media users slam the performance \n\nFurther comments on Instagram claimed she sounded like she was performing karaoke while drunk, while another likened her vocals to a famous scene in 2001's Bridget Jones's Diary, when Renée Zellweger sings while intoxicated. \nThe commenters continued: 'I sound the same after a few drinks at karaoke' and 'I'm sorry but she needs to let her dad be the singer in the family.' \nAnother wrote: 'Nepotism is wild. People with ordinary talent get the spotlight.'\nOne said: 'I've seen better singers in my town's middle school plays.'\nWhereas one mused: 'Remember the scene in Bridgette Jone’s Diary [sic] where she sang? Yea, that one.'\nIn contrast, more vetted comments on her own Instagram, which was also shared by Jade Street, read: 'Gorgeous voice!!' and 'You sound heavenly,' and 'You sound amazing,' as well as 'It’s female Chris Martian now I don’t need to switch teams thank god.'\n\nFurther comments on Instagram claimed she sounded like she was performing karaoke while drunk, while another likened her vocals to a famous scene in 2001's Bridget Jones's Diary, when Renée Zellweger drunkenly sings\n\nIn 2001's Bridget Jones's Diary, the titular character is seen performing a slurred version of Without You - the song famously performed by Harry Nilsson and Mariah Carey\n\nIn contrast, more vetted comments on her own Instagram, which was also shared by Jade Street, read: 'Gorgeous voice!!... You sound heavenly... You sound amazing... It’s female Chris Martian now I don’t need to switch teams thank god'\n'Sounds incredible!' and 'What a beautiful voice,' were posted.\nThe model is studying at Vanderbilt University and told Interview magazine earlier this year that she is 'a law, history and society major'.\nHowever, she is dabbling in acting recreationally, telling the outlet, 'I'm in the lovely Vanderbilt Original Cast, the esteemed cabaret theater group. \n'This semester's show is a musical parody of Love Island called Love on an Island. It's so fun. The songs are phenomenal.' \nShe said in the April interview, 'I have a very low voice so whenever we're doing harmonies, it'll be like, \"Alright, it's the boys and Apple.\"\n'I'm singing my absolute favorite song this semester, which I'm so excited about. I'm definitely not the best in the org, but I love it.'\nInstagramChris MartinTikTokApple Martin\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nApple Martin releases music video after nepo baby's singing was slammed as 'off-key drunken karaoke performance'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 75\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The lost thousands was bad enough... then I learned what she'd also sent 'him'\n\nDo YOU have a story? Email carina.stathis@dailymail.com.au \nBy CARINA STATHIS, SENIOR FEATURES WRITER, AUSTRALIA \n Published:12:53 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:17:19 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nAfter 25 years of being single and living alone in her retirement village, Julee Dennis never imagined she'd fall in love again – let alone with a stranger online. \nBut when 'Donald Johnson' messaged her through a dating site for singles over 60, his gentle attention and whirlwind promises proved irresistible.\n'It was nice having attention after all these years. I hadn't felt wanted for so long,' Julee, now 80, recalled.\nFor months, she woke to loving messages, daily emails and a sense of companionship she'd thought was impossible.\nDonald claimed to be a widowed construction engineer from England, formerly based in Orange, New South Wales, but now settled in Sydney after his son and daughter returned to the UK following their mother's death.\nJulee and Donald chatted via WhatsApp and email about everything from weekend plans to what they were having for breakfast.\nOccasionally, they spoke on the phone, with Donald using a British accent – deepening Julee's trust. \n'The interactions were slow, gentle and very convincing,' Julee said.\n\nJulee (pictured) had been single for 25 years when she joined an over-60s dating app and began messaging 'Donald', a British expat living in Sydney \n\nKylee (pictured with Julee) grew suspicious after seeing photos of Donald, who appeared closer to her age than her mother's \n'I decided it was my turn to get out there and get into the big world again… friends encouraged me to give online dating a go, so I did - and that's how it all started.'\nShe created a profile, listed her hobbies and described herself in a nutshell. Before long, she was exchanging messages with Donald morning and night. \n'We spoke every morning, through the day, and into the evening. I would wake up to messages from him and finally felt wanted again,' she said.\nEmails seen by the Daily Mail reveal Donald frequently used affectionate language and made emotional declarations.\nOne read: 'I just want you to know I have found the love of my life and my best friend in you… I was so alone in this whole wide world, but I found a companion for life in you when you arrived… I wish I could start my day with a warm hug from you and that will soon happen.'\nBut as Julee became more absorbed in the relationship, her daughter Kylee began to sense something wasn't right.\n'She was tired more often. I would ring her at lunchtime and she would still be in bed. In hindsight, it was because she was talking late into the night,' Kylee said.\nKylee's suspicions deepened when Julee asked for $20,000 from her late brother's estate, split into two payments.\n\nKylee (pictured) spent 14 years as a detective with the New South Wales Police Force and decided to use her skills to investigate 'Donald' and other online scammers \n'She didn't say what she needed it for, and nor did I push it. Even my husband asked me, \"Why does she need $10,000 for?\" But it was her business, not mine. So I gave it to her.'\nIn January 2023, Julee finally told Kylee about Donald and shared a photo – and alarm bells began to ring.\n'Something seemed off. He looked like he was my age. I said to my husband, \"I have a problem with this. What is his intention?\"\nWith 14 years' experience as a detective in the New South Wales Police Force, Kylee knew when things didn't add up. \n'To me, he was either using photos that didn't represent what he currently looks like, or it was a fake profile,' she said. \nKylee ran a reverse image search.\n'Within an hour, I knew the profile was fake, so I took a deep breath, poured myself another glass of wine and dug a bit deeper.\n'Mum also sent me photos of him in what looked like a conference meeting. I was able to find the photos were actually of a political reporter and a member of parliament - totally unrelated to Donald Johnson's story.'\nAfter three hours of digging, Kylee discovered the images were stolen from a real estate agent in California. \nThe hardest part was telling her mother the truth.\n'Mum, I hate to tell you but you're not speaking to Donald Johnson. You're being scammed. These photos have been stolen and belong to somebody else in America,' she told her.\n'Mum cried on the phone and was heartbroken. I broke her heart in a zillion pieces – not one of my finest moments.'\nWhen asked whether she'd sent the scammer money, Julee denied it.\n'I would never in this world send any man or woman money. I'm not that stupid,' she said, although emails show finances were discussed and Kylee is not certain what became of the $20,000 her mother requested.\n\nEXCLUSIVE The most evil Nigerian love scam ever that ended with a disabled woman taking 'horrifying' selfies \nAfter learning the truth, Julee reduced contact with Donald and eventually stopped messaging him altogether.\nKylee, meanwhile, created a fake dating profile to investigate further. Within an hour, she had uncovered ten fake profiles using stolen photos from social media. \n'I would pick photos, use reverse facial recognition to see if the images were stolen and would talk to them to understand the language they used… I wanted to see how quickly they would ask for money and was shocked by how many told me they loved me.'\nJulee said the scariest part of falling for the scam was sharing private family photos with a complete stranger. 'Now this stranger has photos of me too,' added Kylee.\nBoth women now recognise the red flags.\n'Most times, they say they're a widow whose wife died from cancer. They're coming up to retirement soon but have \"one last job\" to complete, often overseas,' Julee said.\nTrust builds gradually, supported by convincing business or family backstories.\nKylee pointed out other tactics: 'They use affectionate terms like 'my darling' or 'my love'. There's always an excuse for not meeting in person, they refuse to video call, and they tell the victim not to mention the relationship to family or friends.\nInspired by her mother's experience, Kylee launched a private investigation business, Two Face Investigators, specialising in online scams.\n'It could've been a lot worse. Remember your \"why\" when going into dating. Always pause, check and ask before believing anyone online. Until you meet in person, assume they're not real,' she warned.\nWhatsappSydney\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAn evil love scammer went after my lonely mother.

Newsom and Harris could face off for president in 2028","text":"Well, sports fans, how about this scenario — long-time frenemies Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris facing off for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination three years hence?\n\nThe two Californians’ parallel careers launched in San Francisco nearly three decades ago with the city’s storied political kingpin, Willie Brown, mentoring both. Since then, they have carefully avoided direct conflicts while maintaining at least a veneer of mutual support.\n\nHowever, on Sunday both strongly hinted at presidential campaigns in 2028 — Harris for the third time after falling short in 2020 and losing to Donald Trump in 2024, and Newsom for the first time after repeatedly disavowing interest in the White House during seven years as governor.\n\nNewsom escalated his status as a potential candidate in a pre-recorded interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, while Harris dropped her hint in a pre-recorded interview with BBC in London, which also broadcast Sunday.\n\nAsked whether he would give “serious thought” to running for president after next year’s midterm elections, Newsom responded, “Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise. I’d just be lying. And I’m not … I can’t do that.”\n\nWhen asked if he is moving closer to finding a reason to run he answered, “Fate will determine that.”\n\nHis coy response notwithstanding, Newsom has been developing a national image with a possible presidential run in mind, soliciting national media attention and making appearances in other states.\n\nWith Trump back in the White House, Newsom has appointed himself resistor-in-chief and has taken to mocking Trump in social media posts. Polls indicate he has gained traction as a potential candidate.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has been touring to tout her memoir about her brief campaign against Trump last year after Biden, who had chosen her as his vice presidential running mate in 2020, declared he would not seek re-election.\n\n“I am not done,” Harris told the interviewer. “I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it’s in my bones.”\n\nAsked about polls indicating only lukewarm support for another White House run, Harris responded, “If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”\n\nKuenssberg wrote that Harris has been reticent about plans to run for president, but “her candor in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.”\n\nIf Harris is “not done” with politics and the governorship is off the table, what else could be on her political horizon other than another presidential bid?\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"If Harris is “not done” with politics and the governorship is off the table, what else could be on her political horizon other than another presidential bid?","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/10/28/friends-or-enemies-newsom-and-harris-could-face-off-for-president-in-2028/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sut-z-oe-benefits-3.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 17:18:49","author":"Dan Walters,Gqlshare","authors":["Dan Walters","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":373441362,"title":"Controversial UFC fighter takes back his Trump support in wild rant: ‘I was fooled’","text":"Controversial UFC fighter Bryce Mitchell appeared to change his tune when it came to President Donald Trump.\n\nMitchell, who has previously made antisemitic remarks when it comes to the Holocaust and Adolf Hitler, labeled Trump the “Antichrist” in a bewildering rant posted to his Instagram account on Friday.\n\n“I do not like the guy at all,” Mitchell said. “The first thing for me was he didn’t release the Epstein files. They’re even acting like they didn’t exist. And, of course, they’re sending Israel and Ukraine all of our tax dollars just like the numb-nuts before him did. Putting America last, and now he’s blaming the beef farmers for the price of beef. Hey, I’m not biased, man. He talked a good game, he tricked me. I was fooled. I admit it.\n\n“Now, let me tell you how bad I think this is though. This is really this bad, guys. I want y’all, if you’re a Christian, I want you to get into Revelation 13:3, and I want you to read that verse — yeah, about the Antichrist, about the one who was fatally wounded in the head; then he was miraculously healed and the whole world marveled at him and said, ‘No man can make war with him.’ Yeah, I do think that Donald Trump is that beast of Revelation 13:3. Yeah, go read it. Go read it.”\n\nMitchell said last year he would “take a bullet” for Trump as the president was campaigning against then-Vice President Kamala Harris for the White House.

Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. Former Vice President Kamala Harris also endorsed him in an oblique tone that we have all come to know and expect from Kamala. Rather than outright endorsing him and planting her flag firmly, she told MSNBC that since he is the Democrat in the race, she supports the Democrat. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Half-Heartedly Backs Socialist Zohran Mamdani Without Even Saying His Name)\n\nMost recently, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who held out for as long as possible, finally lined up behind Mamdani. (The other major New York Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, is still quiet.)\n\n Jeffries endorses Mamdani with the enthusiasm of a pout and crossed arms lol https://t.co/dozhVJjih9 pic.twitter.com/4i5mfv4Np2 — Prem Thakker (@prem_thakker) October 24, 2025\n\n“As with any Mayor, there will be areas of agreement and areas of principled disagreement. Yet, the stakes are existential,” Jeffries said in his rather passive-aggressive statement.\n\nYet, despite a growing list of support, a new Suffolk poll released Monday suggests that the endorsements haven’t played much of a role in swaying voters.\n\nThe new poll found that among likely voters, Mamdani garnered nearly 44% of support, and now has a 10-point lead over Andrew Cuomo, who earned nearly 34% of support. Republican Curtis Sliwa trailed behind with 10.8%, while 7.2% of those polled remained undecided, according to the poll.\n\nIn mid-September, a separate Suffolk University poll had put Mamdani in a more dominant position with 45% support, overshadowing Cuomo’s 25.2%, Sliwa’s 8.6%, while 9.4% of respondents remained undecided.\n\nCuomo also made notable progress with Hispanic and Independent voters. In September, Cuomo trailed Mamdani by 30 points among Hispanic voters. According to the new poll, he’s leading by one point in October. Similarly, he moved from trailing Mamdani by 18 points among Independents to a 10-point lead. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nA caveat, though: it’s only one poll, and certainly does not mean that Mamdani’s support has collapsed, or that he is no longer the favorite in the race.\n\nBut it does indicate that New Yorkers simply don’t care about these sorts of endorsements, which seem to excite the Washington media class more than the people actually voting in the election. After all, this is still a local race. It’s still about New York City, its residents, and which path the city will take for the next several years.\n\nOr, that some of the endorsements are perhaps making things worse for Mamdani.\n\nMamdani held a buzzy rally Sunday with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. Although such an event may titillate his most passionate, loyal supporters, it may do the exact opposite with Independents. Glowing endorsements from D.C.’s most left-wing politicians might solidify one’s socialist bona fides. It also might inspire a chill of fear in a working-class Hispanic, neither a Republican nor a Democrat, who is concerned about his family’s safety as they walk to school.","summary":"Poll On Zohran Mamdani One Week Before Election Shows That No One Cares About Democrats' Leaders","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/28/zohran-mamdani-suffolk-poll-lead-andrew-cuomo-gaining-hispanics-hakeem-jeffries-endorsement/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F10%2FGettyImages-2243206466-scaled-e1761667642183.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 16:59:04","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":373446362,"title":"KJP Goes Completely Off The Rails Trying To Explain Why Her Book Is So Terrible","text":"Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre went completely off the rails in an interview with The New Yorker as she tried to promote her new book.\n\nJean-Pierre released a book on Oct. 21 titled “Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,” in which she announced that she left the Democratic party after seeing how they betrayed former President Joe Biden. The former press secretary did an interview with The New Yorker to promote her book, which quickly turned combative as Jean-Pierre tried to explain what she wrote about. The New Yorker published a transcript of their conversation, which is detailed in excerpts below. (RELATED: Karine Jean-Pierre Can’t Figure Out Why Democrats Lost Even As She Doubles Down On ‘Woke’)\n\nThe interview starts with The New Yorker asking Jean-Pierre why she thought the Democratic party was trying to undermine Biden. After a few questions in a similar vein, Jean-Pierre starts talking about how she began to think about how to treat people and how it relates to her as a black woman.\n\n“Sorry, I’m not trying to be dense. I’m a little unclear about what this has to do with Democratic leaders and many Democrats in the country thinking that Joe Biden was going to lose to Donald Trump—which was what the polls all showed—and therefore thinking that he should be replaced,” Isaac Chotiner of The New Yorker says.\n\n“O.K., wait a minute. Hold on a second. Nobody knows anything. Nobody knows what would’ve happened,” Jean-Pierre replies. “People also thought that if you replace Joe Biden we were going to win, or have a better chance of winning. Millions of people who showed up in 2020 didn’t show up in 2024. We can’t forget that there was an incumbency issue as well. This is real. There are, like, several G-10 countries with incumbents who did not get reelected. There was an incumbency issue as well.”\n\n“I’m not sure what you’re saying,” Chotiner responds.\n\n“No, no, no. Wait a minute. You are saying that this was their thinking, and they were kind of predicting. But nobody knew what was going to happen,” Jean-Pierre argues.\n\n“Nobody knew that Joe Biden was going to win in 2020. Nobody knew what was going to happen in 2024. People believed in their hearts that Kamala was going to win. They believed it. They saw the polling and they thought she was going to win, looking at the polling. Nobody knew anything. I’m only bringing up the polls because you brought up the polls to me,” she continues.\n\nThe New Yorker continued to press Jean-Pierre for clarity on her argument, which mirrors what she wrote in the book. In many answers, Jean-Pierre seems flustered, repeating “no, no” or “wait a minute, wait a minute.”\n\nAt one point in the interview, Chotiner points out that Jean-Pierre has both said that Biden shouldn’t have been forced out of the race and that he should have, just not the way it happened.\n\n“But it should have happened, or shouldn’t have happened?” Chotiner asks.\n\n“Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,” Jean-Pierre responds. “I don’t think it should have happened. I believe that we should have done everything that we could, regardless of who was at the top of the ticket, and fought extremely hard. He was the one at the top of the ticket, and so, therefore, I believe we should have fought to make sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won. That’s what I believed.”\n\n“When he decided to run in 2023, we have to also remember what was happening at that moment. There was no red wave in the midterms. Matter of fact, the President and the Vice-President did better than any incumbent President in their first midterm. Polling was saying that it was going to be a red wave,” Jean-Pierre says, repeating an argument she made in her book.\n\nJean-Pierre also gets tongue-tied when asked by The New Yorker if Biden could have done the job of president for four more years.\n\n“One could conceivably think that he could do the job through January, 2025, but that it was not wise to think he could do the job through January, 2029, right?” Chotiner asks.\n\n“It’s not my place to say,” Jean-Pierre responds.\n\n“What do you mean it’s not your place to say?” Chotiner follows up.\n\n“No, no, no. Wait, I’m answering the question. I did not see anything that would cause me concern. That is my answer,” Jean-Pierre backtracks.\n\nJean-Pierre and The New Yorker also have a back and forth about how the former press secretary admits in her book that she did not ever think former Vice President Harris could win the election, but how simultaneously she thought it was an insult to Harris to try to force her off the ticket.\n\nThe former press secretary defends her statements but says her book is about “[her] experience.”\n\n“I’m not trying to discount what you’re saying about Harris, but Biden is not an LGBTQ black woman, and you have the same feelings about how he was treated. This is what you keep going back to in the book,” Chotiner counters. “Sometimes I worry about losing sight of the fact that we’re dealing with a presidential election here, and the feelings of Joe Biden are less important than the fate of the country.”\n\n“You’re telling me about the feelings of Joe Biden, blah, blah, blah, but Joe Biden is out of the picture. He’s out of the picture,” Jean-Pierre responds.\n\n“Yeah, he sure is,” Chotiner said.\n\n“He’s out of the picture now and we lost,” Jean-Pierre responds.\n\n“This is what you wrote your book about.

What are they doing?” Jean-Pierre asks.\n\n“I’m not here to answer for the Democratic leadership. I would—” Chotiner says before Jean-Pierre interjects.\n\n“You’ve been answering for the Democratic leadership. [Laughs.] You were giving me their answers,” Jean-Pierre responds, according to the transcript.\n\n“I didn’t talk to anyone in Democratic leadership. I was just trying to remember how I and others felt watching Joe Biden in those weeks, that it felt like he was too old to be president for another four years, and too old to win,” Chotiner says.\n\n“And here’s the thing: That’s your experience. That’s the experience that you had,” Jean-Pierre says, and according to the transcript, the interview concludes.","summary":"'He’s out of the picture now and we lost'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/28/karine-jean-pierre-new-yorker-independent-white-house-joe-biden/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F10%2FGettyImages-2194099202-scaled-e1761666688297.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 16:56:13","author":"Reagan Reese","authors":["Reagan Reese"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.639},{"id":373465792,"title":"Bill Gates Backtracks on Climate Alarmism, but Still Embraces Plenty of Extreme Positions","text":"In a recent memo, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has pushed back against what he calls a “doomsday outlook” on climate change, signaling a shift in his views on the risks posed by a warming planet. Despite the move, he remains an extremist on a variety of issues, including his belief that we need a new “god” for humans to worship in the age of AI.\n\nBill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who reinvented himself as a creepy advocate for climate alarmism and other leftist causes, has appeared to shift his stance on the issue. In a lengthy memo released Tuesday, Gates sought to tamp down the alarmism he said many people use to describe the effects of rising temperatures, calling instead for redirecting efforts toward improving lives in the developing world.\n\n“Although climate change will have serious consequences — particularly for people in the poorest countries — it will not lead to humanity’s demise,” Gates wrote. “People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.”\n\nThis memo comes just four years after Gates published a book titled How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, and seems to amount to a major reframing of how the billionaire philanthropist, who is worth an estimated $122 billion, is thinking about the challenges posed by a rapidly warming world. The memo arrives a week before world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the United Nations annual climate summit, known this year as COP30. Gates, who has attended the event in previous years, will not be participating this time.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that Gates forecasted his latest comments when he stopped providing funds to a foundation pushes woke causes. And in May, Gates announced plans to wind down the Gates Foundation, which has spent billions on climate-related issues, including a $1.4 billion commitment to help farmers in poor countries adapt to a hotter planet.\n\nDespite Gates’ seeming change of heart on pushing climate alarmism, he remains dedicated to a variety of extreme leftist positions. Here are some of Breitbart Tech’s favorite Gates stories from recent years:\n\nGates believes we need a new digital god:\n\nBreitbart News reported last year that Gates believes we need a new god for the age of AI:\n\nIn his remarks, Gates acknowledged the tremendous potential of AI to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, such as disease, hunger, and climate change. However, he also cautioned that the allure of these technologies could be so great that people may become addicted to them, spending more time in virtual worlds than in the real one.\nTo counteract this risk, Gates suggested that a new spiritual framework may be necessary to keep humanity grounded and connected to one another. “You know, you can almost call it a new religion or a new philosophy of, okay, how do we stay connected with each other, not addicted to these things that’ll make video games look like nothing in terms of the attractiveness of spending time on them,” he said.\n\nGates thinks its fine to fly in a private jet because he is saving the world:\nBreitbart News reported in 2023 that Gates brushed aside criticism of his own carbon footprint because he is so important to the climate debate:\n\nGates went on to argue that his own investment in clean energy and other environmental and public health programs warrants his travel for those purposes.\n“I spend billions of dollars on … climate innovation. So, you know, should I stay at home and not come to Kenya and learn about farming and malaria?” Gates pleaded rhetorically, an assertion for special treatment he has previously made when challenged on his travelling habits.\n\nGates funds research to turn mosquitos into “flying syringes:’\n\nBreitbart News reported in 2024 on one of Gates’ more sinister research projects:\n\nIn a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists have demonstrated the effectiveness of using mosquitoes as “flying syringes” to vaccinate humans against malaria. The research, conducted at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, represents a new and potentially worrying advancement in vaccine technology.\nThe study involved genetically modifying malaria parasites to stop developing after a certain period of time in the human body. The modified parasites, named GA1 and GA2, were designed to prime the immune system without causing a full-blown malaria infection. Researchers then infected mosquitoes with these engineered parasites and allowed them to bite human test subjects in a controlled setting.\n\nGates supported Kamala Harris to the tune of $50 million:\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that Bill Gates threw his support behind Kamala Harris before her utter election defeat:\n\nThree sources confirmed to the New York Times that Bill Gates donated to Future Forward, though he reportedly wanted the donation to remain private, considering he often does not endorse presidential candidates. Social media in support of Harris campaign celebrated news of his donation.\n“Bill Gates just contributed more than $50 million to organizations supporting Kamala Harris. This is huge,” announced the account Kamala’s Wins.\n\nBreitbart News will continue to report on Bill Gates and his extreme positions.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.","summary":"In a recent memo, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has pushed back against what he calls a \"doomsday outlook\" on climate change, signaling a shift in his views on the risks posed by a warming planet.

Nancy Pelosi’s speedy endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris – and chewed the former House speaker out in an angry phone call, according to a new book. \n\nLess than 24 hours after President Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid, Pelosi said her enthusiasm for Harris’ candidacy was “official, personal and political,” and that she believed the former California Senator was the candidate best suited to defeat Donald Trump. \n\nPelosi’s eagerness to endorse Harris apparently drew ire from Obama, who reportedly wanted to let a “process” determine the Democratic nominee – and thought Pelosi was on the same page, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl wrote in his new book, “Retribution.” \n\n“The Obamas were not happy,” a Pelosi confidant told Karl, according to an excerpt obtained by The Daily Mail. \n\nObama called Pelosi soon after her public endorsement, Karl wrote, noting, “This person summed up Obama’s message to Pelosi as, essentially, ‘What the f**k did you just do?”\n\nMeanwhile, the former top Democrat told the 44th president, “That train has left the station,” according to the report. \n\nPelosi’s endorsement came as a surprise to Obama, as he and Pelosi were in “regular communication” as it grew increasingly evident that the then-81-year-old Biden would drop out of the race. The two reportedly “agreed Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged,” Karl wrote. \n\nObama and Pelosi “privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements” before Biden shockingly dropped out of the race on July 21, 2024, the book claims. \n\n“The former president wanted to know what had happened. Why had Pelosi issued a statement endorsing Harris so soon? Hadn’t he and Pelosi agreed days earlier that party leaders anointing the vice president as Biden’s replacement would be a mistake?” Karl wrote. \n\nA source close to Obama told the author he wasn’t actually angry with Pelosi over the endorsement, and characterized the conversation as a “good-natured ribbing.” However, the source close to Pelosi said Obama sounded “genuinely irritated” during the call. \n\nMeanwhile, at least one Biden official believed that Obama, who waited five days to endorse Harris, didn’t believe the then-VP could win. \n\n“There’s only one Black Jesus,” the senior Biden advisor told Karl. \n\nEven Pelosi’s husband was stunned by her quick endorsement, reportedly questioning, “Kamala?” according to the book. \n\n“Don’t start with me,” the California Democrat reportedly replied. \n\nIn “Retribution,” hitting bookstores Tuesday, Karl notes that, as many other prominent Democrats, like the Clintons and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, endorsed Harris, Pelosi “had no choice.” \n\n“No other candidates had stepped forward — Kamala Harris was it. The only thing Pelosi could do was try to help her win the election,” Karl wrote.","summary":"Obama and Pelosi had reportedly agreed to abstain from making any endorsements, according to the book","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/obama-nancy-pelosi-endorsement-kamala-harris-b2853852.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/13/14/42/Obama-Foundation-Democracy-Forum-5mbg2vha.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/W3VBtGp2-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-28 16:53:08","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.669},{"id":373432350,"title":"Has Kamala Harris Made a Decision?","text":"As seen on Gutfeld! former President Joe Biden describes these times as “dark days.” Meanwhile, what’s Kamala Harris’s decision?

The future of the party seemed destined for socialism when the trio of self-identified democratic socialists — New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — joined forces to rally more than 10,000 New York City voters at Forest Hills Stadium on Sunday. But with one week until Election Day, the report, \"Deciding to Win,\" is urging Democrats back to the center. \"To win elections, Democrats need to make the following changes. First, we need to focus more on the issues voters do not think we prioritize enough (the economy, the cost of living, health care, border security, public safety), and focus less on the issues voters think we prioritize too highly (climate change, democracy, abortion, and identity and cultural issues),\" authors Simon Bazelon, Lauren Harper Pope and Liam Kerr wrote. \"Second, we need to moderate our positions on issues where our agenda is unpopular, including immigration, public safety, energy production, and some identity and cultural issues,\" the trio of researchers and Democratic operatives added. POLITICAL ANALYST SAYS DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT THE 'BIG PROBLEM' OF WINNING BACK VOTERS FOR 2028 The Democratic Party has been without a clear leader since former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election to President Donald Trump last year. NYC VOTERS EMBRACE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM AS AOC, SANDERS STUMP FOR MAMDANI Ahead of the midterm elections in 2026, the New York City mayoral race has dominated the national political stage this year. New York Democrats, such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Gov. Kathy Hochul, waited months to endorse the Democratic nominee. Republicans, meanwhile, have capitalized on such endorsements as embracing a far-left agenda, including Trump who labeled Mamdani a \"communist\" – a moniker he rejected. New York City voters who attended the star-studded rally in Queens on Sunday embraced democratic socialism and told Fox News Digital that Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez represent the future of the Democratic Party. But released the following day, the \"Deciding to Win\" report, first shared with Semafor, pushes Democrats back to the center. The report is based on \"thousands of election results, hundreds of public polls and academic papers, dozens of case studies, and surveys of more than 500,000 voters we conducted since the 2024 election.\" According to Semafor's reporting, elected Democrats are set to receive copies of the report as early as this week, and there will be events in Washington, D.C., and New York City to promote it. Democratic campaign staffers are more liberal than Democratic voters and are more likely to be \"on average, younger, more highly educated, more likely to be white, more likely to be female, and less likely to attend church than both Democratic voters and the overall electorate,\" according to academic research by the American Political Science Review. While the report finds that \"most voters are white, most voters are non-college-educated, and most voters are over the age of 50,\" the authors argue that Democrats are meanwhile pulled to the left by donors and campaign staffers. \"Research from Data for Progress shows that Democratic elites are significantly to the left of the general public, and that the gap between Democratic elites and the public is larger than the gap between Republican elites and the public,\" the report states, arguing that both Democratic donors and campaign staffers push the party to the left, away from the electorate. \"To win again, Democrats need to listen more to voters and less to out-of-touch donors, detached party elites, and Democratic politicians who consistently underperform the top of the ticket,\" the authors wrote. This has created a disconnect between the Democratic forces driving the national conversation and the voters who actually turn out for elections, according to the report. Since President Barack Obama won his re-election campaign in 2012, the authors claim that the Democratic Party has moved to the left on \"essentially every issue.\" They conclude that today’s Democratic Party is more focused on climate change, democracy, abortion and identity politics than on the economy and the middle class. With that shift, they say, more voters now see the party as \"out of touch.\" The authors encourage Democrats to refocus policy agendas on lowering costs and building the economy and advocate for \"popular\" economic policies as opposed to student loan forgiveness or Medicare-for-all. They also urge Democrats to focus less on things like climate change and abortion and more on the cost of living. That includes moderating positions on immigration, public safety, energy production and some identity or cultural issues, while rejecting economic influence in politics. \"First, voters' frustrations with the status quo are not the same as a desire for socialism. And second, criticizing the status quo is a complement to advocating for popular policies on the issues that matter most to the American people, not a substitute,\" the authors said. The authors acknowledge that Democrats have \"much to learn\" from Mamdani, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders about prioritizing affordability, just as they should from Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego's approach to border security in Arizona. Democrats should prioritize an \"unwavering focus on the economic issues that are the top priorities of working-class Americans while meeting voters where they are on issues like immigration and public safety,\" according to the authors. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP While pushing Democrats to the center, the authors argue that \"Deciding to Win does not advocate for giving up our party's core values or for refusing to stand up for disadvantaged groups.\" The report encourages Democrats to \"be brave,\" rejecting third-party demands and \"embracing new media platforms and unscripted events with voters, rather than listening to consultants whose greatest fear is their candidate making a mistake.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the DNC for comment but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"Research reveals a disconnect between Democratic elites and voters, and recommends that the party shift away from far-left issues and focus on affordability and public safety.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/radical-far-left-priorities-have-alienated-democrat-voters-report","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/mamdani-supporters.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 16:40:59","author":"Deirdre Heavey","authors":["Deirdre Heavey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":373424900,"title":"Lily Allen hints she has mended her relationship with ex David Harbour as she defends 'cruel' album and denies seeking revenge with explicit lyrics","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoment police Taser and arrest Afghan national after triple stabbing which left dog walker, 49, dead when he 'tried to break up fight and was slashed across the neck'\n\nWilliam 'threatened to strip Eugenie and Beatrice of their titles unless Andrew and Fergie left Royal Lodge'\n\nIt's not me, it's Brexit!

Lily is leaving behind features an eye-catching tiger-print media room and a luxury kitchen inspired by The Godfather\n\nWhile it also boasts floral Parisian-inspired rooms and a stunning walk-in wardrobe filled with designer goods\n\nLily's marriage broke down last December after she accused David of having multiple affairs including a three-year affair with a younger costume designer (pictured in 2023)\nWhile the living room is filled with 'detailed crown mouldings,' it leads to a private garden that features a sauna and cold plunge at the owner's disposal.\nAs well as two guest bedrooms on the third floor, the house also boasts a fully-furnished basement with a gym storage space and a laundry room. \nA local admitted it's been 'quite some time' since it seems anyone has lived in the property, telling the publication: 'Every house on the street has Halloween decorations, but not Lily and David's.'\nLily relocated to London she and David split last year, having discovered he'd been having a three-year affair. \n\n Lily Allen's sordid confessions: The most explosive reveals on stung star's new album \nBut the star has shared in a new interview she would like to return to New York in the future, telling The Sunday Times Culture Magazine: 'My recovery is in New York and my health is a huge priority.'\nThe star added that she finds the support and therapy she gets to help with her struggles with alcohol and drug addiction are better in the US.\nIn P***y Palace, Lily sings how she arrives at an apartment in the West Village where her ex was living, but instead with greeted with 'sex toys and lube'.\n'I found a shoebox full of handwritten letters,' Allen sings in the second verse of the track: 'From broken-hearted women wishing you could have been better. Sheets pulled off the bed, they're strewn all on the floor. Long black hair, probably from the night before.' \nLate last year, Lily was forced to sell her beloved home in The Cotswolds to pay a hefty tax bill, but has since bought a property in Notting Hill, where she grew up.\n'She's a west London girl and is loving being back,' a family friend told Daily Mail's Richard Eden. 'Her new place is just a ten-minute walk from her mum's home and they are very close.'\nLily, who has two children with her ex-husband Sam Cooper, sold her 17th-century home in Cranham, Gloucestershire, for £4.2 million in 2016 after being sued by an ex-tour manager for more than £100,000.\n'I had my house of dreams.' she later reminisced. 'I did it up so nice, it was my life project, the place where I was going to raise my children.'\nShe added: 'I'm a firm believer in paying tax. But I got sued. I had to pay him off, with the money I'd put aside for my tax.\n'I tried to work out a deal with HMRC to pay them back in instalments, but they said no. It was absolutely soul-destroying, and a real lesson in life.'\nThe record comes after a turbulent time in Lily's life following the breakdown of her marriage last December after she accused David of having multiple affairs including his three-year affair with a younger costume designer.\nThe Mail on Sunday has exclusively revealed the identity of 'Madeline' and spoke to her from her home in the US.\nLily's fans have said the song is a modern-day equivalent of Beyonce's 'Becky with the good hair,' which featured on a song called Sorry, a cheating diss track from her 2016 album Lemonade. \n\nThe singer has caused a huge stir with her record West End Girl, which features the song P***y Palace, where she describes her ex's apartment filled with 'sex toys and lube'\nThe lyrics see Lily appearing to suggest the couple had an open arrangement in regards to sex, as long as it was discrete, with paid strangers and not based on emotional connection.\nShe sings: 'How long has it been going on? Is it just sex or is there emotion?/ He told me it would stay in hotel rooms, never be out in the open.\nThe chorus reads: 'We had an arrangement/ Be discrete and don't be blatant. There had to be payment/ It had to be with strangers/ But you're not a stranger, Madeline.'\nSpeaking to The Times, Lily seemingly confirmed that 'agreed-upon boundaries were not adhered to' in her relationship with David, while addressing how apps had made cheating easier. \nShe said: 'There are usually agreed-upon boundaries in relationships. But whether those boundaries are adhered to or not is becoming a grey area all of a sudden. \n'Dating apps make people disposable and that leads to the idea that if you are not happy, there's so much more to choose from — right in your pocket.\nLily famously uncovered David's infidelity when she discovered his profile on celebrity dating app, Raya, and 'joined the dots'.\nThe pop star joined the app herself, pretending to be 'looking for women' – and allegedly found that her now ex-husband had already set up a dating profile.\nSpeaking to the publication, she detailed how she believed dating apps were making people 'disposable' and changing conventional ideas about monogamy.\nHer split from David led Lily to check into a £8,000-a-week trauma treatment centre to focus on her mental health.\nAnd she admitted that she has used her music as a way to work through the dark feelings she was having and to 'lay my truth on the table'.\nLily AllenDavid HarbourNew York\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLily Allen hints she has mended her relationship with ex David Harbour as she defends 'cruel' album and denies seeking revenge with explicit lyrics\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 19\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SONIA HORON, US ASSISTANT SHOWBIZ EDITOR \n Published:15:36 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:16:34 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nJennifer Lawrence is not opposed to plastic surgery.\nFor the Hunger Games star, 35, shared she is looking to get a boob job and revealed all of the procedures she's had in an interview with The New Yorker.\nThe actress said that 'nothing bounced back' after welcoming her second child earlier this year with husband Cooke Maroney, 41.\n'Everything bounced back, pretty much, after the first one,' she said, speaking of her first pregnancy with her eldest son, Cy. 'Second one, nothing bounced back.' \nLawrence said that she's planning to shoot a nude scene on-camera in spring.\nThe actress also said that she would still get the surgery if she wasn't a famous actress.\n'Maybe I wouldn't be hustling to the appointment in the same way,' the star said, adding, 'But I think yes.'\n\nJennifer Lawrence, 35, revealed her plans to get a boob job and shared all of the plastic surgery she's had in a new interview with The New Yorker; Seen October 17\n\n Jennifer Lawrence FINALLY reveals gender of second child \nIn terms of the enhancements she's already had done, Lawrence admitted she gets Botox, but said she is mindful of the fact that she needs to use her forehead to express emotions as an actress.\nShe also revealed that she doesn't get fillers because they show on camera.\nLawrence went on to clarify that she hasn't had a facelift, but added, 'Believe me, I'm gonna!'\nElsewhere in the interview, Lawrence finally revealed the gender of her second child as she opened up about her postpartum anxiety battle.\nThe star welcomed her second baby, now over six months old, in March with her husband, art gallery director Cooke.\nWhile talking about her new film, the movie adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel Die, My Love, produced by Martin Scorsese, she revealed she welcomed a second son — whose name she might have accidentally hinted at in September.\nShe said that with the birth of her first child Cy in February 2022, she 'wasn't really having a bad postpartum.'\nIn contrast, she said of her second child: 'I had a worse postpartum with my second, but the first time the only thing I was at war with was the rest of the world.'\n\nLawrence said that she's planning to shoot a nude scene on-camera in spring, but added that she would still get the surgery if she wasn't a famous actress; Seen in 2024 in Paris\n\nThe actress said that 'nothing bounced back' after welcoming her second child earlier this year with husband Cooke Maroney; She is seen during her pregnancy in 2024\n\n'I just thought every time he was sleeping he was dead,' the Oscar winner said.\n'I thought he cried because he didn’t like his life, or me, or his family. I thought I was doing everything wrong, and that I would ruin my children.'\nLawrence said she was prescribed Zurzuvae, a recently developed drug, to help with her postpartum anxiety.\nShe recounted a story about crying while asking ChatGPT a question about breastfeeding, and said the kind response from AI chatbot made her more anxious and doubt herself even more.\n'You're doing the most amazing thing for your baby. You're such a loving mother,' it had told her, but she said that a robot would tell her that made her question the sincerity of other people who said the same thing to her.\nDuring the same interview, the No Hard Feelings star talked about her longtime battle with anxiety.\n'I feel like I am driven by anxiety,' she shared at one point. \n'When I was a kid, I soothed my anxiety by trying to be good, trying to do the right thing, so that I wouldn't upset God or my parents.'\n\nLawrence also finally revealed the gender of her second child, sharing she gave birth to a baby boy. She and husband Cooke already share older son Cy; the pair seen in 2023\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Vogue, Lawrence opened up about the joy of becoming a first-time mother, sharing that the birth of Cy 'felt like my whole life had started over.'\n'I just stared. I was just so in love. I also fell in love with all babies everywhere.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy SEAN O'GRADY, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:15:46 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:16:24 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nLouis Tomlinson has stuck up for Simon Cowell after he was criticised by One Direction fans following the death of Liam Payne. \nThe One Direction star fell to his death from the third floor balcony of his hotel in Buenos Aires in October of 2024, aged 31. \nSimon faced backlash after his passing, with X Factor's Katie Waissel declaring 'we all know the truth' and Rebecca Ferguson criticising the 'exploitation and profiteering of young stars'.\nKatie, a singer-songwriter who auditioned alongside Liam on the 2010 series of X Factor, name-checked Simon in two statements in which she accused music bosses of focusing on 'profits rather than people'. \nBut Liam's bandmate Louis has said he believes the adults who worked with One Direction during their rise to fame as teenagers did a good job.\n'Look, in any situation similar to this, hindsight is a really powerful thing. I don’t blame anyone for my experience in One Direction,' he told The Independent.\n\nLouis Tomlinson has stuck up for Simon Cowell after he was criticised by One Direction fans following the death of Liam Payne \n\nSimon faced backlash after Liam's passing, with Katie Waissel declaring 'we all know the truth' and Rebecca Ferguson criticising the 'exploitation and profiteering of young stars'\nLouis added that the hardest thing about being in One Direction was having to deal with sudden fame at such a young age. \n'But what was really challenging, more than any of those things, was being young and really famous and having people outside the hotels. \n'If you wanted to just go and get a coffee… even wanting to go for a s*** and having to walk [there] with your security. It's dehumanising, those kinds of things.'\nSimon was said to have 'sobbed' uncontrollably after being told of Liam's death. \nHis friend Sinitta told The Sun: 'He was absolutely devastated. I spoke to Simon, obviously it was a private conversation, but he usually contains his emotions, he's quite stoic isn't he, but he was absolutely gone.\n'Just holding the phone, he was just sobbing. It's the first time in my life I thought 'well we normally come to you when we don't know what to do,' but he was absolutely devastated.\n'They were like his babies. He went on this journey with them, he was part of it - he was almost the sixth member.'\nSinitta said that fan criticism over Simon's involvement in Liam's troubled life has been 'unfair'.\n\nLiam's bandmate Louis has said he believes the adults who worked with One Direction during their rise to fame as teenagers did a good job\n\n'Look, in any situation similar to this, hindsight is a really powerful thing. I don’t blame anyone for my experience in One Direction,' he said (Simon and One Direction pictured in 2013) \nShe said that while people have said Simon should have done more to help, he wasn't to blame for Liam's untimely death, saying: 'Liam was a grown man' and 'you can't bubble wrap everyone.' \nSimon met Liam when he auditioned for X Factor for the very first time at the age of 14. \nAnd upon learning of his death, Simon released a touching tribute to the 'kind, funny and talented', pop star, who 'never forgot the fans'. \nHe wrote: 'You never really know how you feel about someone until a moment like this happens.\n'Liam, I am truly devastated. Heartbroken. And I feel empty. And I want you to know how much love and respect I have for you. Every tear I have shed is a memory of you.\n'This is so difficult to put in words right now. I went outside today, and I thought about so many times we had together. \n'I wanted to let you know what I would always say to the thousands of people who would always ask me. \n'What is Liam like? And I would tell them you were kind, funny, sweet, thoughtful, talented, humble, focused. And how much you loved music. And how much love you genuinely had for the fans.\n'I had to tell you when you were 14 that this wasn't your time. And we both made a promise that we would meet again. \n\nSinitta said Simon was 'absolutely devastated' following Liam's death \n\nSimon released a touching tribute to Liam on Instagram after ehe died describing him as 'kind, funny and talented\n\nSimon met Liam when he auditioned for X Factor for the very first time at the age of 14 \n\n'A lot of people would have given up. You didn't. You came back and within months the whole world knew Liam. \n'And you never forgot the fans. I watched you spending so much time with people who had wanted to meet you. You really cared.\n'You came to see me last year. Not for a meeting. Just to sit and talk. And we reminisced about all of the fun times we had together. \n'And how proud you were to be a Dad. After you left, I was reminded that you were still the sweet, kind boy I met all of those years ago.\nHe continued: 'I have met your son, Bear. He has your smile and that twinkle in his eyes you have.\n'And he will be so proud of everything you achieved. And how you achieved it.\n'I always thought of the 5 of you in the band as brothers. And reading their messages today I believe you were.\n'And now Liam, I can see the effect you had on so many people. Because you left us too soon.\n'Rest in peace my friend. And I am sending my love, thoughts and prayers to your family. Simon X'. \nRebecca FergusonSinittaBuenos Aires\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLouis Tomlinson sticks up for Simon Cowell after he was criticised following Liam Payne's death\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy EMMA GUINNESS \n Published:16:14 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:16:17 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nThe BBC has confirmed the fate of Doctor Who as Disney+ quits its partnership with the troubled sci-fi series after just two seasons.\nDespite rumours that the long-running show could be facing the axe, fans will be delighted to learn that there will be a Christmas special written by Russell T Davies, but not until 2026.\nThe broadcaster has stressed that while a new season of the show itself has yet to be announced, they are 'fully committed' to the show and plan to confirm it 'in due course'. \nLindsay Salt, Director of Drama at the BBC, said: 'We'd like to thank Disney+ for being terrific global partners and collaborators over the past two seasons, and for the upcoming The War Between the Land and the Sea. \n'The BBC remains fully committed to Doctor Who, which continues to be one of our most loved dramas, and we are delighted that Russell T Davies has agreed to write us another spectacular Christmas special for 2026. \n'We can assure fans, the Doctor is not going anywhere, and we will be announcing plans for the next series in due course which will ensure the TARDIS remains at the heart of the BBC.' \n\nThe BBC has confirmed the fate of Doctor Who after Disney+ QUIT its partnership with the troubled sci-fi series - confirming that there will be Christmas special in 2026\n\nThe broadcaster has stressed that while a new season of the show itself has yet to be announced, they are 'fully committed' to the show and plan to confirm it 'in due course'\n\nAs well as the upcoming Christmas special, fans also have the spin-off series The War Between the Land and the Sea to look forward to.\nWhile an exact release date has yet to be announced, it is expected to air in 2026. \nThe five-part series will centre on a war between humanity and an ancient species known as the Sea Devils. \nThe update comes hot on the heels of Prince William's visit to the Doctor Who set ahead of the Welsh BAFTAs earlier this month. \nThe 43-year-old royal enjoyed a special, behind-the-scenes tour of the much-loved television show, after being invited to one of Wales' most successful TV and film studios.\nIn a video released on the Kensington Palace Instagram account today, the Prince of Wales could be seen visiting Bad Wolf Studios in Cardiff, which has produced iconic TV series including Doctor Who and His Dark Materials.\nThe Prince is President of BAFTA and has long been a champion of the homegrown arts.\nThe royal, who attended the studios solo, is seen browsing the futuristic technology behind the Time Lord's Tardis door, with the Doctor's famous juke box also pictured. \n\nThe update comes hot on the heels of Prince William 's visit to the Doctor Who set ahead of the Welsh BAFTAs earlier this month\n\nThe 43-year-old royal enjoyed a special, behind-the-scenes tour of the much-loved television show, after being invited to one of Wales' most successful TV and film studios\nThe recent positive Doctor Who news comes after much backlash to its latest series, which was branded 'unoriginal and uninspired' by critics. \nThe first episode, named The Robot Revolution, was directed by Peter Hoar and written by Russell T Davies. \nIt saw Scottish actor Ncuti Gatwa, 32, return as the Doctor, with Varada Sethu as Belinda Chandra, and Millie Gibson as Ruby Sunday.\nUnfortunately critics were quite harsh with their verdicts. \nRadio Times' Louise Griffin said of the episode: 'The episode is dragged down in various ways, most of which we can't talk about just yet.\n'Suffice to say that the episode's climax, involving a rather ludicrous reveal, fails to stick the landing. There's also some very on-the-nose writing, characters stating the obvious rather than allowing the episode's themes to speak for themselves…'\n\nThe recent positive Doctor Who news comes after much backlash to its latest series, which was branded 'unoriginal and uninspired' by critics\nMeanwhile Tom Power at Tech Radar said: 'The Doctor and Bel's robotic foes are largely unoriginal.\n'In fact, I'd say, unique design notwithstanding, they're an uninspired amalgam of two of the most notorious enemies in Doctor Who's rogue gallery – those being, the Daleks and Cybermen.\n'The Robot Revolution also moves at a break-neck pace. \nEpisodes of Doctor Who are renowned for being breezy, but it feels like this one is particularly guilty of barrelling through its story without stopping to take a breath.\n'That doesn't allow its most pertinent story beats to have the emotional impact they require.'\nLuckily there have also been more positive things said about it as well. \n\nAs well as the upcoming Christmas special, fans also have the spin-off series The War Between the Land and the Sea to look forward to\n\nThe five-part series will centre on a war between humanity and an ancient species known as the Sea Devils\n\n Doctor Who viewing figures exterminated over 'woke, boring rubbish' storylines \nVariety's Scott Bryan said: 'The last few seconds of the first episode are particularly spine-tingling.'\nWhile The Times' Ben Dowell wrote: 'It is a fun, fast-paced hour of TV.'\nThe new series was good news after in February it was revealed that the show was reportedly facing the axe. \nA spokesperson for the BBC told The Sun: 'This story is incorrect. \nDoctor Who has not been shelved.\n'As we have previously stated, the decision on season 3 will be made after season 2 airs.\n'The deal with Disney+ was for 26 episodes — and exactly half of those still have to transmit.'\nDoctor WhoBBCDisney Plus\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDisney+ QUITS Doctor Who partnership with BBC as fate of troubled sci-fi series finally revealed\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
