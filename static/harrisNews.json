In a clip from his Dec. 31 show picked up by Mediaite, Rogan and Australian comedian James McCann discussed candidate Donald Trump’s viral October 2024 appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" Rogan noted that Trump sat for the full three-hour interview without breaks and without being given questions in advance, which Rogan said he respected. McCann suggested Trump’s opponent, Harris, would not have been able to do the same. \"He was able to talk for three hours. Whereas Kamala wouldn’t do it,\" McCann said. JOE ROGAN CLAIMS TOP SPOT ON APPLE PODCASTS, DETHRONES NEW YORK TIMES' 'THE DAILY' \"Well, she could have — she could have done it. I’m telling you, man,\" Rogan responded. \"It would’ve been fine.\" McCann pointed to Harris’ August appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" as evidence she would not have performed well in a long-form podcast setting. Rogan pushed back, arguing that televised interviews in front of live audiences are not conducive to meaningful conversations. \"If you’re going to have a really important conversation with someone, you don’t want to do it with a f------ audience,\" Rogan said. \"Also, you only have seven minutes before you have to cut for commercial or whatever it is. JOE ROGAN AND ANDREW SCHULZ MOCK HARRIS' CLAIM OF PEOPLE CALLING HER MOST QUALIFIED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE \"You can’t do that,\" he continued. \"It’ll take me seven minutes to ask what she likes to cook.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to Harris' office for comment. Rogan described the kinds of questions he would have asked Harris had she agreed to appear on his podcast. \"I want to know, is there anything that she regrets doing?\" he said. \"Is it more complicated being a vice president than you thought it was going to be? Like, what is the web of trying to fix things and change things versus the people that are influencing you to make decisions? \"’Cause we’re not pretending that people don’t spend a lot of money to influence your decisions,\" Rogan continued. \"So how much of an effect does it have? TIM WALZ SAYS HARRIS CAMPAIGN MEDIA STRATEGY FELL WAY SHORT \"What would be better? Could we take money out of politics? Would you be willing? What would we do if we completely eliminated corporate funding of any politicians? How would that change everything? \"Those are the kind of questions. … We could have talked for hours about that.\" The podcaster has maintained his team was in discussions with Harris’ campaign about a potential interview but she ultimately backed out. \"They just got scared,\" Rogan said on his show in February 2025. \"They could have put her in. I would have held her hand. We would have had a conversation.\" The Harris campaign has disputed that account, arguing that Rogan’s team made several difficult demands regarding scheduling and interview conditions, according to the book \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Rogan has repeatedly rejected those claims, saying the failed interview was the result of Harris’ team, not his. He has also said that while he would not have voted for Harris, he had no intention of conducting a hostile interview. \"I’m not going to be antagonistic, I’m not going to be a s-------, I’m not gonna be … I have no desire to turn this into a viral clip thing. I’m not trying to do that,\" Rogan said earlier this year. \"I never wanted that done to me, so why would I do that to someone else?\" Trump’s relaxed, long-form appearances on top podcasts like Rogan's are widely believed to have helped propel him to victory in the 2024 election.

Liberals and critics frequently attacked Trump while he was on the campaign trail by calling him a Hitler-esque fascist, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who compared Trump to the German dictator during a town hall in the final stretch of the 2024 election cycle. Musk attended Trump's inaugural parade in 2025, where he spoke to supporters and was accused of giving a Hitler-style salute to the crowds — a narrative that was promoted by Democrats such as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Musk and Republicans lambasted and mocked the accusations when they cropped up, including the tech billionaire floating a potential defamation lawsuit against Walz for promoting the claim. CRITICS SAY MAMDANI’S VOW TO SWAP ‘RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM’ WITH ‘WARMTH OF COLLECTIVISM’ HAS SINISTER UNDERTONE Fast-forward nearly a year, conservatives are questioning why Mamdani has not faced similar accusations after he was seen extending his arm in a gesture similar to Musk's. \"Zohran Mamdani did the same exact gesture today at his swearing in that the left called a ‘Nazi salute’ when @elonmusk did it,\" former liberal and WalkAway — a movement encouraging people to leave the Democratic Party — founder Brandon Straka posted to X. \"They lie,\" Musk posted to X Friday in response to Libs of TikTok's message showing a swath of headlines from earlier in 2025 reporting that the tech billionaire allegedly gave a Nazi salute. \"HOLY CRAP! Zohran Mamdani just did the EXACT SAME gesture as Elon Musk When Elon does it, it's a ‘Nazi salute.’ When communist Zohran does it, the media is silent. The media is the enemy of the people,\" conservative commentator Eric Daugherty posted. \"Did Mamdani do a nazi salute?!?! Literally shaking rn I’m sure CNN and MSNBC will be all over this,\" Libs of TikTok posted in another message mocking Democrats over their January comments targeting Musk. BERNIE SANDERS DITCHES ICONIC MITTENS LOOK WHILE SWEARING IN SOCIALIST ZOHRAN MAMDANI AS NYC MAYOR \"When Elon signals his heart goes out to the crowd he's a ‘NAZI’. When Mamdani does it, its perfectly fine... The left tried to use that signal from Elon to gaslight people into thinking he is a Nazi because they saw it as politically useful.. They are not ideologically consistent and their hypocrisy knows no bounds. They do NOT care about any of that. They just care about political power and feeling virtuous,\" another posted. \"Zohran Mamdani can make this gesture and everyone loves him for it, but when Elon Musk does it? The leftist media wasted no time calling him a Nazi,\" the Media Research Center posted to X. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, took office Thursday, with ceremonies that included a public swearing-in outside City Hall and an earlier private oath at the decommissioned City Hall subway station. Mamdani was seen lifting his hand from his heart to the crowds of supporters at the end of his speech during the public ceremony. \"I was elected as a Democratic socialist, and I will govern as a Democratic socialist,\" he said. FLASHBACK: INSIDE THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT THAT PUT A SOCIALIST IN CHARGE OF NEW YORK CITY \"Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously,\" Mamdani said, acknowledging that his agenda may not always succeed but insisting it would be bold. \"To those who insist that the era of big government is over, hear me when I say this: No longer will City Hall hesitate to use its power to improve New Yorkers’ lives.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's office regarding conservatives' comments over the salute considering previous coverage of Musk, but did not immediately receive a reply. Musk served as the Trump administration's public leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Trump established at the start of his second administration to weed out fraud, government overspending and mismanagement from the federal government. Musk was a common fixture of the administration — serving as a special government employee — until May, when he criticized Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" for raising the debt ceiling, fracturing the relationship. Musk and Trump have since been spotted at public events together, including chatting with one another. MEDIA OUTLETS ACCUSE ELON MUSK OF GIVING 'FASCIST SALUTE' AT TRUMP INAUGURATION RALLY Musk slammed comparisons to Nazis toward the end of his DOGE tenure, pointing to it as another example of the long-running attacks against Trump and his supporters. \"Well, I mean, look, it’s a relentless propaganda campaign, which obviously President Trump has experienced for a very long time, 20 years, maybe longer,\" Musk said on Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump\" in May. \"And politics is a blood sport, so they’re going to come up with whatever attacks they can to destroy the public perception of someone.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Now, obviously, I’ve not harmed anyone in my life, so it’s an outrageous thing to claim that I’m a Nazi,\" he added.","summary":"Media outlets that accused Elon Musk of Nazi-style salute in 2024 remain silent on similar gesture by NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani at his Thursday inauguration, conservatives claim.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservatives-torch-media-after-mamdani-avoids-musk-level-backlash-over-identical-on-stage-gesture","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2026/01/mamdani-elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 21:32:22","author":"Emma Colton","authors":["Emma Colton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.611},{"id":390828434,"title":"Calmes: Trump's motto in 2025? 'Me, myself and I'","text":"The most potent attack ad of Donald Trump's comeback campaign seemingly ran on a loop during the final weeks before the 2024 election. Assailing rights for transgender people, its punch line indeed delivered a punch: \"Kamala Harris is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\n2025: Promise broken. Back in office, the president has shown that the only pronouns he really recognizes are the first-person kind: me, myself and I.\n\nA year into Trump 2.0, those self-regarding pronouns are now firmly affixed as the bywords of his presidency, on matters major and mundane. They might as well be mounted in gold in the Oval Office, in fonts so large as to not get lost amid all the bling he's installed there. Asked in October just who was to be honored by Trump's planned Arc de Triomph-like monument near Arlington Cemetery, the president was quick: \"Me.\"\n\nTo an extent that's shocked even critics long convinced of his sociopathic narcissism, Trump has fashioned a government that's of Trump, by Trump and for Trump. \"I run the country and the world,\" he boasted in April. Trump thinks \"there's nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing,\" his White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair, as reported in twoarticles last month that signaled her own unease with Trump's ongoing vengeance against his political enemies; his clemency for even the most violent rioters of Jan. 6, 2021; the pain of his erratic tariffs, too-cruel migrant roundups and tragic shutdown of USAID's humanitarian aid; his stonewalling of the Jeffrey Epstein files that candidate Trump promised to release; and the foibles of his slavish Cabinet.\n\nIf Trump strutted as the center of the universe in 2025 - unchecked by advisors like Wiles or by a cowed Republican-controlled Congress, the Supreme Court and corporate chieftains - buckle up for 2026. It marks the 250th birthday of America's independence, and our self-appointed master of ceremonies is focused on the festivities that he'll star in not only on July 4th but all year long. One of his first acts as president was to create a White House task force with himself as chair, of course, to plan semiquincentennial events, ignoring an eight-year-old commission created by Congress for that purpose. Coming soon: A (possibly illegal) commemorative $1 coin with Trump's image from the U.S. Mint.\n\nNever mind that 2026 starts with a big spike in health insurance costs for tens of millions of Americans, including many Trump voters. The president who campaigned on bringing down the costs of living has stood in the way of a legislative remedy to the Dec. 31 expiration of healthcare premium subsidies, repeatedly mouthing his years-old promise that he'll propose a cheaper alternative within weeks.\n\nBut here's how 2026 will end: with midterm elections in November that loom as a referendum on whether the Trump Republican Party should keep control of Congress. The early betting is that no, it won't. Especially after another year of Trump grandstanding, and his party's genuflecting.\n\nIn good times, Trump's garish self-regard might be tolerable to voters, even comical. But these aren't good times, hardly the \"golden age\" Trump announced in his inaugural address last January - except for him and the wealthy hangers-on at his seemingly endless round of parties in the White House and at Mar-a-Lago. The Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Trump's Florida resort was especially rich, pun intended, coming as it did hours before federal food aid for 42 million Americans expired amid a government shutdown he'd done nothing to avert.\n\nDays later, voters gave a shellacking to Republicans in various states' 2025 off-year elections, which is a good omen for the same result nationwide in 2026. There are other signs. On Tuesday, a new Gallup poll showed three out of four Americans were dissatisfied with \"the way things are going in the United States.\" Trump's approval rating was just 36% in Gallup's poll in early December, his lowest reading of the past year, and nearly equal to his all-time low after the Jan. 6 insurrection. Averages of various polls show Trump with negative ratings on his handling of immigration, the economy, trade and tariffs, and inflation - all issues that helped get him reelected.\n\nBut go ahead, Mr. President. Keep talking about how great you are. You're a legend in your own time and mind.\n\nTrump's tone-deafness has become the great mystery of U.S. politics, for both parties, especially considering that he slammed President Biden for bragging about the economy's post-pandemic recovery when Americans weren't feeling it.\n\nAs Americans struggle to buy a home or to afford its upkeep, Trump has gilded the People's House (see the New York Times' recent 3-D recreation of the Oval Office for full, nauseating effect) and transformed the bathroom adjoining the Lincoln Bedroom in marble and gold. Having demolished the East Wing to make way for a gargantuan ballroom where Marie Antoinette would be at home, financed by favor-seeking billionaires and corporations, Trump told reporters on Tuesday that it would have to be bigger than he'd first planned because \"we're gonna do the inauguration\" there.\n\nWhat? The man who's supposed to be leaving office on Jan. 20, 2029, is picking the new location for the next presidential inauguration? Hmmm.\n\nEven before he's been in office a year, Trump has put his brand on two Washington buildings, including the nation's 60-year-old cultural center named by law as a memorial to an assassinated president. The Kennedy Center (no, I will not call it by Trump's name) will have marble armrests; Trump took to social media on the day after Christmas to show off samples. Meanwhile, he's refurbishing a royal jet from Qatar, a \"palace in the sky.\"\n\nTrading on his power in unprecedented ways, Trump was a \"crypto billionaire\" by May, the Wall Street Journal reported, and in August the New Yorker estimated that he'd profited in office by at least $3.4 billion through crypto and licensing deals.\n\nNo, Trump is not for you. He's for he/him.\n\nBluesky: @jackiecalmes\n\nThreads: @jkcalmes\n\nX: @jackiekcalmes\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nTribune Regional CA","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/us-viewpoints/article314123872.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/facebook.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 18:04:09","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":390825204,"title":"From Donald Trump to Benjamin Netanyahu, let 2026 be a year of reckoning | Jonathan Freedland","text":"It’s not quite a new year resolution, and it’s certainly not a prediction. Think of it instead as a hope or even a plea for the next 12 months. May the coming year see those leaders who have done so much damage to their own countries, and far beyond, at last be called to account. Let 2026 be a year of reckoning.\n\nStart with the man whose reach is longest, by dint of the mighty power he wields. Such is the nature of the US electoral system that Donald Trump, who returned to power less than a year ago, will face the judgment of voters in 10 months’ time. His name will not be on the ballot but, make no mistake, the midterm elections of 3 November will deliver a verdict on the second Trump presidency.\n\nA slew of congressional defeats for his party would be satisfying in itself, wounding that gargantuan ego of his, but it would also have practical significance. Few predict the Republicans losing control of the Senate, where Democrats would have to flip at least four seats to take charge – near-impossible given the geography of the 35 seats up for grabs in November. But, in normal circumstances, it should be the safest of political bets that the House of Representatives will no longer be in Republican hands a year from now.\n\nSuch a reverse would dispel the aura of indomitability that has enveloped Trump since he beat Kamala Harris, allowing him to bully and intimidate multiple US institutions, including much of its media, into ceding to him far more power than is rightfully his. It would render him a lame duck, incapable of passing new laws through a hostile chamber.\n\nAbove all, it would see Trump confronted at last with a body both eager and able to hold him to account: a Democratic House would have the appetite and the muscle for serious scrutiny. Armed with subpoena power, it could investigate everything from the cost of Trump’s tariffs for US taxpayers to the astonishingly brazen pattern of corruption and pocket-lining that has characterised this administration. And up its sleeve would be the constant threat of a third impeachment trial.\n\nSo November could indeed bring a reckoning for Trump, which is why he will stop at nothing to avert that outcome. Hence the words of caution above: “in normal circumstances”. Trump will make the circumstances abnormal, if that’s what it takes to keep the House. That effort is already under way, whether in the form of gerrymandered maps in Texas or moves to make voting harder in Democratic areas across the country.\n\nThere are heartening signs of institutions beginning to push back – witness last week’s supreme court decision reining in Trump’s deployment of US troops on the streets of Democrat-led cities – but this will be one of the battles of 2026, as the president stretches every sinew to avoid the accountability an autumn defeat would bring.\n\nIn that, he has a soul brother in the man he hosted in Mar-a-Lago this week, in what was their sixth and final meeting of 2025: Benjamin Netanyahu. Except the electoral peril confronting Netanyahu, whose first term as Israel’s prime minister began in 1996, is more direct: at some point between now and October, Israelis will go to the polls in a contest that could remove him from power altogether.\n\nCentral will be the holding of Netanyahu to account. Many around the world will want that to be for the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, for the relentless aerial bombardment that has left the strip in ruins and for the withholding of humanitarian aid. But inside Israel, the accountability that is sought most keenly is for the deadly failures of 7 October 2023, for the complacency and strategic errors that left a string of southern communities, and hundreds of people at a music festival, exposed to murderous Hamas attack.\n\nIsraeli officials at every level, civilian and military, have paid for that catastrophe with their jobs – bar one. Only Netanyahu has never admitted the slightest responsibility, let alone apologised, for the fact that the deadliest day in the country’s history came on his watch. He has refused to establish a commission of inquiry like those that swiftly followed previous calamities, preferring instead a sham investigation staffed by loyalists – equivalent, as the father of one slain hostage put it, to asking the iceberg to find out who sank the Titanic. So the only chance Israelis will have to hold to account the man who has ruled them for 18 of the past 30 years will be at the ballot box.\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher. Plenty of Israeli campaigners fear this election might be the last chance to save key democratic institutions that have been under sustained assault from Netanyahu for so long. Like Trump in the US or Viktor Orbán in Hungary, who also faces voters this year, Netanyahu has been in an escalating war with the judiciary and independent media, squeezing them ever harder, hoping they will choke. And, like his pal in Washington, Netanyahu will stop at nothing to deny his opponents an electoral victory: on trial on corruption charges, he needs to stay in power in order to stay out of jail. Accountability of both the political and legal varieties terrifies him.\n\nAnd he is not the only leader in the region fearful of the anger of his own people. Iranians have tried and tried again to vent their fury at the regime that has ruled their country for 47 years, only to be suppressed, often brutally. Protests have erupted once again in recent days, the authorities resorting to lethal force even more rapidly than in the past – though there are encouraging signs that some in the security forces are reluctant to engage in the usual crackdown. For years, many inside Iran have despaired at a regime bent on becoming a regional power by sponsoring terror and mayhem in the Middle East and beyond, with ordinary Iranians paying the price in sanctions and economic pain. The reckoning for that has been postponed, more than once. But the demand for change is loud and, says the scholar of Iran Ali Ansari, “Sooner or later something will have to give.”\n\nIn the streets or at the ballot box, accountability could be coming in 2026. In Britain, the Labour government has good reason to fear it, bracing for big losses in every direction, whether to Plaid Cymru in Wales, the Scottish National party in Scotland, the Greens especially in London or Reform UK almost everywhere. In a just world, Nigel Farage would fear the voters, anxious that they would hold him to account not only for his squalid past but as the man who served as chief evangelist for the most disastrous national decision since Munich, namely the Brexit referendum, which marks its 10th anniversary in June.\n\nI concede it’s unlikely that 2026 will see Farage pay for his starring role in that ongoing act of collective self-harm. But eventually Trump, Netanyahu, Orbán and the others must face a reckoning for the pain they have caused and the damage they have done.

The president's remarks were initially sparked by Clooney and wife Amal's naturalization as French citizens.\n\n Days after Trump celebrated Clooney's family gaining French citizenship, Entertainment Weekly obtained a statement from the 64-year-old in response to the president's criticism, which included the politician calling it \"Good News\" that George and Amal are now citizens of France.\n\n \"I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again,\" Clooney's statement reads, referencing Trump's signature slogan, before looking ahead to midterm elections. \"We’ll start in November.\"\n\n After news of the Clooney family's French citizenship broke in December, Trump initially called George and Amal \"two of the worst political prognosticators of all time\" in a Dec. 31 Truth Social post, before celebrating the notion that they could, in theory, move to France as citizens.\n\n Trump slammed France for being in the middle of what he called \"a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,\" before comparing it to immigration under President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n \"Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!),\" Trump wrote, before predicting that Democrats would face \"future defeat\" if they aligned behind California Gov.

But it’s not even the first time X’s AI has been under fire for undressing photos","text":"For a moment, when I read the headlines, I thought I was seeing an old post, but no – X’s Grok AI is being called out for undressing any photo…again. The former Twitter’s AI image editor has come under fire for answering requests like “remove her clothes” for a second time.\n\nLast year, X added the ability for users to use an @ tag to ask the AI Grok a question and get a publicly posted response from the chatbot. In May of 2025, an investigative report showed that X’s Grok AI was not only responding to requests like “remove her clothes” but posting the resulting edited images publicly. After the report came out, the autonomous chatbot started responding to similar requests with “I can’t help with that.”\n\nBut, at the end of 2025, X added a tool that allows users to edit any photo using the AI by clicking on the “...” menu and accessing the new “edit image” option. Following the announcement, some artists announced that they would no longer be sharing their artwork on the platform for anyone to be able to just edit with AI.\n\nThe updated feature has sparked a new trend on X of generating or regenerating photos of celebrities in bikinis on the social platform – although the feature isn’t limited to only celebrity faces. Elon Musk himself even joined in by posting a Grok-generated image of himself in a bikini.\n\nA number of users have shared posts illustrating that the chatbot has no qualms with re-imagining a person in the photo in a bikini.\n\nWhile some argue the trend is designed, much like Grok itself, for humor, the Grok bikini trend is also raising concerns over not just AI, but sparking discussions on consent and privacy. A celebrity like Musk posting a bikini image of himself is one thing; X users asking to see someone in a bikini without their permission is something entirely different.\n\nThe AI’s willingness to put anyone in a bikini is not new. Along with the backlash from last May, the AI came under fire shortly after its image-generating capabilities were introduced for generating images of political candidates, including then presidential hopeful Kamala Harris in a bikini.\n\nAlong with continuing to drive artists away from the platform, the latest Grok backlash highlights the dangers of an autonomous, readily accessible AI. Since the AI’s launch, Grok has prided itself on being an AI with more lax restrictions, which were originally designed to give the AI a sense of humor.\n\nYou may also like\n\nBrowse alternative social media platforms for photographers.","summary":"A new X feature and an AI bikini trend is resurfacing a debate on consent in the age of AI","url":"https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/the-internet-is-calling-out-grok-for-nudifying-photos-but-its-not-even-the-first-time-xs-ai-has-been-under-fire-for-undressing-photos","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Feu6teFXPkiRwMTSpSmX6i-2560-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 16:58:42","author":"Hillary K.

Somehow, the call to have a fully fleshed-out news report has been declared upsetting by those who claim to be intrepid journalists.\n\nAdding to the despair was an announcement that came from the new CBS Evening News host, Tony Dokoupil, who laid out the new policy for that program. As he takes over from the failed experiment of the duo of Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson co-hosting, Dokoupil stated their new format will seek a return to more standardized news reporting.\n\nREAD MORE: CBS Evening News Announces Big Change in Approach That's Already Causing the Left to Melt Down\n\nThis has only poured more kerosene on the media conflagration that has been burning since the arrival of Bari Weiss as the new head of CBS News. The news division has been roiled for much of the year over the lawsuit brought by President Trump, and then the settlement being reached as a result of the Skydance merger with parent company Paramount. The Weiss decision to pull a segment from 60 Minutes over editing decisions has seen the mewling in the media getting ramped up to pure hysteria.\n\nThe critics have been loudly declaring this is all a move to appease Trump and is the dumbing down of the news to appease MAGA. The other side of this complaint is a precious approach: Weiss is sullying the good character of the esteemed credibility of CBS News. This is a chortle-inducing comment that leads to asking a direct question:\n\nHave you even watched CBS News or 60 Minutes lately?!\n\nAs a rhetorical response, allow me to say I have, and this is why this current wave of outrage is so hilarious. A rundown of examples of the highly regarded journalism on display is all that is needed to lay bare this fraudulent wailing.\n\nThe Kamala Harris manipulated editing on the Kamala Harris pre-election interview is just the start, but the network reaction was what made things glaringly worse. First, the excuse was that the interview was chopped up due to time constraints. But this was belied by reality. The controversy emerged because CBS first ran promotional snippets of the interview on the Sunday morning talk shows, but when the full segment ran on 60 Minutes, people noticed her response differed from what was shown in the morning, despite having a full broadcast segment at night with vastly more time. \n\nThe other issue was the manner in which the network altered its usual practice of providing transcripts and/or the full video of the interview after broadcast. Yes, a two-hour conversation needs to be cut down for a segment in primetime, but this is why the full disclosure was always made later. CBS News did not provide the transcript and video until February of this year, after being compelled by the FCC investigating the controversy. That was just the start of the issues at that news show.\n\nAdditionally, we saw Leslie Stahl interviewing a released Israeli hostage, and when the issue of his being starved while in captivity, Ms. Stahl defended the Hamas hostiles by suggesting they might not have had enough food for themselves. In a report on the cuts and closing of USAID, they presented it as a constitutional crisis because the agency was created by an act of Congress. The FACT is, it was created by President Kennedy and operated under the authority of the president and the Executive Branch.\n\nAlso on 60 Minutes, they ran a segment that was actually supportive of speech limitation practices in Germany. It sat with members of a group that wants to target what they deem to be offensive speech and then punish it.\n\nIn the United States, most of what anyone says, sends, or streams online — even if it's hate-filled or toxic — is protected by the First Amendment as free speech. But Germany is trying to bring some civility to the world wide web by policing it in a way most Americans could never imagine. In an effort, it says, to protect discourse, German authorities have started prosecuting online trolls. And as we saw, it often begins with a pre-dawn wake-up call from the police. \n\nThe reporter was Sharyn Alfonsi — the same one who last month was claiming that Bari Weiss pulling her segment was tantamount to censorship — who just nodded approvingly as the Germans were promoting censorship and jailing those who employed free speech.\n\nIn another report from that program, the one that is claimed to be the pinnacle of unimpeachable journalism, they lied outright. They interviewed a pair of people who were laid off from USAID, amid the DOGE cuts. This pair gave heart-wrenching explanations of the challenges they are facing due to the layoffs. Then they were exposed as not being USAID employees, but high-paid contract consultants, who were connected to former USAID director Samantha Power.\n\nApart from that program, the CBS News division had other notable issues. Margaret Brennan, one morning on Face the Nation, tried to tell Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Hitler rose to power when he “weaponized free speech.” Scott MacFarlane had a report where he was upset that Mexican drug cartels were labeled as a terrorist faction, after showing the display at the DEA headquarters of the 100,000 fentanyl deaths in this country.\n\nGayle King tried to blame a plane crash on Trump administration policies, and the head of Delta Airlines had to guide her through the disqualifying detail that the crash she cited took place in Canada. On the trans athlete issue, the network covered a female fencer who declined a contest because she would not compete against “an opponent she says is trans”; that same opponent competed the year prior in the men's division, so using the trans label is more than suggestive. In a charming move, ahead of the No Kings protests, the unbiased and non-partisan news division provided links to retailers who were selling anti-Trump merchandise.\n\nThis is an impressively lengthy list of journalistic problems – and they are all contained in the span of the past year. I would like to offer a challenge to all of those who are trying to say Bari Weiss is ruining things and boast that CBS News and 60 Minutes were unimpeachable sources of stellar journalism: \n\nJust how much worse do you think things can get at this network?!\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives. \n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

The former Celebrity Apprentice host was elected president non-consecutively in 2016 and 2024.\nKeep scrolling for a full breakdown of Clooney and Trump’s history, friendship and more:\nForming a Friendship\nWhile speaking with Variety in 2025, Clooney detailed the nature of his bond with Trump.\n“I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball,” the actor said. “Well, he was. That all changed.”\nTrump ran for president as a Republican, while Clooney has publicly shared his liberal beliefs.\n“It’s a very trying time,” Clooney told the outlet. “It can depress you or make you very angry. But you have to find the most positive way through it. You have to put your head down and keep moving forward because quitting isn’t an option.”\nAll About Politics\nClooney and Trump’s political ideologies changed the course of their relationship, with the actor even publishing a 2024 op-ed in The New York Times ahead of the general election. Instead of condemning Trump, Clooney spent the entire essay calling for then-President Joe Biden not to seek reelection. (Biden eventually did drop out, endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris before she lost to Trump.)\n\"I don’t know if it was brave. It was a civic duty,” Clooney later told CNN in June 2025 of publishing the article. “I found that people on my side of the street — I’m a Democrat … in Kentucky, so I get it — when I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that was time.”\nHe added, “The idea of freedom of speech, the specific idea of it is, you can’t demand freedom of speech and then say, ‘But don’t say bad things about me.’ That’s the deal. You have to take a stand. If you believe in it, take a stand, stand for it and deal with the consequences. That’s the rules.”\nLeaving the States\nShortly after speaking with Variety in 2025, news broke that George and wife Amal Clooney were granted French citizenship alongside their two children. Trump, meanwhile, addressed the move days after George’s interview was published.\n“Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France,” Trump wrote via his Truth Social platform in December 2025. “[The country] is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden.”\nTrump, also taking aim at Clooney’s 2024 essay, further claimed that George “got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre movies.”\n“He wasn’t a movie star at all,” Trump claimed. “He was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics.”\nGeorge Responds to the Drama\nGeorge clapped back after Trump’s social media comments.\n“I totally agree with the current president,” he said in a January 2026 statement, per Variety. “We have to make America great again. We’ll start in November.”\nTrump, who popularized the “Make America Great Again” movement amid his presidential campaigns, will not be able to seek a third term per the U.S. constitution.","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/george-clooney-and-donald-trumps-history-explained-through-the-years/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/George-Clooney-and-Donald-Trump-History-Explained.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=62&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 16:28:49","author":"Miranda Siwak","authors":["Miranda Siwak"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.062},{"id":390806378,"title":"George Clooney gets French citizenship — and another dust-up with Trump","text":"One of Hollywood's most recognizable stars is now officially a French citizen.\n\nA French government bulletin published last weekend confirms that the country has granted citizenship to George Clooney, along with his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their 7-year-old twins.\n\nThe Clooneys — who hail from Lexington, Ky. and Beirut, Lebanon, respectively — bought an 18th-century estate in Provence, France in 2021. In an Esquire interview this October, the Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker described the French \"farm\" as their primary residence, a decision he said was made with their kids in mind.\n\n\"I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood,\" Clooney said. \"I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life. France — they kind of don't give a s*** about fame. I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.\"\n\nIn another interview on his recent Jay Kelly press tour, Clooney mentioned that his wife and kids speak perfect French, joking that they use it to insult him to his face while he still struggles to learn the language.\n\nThis week, after a French official raised questions of fairness, France's Foreign Ministry explained that the Clooneys were eligible under a law that permits citizenship for foreign nationals who contribute to the country's international influence and cultural outreach, The Associated Press reports.\n\nThe French government specifically cited the actor's clout as a global movie star and the lawyer's work with academic institutions and international organizations in France.\n\n\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry added, per the AP. \"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones celebrating. President Trump, who has a history of trading barbs with Clooney, welcomed the news by taking another dig at the actor.\n\nIn a New Year's Eve Truth Social post, Trump called the couple \"two of the worst political prognosticators of all time\" and slammed Clooney for throwing his support behind then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election.\n\n\"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,\" wrote Trump, who himself has made cameos in several films over the years. \"He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nClooney responded the next day via a statement shared with outlets including Deadline and Variety.\n\n\"I totally agree with the current president,\" Clooney said, before referencing the midterm elections later this year. \"We have to make America great again. We'll start in November.\"\n\nClooney and Trump — once friendly — have long criticized each other\n\nClooney, a longtime activist and Democratic Party donor, has remained active in U.S. politics despite his overseas move.\n\nIn July 2024, he rocked the political establishment by publishing a New York Times op-ed urging then-President Joe Biden — for whom he had prominently fundraised just weeks prior — to drop his reelection bid to make way for another Democrat with better chances of taking the White House. A growing chorus of calls led to Biden's withdrawal from the race by the end of that month.\n\nIn a December interview with NPR's Fresh Air, Clooney said his decision to speak out on that and other issues generally comes down to \"when I feel like no one else is gonna do it.\"\n\n\"You'll lose all of your clout if you fight every fight,\" he added. \"You have to pick the ones that you know well, that you're well informed on, and that you have some say and you hope that that has at least some effect.\"\n\nClooney has been a vocal critic of Trump throughout both of his terms, most recently on the topic of press freedoms during the actor's Broadway portrayal of the late journalist Edward R. Murrow last spring.\n\nAnd Trump has been similarly outspoken in his dislike of Clooney, including in an insult-laden Truth Social post — calling him a \"fake movie actor\" — after the publication of his New York Times op-ed.\n\nIn December, just days before this latest dust-up, Clooney shared in a Variety interview that he and Trump had been on good terms during the president's reality television days. He said Trump used to call him often and once tried to help him get into a hospital to see a back surgeon.\n\n\"He's a big goofball. Well, he was,\" Clooney added. \"That all changed.\"\n\nIn the same Variety interview, Clooney — the son of longtime television anchor Nick Clooney — slammed CBS and ABC for abandoning their journalistic duty by paying to settle lawsuits with the Trump administration. He expressed concern about the current media landscape, particularly the direction of CBS News under its controversial new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.\n\nWeiss responded by inviting Clooney to visit the CBS Broadcast Center to learn more about their work, in a written statement published in the New York Post on Tuesday. It began with \"Bonjour, Mr. Clooney,\" in a nod to the actor's new milestone.\n\nClooney told NPR last month that he will continue to stand up for what he believes in, even if it means people who disagree with him decide not to see his movies.\n\n\"I don't give up my right to freedom of speech because I have a Screen Actors Guild card,\" he added. \"The minute that I'm asked to just straight-up lie, then I've lost.\"","summary":"The French government says it granted George and Amal Clooney citizenship because of their contributions to its international influence.

In a New Year's Eve post on Truth Social, Trump framed the development as a political failure for both the actor and France.'Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,' Trump wrote.The president went further by attacking Clooney's career and political activity. 'Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,' Trump added, dismissing his standing in Hollywood.Trump also revived criticism of Clooney's 2024 political interventions, referencing his calls for then-President Joe Biden to step aside and his later support for Kamala Harris.Clooney Claps BackClooney responded the following day with a brief but pointed statement that directly echoed Trump's most recognisable slogan. Rather than addressing each accusation, the actor reframed the remark in electoral terms.'I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again. We'll start in November,' said Clooney.The wording drew immediate attention because of its timing and simplicity. By repeating Trump's phrase, Clooney signalled disagreement without engaging in a prolonged public exchange, while also emphasising the upcoming midterm elections.What George Clooney MeantClooney's reference to November was widely understood as a nod to the US midterm elections, when Democrats are seeking to retake control of the House and potentially the Senate. Clooney has been an active Democratic supporter and fundraiser for years, and his statement aligned with that history.The actor has also explained that family considerations rather than politics drove his move to France. He has previously cited stronger French privacy laws as a key reason for raising his children there, saying they offer greater protection from intrusive media coverage than in the US.Beyond elections, Clooney has repeatedly linked political leadership to the health of democratic institutions, particularly the press, which he has described as essential to public understanding and accountability.Trump–Clooney Feud ExplainedThe tension between Trump and Clooney did not begin with citizenship. Clooney has said he once knew Trump socially, describing a relationship that later broke down as Trump entered politics.That shift coincided with Clooney becoming more vocal in his criticism of Trump's presidency and legal actions involving major US media organisations.Clooney has argued that settlements reached by broadcasters weakened journalistic independence and has framed those decisions as harmful to democracy.Trump's latest remarks, combining personal criticism with political attack, reignited the feud at a moment when both men are again speaking to voters ahead of a crucial election cycle.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/george-clooney-slams-trump-says-making-america-great-again-will-start-november-if-democrats-1767728","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1779869/george-clooney-slams-trump-says-making-america-great-again-will.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=16bab1c08f90bafc23a760231e2c77b8","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 15:13:19","author":"Giuliano de Leon","authors":["Giuliano de Leon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.278},{"id":390823994,"title":"Trump's Motto in 2025?

Republicans took the race seriously for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the broader context in the state Capitol: A victory would give the GOP a supermajority in the state legislative chamber.\n\nThat didn’t happen. The Washington Post reported:\n\nA Democrat won a special election for an Iowa state Senate seat Tuesday, denying Republicans the opportunity to regain a supermajority in the chamber and handing the Democratic Party a large-margin victory ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nRenee Hardman, a member of the West Des Moines City Council, received 71.4 percent of the vote in the special-election race for state Senate District 16, according to unofficial results from the Iowa secretary of state. Republican candidate Lucas Loftin received 28.5 percent of the vote in the race, which encompasses a suburban Des Moines jurisdiction.\n\nThat lopsided, 43-point margin of victory was especially notable: The local district is considered an area that favors Democrats, but a year earlier, Kamala Harris’ 2024 ticket won here by 17 points.\n\nIn other words, Hardman, the first Black woman ever elected to the Iowa Senate, didn’t just win, and didn’t just deny Republicans the supermajority it was seeking, she also overperformed to a significant degree.\n\nShe has a lot of company. In elections throughout 2025, Democrats overperformed in ways that should make Republicans quite nervous ahead of the 2026 midterm election cycle.\n\nAround this time a year ago, as Donald Trump prepared to reenter the White House, the conventional wisdom was that Republicans had entered an era of electoral dominance. Trump had successfully realigned the American electorate to put the GOP in a position to control the nation and its future.\n\nThe same commentary held that the Democratic Party wasn’t just defeated, it was also small and divided, with a demoralized and disheartened base, filled with voters who were prepared to withdraw from civic life for a long while.\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, there was a near-obsessive focus on Democrats and their “brand.” Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado told NBC News in March that his party’s brand was “problematic.” Around the same time, California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Democratic brand was “toxic.” Days earlier, Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania told Politico, “If we don’t get our s––– together, then we are going to be in a permanent minority.”\n\nAs it turns out, there’s been a lot less talk along these lines lately.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-the-democratic-victory-in-the-final-special-election-of-2025-matters","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767363071/260102-renee-hardman-zz_11336450fef1_1133645c9c81/260102-renee-hardman-zz_11336450fef1_1133645c9c81.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 14:40:41","author":"Steve Benen","authors":["Steve Benen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":390789212,"title":"‘Sissy football is bad for America!’: The A to Z of Donald Trump’s sporting year","text":"A – Alienating-the-Base: “We have to come up with another name for the NFL stuff. It really doesn’t make sense, when you think about it, it isn’t really football.” If Maga knew that Donald Trump was up for calling ‘soccer’ ‘football’, and renaming “the NFL stuff”, they’d have voted for Mao Zedong last year.\n\nB – Bad Blood: Has Trump forgiven Taylor Swift for endorsing Kamala Harris? Has he heck. How sad was he to hear her booed at the Super Bowl in February? Not a lot. “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift! She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”\n\nC – Cristiano: The Ronaldo man was invited to the White House this year, and oh to have been a fly on those Oval Office walls. “That’s my main objective: to meet Donald Trump and talk about world peace,” he had said. “If I get the chance to sit down with him, I’ll tell him what we have in common.” There might have been tension in the air, though. Who’s the most famous? “Me or Donald Trump? I think worldwide, even in small islands, they know me more than him. In the world, no one is more famous than me.”\n\nD – Doubters: When Trump claimed he had won “36 Club Championships!” in golf, Rick Reilly, author of Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, was a touch sceptical. “Number of ‘championships’ he said he had last time: 24. Number he says he suddenly has now: 36. Number that his twisted ego just skipped: 11. Number of actual “championships” he’s won: 0. #CommanderInCheat.”\n\nE – Everybody Needs Good Neighbours: After his imposition of hefty tariffs, Trump dismissed any notion that co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico would make things awkward. “Tension is a good thing, it makes it much more exciting!” (Come November: “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? Okay with me.”) \n\nF – Fit for Office: The best line from the, um, independent medical report on the status of Trump’s health? “President Trump’s days include participation in multiple meetings, public appearances, press availability, and frequent victories in golf events.”\n\nG – Gushiest: Many a tribute was paid to Trump during the year (most of them by himself), but none quite topped the one offered by Bryson DeChambeau after his visit to the White House. “In my era, Tiger is the ultimate competitor and somebody that is rarely unfazed. You could just tell there was a different presence – much like yourself, Mr President. You walk into an area and it’s just different. And he just had that aura about him.”\n\nH – Healthy Arms: “You faced down adversity, you entered the playoffs battered and bruised, but not broken. When you ran out the healthy arms, you ran out of really healthy ... they had great arms, but they ran out. It’s called sports. It’s called baseball in particular and pitchers I guess you could say, really particular…” To this day, World Series winners the LA Dodgers are none the wiser about the tribute Trump paid to them during their White House visit. \n\nI – Informed: “I remember watching Pelé on a team called the Cosmos. I assume he is one of the greats?”\n\nJ – Juve: The Juventus squad visited the White House on the eve of the Club World Cup, and left looking befuddled. “I was caught by surprise, honestly,” said US international Timothy Weah. “It was a bit weird. When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it’s kind of like, I just want to play football man.” Manuel Locatelli was left even more discombobulated after Trump pointed at him and said: “Some of these guys behind me ... if they come legally, we want them. They have to say they love America, they love our country. And if they can’t say that, we don’t want them.”\n\nK – Kicking Off: How did he feel about the NFL’s new ‘woke’ ‘dynamic kick-off’? “Ridiculous. How can they make such a big and sweeping change so easily and quickly. It’s at least as dangerous as the ‘normal’ kick-off, and looks like hell. It’s the exact opposite of what football is all about. Sissy football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!”\n\nL – LA: “The governors are going to have to behave! If we think there’s going to be any sign of any trouble, I would ask Johnny to move it to a different city.” At which point Gianni ‘Johnny’ Infantino gulped, Trump threatening to take away World Cup hosting rights from cities run by Democrats, most notably Los Angeles. From my ‘cold dead hands’ was the gist of California governor Gavin Newsom’s response.\n\nM – Master: “I have to congratulate Rory,” said Trump after McIlroy’s triumph in Augusta. “That took tremendous courage. People have no idea how tough that is, that hundredth of an inch makes a difference between a great shot and a horrible shot.” (Unless you have an assistant who’ll move your ball a several hundredths of an inch. Allegedly.)\n\nN – Notorious: On being asked who was his favourite Irish person: “I do happen to like your fighter. He’s got the best tattoos I’ve ever seen. Conor’s great, right?” Taoiseach Micheál Martin, sitting alongside Trump in the White House, turned a whiter shade of pale. \n\nO – Omnipresent: No one was more confused than Cole Palmer when Trump remained on the podium after the presentation to Chelsea of the Club World Cup, and ended up swallowed by a sea of celebrating footballers. “I was a bit confused, yes. He said his son is my biggest fan. I can’t remember what I said. I think it was ‘thank you’ or something.”\n\nP – Peace Prize: People were generally quite rude about Trump being awarded Fifa’s inaugural “Fisher-Price” (credit: random Twitterer) peace prize. Jon Stewart? “An entirely fictitious golden butt plug.”\n\nQ – Queues: His attendance at the US Open men’s tennis final created the mother of all mayhem, the added security measures causing the match to be delayed for 45 minutes – and even then, there were still lines of spectators waiting to get in. Did that prompt them to boo him when he appeared on the big screen? Or was that “fake news”, as the White House’s ‘Rapid Response’ Twitter account claimed? The “losers’ pea-sized brains have been irreversibly destroyed by TDS [‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’],” they said. A mixture of boos and cheers? You decide. \n\nR – Rounds (and Rounds): The busiest folk of the year? Perhaps those who run didtrumpgolftoday.com. Last we checked, they estimated he’d golfed 79 days out of his first 338 days since returning to office (23.4 per cent of his presidency) at an estimated cost – security, transport, etc – of $110,600,000 to the taxpayer.\n\nS – Size Matters: Trump was, as we know, chuffed to receive the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize, but according to the London Times, it didn’t prevent the White House issuing several demands before he received it. Chief among them was that his trophy be at least the size of the World Cup, ie 14½ inches tall and made of 18‑carat gold. \n\nT – Trans Debate: “Could a woman make your team, fellas,” he asked the Juventus men’s squad. Their faces read: “Eh ...” \n\nU – UFC: Yes, the White House will become a venue for the ‘sport’ in 2026. “On the grounds of the White House! We have a lot of land there! We are going to have a UFC fight, championship fight, full fight, like 20-25,000 people!” This is what Abraham Lincoln died for.\n\nV – Vlad: It was a case of ‘To Russia With Love’ when Trump was joined by Gianni ‘Johnny’ Infantino in the Oval Office for an announcement about the World Cup draw. “I thought you’d all like to see it,” said Trump, producing a photo of himself and Vladimir Putin. “I thought it was a nice picture of him. Nice of him. That was very nice, that it was sent to me.” He may be coming [to the World Cup], and he may not,” he added, perhaps unaware that Russia had been banned from the tournament.\n\nW – Wordsmith: Had Trump ever seen a sporting team draw level in a contest? When speaking about the ‘regulating’ of drug prices, he said: “So basically what we are doing is equalising. It’s a new word that I came up with, which I think is probably the best word. We’re gonna equalise!”\n\nX – X-rated: The gist of the response from an unnamed Washington Commanders source when it was reported that Trump had asked that their new $3.7 billion stadium be named after him.\n\nY – YMCA: In honour of Trump, who attended the Washington Commanders v Detroit Lions NFL game in November, Lions receiver Amon-Ra St Brown celebrated a touchdown by doing that YMCA jiggle. How impressed was the Commanders’ Daron Payne? He punched St Brown, got sent off and picked up a suspension. Not much, then. \n\nZ – Zzzzz: There were, indeed, times at the US Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner that it appeared like Trump was nodding off, tennis possibly not being his thing. And he didn’t seem overly enthused by Alcaraz’s triumph. (Martina Navratilova: “Never saw Trump clap. Not once. He is so jealous!!! And when the whole place erupted, clapping for Bruce Springsteen while playing Born in the USA it was magical!!!”)","summary":"2025 was another year filled with perplexing, not-so-sporting remarks from the US president","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/2026/01/03/the-a-to-z-of-the-sporting-year-according-to-donald-trump/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/2UNHCFBXNRHBXJCMLZIRUQPIPY.jpg?auth=2d9de5cb4a4ce93f510d9e18c57b7c7175c2323a7fc6a008ff71cc703840bc93&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 13:00:26","author":"Mary Hannigan","authors":["Mary Hannigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":390768676,"title":"A year of hate from the far left and right is a wake-up call for US Jews","text":"America is a place and a people. America is an ideal and a dream. This was the year when the lines between the party of reality and the party of fantasy sharpened for all Americans. As usual, those lines cut across the lines of political allegiance. As usual, the Jews were in the thick of it. In physical reality, Israel won its multi-front war against the Iranian-led alliance. In the compensatory dreamland of the digital world, the war against the Zionists goes on. Incitement and attacks against American Jews went through the roof after October 7. In 2025, they rose further. The murder in May of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC by a gunman who shouted “Free Palestine” was the tip of an increasingly visible iceberg. In June, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) claimed that 55 per cent of Jewish Americans reported “experiencing some form of antisemitism in the last year.” Nearly one in five (18 per cent) said they had been physically threatened or verbally harassed. A third (36 per cent) witnessed “actual or threatened antisemitic violence”. One in five said that they had removed “distinctively Jewish” items since October 7. But 84 per cent of those affected by antisemitism said they were making “some positive change” because of it. Jewish schools, shuls and community centres now have armed guards and concrete “diversity barriers”. But by March, nearly a third (31 per cent) said their engagement with Jewish life had deepened year-on-year – and that was after the 43 per cent increase in the year after October 7. Jewish Federations call it “the Surge”. October 7 and the war against the Jews on America’s streets, campuses and social media have worked like spiritual and political Ozempic. It’s early days, but if the age of Jewish American safety and comfort is over, then so is the age of zombie liberalism and multicultural flab. The ADL are among the slobs who are finally waking up to what is happening – and how the major Jewish organisations sleepwalked their people into a nightmare. In December, a dozen former ADL officials told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency how their worldview and communal strategy collapsed. “We stood up for the LGBTQ community, for the African American community, for immigrants, and it was a real core part of our mission,” said Joe Berman, who had been one of the ADL’s top litigators. “We would often do it in coalition with other civil rights groups, and that’s all gone. That respect that we had is just completely gone.” As my friend Seth Mandel, one of the heroes of the digital war for truth, wrote in Commentary, these officials “appear to be frozen in time on October 6, 2023”. American Jewish leaders thought they could Tikkun Olam their way to a top spot in the priorities of the Democratic Party. The ADL in particular pushed talking points on partisan issues such as abortion, immigration and DEI. They pushed to impose a Palestinian state on Israel too, and called Donald Trump a white supremacist. They pushed their own people into the firing line. They wasted time, money and credibility on backing activists who would, Mandel writes, “like to see us pushed into the sea”. We will be “forced to win this battle with a greatly reduced roster of allies”. The good news is, the Jews who get it aren’t going to give up, and the non-Jews who get it are with us all the way. Expect 2026 to be a year of strengthening alliances with old friends and building links with new friends. That will require a new set of Jewish institutions, and a new understanding of Jewish politics. The old argument that Israel is a liberal democracy with Gay Pride marches and Holocaust survivors is losing its purchase. Not because it’s not true, but because it’s not smart. The generation that remembers the Second World War and the Shoah is almost gone: Norman Podhoretz, one of its greatest writers, died in the last weeks of the year. Americans are tired of the world. As Trump’s tariffs show, Americans want a better deal from their friends. In 2026, Israel’s supporters will need to argue the realist case. Israel is a hub of hi-tech and military ingenuity amid a region of amateur jihadists and tribal kleptocrats. Its strength is the cornerstone of America’s new Middle East. It has proved that it can fight its corner. It is America’s most reliable, competent and powerful ally – more than Britain. *** The year began with the return to office of Donald Trump. In the future, historians will be baffled how, at a time when they faced a multifaceted and violent campaign to drive them from public life, only about 30 per cent of Jewish Americans voted for the candidate whose record included extending the Civil Rights Act to cover Jews and recognising Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights and in Jerusalem. Instead of the most pro-Israel president in American history, American Jews voted 70-30 for Kamala Harris, who had defended the Biden administration’s slow-walking of arms to Israel as it fought for its survival and encouraged the Black Lives Matter movement, which was explicitly hostile to Jews. For a clever people, we have a lot of fools. The good news? More and more Jewish Americans now understand that this is a luxury they can no longer afford. If you want to know how things would now stand with President Harris in the White House, see what she said this year. She boasted that she was “the first” high-level official to “talk about the fact that people in Gaza were starving” – without mentioning that Hamas was controlling the flow of aid, and without querying the famine myth. In October, Harris told MSNBC that Israel had killed so many children and innocent civilians in Gaza that it was time to “step back and be honest” about the allegation of “genocide”. Another lie. By December, even Hamas’s health ministry had admitted that adult men of military age comprised somewhere between 52 per cent and 75 per cent of the deaths in the Gaza war. The Biden administration had forced Israel to fight a slow and limited war. Biden and his carers cut off some arms supplies, threatened consequences if Israel crushed Hamas in Gaza, and let two-faced Qatar set the pace of hostage negotiations. The second Trump administration changed all this within days of taking office. It opened the arms spigot to Israel, ran diplomatic cover, allowed Israel to win the war in Gaza and – crucially – worked closely with Israel to strike the head of the snake. Israel’s successful Gaza campaign and Donald Trump’s levelling of Iran’s nuclear programme with American air power created the opening for the exit from the Gaza war in October. The terms bind all of America’s regional clients into a new, American-led order in the heart of the global energy market. What happened next was astonishing. In November 2024, Trump had given the Republicans the trifecta (the House, the Senate and the White House), as well as the popular vote. The Iran strike and the Gaza deal restored America as the arbiter of western Asia and the energy business. But in November 2025, the party fell into civil war. A minority of pols, think-tankers and pundits – some isolationist, some pro-Iran and pro-Qatar, some just plain anti-Jewish – launched the opening round of the struggle for the post-Trump Republican Party and the 2028 nomination. This loud but small faction attacked Israel’s role in American foreign policy as a way of displacing Jews from American life, and attacked individual American Jews, especially conservatives and Republicans, as a way of splitting the America-Israel alliance. Their leaders were Tucker Carlson who, after being fired from Fox News in 2023, had reinvented himself as a “just asking questions” podcaster in his Maine woodshed; and Nicholas Fuentes, a grubby racist whose digital stand-up routines had attracted an audience of resentful white youths who called themselves Groypers. Carlson, Fuentes and their hangers-on were backed by a surge of online racism. In December, the Network Contagion Institute reported that the engagement numbers were confected by foreign bots. Much of the genuine audience was also foreign, in the kind of countries where morbid Jew-hatred never went away. Still, it was real enough to blow up the biggest think-tank in DC, the Heritage Foundation, as its trustees resigned over its continued support for Carlson. And because he is tight with Vice President JD Vance, it may yet blow up Vance too. Trump dismissed Carlson as “kooky”. But Vance stuck with Carlson and told Republicans to stop the “infighting”. A lot of Americans think that fighting racists is a good thing. A lot also think that open borders, imperial wars and decadent liberalism have driven the country to the lip of chaos and bankruptcy – and that liberal Jewish organisations and media voices backed that march of folly. In 2026, we shall see how this shakes out. I believe that Americans are on the whole good people who like Jews and hate the enemies of America. Meanwhile, Jewish Americans face a wave of pitchfork paranoia and thuggery reminiscent of the Middle Ages, had America been around then. *** America is undergoing a wave of domestic terrorism. Some of it is the fallout from the Great Awokening, as leftist groups spiral over the edge from performative alienation to genuine terrorism. Some of it is from the Islamists who used the Great Awokening to advance their idea of identity politics. On the first night of Chanukah, gunmen shot up a house in Los Angeles while shouting “Free Palestine”. On the second night, two men attacked Orthodox Jews on a subway train while bystanders did nothing. At dusk before the third night, an Orthodox man was stabbed in the street in Brooklyn. New York City police reported a surge in anti-Jewish attacks after the Bondi Beach massacre. It’s called “network contagion”. No one has any idea how to stop it, apart from massive censorship. That is a bad idea, and impossible in the land blessed with the First Amendment. In 2025, America continued to undergo a wave of speech liberalisation after the ideological favouritism and digital censorship of the Obama and Biden years. The blessing and the curse after Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, now X, is that Jewish Americans have a chance to make their realist case. But the racists and fantasists have the numbers, while X profits from their anti-American lies and incitement. We also have Bari Weiss. And Bari now has an eight-man security detail that costs $10,000 a day, and travels in a military-style convoy of SUVs. Why? Because she defends the Jews. Her takeover of CBS News shows that the revival of the centre ground is beginning, and that pro-Israel Jews can make it happen. It will get worse for American Jews before it gets better. But I believe, as Americans of all stripes believe, that it will get better. Americans are stronger than they realise. The American system is more adaptive than we think. Jewish Americans are stronger and more adaptive than they knew. The diaspora’s biggest and richest community is only now starting to flex its financial, political and spiritual muscles. In 2026, we will start to see the results.","url":"https://www.thejc.com/opinion/a-year-of-hate-from-the-far-left-and-right-is-a-wake-up-call-for-us-jews-whje3vss","image":"https://api.thejc.atexcloud.io/image-service/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1o6m0l5659udgryvk01/0/copy-of-gettyimages-2216591799-jpg.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 12:24:11","author":"Dominic Green","authors":["Dominic Green"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":390767550,"title":"George Clooney fires back after Trump slams his French citizenship","text":"George Clooney and Amal Clooney are now French citizens (Picture: Taylor Hill/Getty Images)\n\nGeorge Clooney has fired back at Donald Trump after the President of the United States criticised him for getting French citizenship.\n\nThe 64-year-old Hollywood star and his wife Amal, 47, have become French citizens as they join the growing list of A-listers ditching the US.\n\nAFP revealed that soon after Christmas, the couple – who have been married since 2014 and in 2021 purchased a stunning provade abode in Provence, France – and their eight-year-old twins, Alexander and Ella, made it official.\n\nAfter the news, Trump took to his Truth Social page on New Year’s Eve and ranted: ‘Good News!

These included immigration, crime, government promotion of transgender athletes (“We had men playing in women’s sports”), blowing up drug boats (“Drugs brought in by ocean and by sea are now down 94%”), education (“We have broken the grip of sinister woke radicals in our schools”), and his foreign policy moves (“bringing for the first time in 3,000 years, peace to the Middle East”), but it’s telling that he began with inflation and dwelled on it at length.\n\nThe overall message that Trump emphasized was dramatic, rapid improvements under his second administration, with more to come. For instance, “We inherited the worst border anywhere in the world,” he said, “and we quickly turned it into the strongest border in the history of our country. In other words, in a few short months, we went from worst to best.”\n\nHis administration is “bringing our economy back from the brink of ruin,” Trump bragged. “Under the Biden administration, car prices rose 22%, and in many states 30% or more; gasoline rose 30% to 50%; hotel rates rose 37%; airfares rose 31%.”\n\n“Democrat politicians also sent the cost of groceries soaring,” he said, “but we are solving that too.”\n\nDomestic doom spiral\n\nBill Clinton’s political adviser James Carville summed up the key issue of the 1992 presidential campaign in one pithy soundbite: “It’s the economy, stupid.” Specifically, it was the jobs, stupid. After a recession from 1990 into 1991, there simply weren’t enough of them to go around, with an unemployment rate north of 7%.\n\nPeople wouldn’t stop talking about it, which magnified economic anxieties. The Bureau of Labor Statistics called this the “jobs-confidence loop” in a report. That doom spiral, more than anything else, is what made George H.W. Bush a one-term president.\n\nRepublicans took it on the chin in the 2025 elections and are looking awful for the 2026 midterm elections on the generic ballot. Why? Many explanations have been offered for this dismal result, following the previous year’s GOP sweep of the House, Senate, and White House.\n\nUltimately, it’s likely that Carville was right in a way that is still relevant today. Which is to say that it’s still the economy, stupid, but with a twist. This time, the issue is the prices, stupid.\n\nRipping up dollar bills\n\nThe song “Suffer,” by alt-country singer Boy Golden, begins with a common enough economic impression of the last several years. “Prices go up and they don’t come down / Cost 40 bucks just to hang around / I know people sleeping on the ground,” the protagonist sings, before coming to his chorus of protest:\n\n“I wanna know where my money wentI want a new f***ing presidentI wanna believe that God is benevolentI wanna know where my money went”\n\nPrices ballooned under former President Joe Biden. It happened because of moves that the Federal Reserve, the government-owned and -operated central bank of the United States, felt compelled to make. The Fed had to deal with the economic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. It also had to finance a binge of pandemic-era and postpandemic spending that Biden himself had sought.\n\nBiden was warned against this last round of COVID-19 spending, which took place as the lockdowns were being lifted, vaccines were being administered, and people were returning to work. “We’re taking very substantial risks on the inflation side,” former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said in 2021, the year Biden’s so-called American Rescue Plan was passed by Democrats in a party-line vote. “Pouring roughly half a trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless,” Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers when Biden was vice president, said in response to the administration’s student loan forgiveness plans the following year. Both economists are Democrats, yet their counsel against inflationary policies went unheeded.\n\nThe result was brutal economically. We’ll get to the numbers, but first, dear reader, please take out a $1 bill and some Scotch tape. Eyeball about one-fifth of that bill, lengthwise, then tear that section off, crosswise.\n\nNext, imagine that happening to every single dollar in your wallet, purse, or bank account. Then realize that you are not imagining things. It took $100 in 2024 to buy what $82.55 could buy in 2020, according to an inflation calculator provided by Alioth Finance.\n\nFinally, use the tape to repair your $1 bill, because people need a lot more of those to pay for things these days.\n\nWhat the Fed wrought\n\nDuring the Obama years and Trump’s first term, monetary inflation had poked along, usually in the 1%-2% range. The value of the dollar fell as the Fed gradually increased the supply of dollars, but only slightly and slowly. In 2020, the year Biden was elected, inflation was 1.2%.\n\nThen it skyrocketed, to 4.7% in 2021 and 8% in 2022. Even in 2023, when there was a significant reduction, inflation was still 4.1%. This effectively erased many of the salary gains workers had made over several years by making everything cost more, in a hurry.\n\nDuring this period, the Fed practiced what it calls “quantitative easing,” which is one of those terms that has the general effect of making most people’s eyes glaze over. Starting in March 2020 and ending roughly two years later, this round of sustained economic activity injected trillions of dollars into the economy, initially to cushion the economic shocks caused by pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nIn short, the Fed created a great deal of money with which to buy securities. The Fed’s balance sheet, its list of owned financial assets that it bought by simply creating, or “printing,” more money, ballooned during this time.\n\n“By the time [quantitative easing] ended in spring 2022, the size of the Fed’s balance sheet had more than doubled – from $4.2 trillion in assets to $8.8 trillion,” explains the website of financial technology firm American Deposit Management. “To put these numbers into perspective, the Treasury held assets equating to 36% of GDP at this time.”\n\nPoliticians, mostly of the Democratic variety, called for investigations into this or that industry during Biden’s tenure in office. The oil industry was allegedly too greedy, or the snack industry was too sneaky, and was cheating people by charging the same for less. It all amounted to a failed attempt to change the subject.\n\nPrices are constantly rising and falling in a free market. This fluctuation happens because prices send economic signals back and forth from consumer to producer, dialing demand and supply up and down. When prices are rising across the board, however, the real culprit is the money supply. Under our system of fiat currency, the cause of that is the government itself.\n\nThe Fed increased the number of dollars available at a rate that was all out of whack with economic growth. That imbalance significantly altered the exchange rate between money and things that money can buy. With so many more dollars in the system chasing roughly the same number of goods and services, all of the individual dollars ended up being worth considerably less.\n\nThe public was, quite understandably, upset about this swift reduction in its purchasing power. The steep rise in prices started a price-confidence loop, and that made Biden a very unpopular president.\n\nGranted, it might have been his disastrous, senior-moment-prone debate performance in late June 2024 that finished Biden off. Yet inflation is what put him on the ropes in the first place.\n\nThe politics of prices\n\nIt was Biden’s vice president, not the diminished man himself, who failed to stop Trump’s big White House comeback. From the voters’ perspective, Kamala Harris amounted to the same thing economically, and she did little to alter that impression.\n\nIn effect, people turned an administration out of office that seemed hellbent on pursuing its own agenda with indifference to the effects that this agenda was having on prices. Some critics charge that we are getting more of the same thing from the Trump administration, with its tireless pursuit of tariffs and with Trump’s own seemingly personal vendetta against current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nIn his pre-Christmas speech, Trump made the case that his administration cares deeply about prices.\n\n“The price of a Thanksgiving turkey was down 33% compared to the Biden last year,” he said. “The price of eggs is down 82% since March, and everything else is falling rapidly, and it’s not done yet. But boy, are we making progress.” In addition, he would be “standing up to the special interest to dramatically reduce the price of prescription drugs.”\n\nYet voters’ general impressions thus far are that the economy under Trump is not so great. Prices play an outsize role in that judgment. A December 2025 Navigator Research poll of 1,000 voters, for instance, found that Trump’s ratings are “especially poor on inflation,” with 61% of voters disapproving of Trump’s performance on inflation and the cost of living, versus only 35% who approve. Four percent were undecided.\n\nThe out party has more negative impressions of the economy when its opposite number is in office, so you would expect a more dour assessment from Democrats. Yet the Navigator poll also found some softness in the Trump coalition that could hurt in the midterm elections.\n\n“Nearly one in six Trump voters regret their 2024 vote choice, citing Trump’s broken promises – especially on the economy,” the polling firm reported.\n\nStuck in a loop?\n\nA price-confidence loop arose during the Biden administration. Prices went up, and people talked about it a lot, even when inflation had finally slowed down. For 2024, the year that Trump beat Harris, inflation clocked in at 2.9%.\n\nThat was a little high by recent historical trends, but not disastrously so. If that had been the average rate of inflation throughout the Biden administration, there’s a decent chance he would still be president today. That figure, 2.9%, is perhaps only slightly higher than where economists expect the needle to land on total inflation measured over 2025.\n\nThe Trump administration has done some things to bring prices down, especially on the regulation front. But Trump has also pressured the Fed to cut interest rates at the same time that it is trying to fight higher inflation, railed against Powell for not doing so until September, and is trying to fire one of the Fed governors, Lisa Cook, over alleged past mortgage fraud.\n\nPowell’s term is up in 2026. Many financial analysts fear the president will appoint a replacement who will value short-term growth over price stability.\n\nThen there is the problem of tariffs. “We had the worst trade deals ever made, and our country was laughed at from all over the world,” Trump said in his December speech, “but they’re not laughing anymore.” Neither were financial markets after “Liberation Day,” April 2, when Trump leveled tariffs on most nations and one island populated entirely by penguins.\n\nThe specter of a worldwide trade war loomed. Financial markets experienced a massive selloff globally, temporarily shedding a ballpark $10 trillion of value in a matter of days. A combination of the administration relaxing some tariffs, lawsuits that challenged its authority to do this in the first place, and some trading partners deciding that a trade war would hurt too many people with friendly fire eventually calmed things down.\n\nThe relationship between tariffs and inflation is complicated, but tariffs have demonstrable upward effects on many prices even in times of more straightforward trading. Under the current regime, tariffs have pushed up many prices already; harmed manufacturing jobs in the U.S., as many of the inputs are imported; and likely had knock-on bad effects on broader employment. Unemployment has ticked up at the same time that companies trying to navigate a new labyrinthine regime have had to eat some of the tariffs in the short run.\n\nLooking forward to 2026, many companies were already baking tariff-driven price hikes into their pie charts. A survey by the Institute for Supply Management, for instance, found that 86% of manufacturers were planning to pass on all or at least a significant portion of the cost of tariffs on their wares by raising prices.\n\nMembers of the Trump administration have floated a “tariff dividend,” paid to citizens out of increased tariff revenues, to overcome the poll-measured skepticism of the majority of people toward its trade policies. However, this would still require the consent of a closely divided Congress and could be further undercut by an adverse ruling by the Supreme Court on tariffs.\n\nThe current price-confidence loop presents a tricky political problem for any party in power in that the country likely has to get well past it before the din ceases. After the November GOP shellacking in several state and local elections, Trump initially discounted concerns over “affordability.”\n\nTrump’s party has a lot riding on public perceptions of prices and the economy in this year’s midterm elections. His address was thus a Yuletide pivot. The president gave his supporters the gift of at least appearing to take the issue of prices seriously. If he proves serious about tackling the issue in the new year, it could make a real difference for the political battles to come.\n\nJeremy Lott (@jeremylottdiary) is the author of The Warm Bucket Brigade: The Story of the American Vice Presidency.","summary":"The week before Christmas, President Donald Trump delivered a televised address from the White House.

The difference with this report, however, is that the public won’t get to see it, as the DNC has refused to release it, similar to one produced by the House Democrats’ campaign arm after Trump’s initial win in 2016, against the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nIronically, DNC Chairman Ken Martin promised to conduct an autopsy for the 2024 election, criticizing the decision not to release the 2016 report. Now, however, he has done a complete 180-degree turn.\n\nIn a statement released in late December, Martin said, “In our conversations with stakeholders from across the Democratic ecosystem, we are aligned on what’s important, and that’s learning from the past and winning the future. Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”\n\nAccording to a CNN report, officials involved in the review were concerned that releasing it would only inflame internal party tensions at a time when Democrats have started to notch some wins. Gubernatorial victories in Virginia and New Jersey have buoyed the party. A Democrat was elected mayor in Miami for the first time in nearly 30 years. More than two dozen House Republican Conference members have announced they will not seek reelection, including Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), who not only said she will not run again but also dropped out of the New York governor’s race.\n\nAdd in Trump’s continued sagging poll numbers, and Democrats appear to be in a prime position for gains in 2026 and perhaps the 2028 presidential election. So why are they afraid to release the post-mortem of the 2024 election, especially after the 2024 Democratic ticket of Harris and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) burned through $1.5 billion in just 15 weeks?\n\nThe concern about “inflaming party tensions” is revealing and offers some insight. While Democrats frequently say they are “united,” the only thing truly uniting them is a shared animosity toward Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and the current administration. Beyond that, divisions run deep, centered on the strained relationship between the party’s establishment wing and its progressive wing.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) remains influential within the party, and more progressive members of Congress, such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), the latter of whom entered the primary to run for the Senate in Texas, have continued to grow their influence, often to the detriment of more traditional Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nThe recent government shutdown, which lasted more than 40 days, occurred in part because progressive Democrats demanded that party leaders, including Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), maintain a strategy of holding out. As the shutdown dragged on, it began to affect government workers, SNAP payments, and small businesses, prompting more centrist Democrats to break with the party to reach an agreement.\n\nProgressives ultimately labeled the deal that reopened the government “a betrayal.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) took direct aim at Schumer, saying he “is no longer effective and should be replaced.”\n\nThe autopsy likely reveals deep divisions among Democratic legislators, and between lawmakers and voters, over priorities, policies, and strategy. Those divisions include:\n\nImmigration and border security — While the Trump administration’s methods have come under scrutiny and even some supporters are critical of deportation efforts, the Republican position remains more popular with voters. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party favors a more hands-off approach, similar to that of former President Joe Biden’s administration, which proved politically disastrous.\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict — The issue is so divisive that some progressive Democrats are calling for a primary challenge to Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), a progressive Democrat. Fetterman’s offense? He has been a staunch defender of Israel, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. While he votes with progressives on most issues, for some activists and Democrats, that is no longer enough.\n\nZELENSKY SUGGESTS RUSSIA IS PLANNING TO INTERFERE WITH REFERENDUM ON TRUMP PEACE PLAN\n\nCultural issues and party image — The Democratic Party has increasingly been seen as “out of touch.” Its focus on “gender-affirming care,” transgender rights, the preservation of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and aggressive language policing has created an image of a party disconnected from average voters, particularly working-class and swing voters.\n\nChances are, Martin does not want this internal battle to play out in public. Yes, it would be a distraction, but it is also a problem that will not disappear with off-year election wins or narrow margins in the 2026 midterm elections. These issues will still be there in 2028. Refusing to address them now almost guarantees they will resurface when Democrats begin announcing their presidential ambitions in early 2027.\n\nJay Caruso (@JayCaruso) is a writer living in West Virginia.","summary":"When a party loses a presidential election, the aftermath is marked by a slew of analysis and deep dives, often referred to as a “post-mortem” or “autopsy,” aimed at determining what exactly went wrong and how to improve the outcome four years later.

Yet a surprising number of them go on to become president. Forty-five men have been or are the president of the United States. Fifteen of those men — one-third — were vice president first.\n\nVice presidential legacies?\n\nThose vice presidents who became president then ran administrations whose legacies are ranked and debated throughout U.S. history. The victors received Secret Service protection for life and a dedicated presidential library to house their papers, which helps make the case for their place in history.\n\nAs for vice presidents who do not become president, they can receive a government pension, provided they have at least five years of total employment with the federal government. Former President Joe Biden, for instance, received a pension that paid $166,374 a year to start, after he served as vice president in Barack Obama’s administration, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.\n\nBiden’s payout was sweetened by his 36 years in the Senate before the vice presidency. President Donald Trump’s first vice president, Mike Pence, started receiving his pension with much less money, only $57,265 annually, according to NTUF. Pence’s time on the federal government payroll, and now his pension, stem from his four years as vice president, plus 12 years as a House member from Indiana.\n\nFormer vice presidents are also able to parlay their experience and connections into book deals, paid speaking engagements, and other opportunities. Harris is currently hawking her book 107 Days, a campaign memoir about how she tried, and failed, to keep Trump from retaking the Oval Office after Biden dropped out and endorsed her as the Democratic Party’s standard-bearer.\n\nYesterday’s presidential understudies are also frequently mentioned on the quiz show Jeopardy! And, as Harris said, their 3D likenesses eventually join the Senate’s vice presidential bust collection.\n\nSculpting those busts can take quite some time, however. The queue is backed up at the moment, with marble busts for Biden, Pence, and Harris still in production.\n\nThe Senate hosts the marble collection because of the vice president’s historic, constitutional role as president of the upper chamber. Vice presidents preside over the Senate, although by tradition they do not take part in speechifying and debates. Instead, their chief power is to cast tiebreaking votes in closely divided Senates.\n\nThe number of tiebreaking votes that happen varies wildly by administration. Biden did not have the opportunity to cast a single tiebreaking vote in his eight-year vice presidency.\n\nIn contrast, Harris cast a record-breaking 33 votes in four years. The 50-50 Senate tie during the Biden administration’s first two years helps explain this. Pence cast 13 Senate tie-breakers over his four years as vice president, all with a Republican majority. Trump’s second vice president, JD Vance, formerly a freshman senator from Ohio, has thus far cast seven deciding votes, according to the Senate website.\n\nVance and the midterm elections\n\nVance, like Harris, will eventually have his own bust in the Senate. In 2024, he attacked Harris with gusto on the campaign trail, took a dig at her on social media over allegations that sections of an earlier book of hers had been cribbed from Wikipedia entries, and still contrasts her role in the Biden administration’s lax border policies with the Trump administration’s more enforcement-minded approach.\n\nBut to her comments that she is “a historic figure?” So far, crickets.\n\nWhat that likely means is that Vance doesn’t view her as a credible threat to his own White House ambitions. Instead, Vance, like Harris before him, has hitched his near-term political career to the success of the administration that he serves.\n\nThe 2026 midterm elections stand in his way. Current polling is not favorable to Republicans. A significant loss in November would hobble his party and hurt his chances of succeeding Trump, so he’s doing what he can to avert that disaster.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS SAYS DEMOCRATS NEED POST-TRUMP MESSAGE TO FIX ‘FLAWED STATUS QUO’\n\n“Do you want rents to keep dropping and wages to keep rising, as they have over the last few months?” he asked a stadium full of Turning Point USA conservative activists at their December convention.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro are both releasing memoirs in February 2026. Former Vice President Kamala Harris is touring swing states to promote her own book about her 2024 campaign. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — who recently amplified a poll showing her ahead of Mr. Vance in a hypothetical matchup — begins her year with a major speech at Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration ceremony. \n\nFor would-be candidates in both parties, 2026 will serve as a crucial test of their political appeal, their ability to raise money and their skill at navigating their respective parties’ anxieties and ambitions. As the year starts, they’re locked in a covert courting period, staying coy about their interest in national office even as they methodically build support.\n\n“The talented and smart are in a mad rush for influential people who are willing to be in their corner,” said Jay Townsend, a political consultant who has worked on Republican presidential campaigns. “They’re quietly raising money already.”\n\nSome, like Newsom and Shapiro, are releasing memoirs, typically a tell-tale sign of candidates-in-waiting. Such books offer contenders a way “to own your story and define your narrative,” according to Karen Finney, a Democratic operative who advised on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. Other shortlisters, like Vance, Harris and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, have already published bestselling memoirs. Harris recently expanded tour dates for her new book about her historic 107-day candidacy, which will see her travel to four swing states and South Carolina, which was Democrat’s first-in-the-nation primary state in 2024.\n\nOne Democratic National Committee member, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning, said there is a \"rush of energy\" surrounding 2028 preparations, including selecting a convention site and deciding which states should hold early primaries. There is \"some anxiety around the type of nominee\" after two women lost to Trump in 2016 and 2024, the member said.\n\n“I definitely see and feel the pushback a lot, which is people being like, ‘Kamala is still incredibly popular. Let’s not write her off,’” the member said. “But I also hear from people that say, ‘I can’t live through another rejection of a woman candidate.’”\n\nVance leads, but others circle\n\nOn the Republican side, Vance appears to be the early front-runner, bolstered by his position as vice president and his ties to Mr. Trump's inner circle. \"For 2028, right now, it's Vance's race to win or lose,\" said Garrett Ventry, a Trump ally who runs the lobbying firm GRV Strategies. \"He has that institutional support.\"\n\nBut other Republicans are positioning themselves. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose podcast has grown in popularity, \"is as ambitious as they come,\" Townsend said. \"I don't think he's going to look at JD Vance and be intimidated. He faced down Donald Trump and was the last one standing, so why shouldn't he go for it?\" Former Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have each made visits to Iowa in recent months, historically a sign of an official who wishes to be in the presidential conversation.\n\nIowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann, who chairs the Republican National Committee’s presidential nominating process, said his team expects to deliver an initial report on the primary calendar at the RNC meeting later this month in Santa Barbara, Calif. “I’d never say absolutely until it's officially passed, but it's looking more and more inevitable that Iowa will be first in the nation again,” he said.\n\nOne White House official said it’s still “too early” for the president to focus on boosting his next successor. But Trump has repeatedly praised both Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, calling a prospective Vance-Rubio ticket “unstoppable.”\n\nA person close to Vance said he plans to play a “big role” on the campaign trail this year, when he’s expected to criss-cross the nation delivering speeches focused on the economy.\n\nWhether Republicans can turn around public sentiment on inflation could prove pivotal as the party defends majorities in both chambers of Congress.\n\n“To date, the polling data is relatively clear that despite some progress, voters still feel they cannot get ahead in today’s economy,” said Ken Spain, a Republican strategist. “Republicans must find a way to recapture the narrative on cost for 2026 and beyond.”\n\nDem govs position for 2028\n\nAmong Democrats, Newsom leads early polling, along with Harris. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Ocasio-Cortez follow closely behind. But a clutch of governors are also seen as eyeing the top job.\n\n\"I do think the next president is more likely to be a governor,\" Finney said. \"They are chief executives, and they can talk about results in a way that is harder when you're a senator or come from a legislative body.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a billionaire who has been a major Democratic donor, is also seen as a potential candidate. Moore, who will lead the National Governors Association starting in mid-2026, hired two former Harris campaign aides to his state office last year: media strategy director Ammar Moussa and communications strategist Rhyan Lake. Like Mr. Newsom, he has launched a redistricting effort in his state. He has repeatedly said he is not running for president.\n\nFor governors running for re-election this year — including Shapiro, Pritzker and Moore — balancing state campaigns with national ambitions presents a delicate challenge.\n\nShapiro faces particular pressure to help Democrats win in Pennsylvania, a key battleground. He backed the state's new party chair, Eugene DePasquale, who will be tasked with rebuilding from Democrats’ 2024 losses.\n\nWhile Newsom has the advantage of being at the end of his governorship — freeing him up to focus on what’s next — other governors can't take their eyes off the prize of winning in November.\n\nThe affordability message\n\nDemocrats believe economic issues — especially the many cost of living concerns now grouped together under the umbrella of “affordability” — will bolster their chances in the midterms. The DNC member told MS NOW that party leaders have been “very clear” with candidates that messaging on affordability cuts across demographic groups.“It’s very easy” to “point the finger at the governing party if things are perceived as not going well,” said Ventry, though he acknowledged the dynamics were flipped under former President Biden. “It’s much easier to throw bombs than to govern.”\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, Vance set modest expectations for the midterms, suggesting that losing a dozen House seats and two or three Senate seats would be acceptable. \"I think it will be better than that,\" he added.\n\nAllan Lichtman, a presidential historian, noted that significant midterm losses have historically preceded changes in White House control, as happened before Trump's 2016 victory and Biden's win in 2020.\n\n“While it's not an absolute predictor, it is an indicator of momentum going into a presidential election,” said Lichtman. “2026 will mean a lot for 2028.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/2028-politics-preview-presidential-campaign-2026-midterms","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767202735/251231-2026-precursor-to-2028-zz/251231-2026-precursor-to-2028-zz.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 10:00:00","author":"Akayla Gardner","authors":["Akayla Gardner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.145},{"id":390743276,"title":"George Clooney Fires Back After Donald Trump Mocks His French Citizenship","text":"George Clooney has responded after Donald Trump criticized the actor and his wife Amal Clooney for receiving French citizenship.\n\nTrump lashed out on Truth Social after the news was revealed earlier this week, writing, “George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden.”\n\nThe president continued, “Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!), who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country, including Tim Waltz, Gavin Newscum, for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat. Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Clooney replied, “I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again. We’ll start in November.”\n\nEarlier this week, France’s Ministry of Justice confirmed that the Clooney family received their naturalization orders in official documents published over the weekend. George will retain his American citizenship, while Amal — who was naturalized under her maiden name Amal Alamuddin — is British-Lebanese. Their two children were born in London. \n\nThe Clooneys spend a significant portion of their lives in the south of France, where they purchased an estate in 2021. The actor cited France’s privacy laws as a primary draw. “I was worried about raising our kids in L. A., in the culture of Hollywood,” he told Esquire. “I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life. France — they kind of don’t give a shit about fame. I don’t want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi.

Here’s a Wish List for 2026.","text":"Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts — an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let’s take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar.\n\nFirst, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation’s capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos — wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage, and more — the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: national sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests — not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex.\n\nThat reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90 percent. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump’s law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20 percent from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says.\n\nStill, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list.\n\n1. Peace in Eastern Europe. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which thus far remains elusive. A durable peace — one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration — should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader, and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful — if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious — concessions.\n\n2. Victory on Birthright Citizenship. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration’s righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally “required” birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet — granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally — is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress’s rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration.\n\n3. Improved Affordability and Housing Costs. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 — from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care, and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it — cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline — the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration.\n\n4. Justice for Minnesota Somali Fraud Scandal. The burgeoning massive fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, involving many businesses run by Somali immigrants, has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris — who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate — know, and when did she know it? The American people deserve answers to all these questions.\n\n5. Tamed Communist China. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible, and emboldening key regional allies — such as Japan — who share America’s interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump’s presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal.\n\nThis past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more — a lot more — of that same success in this new year.\n\nREAD MORE from Josh Hammer:\n\nWhat, Exactly, Does the Right Stand For?\n\nChanukah Is Relevant for Everyone — but Not in the Way You Might Think\n\nDon’t Go Wobbly on China\n\nTo find out more about Josh Hammer and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com.

Enter Mayor Zohran Mamdani and First Lady Rama Duwaji","text":"In his inaugural speech, Mamdani vowed to govern “expansively and audaciously,” and said that New York will not be a city “governed only by the one percent,” or “a tale of two cities, the rich versus the poor.” He was sworn in by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who thanked New York City for electing Mamdani as mayor, and reminded the crowd that his ideas are “not radical.”\nAnd yet, Mamdani and his First Lady, 28-year-old illustrator Rama Duwaji, have broken the political mold. Not solely because of Mamdani’s perhaps not radical but inarguably progressive ideas—to, say, tax the rich or enforce a rent freeze—but also because of their ages and backgrounds, which have been underscored repeatedly by the media as cause of celebration or with Islamophobic dismay.\nMamdani was born in Uganda to Indian parents, and Duwaji in Texas to Syrian Muslim progenitors. They are young and progressive, and they also look the part. The balancing act moving forward, as it pertains to their style now that they’re embedded in the political establishment, will be to negotiate between the newfound gloss of their public image while keeping it consistent with their politics.\nWhen Mamdani celebrated his election in November of 2025, Duwaji donned a top by London-based Palestinian-Jordanian designer Zeid Hijazi paired with a skirt by the New York-born and -based Ulla Johnson, who is known for her bohemian flair. She managed the task of looking both like a first lady and a 20-something woman dressing for a special occasion with aplomb. Back then, she had been advised—free of charge—by stylist Bailey Moon, who dresses the likes of Morgan Spector and Cristin Milioti and is most widely known for having worked with Jill Biden and her family throughout president Joe Biden’s administration.\nMoon’s role advising Mamdani and Duwaji was revealed by Puck soon after election night—it had been a well-kept industry secret, as had been his work with the Biden family—and a flurry of headlines discussed the need for a democratic socialist mayor to work with, in the words of the New York Post, a “swanky celeb fashion stylist.” Moon is no longer advising Mamdani and Duwaji.\nInstead, when Mamdani, who wears suits by Suit Supply and once told GQ that Uniqlo was one of is go-to brands, chose Thursday to wear a tie by the New Delhi-based designer Kartik Kumra of the label Kartik Research, he was advised by the stylist and former Vogue editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who revealed her role and confirmed what the couple wore to the proceedings with a post on her newsletter. Kumra operates a store in the Lower East Side and shows his collections during Paris Fashion Week, yet his approach at making fashion is singular in that he personally works with a network of artisans in his home country of India. Karefa-Johnson also pointed out that internet sleuths recognized the tie as a nod to New York’s single other democratic socialist mayor, Firello La Guardia, whose nickname was “The Little Flower.”\nDecorated with a jacquard motif from Assam in Northeast India, the tie also served the purpose of allowing Mamdani to represent in a subtle yet meaningful way—this is, after all, the purpose of fashion within the political sphere: To provide context, to send a message, without doing so too brazenly, just like Duwaji did on election night by wearing a Palestinian designer.\nThe opportunity to work with Mamdani, Karefa-Johnson wrote, came about when she received a call from Mamdani’s senior advisor Zara Rahim, whom she also described as her “longtime friend.”\nTeam Mamdani faces a unique challenge in that it must ensure that the mayor and the first lady set forth a proper, consistent image, while trying to bypass unnecessary discourse from his detractors and critics. A lesson they might have learned from the media coverage around Moon’s role is that, should they choose to work with a stylist—which they surely must to ensure consistent messaging and to facilitate the process of procuring pieces on loan for Duwaji—reporting and criticism is unavoidable. While Moon fit the bill in terms of his known discretion and acumen in the political space, Karefa-Johnson is an appropriate choice in that she is a well-regarded and connected fashion editor who is outspoken in her politics, which closely align with Mamdani’s. Karefa-Johnson is known for being generally anti-establishment, and she also understands first hand the nuances of living visibly and publicly as a woman of color. Should the right-wing media come looking for something to say about Duwaji’s new stylist, there should be no surprises for either camp.\nFor the midnight swearing in at a long-closed subway station beneath City Hall, Duwaji donned a vintage Balenciaga coat from Albright Fashion Library and archival earrings from New York Vintage, both selected and rented by her with Karefa-Johnson. Duwaji is known to be an avid thrifter, having recently told New York Magazine that she used to have a Google Maps folder with “50 different places” she had found and saved. By choosing to rent a vintage piece, Duwaji is affirming that she favors sustainability and circularity in fashion, like many others her age. (It is also generally more affordable to rent or thrift vintage luxury than purchasing it.)\nThe coat was paired with tailored black shorts by The Frankie Shop, which retail for $139, and boots by Miista, which retail for $630. Karefa-Johnson made a point to write in her newsletter that the boots were borrowed from the brand, not purchased, preemptively addressing possible criticism the first lady is wearing a costly item while her husband speaks of standing with the working people of New York City.\nFor the second swearing in this afternoon, Duwaji wore a custom-made ensemble by Cynthia Merhej, the Lebanse-Palestinian designer behind the label Renaissance Renaissance. The piece, a brown coat dress with faux fur trims, was an “adaptation,” according to the stylist, of a piece from Merhej’s Fall/Winter 2023 collection. Once more Duwaji has chosen to speak with her fashion, choosing an independent woman designer from the Middle East who comes from a family of clothes-makers. Merhej also recently worked with costume designer Miyako Bellizzi to outfit Chloë Sevigny for Durga Chew-Bose’s debut film, a remake of the 1958 French classic Bonjour Tristesse.\nKarefa-Johnson did not disclose what the Mayor was wearing, though his style is simpler and much less flashy than that of his predecessors. (Former mayor Eric Adams was sitting in the crowd wearing a $720 Fendi scarf.)\nDuwaji looked the part of first lady while circumventing pearl necklaces and pant suits. She, most importantly, looked like herself, while making a clear statement of what matters to her and where her politics lie, even when she’s not delivering remarks. Even if the public generally believes that fashion is inconsequential to a political figure, these choices matter. Hillary Clinton, for one, was heavily criticized for wearing a Giorgio Armani jacket with a price tag in the thousands of dollars back in 2016. First Lady Melania Trump has also received flack for donning European luxury labels like Dior and McQueen while her husband speaks of reinforcing the American economy. Then-vice-president Kamala Harris, on the other hand, was celebrated for choosing African American designers for the 2021 Inauguration celebrations.\n“I love fashion, and I love being creative and putting things together and styling things,” Duwaji told New York Magazine. “Speaking out about Palestine, Syria, Sudan—all these things are really important to me,” she added. Like her husband, and her generation, Duwaji understands something crucial to our existence today: Everything is political, from how we act and where we shop to how we dress and who we choose to work with.","summary":"The newly inaugurated New York City mayor and his wife make a convincing pitch for aligning the new polish of public image with their progressive politics.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/rama-duwaji-dress-stylist-zohran-mamdani-new-york-mayor-inauguration","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69570c2479d2bec33973725f/16:9/w_8192,h_4608,c_limit/2254285678","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 02:41:36","author":"José Criales-Unzueta","authors":["José Criales-Unzueta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.205},{"id":390653914,"title":"329 days of Trump, Trump, Trump: How he made himself 'ubiquitous' in a year","text":"Since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has relentlessly pursued the public's attention each day of his second term in office.In doing so, Trump has set out to dominate our collective consciousness unlike any of his predecessors.To understand how Trump has achieved this omnipresence, The New York Times reviewed the first 329 days of his second term, finding at least one instance each day when he attracted the public's attention to himself and his actions.The review encompassed more than 250 media appearances, more than 320 official appearances, and more than 5,000 Truth Social posts or reposts. The analysis shows that while Trump has lagged his predecessors in his number of official appearances, he has pursued a raft of innovative methods to force himself into the public consciousness on a daily, and sometimes even hourly, basis.The battery of activity started from the moment he was inaugurated, when he traveled from the Capitol to Capital One Arena to publicly sign a flurry of executive orders.Live EventsSince then, he has stayed in the public eye in part by doing things no president has ever done. High-stakes Oval Office meetings, like his negotiations with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, are held on-camera and broadcast live on global news networks. His Q&A sessions with reporters frequently last an hour or more.He regularly airs his opinions -- on social media, in discursive asides at rallies -- about idiosyncratic subjects that range widely across the zeitgeist, from Sydney Sweeney's sexy denim ads to the redesigned logo of the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain to the mysterious fate of aviator Amelia Earhart, who vanished over the Pacific Ocean in 1937.And his engagement with the news media has soared well beyond the start of his first administration.Through Dec. 14, Trump took reporters' questions on 449 occasions, compared with 223 during the same period of his first term. On average, Trump has interacted with journalists roughly twice a day, doubling his rate from 2017, according to Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University political scientist who tracks presidential press interactions. Trump limits which news outlets can ask questions at small events, but in sheer volume, he is the most media-accessible modern president, and far outpaces his predecessor, Joe Biden.\"Reporters will be in my office asking me for the president's reaction to a breaking news story,\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in an interview. \"And I'll just say to them, 'I don't know, why don't you ask him yourself in 30 minutes?'\"Many of his public moments go viral online, like his diatribe about restoring the name of the NFL's Washington Redskins, or the artificial intelligence-generated video meme he posted of himself dribbling a soccer ball with Cristiano Ronaldo in the Oval Office. They take on a life of their own, rippling across social media and dissected and amplified by influencers and mass media platforms alike.The result is a president whose not-so-inner monologue is injected into our daily lives in myriad ways, when we are watching TV on the weekends or idly scrolling the web -- a Greek chorus for our national narrative.\"He's the most ubiquitous president ever,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian. The media strategy aligns with his political strategy. Dating to his years as an outspoken real estate developer and reality TV star, Trump has relished being unavoidable for comment. But at age 79, he has been outdoing his younger self. And there is a logic to his logorrhea.Trump's allies often speak of the political benefits of flooding the zone: pursuing so many policies, ideas and dramatic restructurings of the normal ways of governance as to overwhelm the system. \"All pedal, no brake,\" as Steve Bannon, Trump's one-time adviser, has called it.\"We joke internally that he is our ultimate director of communications,\" Leavitt said. \"He has incredible media instincts, and he is the final decision-maker on all policy, and he has been in a 'flood the zone,' 'do as much as possible' mindset since he walked into the Oval Office on Jan. 20.\"All presidents benefit from the awesome news-making powers of the office, with its agenda-setting influence over a dedicated global press corps. But Trump has outstripped his predecessors in whipsawing the public's attention onto matters small and large -- and limiting the level of scrutiny that any one shocking remark or policy proposal receives.\"People can really only focus on a handful of things a day,\" said Bill Burton, a deputy White House press secretary under President Barack Obama. \"This attention flood is working for Trump because he is able to do an extraordinary amount of executive actions and very little of it can get attention.\"Or as Brinkley put it: \"He plays to win the day, every day, around the clock.\" His commentary takes on a life of its own. One of Trump's political assets is his instinct for virality.With a natural feel for the web, Trump has a knack for amplifying wacky memes and pop culture curios that can drive days of online discourse. Sometimes, coverage of his offhand remarks or late-night social media posts can crowd out the more significant, norm-shattering changes he is making to American governance.Late one Friday night in May, the president posted an obviously AI-generated image of himself as the pope. It struck a nerve.Trump had already courted controversy days earlier, after the death of Pope Francis on April 21.\"I'd like to be pope,\" the president told reporters who asked about who should become the next pontiff. \"That would be my number one choice.\"The comment disturbed some Catholics, who said the notion was crude and insensitive. That reaction seemed only to prompt Trump to double down, posting the AI-generated image to his Truth Social account days later. By the weekend it had become a cultural phenomenon, mocked on \"Saturday Night Live\" and called out by experts as an example of misleading AI content.Trump, who is not Catholic, had plenty of defenders, too. They said his commentary and the AI image were simply jokes, part of the president's unique comedic style.\"As a general rule, I'm fine with people telling jokes and not fine with people starting stupid wars that kill thousands of my countrymen,\" Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic, wrote on the social platform X.In his quest for attention, the president is often aided by a cottage industry of right-wing influencers and activists who are primed to syndicate, reinforce and defend whatever content he pushes out each day. For this conservative media ecosystem, Trump's messaging and commentary are the raw fuel that drives clicks, shares and views.On June 7, the president's visit to a raucous UFC fight -- complete with a \"Trump dance\" entrance into the arena -- generated an immediate spike in online interest, including about 50,000 posts on X. Five days later, when he promoted a \"Trump gold card\" visa, his announcement led to roughly 30,000 posts on X. A barrage that distracts from bad news. One pattern in Trump's behavior: When his administration is faced with bad news, he launches a fusillade of distraction.This can take the form of outlandish, out-of-left-field claims about political opponents. Or he might weigh in on a pop culture subject far afield from Washington politics -- from the ratings of late-night hosts like Seth Meyers to the physical appearance of a megastar like Taylor Swift.The events of July 2025 offer a case in point.As the Jeffrey Epstein files returned to the news -- along with speculation that Trump might appear in them -- the president embarked on a breathtaking series of tangents. Trump claimed without evidence that former President Bill Clinton had bankrolled an effort by senior intelligence officials to frame him for a crime, mused about stripping actress Rosie O'Donnell of her U.S. citizenship, and accused singer Beyoncé of accepting millions of dollars to endorse his erstwhile rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris.On July 18, the Justice Department filed a request to unseal grand jury testimony about Epstein, again raising questions about Trump's involvement. The president promptly lobbed insults at late-night talk show hosts, dismissed the Epstein affair as \"fake news\" and shared fresh claims about a supposed Obama administration plot to undermine him after the 2016 election.On July 25, The Wall Street Journal published a major scoop: The paper had unearthed a risque birthday letter that Trump had apparently written to Epstein in 2003. Trump responded with his attack on Beyoncé and revived his threat to revoke the broadcast licenses of TV networks. Then he announced the imminent construction of an enormous gilded ballroom at the White House, at a cost of $200 million. (He has since revised the cost upward to $400 million.)Asked if there was a deliberate strategy to distract from negative news, Leavitt noted that every administration seeks to minimize unhelpful headlines.\"Yes, there have been times in which we've tried to do that, but also often it just happens naturally, because the president is willing to weigh in on so many subjects,\" she said. \"Sometimes it's really not deliberate. It's just him speaking his mind on whatever news cycle or news story is brought to him in that moment.\" He has added tricks to his arsenal. Trump's devotion to Truth Social mirrors the hair-trigger Twitter habit of his first term; on one recent December evening, he posted 158 times between 9 p.m. and midnight. And he has continued to appear on Fox News with certain preferred hosts.But in the first year of his second term, he added to his media arsenal by appearing in many more public spaces that fall outside a president's typical itinerary.Trump has stopped by a Washington Commanders NFL game, popped up in the New York Yankees locker room, attended the Ryder Cup golf tournament and the men's tennis final at the U.S. Open, sat ringside at numerous UFC fights, and traveled to the Daytona 500. He is the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. When FIFA staged the Club World Cup final in New Jersey, Trump not only attended, but joined the winning team onstage for the trophy ceremony.The net effect is a sense of inescapability, that no corner of American life remains Trump-free - which itself amounts to a potent expression of presidential authority and command. \"His power, in part,\" said Burton, the former Obama aide, \"comes from the attention that people give him, or that he forces on them.\" Can it ever be too much? In the fall of 2009, Obama appeared on David Letterman's talk show, gave interviews to CNBC and Men's Health magazine, and made the rounds of all five major network Sunday shows. Washington was abuzz about whether he was overexposed.That debate sounds quaint today. But the question of whether a president can be too visible remains open.\"The public is being desensitized\" to Trump's omnipresence, argued Brinkley, the historian. \"It starts becoming blather. The enemy for Trump isn't Democrats; it's the public being bored with the show.\"Leavitt said that if there were a risk to his ubiquity, \"President Trump would not be president right now.\" She added: \"He is a businessman who speaks his mind and tells it like it is, and sometimes people don't like that. But obviously the vast majority of our country does, or else he wouldn't be in this office.\"During Trump's first term, the public eventually tired of his frenzied pace. And in some ways, Trump appears to be slowing down physically as he approaches his 80th birthday in June (which he will celebrate in part by staging a nationally broadcast UFC fight on the White House lawn). He has appeared to doze at some Oval Office meetings, and he is holding fewer formal public events than he did at this point in 2017.Still, Trump and his team have embraced the everywhere-all-at-once nature of modern media. Average Americans, busy with work and family, do not tune in for daytime news conferences or Cabinet meetings. And 6:30 p.m. newscasts and local newspapers are no longer the primary vessels by which Americans learn about their commander in chief.Instead, politics now suffuses our lives as a kind of ambient noise -- via TikTok videos, social media posts, YouTube talk shows and family Facebook messages -- never fully separate from our leisure pursuits. \"Right now the game is attention, in terms of what's culturally breaking through,\" Burton said. \"The fact that so much message exists is the point.\"Trump has both propelled this merging of culture and politics, and continues to strategically exploit it. In December, he became the first president to personally host the Kennedy Center Honors, comparing himself onstage with Johnny Carson and musing that he would do a better job than Jimmy Kimmel.\"This is the greatest evening in the history of the Kennedy Center,\" Trump told the crowd. \"Not even a contest. There has never been anything like it.\"His performance aired in prime time on CBS on Dec. 23.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpwhite housewashington redskinswashington commanders nfltruth socialtowson universityoval officenew york yankeeswall street journalnew york times\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News ontrumpwhite housewashington redskinswashington commanders nfltruth socialtowson universityoval officenew york yankeeswall street journalnew york times \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"President Donald Trump dominates public attention daily in his second term.

Minnesota's firebrand Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has questions of her own to answer after Somali daycare scandal, writes TOM LEONARD","text":"With her motto – ‘I am America’s hope and the president’s nightmare’ – framed on the wall of her office, firebrand Left-wing Congresswoman Ilhan Omar displays plenty of ambition, though perhaps not modesty.\n\nAnd with her stirring tale of fleeing war-torn Somalia to build a new life in the American Midwest, she and her supporters have prided themselves on her message of hope providing a compelling counterpoint to Trump.\n\nOmar has said she came to the US when she was 12, knowing only two English phrases: ‘hello’ and ‘shut up’. Since then, she’s found plenty more to say.\n\nTeeth-grindingly self-righteous and uber-woke, she is one of the four members of the so-called ‘Squad’ – along with New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – a cabal of racially diverse, ultra-Left-wing Democrat Congresswomen who inspire devotion from their Gen Z followers and irritation or plain contempt from just about everybody else.\n\nIncluding moderates in their party who believe that, with Trump having won a landslide in large part due to his rejection of Biden-era wokery, the Squad’s endless sniping about America and obsession with ‘progressive’ policies is electoral suicide.\n\nRepublicans seem to regard Omar in particular as the most toxic of the Squad and have pounced on any controversy – including long-standing allegations that she married her brother so he could come to the US, an unsubstantiated claim she has rejected as ‘absolutely false and ridiculous’.\n\nCritics also deride her as a shameless hypocrite, spouting Marxist politics while wearing expensive Jimmy Choo and Prada sunglasses. And who claims to be a devout Muslim but who – according to his ex-wife – conducted an affair with third husband Tim Mynett (her former campaign adviser) while he was still married.\n\nNow Trump has Omar, a 43-year-old mother of three, in his sights as never before amid an unfolding series of dizzying fraud scandals – amounting to more than $1 billion in stolen state funds – which have captivated America and which were largely perpetrated by Minnesota’s Somali community, whom Omar represents and with whom she closely identifies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump exploded on social media: ‘Much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90 per cent, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia.’ He went on: ‘“Congresswoman” Omar, an ungrateful loser who only complains and never contributes, is one of the many scammers.’\n\nOmar has publicly condemned the various frauds – which include fake claims for feeding children during the pandemic, assisting schoolchildren to cope with autism and housing homeless people. And, although she did know some of those who’ve been prosecuted, there’s no evidence she was directly involved in any of the schemes.\n\nGiven this, Trump appears to be referring to a more recent controversy that, for Omar, is rather closer to home.\n\nThe politician who has previously claimed that she barely has any money now appears to be wealthy, and possibly very wealthy indeed. She has been accused of failing to follow congressional procedures covering the disclosure of her assets and potentially wildly under-representing her husband’s investments.\n\nHer most recent financial disclosure forms to the federal government suggest she and husband Tim Mynett are worth at least $6 million (£4.5 million)and as much as $30 million (£22 million). A mere two years ago, the couple said they had no more than $158,000 (£117,000).\n\nOmar, who is paid a congressional salary of $174,000 (£129,000), has accused the US media of misrepresenting her wealth. However, Washington insiders insist she’s to blame for being intentionally opaque about her finances.\n\nOmar’s most recent compulsory disclosure shows that Mynett has a stake in a venture capital firm valued at between $5 million and $25 million. Her 45-year-old husband, a political consultant-turned-venture capitalist, is also part-owner of a California winery worth up to $5 million.\n\nThat does not necessarily mean the couple are worth $30 million, which she has flatly denied. Her office has stressed that the sums on the disclosure form reflect the full value of the businesses rather than her husband’s personal stake.\n\nShe’s angrily insisted that Mynett is one of ‘several’ partners in the two firms. However, according to California records, Mynett is just one of two partners in the winery – though others could conceivably have joined since then.\n\nCritics say the Congresswoman – while not accused of wrongdoing – has ensured the waters remain muddied by failing to disclose simply and clearly her husband’s stake.\n\nMeanwhile, Mynett’s venture capital firm, Rose Lake Capital – set up in 2022 with business partner Will Hailer – has (if Omar’s financial statements are correct) enjoyed similarly astronomical growth in the past two years.\n\nShe said it was worth less than $1,000 in 2023. Now it’s valued at between $5 million and $25 million. According to the New York Post, in recent months the firm ‘quietly scrubbed’ the names and biographies of nine of its executives and advisers – including two Obama-era US ambassadors – from its website. ‘By not reporting the value of Mynett’s stakes, Omar is effectively hiding the extent of her wealth from the public,’ says the Washington Examiner newspaper.\n\nA conservative watchdog, the National Legal and Policy Center, said this week it is now scrutinising Omar’s finances.\n\nPaul Kamenar, the organisation’s lawyer, said: ‘There’s a lot of strange things going on. She was basically broke when she came into office and now she’s worth perhaps up to $30 million… she needs to come clean on these assets.’\n\nAnd Mynett’s investments are causing headaches for him and his wife in other ways. The wine business, called eStCru and based in Santa Rosa, California, was accused in 2024 of defrauding investors, one of whom alleged Mynett and his partner had failed to honour a pledge to pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Mynett has denied the allegations, calling it a contractual dispute.)That Mynett is investing in wine is also perhaps surprising given that, according to Omar’s own spokesman, the couple married ‘Islamically and legally’ in 2020.\n\nSince strict Sunni Islam, to which the hijab-wearing Omar adheres, forbids a Muslim woman from marrying a non-believer, some suspect Mynett must have converted. And Muslims, of course, are strictly forbidden from producing, selling or drinking alcohol.\n\nOmar insists she has no involvement in her husband’s business affairs but, given she frequently cites her faith as a guiding star in her political career, some observers have called for her to break her public silence on his wine business.\n\nInterest in any potential financial irregularities in the Omar household has inevitably been sharpened by the epic level of fraud that has recently been exposed within Minnesota’s sprawling Somali community – estimated to number around 80,000 and concentrated in the city of Minneapolis which Omar represents.\n\nThe latest scandal, focusing on empty children’s day care centres handed millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, has helped Trump to push Somali fraudsters near the top of the US news agenda and has led to demands for the resignation of Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the hapless running mate of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nCritics have blamed Minnesota’s ‘bleeding-heart bureaucracy’ – for which Omar is a front-rank cheerleader – and a cynical policy of accusing anyone who questioned the endless, unchecked handouts of racism.\n\nThis week, Minneapolis resident Cain Pence, a disabled whistleblower who helped expose a massive Somali-run fraud scheme in the city, told the Daily Mail: ‘There’s a unique reason why [fraud was so prevalent in] Minnesota. We have more social services. We have a liberal political culture and generous welfare systems... and then a group of people exploited that. At the same time the whole George Floyd thing happened [in 2020] and you literally couldn’t say one word against a Somali. So it all worked together to create a tsunami of fraud.’\n\nWalz and other Democrat leaders of the Midwest state – who pride themselves on the generosity of their benefits system – have come in for intense criticism since journalist Nick Shirley released a YouTube video a few days ago that showed empty or abandoned day care facilities were still receiving enormous sums of public money.\n\nHe filmed himself standing outside one of them, the ‘Quality Learning Center’ in Minneapolis, with a large sign showing its name spelled incorrectly as ‘Learing’. Shirley pointed out that the premises were empty at midday on a weekday during the school year.\n\nHe also filmed two other day care centres that had received millions of dollars despite being seemingly devoid of children (but not Somali ‘staff’, who sent him packing).\n\nIn light of the video, which has garnered tens of millions of views and after which Shirley has received a number of death threats, the US Department of Health and Human Services paused $185 million in aid to Minnesota – home of the world’s largest Somali community outside Africa.\n\nOpponents have long accused Trump of racism over Somali immigrants, not least for his encouragement of supporters to chant, ‘Send them back!’ at rallies.\n\nTrump has now said he doesn’t want any Somali migrants at all in the US, and agents of his Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) department are reportedly planning an operation in Minneapolis targeting the community. But although some 40,000 Minnesota residents were born in Somalia, the majority of ethnic Somalis have US citizenship or permanent residency. (Omar became a US citizen when she was 17.)\n\nEven fellow conservatives have pointed out that the real\n\nissue isn’t immigration but rampant government benefits fraud that is rife across the US (up by 242 per cent since 2020), and particularly in handout-happy Democrat states.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that most Somali-Americans are law-abiding citizens, the sheer scale of the fraud in Minnesota and the inescapable truth that this community was deeply involved in it have made it hard for Democrats to dismiss the kerfuffle as politically expedient race-baiting.\n\nFederal charges have already been filed against 98 people in Minnesota, and at least 60 have been convicted. According to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, 85 of the defendants accused of embezzlement of public funds are ‘of Somali descent’, while Minnesota’s Republican House Speaker, Lisa Demuth, claims what has so far emerged ‘is probably the tip of the iceberg’. Last week, Assistant Attorney Joseph Thompson announced that more than $9 billion in federal funds allocated to childcare programmes in Minnesota may have been stolen.\n\nThe cases stretch back to 2022 – during the Biden administration – when Minneapolis prosecutors charged 47 defendants with stealing at least $250 million from a child nutrition programme set up during Covid. Those charged claimed they had opened centres that were inundated with hungry children. Instead, they were submitting entirely false child rosters.\n\nA small halal grocery claimed to be feeding thousands of children every day. Its Somali-American owner was convicted of pocketing nearly $1 million which he spent on a honeymoon in the Maldives, a $64,000 pick-up truck and $30,000 in jewellery from Dubai.\n\nThe cases expanded to include fraud in Minnesota’s housing and autism-services programmes, again with the accused taking large sums of money for non-existent services. They splashed out on properties in Kenya and top-of-the-range Mercedes and BMWs. A lot of the money went into banks and companies in China, where investigators will find it almost impossible to identify the recipients.\n\nMost shocking of all, the Treasury Department is investigating a report by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, which alleged that millions of dollars in stolen funds from Minnesota were sent to Somalia and ended up with Al-Shabaab, the Somali branch of Al-Qaeda. (Federal investigators told CBS News there’s no evidence for this claim.)\n\nOpponents say Omar is partly to the blame for these benefits scandals as she introduced the 2020 MEALS Act which relaxed oversight of children’s meal schemes during the pandemic.\n\nIf the crisis ends up claiming the career of Minnesota’s most famous Somali migrant, Republicans (and not a few Democrats) will not be too distraught.\n\nAdditional reporting: Dana Kennedy in Minneapolis","summary":"LEONARD: With her motto - 'I am America's hope and the president's nightmare' - framed on the wall of her office, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar displays plenty of ambition, though perhaps not modesty.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15427801/Trumps-socialist-nemesis-fraud-scandal-Minnesotas-Congresswoman-Ilhan-Omar.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/01/23/105165259-0-image-m-42_1767308853678.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 23:40:18","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.01},{"id":390619164,"title":"Ilhan Omar Faces Scrutiny Over Her Stance Against Trump","text":"In her office, a framed motto reads, “I am America’s hope and the president’s nightmare,” encapsulating the bold ambitions of Ilhan Omar, a prominent Left-wing Congresswoman.

It stands as a hopeful contrast to the rhetoric associated with former President Trump.\n\nOmar recounts arriving in the U.S. at the age of 12 with only two English phrases in her vocabulary: “hello” and “shut up.” Since then, she has added considerably to that repertoire.\n\nOmar is known for her vocal activism and is a key member of the “Squad,” a group of four racially diverse, progressive Democrat Congresswomen, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York.

(Omar became a US citizen when she was 17.)\n\nEven fellow conservatives have pointed out that the real\n\nissue isn’t immigration but rampant government benefits fraud that is rife across the US (up by 242 per cent since 2020), and particularly in handout-happy Democrat states.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that most Somali-Americans are law-abiding citizens, the sheer scale of the fraud in Minnesota and the inescapable truth that this community was deeply involved in it have made it hard for Democrats to dismiss the kerfuffle as politically expedient race-baiting.\n\nFederal charges have already been filed against 98 people in Minnesota, and at least 60 have been convicted. According to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, 85 of the defendants accused of embezzlement of public funds are ‘of Somali descent’, while Minnesota’s Republican House Speaker, Lisa Demuth, claims what has so far emerged ‘is probably the tip of the iceberg’. Last week, Assistant Attorney Joseph Thompson announced that more than $9 billion in federal funds allocated to childcare programmes in Minnesota may have been stolen.\n\nThe cases stretch back to 2022 – during the Biden administration – when Minneapolis prosecutors charged 47 defendants with stealing at least $250 million from a child nutrition programme set up during Covid. Those charged claimed they had opened centres that were inundated with hungry children. Instead, they were submitting entirely false child rosters.\n\nA small halal grocery claimed to be feeding thousands of children every day. Its Somali-American owner was convicted of pocketing nearly $1 million which he spent on a honeymoon in the Maldives, a $64,000 pick-up truck and $30,000 in jewellery from Dubai.\n\nThe cases expanded to include fraud in Minnesota’s housing and autism-services programmes, again with the accused taking large sums of money for non-existent services. They splashed out on properties in Kenya and top-of-the-range Mercedes and BMWs. A lot of the money went into banks and companies in China, where investigators will find it almost impossible to identify the recipients.\n\nMost shocking of all, the Treasury Department is investigating a report by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, which alleged that millions of dollars in stolen funds from Minnesota were sent to Somalia and ended up with Al-Shabaab, the Somali branch of Al-Qaeda. (Federal investigators told CBS News there’s no evidence for this claim.)\n\nOpponents say Omar is partly to the blame for these benefits scandals as she introduced the 2020 MEALS Act which relaxed oversight of children’s meal schemes during the pandemic.\n\nIf the crisis ends up claiming the career of Minnesota’s most famous Somali migrant, Republicans (and not a few Democrats) will not be too distraught.\n\nAdditional reporting: Dana Kennedy in Minneapolis","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn her office, a framed motto reads, &#8220;I am America’s hope and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ilhan Omar Faces Scrutiny Over Her Stance Against Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/ilhan-omar-faces-scrutiny-over-her-stance-against-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trumps-socialist-nemesis-Ilhan-Omar-has-questions-to-answer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 23:37:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.127},{"id":390629076,"title":"GOP redistricting could backfire as urban, immigrant areas turn back to Democrats","text":"Voters in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia cities shifted away from Republicans this year.\n\nBy Tim Henderson for Stateline\n\nGOP reversals in this year’s elections, especially in some urban and immigrant communities, are setting off alarm bells for Republicans using redistricting to try to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterms.\n\nRedistricting plans demanded by President Donald Trump in states such as Texas and Missouri — meant to capitalize on his stronger showing among certain urban voters in the 2024 election — could backfire, as cities in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia returned to Democratic voting patterns in off-year elections this past November.\n\nExperts see the shift as a sign of possible souring on the administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, combined with disappointment in economic conditions.\n\nRelated | How the unprecedented redistricting war is harming election officials, politicians, and voters\n\nPaul Brace, an emeritus political science professor of legal studies at Rice University in Houston, said Texas Republicans are likely to gain less than they imagine from new maps designed to pick up five additional seats for the party. He said minority voters’ interest in Trump was “temporary” and that he had underperformed on the economy.\n\n“Trump’s redistricting efforts are facing headwinds and, even in Texas, may not yield all he had hoped,” Brace said.\n\nRedistricting efforts in Texas spawned a retaliatory plan in California aimed at getting five more Democratic seats. Other states have leapt into the fray, with Republicans claiming an overall edge of three potential seats in proposed maps.\n\nCuban-born Jose Arango, chair of the Hudson County Republican Party in New Jersey, said immigration enforcement has gone too far and caused a backlash at the polls.\n\n“There are people in the administration who frankly don’t know what the hell is going on,” Arango said. “If you arrest criminals, God bless you. We don’t want criminals in our streets. But then you deport people who have been here 30 years, 20 years, and have contributed to society, have been good people for the United States. You go into any business in agriculture, the hospitality business, even the guy who cuts the grass — they’re all undocumented. Who’s going to pick our tomatoes?”\n\nAs immigration arrests increase this year, a growing share of those detained have no criminal convictions.\n\nRelated | How Democrats—and Trump—turned 2026 into a potential blue wave\n\nNew Jersey’s 9th Congressional District, which includes urban Paterson, went from a surprising Trump win last year to a lopsided victory this year for Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. Trump won the district last year by 3 percentage points and Sherrill won by 16 points. The district is majority-minority and 39% immigrant.\n\nThere was a similar turnaround in Miami, a majority-immigrant city that elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in almost 30 years. Parts of immigrant-rich Northern Virginia also shifted in the governor’s race there.\n\nIn the New Jersey district, Billy Prempeh, a Republican whose parents emigrated from Ghana, lost a surprisingly close 2024 race for U.S. House to Democrat Nellie Pou, of Puerto Rican descent, who became the first Latina from New Jersey to serve in Congress.\n\nPrempeh this year launched another campaign for the seat, but withdrew after Sherrill won the governor’s race, telling Stateline that any Republican who runs for that seat “is going to get slaughtered.”\n\nPrempeh doesn’t blame Trump or more aggressive immigration enforcement for the shift. He said his parents and their family waited years to get here legally, and he objects to people being allowed to stay for court dates after they crossed the border with Mexico.\n\n“We aren’t deporting enough people. Not everybody agrees with me on that,” Prempeh said.\n\nParts of Virginia saw similar voting pattern changes. Prince William County, south of Washington, D.C., saw support for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger jump to 67% compared with 57% for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last year. The county is about 26% immigrant and 27% Hispanic.\n\nRelated | Here's how Virginia Democrats will combat Texas' map-rigging\n\nAsian American and Hispanic voters shifted more Democratic this year in both New Jersey and Virginia, said J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, expanding on a November post on the subject.\n\nHowever, some of those Virginia voters might have sat out the governor’s race, Coleman said.\n\n“I do think there is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year,” Coleman said. “There were many heavily Asian and Hispanic precincts in Northern Virginia that saw this huge percentage swing from Harris to Spanberger, but also saw relatively weak turnout.”\n\nThe pattern is “hard to extrapolate” to Texas or other states with new maps, Coleman said, “but Democrats are probably liking what they saw in this year’s elections.”\n\nHe said one of the redrawn districts in Texas is now likely to go to Democrats: the majority-Hispanic 28th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and South Texas. And the nearby 34th Congressional District is now a tossup instead of leaning Republican, according to new Center for Politics projections.\n\nThe pattern in New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District this year was consistent in Hispanic areas statewide, according to an analysis provided to Stateline by Michael Foley, elections coordinator of State Navigate, a Virginia-based nonprofit that analyzes state election data.\n\nNew Jersey Hispanic precincts “swung heavily” toward Sherrill compared with their 2024 vote for Harris, Foley said in an email. He noted that New Jersey and Florida Hispanic populations are largely from the Caribbean and may not reflect patterns elsewhere, such as Texas where the Hispanic population is heavily Mexican American.\n\nPou, who won the New Jersey seat, said economics played a part in this year’s electoral shift.\n\n“The President made a promise to my constituents that he’d lower costs and instead he’s made the problem worse with his tariffs that raised costs across the board,” Pou said in a statement to Stateline.\n\nMicah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said immigration and pocketbook issues both played a role in places like the 9th District, as did an influx of Democratic campaign money.\n\n“The biggest reason is a sense of letdown in President Trump,” Rasmussen said. “There were many urban voters who decided they liked what Trump was saying, they liked the Hispanic outreach, they bought into his economic message. And just one year later, they’re equally disillusioned.”","summary":"Voters in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia cities shifted away from Republicans this year.\n\n\n\nBy Tim Henderson for Stateline\n\n\n\n\nGOP reversals in this year’s elections, especially in some urban and immigrant communities, are setting off alarm bells for Republicans using redistricting to try to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterms.\n\n\n\nRedistricting plans demanded by President Donald Trump in states such as Texas and Missouri — meant to capitalize on his stronger showing among certain urban voters in the 2024 election — could backfire, as cities in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia returned to Democratic voting patterns in off-year elections this past November.\n\n\n\nExperts see the shift as a sign of possible souring on the administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, combined with disappointment in economic conditions.\n\n\n\n\nRelated | How the unprecedented redistricting war is harming election officials, politicians, and voters\n\n\n\n\nPaul Brace, an emeritus political science professor of legal studies","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2026/1/1/2360165/-GOP-redistricting-could-backfire-as-urban-immigrant-areas-turn-back-to-Democrats?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1506520/story_image/AP25338770846705.jpg?1765386058","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 23:00:27","author":"Stateline,Tim Henderson","authors":["Stateline","Tim Henderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":390635232,"title":"George Clooney Claps Back at Trump’s NYE Rant: ‘We Have to Make America Great Again.

The actor, who is an outspoken Trump critic, notably urged former President Joe Biden to drop out of the race in an op-ed. \n\n“Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,” Trump wrote. “Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!), who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country, including Tim Waltz [sic], Gavin Newscum, for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat.” \n\n“Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,” Trump continued. “He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIn a statement responding to Trump’s post, Clooney said: “I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again. We’ll start in November.”\n\nThe pair’s war of words comes after Clooney recently told Variety that he and Trump used to be friendly prior to the latter’s entry into politics. \n\n“I knew him very well,” Clooney told the outlet. “He used to call me a lot, and he tried to help me get into a hospital once to see a back surgeon. I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\nIn addition, Clooney criticized ABC News and CBS News for settling lawsuits filed by Trump last year for $16 million each. \n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f**k yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” he said. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nClooney also condemned CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss for “dismantling” the network. Weiss has since responded to Clooney, reportedly inviting him to “learn more” about her work and visit the CBS newsroom.\n\nClooney’s decision move to France follows the “Jay Kelly” star praising the country and the lifestyle it offers his family. In an interview with the French broadcaster RTL earlier this month, he said that he planned to raise his kids on a farmhouse in France that they loved.\n\n“Here, they don’t take photos of kids. There aren’t any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That’s No. 1 for us,” he explained. “We also have a house in the United ​States, but our happiest place is ​on this farm where the kids can ​have fun.”\n\nClooney has previously stated that he grew up on a farm and likes the idea of his twins growing up away from the noise and spotlight of Hollywood.","summary":"The president called the actor's decision to move to France \"good news\" before attacking him for his support of Kamala Harris in the 2024 election\n\n\nThe post George Clooney Claps Back at Trump&#8217;s NYE Rant: &#8216;We Have to Make America Great Again.

Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), announced her intention to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats — or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive — many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned or announced their intent to not run for reelection. With only two exceptions — Republicans in 2018 and 2020 — this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members.\n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI). Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC).\n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on.\n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, (R-NC), mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies.\n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats — nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation — are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates.\n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one.\n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House.\n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.","summary":"By Charlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science, Boise State University. \n\nThe midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run — 43 in the House, plus 10 senators.

Hardly","text":"The fallout from that moment more than three years ago could not have been easier to predict. Democrats experienced an infusion of energy, the kind that comes from suddenly becoming the underdog. But that was not the source of the surprise. Once the dust settled, it became apparent that the Republican Party and the pro-life movement as a whole were not quite ready for a post-Dobbs world. Then a stunning, nagging question began to emerge: Is the GOP still the party of life? \n\nThe post-Dobbs GOP\n\nThe black and white nature of politics naturally leads to the assumption that if one side is for something, then the other side is against it. This template fits well over many issues. But when it comes to abortion, the decades-old equation no longer works very well. And it’s not because the Democratic Party has become sympathetic to the plight of unborn souls. On the contrary, Democrats are as consistently anti-life as they’ve ever been. It is the Republican half of the equation where the fervor has noticeably diminished, and the staunchly held ideals have waned. Once upon a time, support for unborn life served as a guiding principle for the Right. Now, the main criteria is whether such a principle will “harm” Republicans at the polls. \n\nIt is a dispiriting evolution, to say the least. And it has been heavily, perhaps even fully, induced by a GOP dominated by personalities above all else. \n\nA main feature of Donald Trump‘s 2016 campaign for president was the promise that he would appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court. Every candidate in the crowded field understood what was at stake with the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February 2016. Trump’s pledge to bring an end to Roe, combined with the kind of temperament that welcomes a fight, ignited hope. Republicans would finally come out on top in the decadeslong battle between the pro-life and pro-choice crowds, at least at the Supreme Court. It was the kind of victory that pointed to the GOP’s ability to do what had previously felt impossible: push back against leftist cultural domination. \n\nNot long after Roe and Casey were overturned, the sinking reality of a post-Dobbs world was quickly felt. Anyone who believed a pro-life win at the highest court in the land would magically transform the United States into a pro-life nation was singularly naive. Dobbs would not bring an end to abortion or the debate surrounding it. \n\nWith the issue sent back to the states, laws around the country would span the spectrum from restrictive to permissive, and everything in between. This seemed to catch some off guard. Furthermore, the Democratic Party’s collective loss awakened a long-dormant sense of urgency. For years, abortion proponents had coasted on the existence of Roe. Overnight, that comfort was gone. In its place was a renewed effort to protect abortion and make Republicans pay.\n\nBack to the states\n\nLess than five months after the Dobbs decision, Americans went to the polls to vote in the 2022 midterm elections. Historically, the party in power does rather poorly during midterm elections. But this time, the “red wave” prediction of a Republican sweep did not come true. While the GOP took control of the House, Democrats expanded control in the Senate. Around the country, Democrats flipped governorships and legislatures. The deleterious effect the 2022 midterm elections had on Republican power has colored the pro-life agenda since then. \n\nThe 2022 midterm election autopsy pointed to the Dobbs decision as a major reason for the upsets. But instead of admitting that a post-Dobbs world, while difficult, was still worth it, far too many Republicans in both leadership and at the grassroots level have behaved as if the opposite were true. This is disgraceful. And it’s proof the “party of life” is more concerned with power than unshakeable virtues. \n\nIn early December, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) unveiled a new pro-life group called Love Life Initiative. According to its site, the group’s goal is “thoughtful, far-reaching advertising campaigns that promote the sanctity of life, advance referendums that protect life, and identify and defeat harmful proposals in statehouses across the nation.”\n\nWhat did the Trump administration have to say about this? A source told Axios the following: “Clearly, Senator Hawley and his political team learned nothing from the 2022 elections, when the SCOTUS abortion ruling [overturning Roe v. Wade] resuscitated the Democrats in the midterms.” Is the guiding force no longer what’s morally correct but what’s politically expedient? It’s hard to come to any other conclusion. It’s almost as if Trump and his team are embarrassed and/or annoyed when Republicans do something so “antiquated” as maintain their pro-life creed. \n\nAnd this is the continuing aftermath of one of the biggest pro-life victories of all time? \n\nThis reaction to Hawley is not the only indication the “party of life” has morphed into a shell of its former self. \n\nIn August 2024, during his third run for president, Trump posted on Truth Social: “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights.” This is the kind of language the pro-abortion Left uses when talking about the issue. It’s fair to say Trump wanted to present himself as appealing to women during his run against then-Vice President Kamala Harris. But announcing you’d be great for women and so-called reproductive rights is clearly at odds with the pro-life agenda. Protecting both women and the unborn should be the goal. His post ignored the unborn completely. \n\nIVF Betrayal\n\nAlso during his third campaign, Trump promised to completely cover the cost of IVF for Americans who wished to go that route. But there is nothing pro-life about in vitro fertilization if you look at the human cost required to bring about a successful pregnancy. During the IVF process, multiple embryos are “created” in a laboratory. Some are used and implanted, some are miscarried, and still others are discarded or frozen. If pro-life Americans are horrified by the destruction of human life during abortion, they should also be concerned about the same result when it happens during IVF. \n\nIn February, Trump signed an executive order meant to help reduce costs and remove barriers to IVF. Lila Rose of Live Action and Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life were vocal about their opposition to the order. But influential, longtime groups such as the National Right to Life and SBA’s Pro-Life America either remained silent or weakly reacted to it. This is just one example showing that pro-life organizations are scared to hold Trump accountable, even on the issue that defines their missions. It is allegiance to a temporary politician over a foundational issue. It is pure cowardice. \n\nThe weakness further extends to Trump’s appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the position of HHS secretary. Kennedy is an abortion-supporting Democrat and has been for years. That hasn’t changed despite assurances to pro-life senators during his nomination hearings. Kennedy continues to refuse a review of the chemical abortion pill mifepristone. Through his organization, Advancing American Freedom, Former Vice President Mike Pence called Kennedy out as a “progressive wolf in pro-life sheep’s clothing” and demanded his removal. \n\nThese examples pile on top of the uncritical support that too many Republicans have for the president. In their minds, there is simply no room for criticism of him or his agenda. This holds true even when his words, actions, and nominations are at odds with long-standing values. Those values, protection of unborn life and support for politicians who refuse to bend on the issue, are no longer in the foreground. They no longer dominate nor direct what was once known as the “party of life.” \n\nWinning well\n\nWhen it comes to abortion, Republicans have to collectively decide whether they want to just win or win well. The former is nothing more than beating your opponent on Election Day. The latter is not only getting more votes but doing so while maintaining and promoting the principles that undergird American conservatism. These are the kind of ideals that are non-negotiable and don’t shift based on what ideological enemies do. I dare say that “winning well” should be the ultimate goal. But for far too many years now, crossing the finish line first is all that has mattered. \n\nCHINA TEACHES TRUMP TWO LESSONS ON TAIWAN\n\nAt present, it’s difficult to imagine a return to a time when pro-life principles stood at the center of the GOP’s identity. The party now appears publicly uncertain about what matters most, and worse, largely untroubled by the fact that it has drifted from what it once defended without hesitation. Holding fast to these values requires an unapologetic approach that ignores the changing tides of political popularity. To care about these issues is to anchor oneself to what is right rather than what is convenient. And that’s a risk an unsettling number of Republicans, voters and leadership alike, no longer seem willing to make.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And, yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS,\" Dokoupil said. \"I report for you.\"\n\n The remarks arrive as CBS News faces continued scrutiny over editorial independence amid a number of significant leadership and strategic changes happening behind-the-scenes with the network and its parent company, the recently formed Paramount Skydance.\n\n Last year, prior to his re-election and prior to Skydance Media's acquisition of Paramount Global, President Donald Trump sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Paramount later paid $16 million to settle the lawsuit without an admission of wrongdoing — leading many to speculate the payout for Trump's case was simply an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration and the FCC ahead of the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\n That skepticism only increased in December, CBS News' new Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss landed in the hot seat by pulling a 60 Minutes story hours before air, claiming the piece — focused on Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvado — needed further reporting.\n\n Against that backdrop, Dokoupil framed his debut as an effort to rebuild trust with viewers of what CBS bills as America’s longest-running broadcast.\n\n “A lot has changed since the first person sat in this chair,” Dokoupil said in his prepared statement. “But for me, the biggest difference is people do not trust us like they used to. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media.”\n\n Dokoupil said those concerns have followed him for more than two decades of reporting across the country, from conversations with neighbors in West Virginia to those in New York City.\n\n “Sometimes people wanna talk to me about our coverage of NAFTA or the Iraq War,” he said. “Other times, it’s all about Hillary Clinton’s emails or Russiagate. Or more recently, COVID lockdowns, Hunter Biden’s laptop or the president’s fitness for office.”\n\n “The point is on too many stories the press has missed the story,” he continued. “Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you.”\n\n Dokoupil went on to admit he has felt that disconnect himself.\n\n “At certain points, I have been you,” he said. “I have felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn’t reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life. And that the most urgent questions simply weren’t being asked.”\n\n He said his approach as anchor would center on transparency and accountability. “Which means I tell you what I know, when I know it and how I know it,” Dokoupil said. “And when I get it wrong, I’ll tell you that, too.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n The father of four and former CBS Mornings anchor pledged to apply the same standard across the political spectrum.\n\n “I’m going to talk to everybody, and hold everyone in public life to the very same standard,” he said. “After all, I became a journalist to talk to people.”\n\n Dokoupil closed by directly inviting viewers to keep him accountable. “I’m Tony Dokoupil, the anchor of The CBS Evening News,” he said. “Hold me to it.”\n\n The CBS Evening News with Tony Dokoupil begins Jan. 5 (at 6:30 p.m. local time) on CBS. The debut episode will be broadcast from San Francisco as part of Dokoupil's Live From America tour that spans 10 cities over 10 days with stops in Denver (1/6), Dallas (1/7), Atlanta (1/8), Miami (1/9), Detroit (1/12), Minneapolis (1/13), Chicago (1/14), Cincinnati (1/15) and Pittsburgh (1/16).","summary":"\"Here’s my promise to you today and every time you see me in this chair: you come first,\" Dokoupil said","url":"https://people.com/tony-dokoupil-promises-cbs-evening-news-viewers-come-first-not-corporate-interests-11878119","image":"https://people.com/thmb/ZM5NDUZElna_hz2OthM7PM2232E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(730x328:732x330)/Tony-Dokoupil-cbs-evening-news-010126-05af7245fc624d1abfb2fab858578542.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 18:45:30","author":"Dave Quinn","authors":["Dave Quinn"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":390680654,"title":"Stock market shatters Trump’s claim the US has the world’s 'hottest' economy: analysis","text":"During his speeches, President Donald Trump often claims that he inherited a broken economy from former President Joe Biden and is now overseeing an era of renewed prosperity.

Yes, stock gains have comfortably exceeded the long-term average for a third straight year.

Stocks are no anomaly; U.S. bonds and the dollar are relative losers as well. The best explanation for why investors discounted U.S. assets so soon after The Economist dubbed the American economy 'the envy of the world' can be found in the latest OECD forecasts.\"\n\nBurgess continues, \"Coming into 2025, the Paris-based organization predicted the U.S economy would grow 2.4 percent for the year, trouncing the rest of the developed world's 1.9 percent. Now, the OECD predicts a less optimistic 2 percent. It sees a further downshift in 2026, to 1.7 percent, matching the OECD overall.\"\n\nRobert Burgess' full column for Bloomberg News is available at this link (subscription required).","summary":"During his speeches, President Donald Trump often claims that he inherited a broken economy from former President Joe Biden and is now overseeing an era of renewed prosperity.

They faced a bloodbath defeat in what had been a low-profile Iowa race, serving as a glaring warning for the GOP as they look ahead to 2026. \n\nDemocrats achieved a historic win on Tuesday night, electing Renee Hardman to the Iowa state Senate with 71.5 percent of the vote. This landslide victory resembled a presidential rout more than a downballot race. \n\nHardman’s win not only embarrassed the Republican candidate but also prevented the party from securing a supermajority in the chamber. Such dominance could make opposing voices nearly irrelevant. Additionally, Hardman made history as the first Black woman elected to the Iowa state Senate. \n\nThe magnitude of the win was surprising as Hardman’s 71.5 percent was 27 points higher than Kamala Harris’s performance in Iowa in 2024. This striking turnaround is something Democrats will highlight as evidence that changes are happening in areas Republicans typically view as secure.\n\nIn the context of Trump’s second term, this outcome fits into what Democrats have begun to label the “Trump effect.” This concept suggests that voter fatigue, backlash, or the sheer exhaustion from ongoing conflicts is driving people toward alternatives, even in traditionally GOP regions. \n\nRenee Hardman overperforms Kamala Harris by 27 points in the Iowa State Senate 16 Special Election. pic.twitter.com/fwU7WAjIPP\n— The Political HQ (@ThePoliticalHQ) December 31, 2025\n\nThe Iowa rout did not occur in a vacuum because other recent Democratic victories indicate that dissatisfaction may be spreading beyond the usual battleground states. These include gubernatorial wins by Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, along with several downballot flips and strong performances in places where Republicans usually feel confident. \n\nEarlier this year, Democrats made significant gains in Erie County, Pennsylvania, which had narrowly supported Trump in 2024. They also ousted a long-serving Republican incumbent in Virginia’s 66th state House district. In Georgia, Democrats achieved two statewide wins for public service commissioner, marking their first nonfederal statewide victories since 2006. Even in Mississippi, Democrats ended the Republican supermajority in the state Senate by flipping three seats, removing the GOP’s ability to override the governor’s veto and easily make constitutional changes. \n\nWhat makes the Iowa result particularly painful for Republicans is its symbolism. A late-year election is expected to be quiet, a minor event that party operatives don’t dwell on, not a headline-grabbing defeat. Yet, this election revealed a significant shift in political sentiment, showing a vivid blue response. \n\nWhile national races may feel far removed, a big win in a small local election can signal that voter dissatisfaction is increasingly resonating in local communities, especially as people grapple with issues of affordability and a government struggling to resolve conflicts abroad or lower costs at home. \n\nIt’s another overwhelming loss for the GOP, which struggled with infighting and bad poll numbers in 2025. Serving as the last vote of the year, Republicans are reportedly already preparing for huge losses in the midterms with Trump facing the potential of a lame-duck presidency if the Democrats get a majority in Congress.","summary":"A quiet end-of-year race turns into a brutal warning sign for Republicans as Democrats rack up a historic win.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/gop-candidate-gets-steamrolled-in-iowa-election-bloodbath","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GOP-Candidate-Gets-Steamrolled-by-Renee-Hardman-in-Iowa-Election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 18:30:21","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":390577564,"title":"Big New Year Dreaming: Kamala Harris Wants a Trump-Style Comeback","text":"Kamala Harris has launched a brand-new political action committee called Fight for the People.

She stacks slogans together, sprinkles in a nervous laugh, and acts as if every failure proves she’s secretly destined for greatness later. Voters didn’t gradually drift away. They sprinted.\n\nThis PAC doesn’t read like leadership. It reads like refusal to accept the verdict. Kamala never persuaded, nor was she inspirational. She didn’t connect. So, of course, the next move is to launch something new, slap the word “fight” on top, and hope everyone forgets what already happened. But the stench of great defeat doesn’t disappear just because the logo looks fresh.\n\nAnd speaking of fresh ideas, Kamala has been wandering around on that book tour like it’s supposed to prove she’s still a force in national politics. The book didn’t reset anything. I mean, who writes a book about how you lost a presidential bid and then expects applause and purchases? The book didn’t make people think, you know what, maybe we misjudged her. It landed with a thud and a polite shrug.\n\nBut in classic Kamala fashion, the lesson wasn’t, maybe this isn’t working. The lesson was, let’s level up the delusion. I can’t win a presidential race or sell a narrative people actually want to read. So of course, the next move is to start a PAC.

ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? …AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???” \n\nApparently in Trump’s America, celebrity endorsements are a crime.\n\nGeorge Clooney\n\nTrump already wasn’t a fan of Clooney when the movie star backed former President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the 2024 race. When Clooney later called for Biden to drop out in a New York Times op-ed, Trump called Clooney a “fake movie actor” who “never came close to making a great movie.”\n\nAnd then when Clooney appeared on “60 Minutes” in March, criticizing the Trump administration for its efforts to “make journalists smaller,” Trump jumped on Truth Social yet again.\n\n“Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece’ on George Clooney, a second rate movie ‘star,’ and failed political pundit,” Trump wrote. “He fought hard for Sleepy Joe’s election and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog.”\n\nClooney responded pretty plainly: “I don’t care.”\n\nTrump blasted Hanks after his scheduled award appearance at U.S. Military Academy West Point was unexpectedly canceled. \n\n“We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!” Trump wrote via Truth Social. “Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”\n\nHanks was set to win the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award, but it was canceled without clear explanation. He has also been inducted as an honorary member into the U.S. Army's Ranger Hall of Fame. \n\nGiven that Hanks has won multiple Emmys, whereas Trump hasn’t even secured one—despite his incessant complaining about it—this one seems personal.","summary":"If there is one thing that President Donald Trump is good at, it’s beefing online—especially with celebrities.

Trump also questioned George Clooney’s political judgement and acting career, turning a celebrity citizenship update into a broader political attack. The episode comes as France tightens immigration rules, highlighting the irony of Hollywood stars navigating bureaucracy.

These Nasty Primary Battles Could Get In The Way","text":"Democrats are seeking to retake control of Congress in November’s midterm elections, but a swath of cutthroat primaries in districts they seek to flip could blunt the party’s momentum.\n\nIn swing seats across the country, establishment Democrats are facing off against candidates hailing from the party’s far-left flank. The growing number of intraparty battles has sparked concerns that nominating left-wing candidates could complicate Democrats’ efforts to flip GOP-held seats in 2026. (RELATED: Michigan Senate Race Could Be GOP’s Best Midterms Offense Play, Poll Shows)\n\nSome Democratic strategists have cited Tennessee Democratic candidate Aftyn Behn’s loss in December as a prime example of the risk of nominating a staunch progressive to run in a Republican-leaning district.\n\nThough Behn kept the special election race within single digits — in a district President Donald Trump had carried by 22 percentage points in 2024 — some Democrats have argued the contest could have been within reach for the party if it had backed a more centrist candidate who more closely matched the views of the district.\n\n“Each time we nominate a far-left candidate in a swing district who declares themselves to be radical and alienates the voters in the middle who deliver majorities, we set back that cause,” Lanae Erickson, senior Vice President for Social Policy, Education & Politics, at liberal think tank Third Way said in a statement following Behn’s loss.\n\n“Might’ve been winnable with the right candidate, but Aftyn ‘I’m a very radical person’ Behn was not it,” Democratic strategist Simon Balezon wrote on X.\n\nNational Republicans are also eager to tie Democrats running in purple districts to New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s brand of democratic socialism. The increasing number of primary contests could also force Democrats to spend considerable resources in the primary while GOP incumbents rake in cash for the general election.\n\n“Democrats are trapped in a civil war of their own making, dragged left by Zohran Mamdani radicals while their swing seats bleed money,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. “This is what a party in panic looks like.”\n\nHouse Democrats’ campaign arm countered that the number of primaries are a product of the party’s strong performance in the 2025 off-year elections and lead in the generic ballot. Republicans, however, continue to hold a higher favorability rating than Democrats and GOP incumbents have largely maintained an edge in fundraising over their Democratic challengers.\n\n“Every poll and election result this year point to one reality: voters are tired of Republicans’ broken promises and are poised to deliver major wins for Democrats in the midterms,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spokesperson Viet Shelton told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “It’s why we are fielding such a large and incredibly strong class of candidates across the country while Republicans are not.”\n\nContentious Democratic primaries with notable ideological and factional divides are playing out in the following four battleground districts. Given House Republicans’ razor-thin majority, these swing seats are likely to help decide House control during the midterms.\n\nCalifornia’s 22nd District \n\nDemocrats are locked in a fierce contest to unseat moderate Republican California Rep. David Valadao, who has successfully fended off Democratic challenges over consecutive cycles. Valadao’s reelection bid became more difficult after Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander redrew the majority-Hispanic district from one Trump won by six percentage points in 2024 to one the president would have carried by only two points.\n\nCollege professor and school board trustee Randy Villegas, 31, is running for the majority-Hispanic district as a staunch progressive. He has secured independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ endorsement and is affiliated with the left-wing Working Families Party.\n\nVillegas has also tapped political strategist Morris Katz, who helped steer New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s left-wing populist campaign, to cut ads for his congressional run.\n\nCalifornia state legislator Jasmeet Bains, 40, is running on a more moderate platform. She has rolled out a slate of endorsements from establishment California Democrats and EMILYs List, a pro-abortion organization supporting female candidates.\n\nVillegas has flexed his progressive credentials by swearing off corporate PAC money and including Medicare for All in his campaign platform — a universal taxpayer-funded health proposal that has divided Democrats.\n\nValadao entered October with nearly $1.8 million on hand, dwarfing Bains and Villegas who both reported less than $300,000 in the bank. With the retirement of Republican Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse, Valadao is the only remaining House Republican who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 seeking reelection in 2026.\n\nColorado’s 8th District \n\nRepublican Colorado Rep. Gabe Evans, a freshman lawmaker, is facing several Democratic challengers in a purple district that narrowly voted for Trump.\n\nColorado progressive Manny Rutinel, 30, is vying for the Democratic nomination against fellow state legislator Shannon Bird, 56, who is running on a more moderate platform.\n\nRutinel has pledged to not accept corporate PAC donations and has won the support of the left-leaning Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ campaign arm.\n\nBird is backed by EMILYs List and WelcomePAC, a center-left organization working to elect Democratic candidates in Trump-won districts. She announced her resignation from the state legislature in early December to focus on her congressional run.\n\nEvans leads the field in fundraising and ended 2025’s third fundraising quarter with nearly $2 million in the bank. Rutinel has maintained an edge over Bird in fundraising. He ended September with $1 million on hand. (RELATED: Seven Primaries That Could Tear Democrats Apart In 2026)\n\nPennsylvania’s 7th District \n\nFive Democratic candidates are vying in a crowded primary to defeat Republican Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in 2026. The freshman lawmaker representing a bellwether district in the Lehigh Valley is one of Democrats’ top targets in the midterms. The swing district backed Trump in 2024 after voting for former President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nMackenzie, 43, defeated then-incumbent Democratic Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild by 1 point in 2024. Wild has endorsed Carol Obando-Derstine, a one-time staffer to former Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, to challenge Mackenzie.\n\nPennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association president Bob Brooks leads the field in endorsements drawing support from progressives, such as Sanders and Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna. Establishment Democrats, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, are also backing the union leader’s campaign.\n\nNorthampton County executive Lamont McClure and former federal prosecutor and Marine reservist Ryan Crosswell are also vying for the Democratic nomination.\n\nMackenzie maintains a significant fundraising edge over the pack of Democratic candidates.\n\nThe incumbent reported more than $1.4 million in the bank at the end of September. Crosswell closed the year’s 3rd fundraising quarter with more than $430,000 on hand, followed by McClure and Brooks, who both reported less than $300,000.\n\nArizona’s 1st District \n\nDemocrats are also divided over the best candidate to succeed retiring Republican Arizona Rep. David Schweikert.\n\nThe battleground seat vacated by Schweikert — who is running for governor — spans parts of wealthy North Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley that Trump carried by three points in 2024.\n\nFormer Democratic state legislator Amish Shah, who narrowly lost to Schweikert as the district’s 2024 Democratic nominee, is mounting a comeback bid for the swing seat. The ex-lawmaker has the support of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus’ campaign arm, which is affiliated with House Democrats.\n\nFormer TV anchor Marlene Galán-Woods is backed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ campaign arm and EMILYs List.\n\nGalán-Woods came up short against Amish in the 2024 Democratic primary, placing third, and has argued the party should nominate a new face in 2026. She is the widow of late Republican Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods and was a registered Republican until 2018.\n\nTrump endorsed Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Gina Swoboda to succeed Schweikert in October, though the president’s support has failed to stop other candidates from entering the race. Turning Point Action chief operating officer Tyler Bowyer excoriated Swoboda’s leadership in a post on X in October.\n\nFormer sports reporter, analyst and National Football League (NFL) kicker Jay Feely announced on Dec. 19 that he would run against Swoboda in the district’s Republican primary after previously running in the neighboring safely Republican 5th district. Feely switched seats a month and a half after Trump endorsed another GOP candidate for the 5th district but added that he likes Feely “very much” and suggested the former NFL player should run for another district or office.\n\nFeely played in the NFL for 14 seasons including four with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIn another hotly-contested GOP-held seat, moderate and progressive factions of the Democratic Party have largely united around three-time Democratic candidate Rebecca Cooke, who is expected to face Republican Wisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden in the general election.\n\nCooke narrowly lost to Van Orden by roughly 12,000 votes in 2024. She notably outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris by roughly three points, according to analysis by The Downballot.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Not nearly enough. We have a plan to take them on | Chris Powell","text":"The next general election will be no ordinary democratic contest. Not the usual swing of the pendulum this way or that. It will be a key moment in the history of our democracy – and it could be less than three years away.\n\nBe in no doubt: populists represent a new and terrifying threat to the kind of free elections and free society we cherish, but now take for granted.\n\nAs Donald Trump declared at a pre-election rally in July 2024: “In four years you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Or, as his fellow populist Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, said: “Democracy is like a tram. You ride it until you arrive at your destination, then you step off.”\n\nYet, here in the UK, where is the urgently needed counter-plan on a huge scale to thwart and head off such an existential threat? It is simply not in place, nor does it appear to be even at the planning stage. We are at a very dangerous moment. We simply cannot afford to allow Nigel Farage’s Reform UK to have a free run, and become established and entrenched as a credible potential government in the minds of disenchanted voters.\n\nThe longer they go unchallenged, the more unthreatening and risk-free they will seem to voters. Just hoping that Reform and Farage implode, or that the rightwing vote will somehow fracture, is potentially suicidal for our freedom and democracy.\n\nThe Labour party has taken some small steps to counter Reform. Keir Starmer has at last begun to talk about a closer relationship with Europe, and more broadly challenge the disastrous failure that is Brexit. Presentationally, we have recently seen the first decent Starmer videos on TikTok. But it is small-scale and the narrative surrounding this government has more often been about its own failings and internal conflicts than the battle it faces against a populist surge.\n\nIf this goes on, the threat will grow. It is already doing just that on the international stage. The new US foreign policy strategy aims to support European populist parties. That is frightening. The 50-year-old Conservative Political Action Conference, reinvigorated by hard-right influencer Steve Bannon, brings populist parties in the US and Europe together to combine their electoral experiences and share initiatives. But what is there from the anti-populist side at European level? Nothing.\n\nIn September 1995, Tony Blair and his team met at my home for their first election planning meeting. All the key players were involved. New Labour was ahead in the polls. But we did not just hope that the Tories under John Major would continue to decline. We planned scrupulously for a complete reorientation, to signal a real break from the past by Labour: new strategy, new branding, new policy, new presentation, new organisation. This kind of no-holds-barred thinking is needed. A fundamental reset.\n\nFor four years, my colleague David Cowan and I have been studying how populist parties operate here and in other countries, and how to counter them. There are certain key lessons. The first is that many populists seem to work single-mindedly on the “we have only got to win once” principle. So survival means adopting an equally ruthless rebuttal mindset within democratic bounds. Prioritising conventional niceties, as Kamala Harris did when refusing to break with Joe Biden, will be a self-defeating luxury. Anti-populists must be prepared to fight fire with fire on messaging, call out lies and expose Farage’s simplistic solutions.\n\nOnce elected, a number of populists have faced accusations of rigging democratic political systems to make it nearly impossible for them ever to lose. Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Erdoğan in Turkey, Narendra Modi in India, now Trump in the US, Robert Fico in Slovakia and Andrej Babiš in the Czech Republic all seem to adopt the same game plan.\n\nSince he came to power in 2010, Orbán has changed the voting system to benefit himself. The judiciary became accountable solely to him; they appear to freely throw opponents in jail. Last year Erdoğan jailed his presidential opponent, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who was ahead in the polls, and demanded he serve a 2,000-year sentence.\n\nSome populists have been accused of meddling with national broadcasters, by appointing cronies to their board. They deny opposition parties equal rights to promote themselves, so they have no chance. This is the populist playbook. What chance then for our elections, our free speech? How will the BBC and independent media fare? An independent judiciary?\n\nThe second lesson from our research is that Starmer needs to fundamentally change the way he approaches voters and his way of interacting with them. Voters are fed up, think nothing works – and some are simply angry and feel ignored. Our work shows that populists are best taken on when their opponents can somehow demonstrate that they are on the people’s side. This is how Kentucky’s Democratic governor since 2019, Andy Beshear, won out in a deeply Republican state. He has relentlessly spoken out in plain language on bread-and-butter issues: jobs, roads, schools, prices.\n\nAnd third: Labour needs a top-to-bottom media and communications overhaul. The populist right in many countries operates a coordinated, emotionally driven media machine across social platforms, leaving the mainstream left’s ecosystem looking fragmented, reactive and constrained by an outdated broadcast mentality. To compete, Labour needs a two-front strategy now. Tactically, it must create a semi-autonomous digital narrative unit whose sole mission is to wage and win the daily war for attention. The goal is to ensure that when a voter scrolls, the populist narrative is no longer the only one they hear. This also requires a long-term cultural overhaul to recruit and elevate authentic communicators willing to talk on platforms like popular podcasts, as traditional media is no longer reaching disengaged voters.\n\nTo achieve this, a shift will be needed from a national media “air war” to a permanent, hyper-local “ground war”. The solution is a local action network, a permanent organising infrastructure modelled on the ground-up success of Stacey Abrams in Georgia. Its mission would be to listen, act and communicate – identifying local problems, launching campaigns to fix them and publicising every small win.\n\nThe current situation in the UK is a textbook case of an establishment party caught in the headlights as its populist opponent expertly reacts to voter pain and disenchantment. Relying on containment or a rational “hold-your-nose” vote is a strategy that will eventually fail. Labour needs a comprehensive action plan, now. Time is a luxury it can’t afford.\n\n Chris Powell is an election strategy analyst and advised the Labour party for more than 20 years.

But recent polling indicates that Democrats may not be able to count on the issue in their efforts to drive votes in the 2026 midterms, after making abortion rights the centerpiece of their pitch to voters in the elections that followed the fall of Roe v Wade.\n\nIn 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). But in October of this year, just 36% of Democrats said the same. By contrast, abortion remained about as important to Republicans in both 2024 and 2025, PRRI found. PRRI’s findings mirror a September poll from the 19th and SurveyMonkey, which found that the voters who cared most about abortion are people who want to see it banned.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, abortion was seen as the Democrats’ strongest issue, after the 2022 overturning of Roe sparked a wave of deeply unpopular state-level abortion bans. Kamala Harris put abortion rights at the heart of her presidential campaign, while Democratic Senate candidates and Super Pacs poured an astounding $175m into abortion-related TV ads – far more than any other issue. Donald Trump, who enabled Roe’s collapse by appointing three conservative justices to the US supreme court, repeatedly tried to downplay the fight over abortion rights, viewing it as a political liability and a sure-fire boost for Democrats.\n\nBut the power of the issue turned out to be overstated in 2024. Trump handily won the popular vote and Republicans ended up with control of both houses of Congress. Still, the president has largely avoided further action on the issue at the federal level, focusing instead on initiatives like cracking down on immigration, instituting steep tariffs and bulldozing the federal workforce.\n\nThe tumult has further yanked Americans’ attention away from abortion, said Melissa Deckman, PRRI’s CEO.\n\n“It’s just hard to catch your breath, because every day there’s a new, outrageous thing happening with the administration,” Deckman said. Abortion, she added, has been replaced as a top issue by affordability and the economy. “That seems to be first and foremost for everyone. But it’s also, for Democrats, the state of democracy writ large. We consistently find that Democrats are more concerned about the health of democracy.”\n\nAugust polling from the group Emilys List, which champions Democratic women who support abortion rights, found that voters are now prioritizing the economy over abortion. But it also found that 49% of female voters consider threats to abortion rights to be a “dealbreaker”. Abortion remains a galvanizing issue in state supreme court elections, which now often have the final word on the legality of state-level abortion restrictions. \n\nAdvocates are currently working to secure enough signatures to get abortion rights measures on the state ballots in Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon and Virginia. Idaho, Oregon and Virginia’s proposed measures would protect abortion access, while Nebraska and Montana’s measures would eliminate it. Two states, Nevada and Missouri, have already confirmed that they will have abortion-related measures on the ballot. (Nevada passed an abortion rights measure in 2024, but it must past a second time before the constitution can be amended.)\n\nIn the past, Democrats have hoped that these kinds of measures, which voters tend to support, will elevate their candidates. But in 2024, voters backed abortion rights while rejecting Democratic candidates. Trump won four states that voted in support of ballot measures that added abortion rights to their state constitutions.\n\nSome of those measures have also proven to be less gamechanging than advocates originally hoped. In 2024, Missouri voters decided to amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights, making the state – which at the time banned virtually all abortions – the first state in the country to repeal a post-Roe ban. However, a protracted legal battle over the exact implications of the measure have repeatedly blocked Missouri abortion clinics from offering the procedure. Now, in 2026, voters will be asked whether they want to repeal the measure they passed just two years ago.\n\n“It just feels like such a messaging failure, to not understand and not be able to communicate that these people are going to continue to decimate abortion access,” said Alisha Dingus, executive director of the DC Abortion Fund, which helps people get the procedure. “I would like to see more politicians who are more comfortable talking about abortion more regularly.”\n\nThe flagging attention to abortion is having a trickle-down effect on fundraising efforts by abortion rights advocates. Donations to the DC Abortion Fund dropped precipitously in 2025, as post-Roe rage donations evaporated and economic struggles led reliable donors to stop giving.\n\nData indicates that US abortions have increased over the past few years, thanks in large part to online access to abortion pills. But Dingus fears that funding will dry up for women who need to travel to clinics for abortions. Right now, the DC Abortion Fund gives out about $3,800 to dozens of people per week to support costs associated with abortions – but Dingus isn’t sure how much longer the money will last.\n\n“What I see is going off the cliff in 2026, because we can only stretch those additional dollars for so long,” Dingus said.","summary":"Abortion was seen as one of Democrats’ strongest issues in the 2024 election –  new polls indicate that may be shifting\n\nUp to seven states will vote on abortion rights this year.

Gavin Newsom at a major Democratic Party summit, it appears to be game on in the next White House race. Even though the main campaign focus this year will be on the 2026 midterm elections and the battle for Congress, early moves are underway in the 2028 race to succeed term-limited President Donald Trump. The starting gun for the next presidential showdown won't be fired until after November's midterms. But that's not preventing the large field of potential White House contenders from making headlines. Vance, considered by many to be Trump's heir apparent to eventually take over the MAGA mantle, was endorsed last month by Erika Kirk at an annual summit hosted by Turning Point USA, the increasingly influential and politically powerful conservative group. VANCE AMPLIFIES HIS 2026 MESSAGE WHILE LANDING KEY 2028 BACKING Kirk, who took over the reins of Turning Point after her husband and conservative champion Charlie Kirk was assassinated in September, opened the conference by supporting Vance. \"We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,\" in 2028, she said. \"Forty-eight\" refers to the number of the next president. The backing of the vice president by Turning Point, which is particularly influential among younger conservatives and whose political arm has built up a powerful grassroot outreach operation, could give Vance a major boost should he decide to run for president in the 2028 election. SUCCEEDING TRUMP IN 2028: SIX REPUBLICANS TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON A longtime Trump adviser told Fox News Digital that \"it wasn’t a surprise to see her endorse, given that while he was still alive, Charlie couldn’t have been more explicit about supporting Vance in 2028.\" And the adviser, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, emphasized that Erika Kirk's backing \"reaffirmed that Turning Point’s entire political machinery will be behind him [Vance] if he decides to run. It’s another big get for the vice president and a warning shot to other potential candidates.\" While Vance is considered the clear Republican frontrunner at this extremely early point in the 2028 cycle, other GOP lawmakers appear to be laying down markers. Two Republicans who tangled with Trump during the party's contentious 2016 presidential primary — Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky — are increasingly voicing their differences with the president and his administration. Among the other Republicans to keep an eye on in the new year are Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who was battered by Trump and his allies during the 2024 GOP presidential primaries, Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Brian Kemp of Georgia, and possibly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who as a senator from Florida ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 nomination. Whether the Republicans have a competitive 2028 presidential primary will depend in part on the success of Trump's second term, whether the economy soars and how the GOP fares in next year's midterms. Regardless of those factors, as the part out of power, it's a sure bet the Democrats will have a wide open race for their party's presidential nomination. Harris, the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer after then-President Joe Biden exited the race, showcased an edgier stump speech as she railed against both major parties and the political status quo in an address at the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) winter meeting in December. And Newsom landed the red carpet treatment, as he mingled with delegates during the opening day of the DNC's confab, which was held this year in Los Angeles, home turf to both Harris and Newsom. DEMOCRATIC HEAVYWEIGHTS TURN HEADS, SPARK 2028 SPECULATION \"Obviously, we must focus on the midterms,\" Harris said in her speech. \"But Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms. And then after Trump. We need to answer the question. We need to answer the question: what comes next for our party and our democracy?\" Expect to see more of Harris in the new year helping Democrats from coast to coast as the party works to win back congressional majorities in the midterms. And Harris has added more 2026 stops to her book tour promoting \"107 Days,\" her reflections on her abbreviated 2024 presidential campaign. Among the stops is one in South Carolina, a crucial early-voting primary state in the Democratic Party's presidential nominating calendar. While Newsom didn't address the delegates at the DNC's general session, he was treated like a VIP as he held meetings and mingled with delegates during the opening day of the winter meeting. And Newsom met with the Democratic Party chairs from New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, and Nevada, another crucial early voting state. \"We had a great discussion on a wide range of issues,\" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told Fox News Digital. Newsom's stature in his own party has soared this year, thanks to his very vocal and visual pushback against the president, including his viral social media trolling of Trump and his successful California push to counter the Republican congressional redistricting effort. \"Newsom has shown an ability to stand up to Trump in a bold and highly effective manner without shying away from core democratic values,\" veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital. 21 DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 While both Newsom and Harris made a splash at the DNC winter meeting, they both have plenty of detractors who worry that neither would be electable in 2028 when the Democrats try to win back the White House. And if one or both of them launch presidential campaigns, they'll likely be joined by a large crowd of other contenders. One of those possible White House hopefuls is Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who was also making the rounds during the opening day of the DNC meeting. There are more than a dozen other Democrats thought to be potential 2028 White House contenders. And most of them have been paying visits to the early voting states, as well as parachuting onto the 2025 campaign trail. Among them are Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Wes Moore of Maryland and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan; Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut; progressive superstar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rep. Ro Khanna of California, another leading progressive; and two moderate Democrats, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and former White House chief of staff and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. With crucial midterm battles from coast to coast this year, expect to see much more of potential 2028 contenders out on the campaign trail in the months ahead.

Fool me twice, shame on me.” \n\nThis comes to mind reading reports of the mind-boggling welfare fraud megascandal that has been exposed in Minnesota. \n\nFor perspective on the scope of the scandal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson estimates fraud losses in Minnesota since 2018 could top $9 billion. \n\nWe’re talking about fraud in Medicaid, nutrition programs, government-funded housing programs, government programs to assist autistic children, etc. \n\nBeyond tracking down and indicting criminals, there are critically important lessons to be learned here for our country, and we must learn them. \n\nWhat do we learn about the connection between fraud and big government? What do we learn about fraud, big government and the Democratic Party? What lessons do we learn regarding our immigration policy? \n\nFraud and big government go hand in hand. \n\nA Government Accountability Office report in July notes over $300 billion of fraudulent payments in 19 pandemic-relief programs. \n\nLast May, CBS’ “60 Minutes” reported on vast fraud in federal spending programs. Per estimates of a woman who spent “a decade” at GAO, “I believe the government is losing between $550 billion and about $750 billion a year” in fraud. \n\nWhat’s the connection to the Democratic Party? Simple. Democrats are the party of big government. Every proposal coming out of the Democratic Party involves more government. More government programs, which means more fraud. \n\nAnd, of course, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, at the helm of his state while all this was happening, was the Democrat nominee in 2024 to be our vice president. He was introduced by Kamala Harris as her running mate, saying he’s “the kind of vice president that America needs.” \n\nThe Cato Institute issues a biannual Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors, grading all 50 governors on tax and spending policies. In the last report in 2024, number 50 out of 50 governors was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, scoring 19 points out of a possible 100. \n\nWhat is the lesson regarding immigration? \n\nThe Somali community in Minnesota disproportionately participated in this widespread fraud. \n\nInterviewing Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, CBS’ “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan noted that in COVID-19 fraud exceeding a billion dollars, “of 87 charged all but eight are of Somali descent.” \n\nOmar herself is Somali and a member of the far-left “squad” in Congress. \n\nNoting the disproportionate Somali presence in the scandal, President Donald Trump wrote on social media, “Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER.” \n\nThose calling Trump a racist miss the point. \n\nConsider the Corruption Perception Index published annually by Transparency International, an organization working to eliminate corruption around the globe. \n\nOut of 180 countries measured in the Transparency International Index, Somalia is the second most corrupt country in the world. \n\nWorth noting is the strong inverse relation of corruption with economic freedom. The most economically free countries—smaller government, less intrusive regulation, strong consistent rule of law—are also the least corrupt. \n\nIn the annual Fraser Institute Economic Freedom of the World Report, out of 165 countries measured and ranked in economic freedom, Somalia ranks 101. \n\nThe point is that the Somalis so prominent in the massive fraud in Minnesota come from a country with values and reality the total antithesis of what our country is about. It is a country with little economic freedom and widespread corruption. \n\nIf Somalis chose to come here to be free and responsible citizens, good for them and good for us. But it appears many have brought the destructive values of their home country with them. They should be screened. \n\nRep. Omar has been a perverse megaphone for anti-American sentiment since she arrived in Congress. \n\nSo, cut fraud by cutting back the scope of government, and shut our borders to those who do not aspire to our values of personal responsibility and freedom. \n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM \n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Nick Shirley, the independent conservative YouTuber who published a 42-minute documentary on the subject, has racked up 2.5 million views in just five days. Commentary on the various aspects of this scandal, from Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's culpability to Somali immigration and where the money went, has gone insanely viral on social media and YouTube, and cable news is now covering the subject relentlessly.\n\nShirley has received unending acclaim from conservative commentators—Vice President J.D. Vance implied his work was worthy of a Pulitzer Prize—and a neutral-to-hostile reception from the mainstream media. Outlets like CNN are working to poke holes in some of his specific claims, while acknowledging there is plenty of evidence of fraud throughout the state's welfare system.\n\nI watched Shirley's video, and I admit that it left me feeling conflicted. I'm perfectly comfortable with the fact that he's not a professional or credentialed journalist; journalism is not a priesthood, and anyone who seeks to report the truth can engage in the craft. Great works of investigative journalism have been achieved by amateurs. Consider Guan Heng, the former Chinese citizen who took it upon himself to document the communist government's atrocities in Uyghur detention camps. In visiting state-funded child care facilities to see if they're actually enrolling children, Shirley was doing something perfectly valid. Moreover, we all know there is a considerable amount of fraud in state services: Prosecutors have charged nearly 100 people, most of them members of the Somali diaspora, in connection with fake charity schemes, Medicare payments, and child care.\n\nCritics have countered that Shirley's methods lack rigor and have questioned whether he visited the daycares during their actual hours of operation. His video draws attention to the fact that the front doors of the daycares were locked and no one would let him in, but in an era of mass social panic over school shootings (which are thankfully rarer than most people understand), there is no daycare in the country that would permit a stranger to simply walk right in. Some local reporters have suggested that the reason Shirley didn't see any kids is because the centers in question had already closed down.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be a serious mistake to dismiss what Shirley found, and there's some genuine confusion over the state of the daycares. Tikki Brown, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families, explained that numerous childcare facilities had been investigated for serious safety issues, though they continued to receive public funding. One daycare that is featured significantly in Shirley's video, the Quality Learning Center, was permanently closed the week before he visited it, yet local television reporters spotted children still being dropped off at the center. Moreover, the fact that the name of the center is misspelled on the sign hanging above the door does not inspire great confidence. (Anyone want to enroll their child at the Quality Learing Center?)\n\nThis school, in particular, seemed beset with problems. One local report contended that the Quality Learning Center had accrued 95 violations over the course of five years for offenses such as failing to keep hazardous materials away from children and improperly keeping records on who was enrolled. Yet the center continued to receive millions in state funding during that time period.\n\nWhat's notable about that local news item, however, is that it was published almost a year ago, on January 28, 2025. As Reason's Eric Boehm pointed out in his excellent explainer on the welfare fraud story, conservative complaints that no one in the media paid any attention to the story until now are demonstrably false: Local media has been covering Minnesota child care fraud as far back as 2015.\n\nIt is true that the story did not become a topic of national news until conservative writer Christopher Rufo began focusing on it. Since then, however, some large media organizations have done commendable work on the story. The New York Times, for instance, published a devastating report on the fraud that laid the blame very squarely on Walz.\n\nEven so, the welfare fraud story has not exactly attracted wall-to-wall coverage from mainstream media, even though it is obvious that these kinds of schemes are hardly isolated to Minnesota or to the Somali community: Taxpayer dollars are misappropriated, lost, or stolen in blue states and in red states alike. Moreover, Walz's selection as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election was a perfect opportunity for the national media to follow up on the local fraud reports and make this a big story. For whatever reason, they chose not to.\n\nConservative media is big and powerful too, though. It's always a bit rich when we hear Republican commentators complaining that the mainstream media has failed to investigate one news story or another, when conservative and independent media journalists are perfectly capable of looking into this as well. To be sure, there are powerful examples of nonmainstream reporters doing incredible work on a wide variety of underscrutinized topics: Gabe Kaminsky, Matt Taibbi, Ken Klippenstein, and others. Sometimes, their work goes unremarked upon by mainstream media, even when it deserves coverage—and then, when it is covered, the mainstream adopts the \"Republicans pounce and or/seize\" framing.\n\nIf mainstream, establishment national media treated the widespread looting of the public coffers as an urgent crisis that deserved at least as much scrutiny as, say, President Donald Trump's renovation of the East Wing, this would constitute a profound public service. American taxpayers and news consumers deserve a media class that is highly attuned to government corruption at the federal, state, and local levels.\n\nA Walz Around the Welfare State\n\nFor what it's worth, Walz is doing an absolutely terrible job of reassuring the public that he actually cares about identifying and prosecuting fraud. It's all well and good to push back against attempts to blame the entire Somali community for perpetrating the fraud, but Walz has a weird habit of shifting accountability by highlighting the criminality of \"white men.\" If you assert that we should ignore crude racial collectivization and then immediately claim that actually white people are the real problem, you are not helping yourself.\n\nBut the worst take of the week relating to this story comes from Politico's Josh Gerstein, who wrote on X: \"At some point, the amateur effort to knock on doors of home daycares intersects with robust stand-your-ground laws.\"\n\nAt some point, the amateur effort to knock on doors of home daycares intersects with robust stand-your-ground laws\n— Josh Gerstein (@joshgerstein) December 30, 2025\n\nThese two things don't intersect at all. Stand-your-ground laws establish the right of individuals not to retreat from dangerous situations and instead defend themselves, as long as they have the legal right to be there in the first place. You can't shoot someone just because they knocked on your door; that's because knocking on someone's door isn't placing them in danger.\n\nAnd a special shoutout to leftist streamer Hasan Piker—who recently returned from a Jane Fonda-style propaganda tour of China—who opined that it was a crime to barge into a daycare with a camera.\n\nidk what kind of fraud somalis in daycares are doing but i think it's a separate crime to try and storm w a camera into a daycare w kids in it??\n— hasanabi (@hasanthehun) December 28, 2025\n\nPiker apparently didn't watch the video, either. Shirley knocked on the door: He did not break into the premises of the Quality Learning Center, or any other center.\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nNo Niall Stanage this week, but I am joined by Amber Duke to break down the welfare fraud story, Trump alienating Joe Rogan, and our top entertainment choices of the year.

Tim Walz, which began after conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley posted a 42-minute documentary alleging that Somali-Americans in Minneapolis had embezzled “upwards of $100 million” in state funds in a daycare scam.\n\nShe followed up with another post on the same platform shortly afterwards in which she reiterated: “Almost every Trump voter I see on X is so fed up they are planning a 2026 tax revolt. And rightfully so!\n\n“It’s because Americans work their asses off, barely make ends meet, and the government consistently gives their hard earned tax dollars to foreign countries, foreign wars, and foreigners the U.S. government has brought/allowed into America!

Meanwhile the government, NO MATTER WHICH PARTY IS IN CHARGE, screws over Americans. What will it take to put the American people first???”\n\nWhether Americans really will refuse to submit their income tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service en masse come Tax Day – Wednesday, April 15 – remains to be seen. Still, Greene appears correct in diagnosing widespread discontent on the right.\n\n“F*** it, I’m not paying taxes this year,” Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez wrote on X Tuesday.\n\n“And then when the IRS comes after me, I’ll blow that up into a huge national story about how the government will destroy your life over a couple thousand dollars meanwhile the Pentagon just failed their 8th straight audit in a row, Somalis literally come to the U.S. just to defraud us out of billions and illegals are prioritized for section 8 housing and welfare programs over Americans. I’m not paying for it anymore.”\n\nShe added in a follow-up: “I’m not even joking, I am fully supporting Americans not paying taxes this year or any other year until we see arrests made, funds being utilized properly and fraud being rooted out.”\n\nGreene approvingly reposted Hernandez’s remarks with the comment: “Now imagine if millions of Americans did this.”\n\nA number of other MAGA-aligned accounts have posted similar sentiments to Hernandez this week, including the Hodge Twins, Theo Von, and Rumble personality Graham Allen.\n\n“What are the feds gonna do if we all just stop paying taxes?” the Hodge Twins asked Monday.\n\n“What are we paying taxes for?” Von posted a day later.\n\n“THE WHOLE COUNTRY SHOULD STOP PAYING TAXES UNTIL THE CORRUPTION ENDS!!” Allen proposed in Trumpian all-caps. “HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS!!

There's hope for Trump's next year","text":"Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts — an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let’s take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar. First, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation’s capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos — wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage and more — the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: national sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests — not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex. That reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump’s law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says. Still, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which remains elusive. A durable peace — one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration — should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful — if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious — concessions. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration’s righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally “required” birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of noncitizens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet — granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally — is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress’s rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 — from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it — cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline — the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration. The burgeoning fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, including at businesses run by Somali Americans — astonishing in scale — has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris — who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate — know, and when did she know it? The Biden administration and the Walz administration began investigating these fraud allegations years ago, and the American people deserve answers to all these questions. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible and emboldening key regional allies — such as Japan — who share America’s interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump’s presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal. This past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more — a lot more — of that same success in this new year.
