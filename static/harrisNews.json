Her voice cracking and often falling to a whisper as she wiped away tears, Erika Kirk talked about her late husband's life, political beliefs and legacy.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring my husband, in such a profound and meaningful way. And thank you for making this event a priority,\" she said. “Your support of our family and the work that Charlie devoted his life to will be something I cherish forever.”\n\nThe ceremony coincided with what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday. It came about a month after the Turning Point USA founder was fatally shot while speaking to a crowd at Utah Valley University.\n\nIn a sign of Kirk's close ties to the administration, he was the first recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in Trump’s second term. The president also spoke at Kirk’s funeral in September, calling him a “great American hero” and “martyr” for freedom, while Vice President JD Vance accompanied his body home to Arizona on Air Force Two along with Erika Kirk.\n\n“We’re here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I’ve ever seen before, and an American patriot of the deepest conviction, the finest quality and the highest caliber,\" Trump said during the medal ceremony.\n\nOf Kirk's killing, the president said, “He was assassinated in the prime of his life for boldly speaking the truth, for living his faith and relentless fighting for a better and stronger America.\"\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom was established by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 for individuals making exceptional contributions “to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.”\n\nTrump returned to the U.S. in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday after a whirlwind trip to Israel and Egypt to celebrate a ceasefire agreement in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that his administration was instrumental in brokering. The president joked that he almost requested to reschedule the ceremony because of the trip.\n\n“I raced back halfway around the globe,\" Trump said. “I was going to call Erika and say, ‘Erika, could you maybe move it to Friday?' And I didn’t have the courage to call. But you know why I didn’t call? Because I heard today was Charlie’s birthday.”\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei, who had been visiting with the president at the White House earlier, stayed on to attend the ceremony.\n\nTrump has awarded a string of presidential medals going back to his first term, including to golf legend Tiger Woods, ex-football coach Lou Holtz and conservative economist Arthur Laffer as well as to Yankees Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, the latter of which came during the 2020 State of the Union. He awarded posthumous medals to Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley.\n\nThis term, Trump has also announced his intentions to award the medals to Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and a close former adviser, and to Ben Carson, who served as Trump's first-term secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nKirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 and Trump praised him as one of the key reasons he was reelected last year.\n\nBut Kirk's politics were also often divisive. He sharply criticized gay and transgender rights while inflaming racial tensions. Kirk also repeated Trump’s false claims that former Vice President Kamala Harris was responsible for policies that encouraged immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally and called George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a national debate over racial injustice, a “scumbag.”\n\nAs Tuesday's ceremony was underway, the Trump administration said it had revoked the visas of six foreigners who U.S. officials deemed had made derisive or mocking comments about Kirk’s assassination. The six who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa.\n\nThe move comes as the Trump administration and its supporters have zeroed in on people who made critical comments about Kirk, leading to firings and other discipline.\n\nTrump wrote in a social media post hours before it started that he was moving the ceremony from the White House’s East Room to the Rose Garden to accommodate a crowd he said would be “so big and enthusiastic.”\n\nTrump paved over the grass there and put in a patio area, and talked happily about the medal ceremony being one of the first major events in the new space. He noted how the weather had cleared up after it was expected to be raining, saying: “I was telling Erika, God was watching. And he didn’t want that for Charlie.”\n\nKirk’s widow said she asked their 3-year-old daughter what she might have given her father for his birthday, and she responded a stuffed animal and a cupcake while saying he hoped he'd get a birthday surprise. Erika Kirk said her husband was sometimes hard to buy presents for, but the medal was the perfect gift.\n\nErika Kirk said her husband might one day have run for president \"but not out of ambition. He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed from his servant’s heart.”\n\nShe said God began a “mighty work” through her husband, and she intends to see it through. She finished her remarks by saying Charlie’s story reminds us that “to live free is the greatest gift but to die free is the greatest victory.”","summary":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday posthumously awarded America's highest civilian honor to Charlie Kirk, the assassinated activist who inspired a generation of young conservatives and helped push the nation's politics further to the right.

His politics were often divisive, and Trump has cited Kirk as a major reason he was reelected, calling Kirk a “great American hero” while speaking at his funeral in September.\n\nThe government shutdown also entered its 14th day Tuesday, with the Senate returning from its holiday break, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson refusing to call lawmakers back to Washington and Trump’s budget director vowing to keep firing federal workers.\n\nDemocrats have focused on trying to keep Affordable Care Act subsidies from expiring for millions of Americans who purchase insurance on “Obamacare” exchanges. Without this federal support, costs are expected to soar across the health care economy. Johnson said he “won’t negotiate” unless Democrats first agree to reopen the government, losing their leverage for any deal.\n\nThe Latest:\n\n Florida judge temporarily blocks transfer of downtown Miami land for Trump’s presidential library \n\nThe move came after a Miami activist alleged that officials at a local college violated Florida’s open government law when they gifted the sizable plot of real estate to the state, which then voted to transfer it to the foundation for the planned presidential library.\n\nThe nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard, one real estate expert wagered that the parcel could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.\n\nMarvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed a lawsuit this month in a Miami-Dade County court against the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College, a state-run school that owned the property. He alleges that the board violated Florida’s Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land, and he’s seeking to block the land transfer.\n\n Hegseth letter last month says up to 1,000 Guard members to be in Memphis through September 2026 \n\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, it remains unclear how many National Guard troops are or will be in the city, where some armed Guard soldiers were spotted late last week beginning their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the iconic Pyramid. A slew of officers from other federal agencies have already been sent to Memphis through a Trump-created task force aimed at crime.\n\nAccording to a Sept. 23 letter from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to Gov. Bill Lee, the Department of Defense is prepared to authorize and fund up to 1,000 Guard personnel in Memphis through September 2026. The Associated Press obtained the letter through a public records request. The Daily Memphian previously reported on it.\n\nLee, a Republican, had said he didn’t expect many more than 150 Guard members in Memphis, but he has been loath to repeat the number, instead lately saying there is no estimate.\n\nU.S. Marshals Service Director Gadyaces S. Serralta said Tuesday that between 1,500 and 2,000 federal law enforcement agents who are part of the task force are in Memphis daily.\n\n State Department adviser charged with illegally retaining classified records \n\nAshley Tellis is accused by the Justice Department of printing out classified documents and storing more than 1,000 pages of highly sensitive government records in filing cabinets and trash bags at home.\n\nTellis was charged with the unlawful retention of national defense information after FBI agent searched his home over the weekend.\n\nHe was ordered detained Tuesday pending a detention hearing next week. One of his lawyers said they “look forward to the hearing, where we’ll be able to present evidence.”\n\nAn FBI affidavit alleges Tellis over the last month printed classified documents on topics including U.S. military aircraft capabilities. Surveillance video shows him on several occasions exiting the State Department and a Defense Department facility with a briefcase in which he was believed to have stashed the printed-out papers, according to court documents.\n\n▶ Read more about the charges against Tellis\n\n US revokes 6 visas over Charlie Kirk-related speech \n\nThe Trump administration has revoked the visas of six foreigners deemed by U.S. officials to have made derisive comments or made light of the assassination of Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe State Department says it had determined they should lose their visas after reviewing their social media posts and online clips about Kirk.\n\nThe announcement came as Trump was posthumously awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe administration and its supporters have targeted people for their comments about Kirk, leading to firings or other discipline of journalists, teachers and others, and raising free speech concerns.\n\nThe six people who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa. They were not identified.\n\n Erika Kirk says she intends to see her husband’s work through \n\nErika Kirk says God began a “mighty work” through her husband, Charlie, and she intends to see it through.\n\nIt’s a nod to her new role as head of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth voting advocacy group he started in 2012.\n\nShe finished her remarks by saying that Charlie Kirk’s story reminds us that “to live free is the greatest gift but to die free is the greatest victory.”\n\n“Happy birthday, my Charlie,” she said. “Happy freedom day.”\n\n Erika Kirk says her husband may have made a bid for the White House if he had lived \n\n“And if the moment had come, he probably would have run for president, but not out of ambition,” she said as she wrapped up her tribute to Charlie Kirk. “He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed.\n\n Venezuelan leader calls on press to combat US ‘lies’ \n\nFollowing the latest U.S. strike on a small boat accused of carrying drugs in international waters off Venezuela, Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela’s National Assembly and a close ally of President Nicolás Maduro, called on the press to combat U.S. “lies” that are being used to justify a possible invasion.\n\nThe government had convened foreign media and dozens of leaders of local media outlets for Rodríguez’s message Tuesday.\n\n“The objective is not the search for the truth and much less fighting drug trafficking,” Rodríguez said. It’s about “looking for the way to have an excuse for aggression.”\n\n“We’re not asking you to make up anything, but rather to defend the truth,” he said.\n\n Nation’s highest civilian honor is the best birthday gift, Erika Kirk says \n\nErika Kirk says the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the perfect birthday gift for Charlie.\n\nShe said after receiving the award on her husband’s behalf that she had spent years trying to find the best birthday gift for him. Charlie Kirk would have turned 32 on Tuesday.\n\nShe says he preferred quiet birthdays, but she can say with confidence that Trump has given him the best birthday present with the nation’s highest civilian honor.\n\n Trump presents award to Kirk’s widow \n\nAfter describing it as a “really big deal,” the president asked a military aide to read the citation. Erika Kirk wiped her eyes and Trump handed the medal to her.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring my husband in such a profound and meaningful way,” she said.\n\n Trump detours to appreciate the sound of sirens \n\nDuring remarks about public safety, Trump could hear sirens from somewhere nearby.\n\n“What a beautiful sound,” he said. “They’re stopping crime. That’s what they’re doing.”\n\nHe went on to describe them as “real deal sirens” and “not politically correct sirens.”\n\n Senate Democrats’ bill to halt US assistance for Argentina fails to quickly advance \n\nSenate Democrats were trying to quickly advance a bill that would prohibit $20 billion in assistance that Trump has promised to Argentina, but it failed to get the unanimous consent needed after a Republican objected to the legislation.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that overseas banking, argued that Trump was only promising the assistance to help Argentine President Javier Milei.\n\n“That’s Argentina First, not America First,” she said.\n\nThe chair of the Senate committee on banking, Sen. Tim Scott, objected to Warren’s attempt, saying that it would “impair Treasury’s ability to help an ally in South America.”\n\n CDC has lost nearly a quarter of its workforce this year, union estimates \n\nPublic health experts and others are still trying to determine the exact impact of the latest government layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But one union estimates that the Atlanta-based agency has lost roughly a quarter of its workforce so far this year.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees held a call with reporters Tuesday, in which it estimated that of the more than 13,000 CDC employees at the beginning of this year, more than 3,000 have left through layoffs, buyouts, retirements or other ways.\n\nAFGE officials were reacting to questions about more than 1,300 CDC received reduction-in-force notices that went out Friday — of which about 700 were late revoked in follow-up notices.\n\nGovernment officials attributed to chaos to a coding error, but have not responded to questions about how a mistake of that magnitude happened, and what CDC programs and staff are being eliminated in this latest round.\n\n Trump credits Kirk with boosting his comeback campaign \n\n“He helped make it happen,” the Republican president said. Without Kirk, “maybe you would have Kamala standing here today,” referring to former Vice President Kamala Harris who was his Democratic opponent last year. “That would not be good.”\n\n Trump attributes nice weather for Charlie Kirk event to God’s blessing \n\nTrump opened the ceremony for Charlie Kirk’s posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom by noting how beautiful the day was out in the Rose Garden.\n\nHe said that the weather was supposed to be terrible and rainy but instead it was sunny, allowing the event to be moved from indoors to outdoors.\n\n“I was telling Erika, God was watching,” Trump said of Kirk’s widow. “And he didn’t want that for Charlie.”\n\n Feds deploy tear gas in Chicago street after high-speed chase leads to crash \n\nA high-speed chase involving Border Patrol agents pursuing a suspect led to a crash Tuesday afternoon in a residential street on Chicago’s East Side, authorities said. Footage from the scene shows bystanders gathering before agents deployed a tear gas to disperse them.\n\nWhile Border Patrol agents conducted an immigration enforcement operation, DHS officials said a person suspected of being in the country illegally used a vehicle to ram into a Border Patrol vehicle before fleeing. The agents chased the suspect’s vehicle until the suspect stopped and attempted to run away on foot, according to DHS.\n\nAs agents arrested the suspect, a crowd began to form and “crowd control methods were used,” DHS officials said.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department confirmed that federal agents deployed tear gas into the street.\n\nFootage from ABC shows dozens of protesters waving flags as several federal agents and local police officers hold them back from the street. Border Patrol agents can be seen throwing tear gas cannisters into the crowd, enveloping the street in a white gas as protesters cough and run from the area.\n\n Trump says US may stop buying cooking oil from China as ‘retribution’ for soybean boycott \n\nIn a Truth Social post, he called Beijing’s decision not to buy U.S. soybeans “an Economically Hostile Act.”\n\nHe wrote that the U.S. can “easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves” and doesn’t need to buy it from China. China has been the biggest foreign buyer of American soybeans for many years but hasn’t bought any since May.\n\nThe post is the latest escalatory rhetoric after trade tensions flared up last week when Beijing imposed extra export rules on rare earths products. However, both sides also have made off-ramp remarks, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling Fox News on Monday that the leaders still plan to meet at the end of the month in South Korea.\n\n More Education Department workers laid off \n\nMore than 200 civil rights workers at the U.S. Education Department are being laid off after an appeals court cleared the way for their dismissal.\n\nAn appeals court last month reversed a lower court decision that blocked the March firings. Department officials cited the ruling in a layoff notice that was sent to Office for Civil Rights workers on Monday and obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nIt adds to more than 400 other layoffs the department announced last week as the Trump administration pressures Democratic lawmakers over the federal shutdown.\n\nA department spokesperson did not immediately comment.\n\nMass layoffs in March nearly halved the Education Department, but a federal judge halted the firing of about 260 Office for Civil Rights workers. Many were being brought back to the agency when an appeals court reversed the decision.\n\n Trump says some Democrat-backed programs won’t return after shutdown \n\nThe president says his administration is using the government shutdown to target federal programs that Democrats like and “they’re never going to come back, in many cases.”\n\n“We are closing up Democrat programs that we disagree with and they’re never going to open again,” he said.\n\nTrump added: “We’re being able to do things that we were unable to do before” during the shutdown, which he blames on Democrats. Democrats blame Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nTrump said officials will present a list of targeted programs on Friday.\n\nHe didn’t provide further details except to say his administration is seeking to terminate “some of the most egregious socialist – semi-communist” programs.\n\n Trump and Hegseth defend Pentagon’s news press policy \n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon press corps that has objected to the policy should have been “front and center across the board on wanting to give credit to the president” for his ceasefire deal in Gaza, but “Instead, what they want to talk about is a policy about them.”\n\nOutlets including The Associated Press, New York Times and Newsmax have refused to agree to the policy, saying it threatens to punish them for routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment.\n\nTrump said he thought the press is “very dishonest” and said he could see why Hegseth is “bothered” by the press access to the Pentagon.\n\n“It bothers me to have soldiers and, you know, even high-ranking generals walking around with you guys on their sleeve,” Trump said.\n\nTrump suggested he might move the White House press corps out of the building and said, “You’re lucky I’m president because we could move them very easily across the street.”\n\n Trump threatens to revoke Boston’s World Cup matches if authorities don’t get tougher on crime \n\n“We could take them away,” the president said of games in the city that he said were already sold out.\n\n“If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there’s unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who’s phenomenal -- and I would say, “Let’s move into another location” and they would do that.”\n\nTrump meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino. He said Infantino “wouldn’t love to do it, but he’d do it very easily.”\n\nThe president didn’t offer specifics, but suggested that crime threats were hurting Boston and that his administration could solve those.\n\nHe’s already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and Trump’s efforts to increase military presence in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights.\n\n Police protecting U.S. Capitol, Congress miss first full paycheck \n\nAs the government shutdown leaves many federal workers furloughed or working without pay, its impact is increasingly being felt in missed paychecks.\n\nThe union representing members of the U.S. Capitol Police — who protect the Capitol, members of Congress and their staff — said that on Friday, officers did not receive a full paycheck.\n\n“The longer the shutdown drags on, the harder it becomes for my officers,” said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the union. “Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass because we are in shutdown – they still expect to be paid.”\n\n Trump threatens to pull aid to Argentina based on election results \n\nTrump, seeming to refer to Argentina’s crucial midterm elections later this month that will be a referendum on Milei’s policies, said that “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.”\n\nIt’s not the first time this year Trump has sought to insert himself in the domestic affairs of another country to protect a leader seen as an ally.\n\nThe comments came a day after Trump, while speaking at the Knessett, called for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be pardoned in the corruption trial he faces. Trump branded the trial a “witch hunt,” a term he used for his own court cases while he was running for president last year.\n\nThe president also called the prosecution against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for attempting to overturn his 2022 election, a “witch hunt.” Trump then imposed 50% tariffs on the Latin American country and sanctioned its main justice in retaliation.\n\n Treasury secretary meets with Ukranian prime minister \n\nScott Bessent met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to reaffirm the U.S.’ “unwavering support for Ukrainian sovereignty.”\n\nA Treasury readout of the meeting states that Bessent stressed the need for European allies to ratchet up pressure on Russia, and any country that purchases Russian oil.\n\n Trump says he’s considering imposing tariffs on Spain \n\nHe said the move could come in retaliation for Spain now following other NATO members and increasing its military spending.\n\nTrump added that Spain is “doing very well off our backs.” He was referring to Spain being the sole member of the 32-nation alliance not to commit to increasing military spending to 5% of GDP.\n\nTrump said that geography ensures that Spain gets NATO protection “automatically” but that what the country had done was “very disrespectful to NATO.”\n\nTrump has previously suggested Spain should be expelled from NATO. He didn’t say that this time, but said of imposing possible tariffs, “I may do that” and that, “I think they should be punished.”\n\nThat’s despite Trump’s administration already having negotiated tariff rates with the European Union, which includes Spain.\n\n Trump tells Hamas to disarm and return dead hostages \n\nTrump says he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas if “they don’t disarm, we will disarm them.”\n\nThe U.S. president made the comment while speaking at the White House during Argentinian President Javier Milei’s visit.\n\nIt comes after an Israeli military agency declared a “violation” of the truce agreement that it would respond to by halving the number of trucks allowed to bring humanitarian aid into the devastated territory.\n\n Milei gives Trump gold-framed letter nominating him for Nobel Peace Prize \n\nThe glowing letter that the Argentine leader wrote expressed his “deepest admiration” for Trump and his “commitment to peace.”\n\nTrump has long sought a Nobel Peace Prize but suggested he may never be awarded it.\n\nTrump received nominations for the prize this year but many of them occurred after the February deadline for the 2025 award. That fell just a week and a half into his second term.\n\nForeign leaders who’ve sought close relations with the White House have suggested Trump should win the award or said they will nominate him.\n\n Trump explains why U.S. is helping out Argentina \n\nThe U.S. is establishing a $20 billion currency swap line to prop up the Argentine peso — and that assistance is to help a “great philosophy take over a great country,” Trump says.\n\n“Argentina is one of the most beautiful countries that I’ve ever seen,” Trump said.\n\nThe president also stressed that it was helping “our neighbors.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio added that Argentina was “foremost” among Latin American countries that have “aligned with the United States on issue after issue.”\n\n“I think this is important,” Trump said. “This is our hemisphere.”\n\n Trump and Milei begin their meeting \n\nThe two leaders are holding a working lunch in the Cabinet Room at the White House.\n\n“He’s MAGA all the way,” Trump said of the Argentine leader. It usually refers to Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” but in this instance, Trump was also using it to say “Make Argentina Great Again.”\n\nMilei, speaking in Spanish, said he was “very honored, especially in this moment when we are giving thanks for Trump’s great leadership.”\n\n“We can follow a peaceful route and make Argentina a strong example for freedom and prosperity,” Milei said.\n\n Trump confirms another US strike against boat in Caribbean \n\nHe said in a post on social media that six people were killed in the strike on the vessel suspected of carrying drugs off the waters of Venezuela. No U.S. forces were harmed.\n\nIt’s the fifth deadly strike in the Caribbean as the Trump administration has asserted that it is treating alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who must be met with military force.\n\nFrustration with the administration has been growing on Capitol Hill among members of both major political parties. Some Republicans are seeking more information from the White House on the legal justification and details of the strikes. Democrats contend the strikes violate U.S. and international law.\n\n▶ Read more about the latest strike.\n\n House Judiciary Committee seeks testimony from Jack Smith \n\nRepublicans on the House Judiciary Committee want the Justice Department special counsel who prosecuted Trump to appear for an interview.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the committee chair, charged in a letter to Smith that his team’s prosecutions of Trump were “partisan and politically motivated.” Jordan’s move shows how Republicans are escalating their tactics to go after Trump’s perceived enemies.\n\nSmith pursued two criminal cases against Trump -- for illegally holding classified documents and for interfering in the 2020 election -- but abandoned them after Trump won election last year.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has also conducted interviews with other members of Smith’s team, Jordan said, but they declined to answer many questions, citing the Fifth Amendment.\n\n Milei arrives at the White House \n\nThe Argentine leader was greeted warmly by Trump in the West Wing driveway shortly after 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe two men posed for photos, both giving a thumbs-up.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter for his message to Argentina, the U.S. president said: “We love them. We will be there for them.”\n\nTrump added, “and they have a great leader. They have a very great leader.”\n\n Argentina’s leader praises Trump before White House meeting \n\n“Your commitment to life, freedom and peace has restored hope to the world,” President Javier Milei wrote on social media, congratulating the U.S. president on securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza, where a truce is holding after a devastating, two-year Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe Trump-Milei bromance has already paid off for Argentina — most recently, to the tune of a $20 billion bailout.\n\nExperts say Milei comes to the White House with two clear objectives. One is to negotiate U.S. tariff exemptions or reductions for Argentine products.\n\n▶ Read more about the White House meeting.\n\n Trump takes note of slow return of dead hostages to Israel \n\n“ALL TWENTY HOSTAGES ARE BACK AND FEELING AS GOOD AS CAN BE EXPECTED. A big burden has been lifted, but the job IS NOT DONE,” Trump wrote in a posting on his Truth Social platform. “THE DEAD HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, AS PROMISED! Phase Two begins right NOW!!”\n\nHe made no mention in his post of Israel announcing earlier Tuesday that it would halve the flow of aid into the territory as a result of the slow return of the dead.\n\n Trump moves Kirk Medal of Freedom ceremony to Rose Garden \n\nThe president said in a post on social media that he’s moving the ceremony to posthumously honor Charlie Kirk outside at the White House, where he paved over the Rose Garden grass, because the crowd will be “so big and enthusiastic.”\n\nTrump said the new location will allow people to see the changes he’s made, such as the Presidential Walk of Fame where he hung portraits of the previous commanders-in-chief, along with renovations to the Palm Court.\n\nTrump’s post to the entire world also included instructions on how to enter the White House for the event: “Enter through Main South Entrance.”\n\n Some airports decline to show Noem’s video message on government shutdown \n\nAirports in Las Vegas, Charlotte, Phoenix and Westchester County say the Homeland Security secretary’s video goes against their policy or regulations because of its political content.\n\nIn the video, Noem blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown and its impacts on operations to screen travelers. The shutdown has left airports scrambling with flight disruptions.\n\n US rejects bid to buy 167 million tons of coal for less than a penny per ton \n\nThe bid’s price for the coal on public lands in Montana reflected the low appetite for coal among utilities turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar.\n\nIt would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade. But coal emissions are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is making weather more extreme. Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his energy agenda, but economists say he’s unlikely to reverse its decline.\n\nA Department of Interior statement Tuesday said the $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. didn’t meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act. Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it’s unclear if they will attempt another sale.\n\n Maine Gov. Mills to confront Trump again with US Senate campaign \n\nThe New England governor who told Trump to his face that she would see him in court now plans to challenge Maine’s Republican U.S. senator at the ballot box.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Janet Mills cited her White House confrontation in her Tuesday launch video. She told The Associated Press: “I’ll stand up to Trump, just as I did in February.”\n\nMills says she’s running for a broader resistance to Trump and to oust five-term Sen. Susan Collins, who voted for the tax breaks and spending cuts law that reduced food and health care aid for children and low-income Americans.\n\nOther challengers for the Democratic nomination include oyster farmer Graham Platner, who has the backing of Vermont Sen.

The rules, finalized last month and taking effect this week, require journalists to sign an acknowledgment outlining restrictions on gathering and publishing information in order to retain Pentagon press credentials.\n\nSecretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the new procedures on September 19, “The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon — the people do. The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.” His post linked to the Daily Wire’s exclusive story, which first reported the implementation of the updated guidelines.\n\nThe memo obtained by the Daily Wire explained that reporters holding a Pentagon Facilities Alternate Credential (PFAC) must sign an “in-brief form” acknowledging information security rules and escort requirements. The Pentagon Force Protection Agency will issue new PFACs marked “PRESS” in red, with distribution prioritized to resident media through September 30 and to visiting media beginning October 1. The memo directed personnel to ensure unescorted journalists remain only in designated zones and stated that violations could lead to credential revocation.\n\nHegseth first outlined the changes in a May 23 memo titled “Updated Physical Control Measures for Press/Media Access Within the Pentagon,” emphasizing national security and the protection of classified and sensitive information. The directive barred media from entering the Secretary of Defense’s offices and Joint Staff areas without an escort and prohibited access to the Pentagon Athletic Center. It required escorted access for interviews and indicated forthcoming updates to press credentials and in-brief procedures.\n\nOn September 24, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell posted on X: “It should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon’s press procedures. Let’s be absolutely clear: journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. This claim is a lie,” he said, before explaining the new rules. “Have an escort in sensitive areas. Wear a press credential. Don’t encourage our people to violate DoW policy. Pretty simple.” Parnell attached a letter sent to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press clarifying that the new in-brief does not require preapproval of reporting and that First Amendment protections remain intact.\n\nThe letter, dated September 24 and signed by Parnell, clarified that the in-brief form “does not impose restrictions on journalistic activities, such as investigating, reporting, or publishing stories—rights unequivocally protected by the First Amendment.” It added that credential holders are simply informed of access protocols and potential reasons for credential revocation related to security risks, emphasizing that publication of unauthorized material alone would not normally result in disciplinary action.\n\nDespite these assurances, widespread resistance continued from the press corps. In statements published October 13, multiple outlets announced they would not sign the policy.\n\nWashington Post executive editor Matt Murray remarked:\n\nJournalists from The Washington Post will not be signing the Pentagon’s new press access policy. The proposed restrictions undercut First Amendment protections by placing unnecessary constraints on gathering and publishing information. We will continue to vigorously and fairly report on the policies and positions of the Pentagon and officials across the government.\n\nThe Atlantic’s editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg issued a similar statement:\n\nThe Atlantic’s journalists will not sign the Pentagon’s press policy. We fundamentally oppose the restrictions that the Trump administration is imposing on journalists who are reporting on matters of defense and national security. The requirements violate our First Amendment rights, and the rights of Americans who seek to know how taxpayer-funded military resources and personnel are being deployed.\n\nNew York Times Washington bureau chief Richard Stevenson wrote:\n\nJournalists from The New York Times will not sign the Pentagon’s revised press pass policy, which threatens to punish them for ordinary news gathering protected by the First Amendment. Since the policy was first introduced, we have expressed concerns that it constrains how journalists can report on the U.S. military, which is funded by nearly $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars annually. The public has a right to know how the government and military are operating.\n\nHegseth responded on X on October 13, quote-tweeting statements from those outlets with a waving-hand emoji as they declared they would not sign.\n\nIn the afternoon on the same day, Hegseth summarized the new policy in another post, writing, “Pentagon access is a privilege, not a right. So, here is @DeptofWar press credentialing FOR DUMMIES: Press no longer roams free. Press must wear visible badge. Credentialed press no longer permitted to solicit criminal acts. DONE. Pentagon now has same rules as every U.S military installation.”\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) replied, quote-tweeting Hegseth’s post with the remark: “NO FREE SPEECH, NO FREE PRESS IF YOU HURT POOR PETEY’S FEELINGS!!” Musician and PragerU influencer Alexis Wilkins responded to Newsom’s comment, writing, “I need it explained to me like I’m 5 why saying press cannot roam freely around the Pentagon is being treated like a free speech infringement ‍♀️.” \n\nConservative commentator Gunther Eagleman also responded, saying, “Says the guy who outlawed political parody.” He was referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signing of two laws, AB 2655 and AB 2839, which were enacted after Elon Musk shared a spoof campaign ad mocking then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. As Breitbart News reported at the time, the measures sought to restrict so-called “deepfake” videos of politicians. However, as of September 2025, a federal judge has thrown out both laws, ruling that they amounted to an unconstitutional form of censorship.\n\nThe Pentagon Press Association said that the policy “gags Pentagon employees and threatens retaliation against reporters who seek out information that has not been pre-approved for release.” The association claimed that “potential expulsion from the Pentagon should be a concern to all.”\n\nOutlets refusing to sign the Pentagon’s new press access policy:\n\nThe Washington Post\nThe New York Times\nThe Atlantic\n\nThe Guardian\n\nThe Associated Press\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nBreaking Defense\nThe Washington Times\n\nOutlet agreeing to sign:\n\nOne America News Network (OAN)\n\nAn October 14 opinion by NPR’s Tom Bowman detailed the decision to turn in his credentials, writing that signing the new form “would make us stenographers parroting press releases, not watchdogs holding government officials accountable.” Bowman described his nearly three decades of Pentagon reporting and expressed concern that the new rules would restrict journalists’ ability to obtain and report truthful information about U.S. military operations.","summary":"Journalists from across the political spectrum face a 5:00 p.m. Tuesday deadline to sign the Department of War’s new Pentagon access agreement or surrender their credentials.\n\n\nThe post &#8216;Pentagon Access Is a Privilege, Not a Right&#8217;: Hegseth Draws the Line as Media Refuse to Sign appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/14/pentagon-access-is-privilege-not-right-hegseth-draws-line-as-media-refuse-sign/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/Pete-Hegseth-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 21:05:25","author":"Jasmyn Jordan","authors":["Jasmyn Jordan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.169},{"id":369259876,"title":"Alyssa Farah Griffin Fails To Keep Her Promise Of Wearing MAGA Hat After Trump’s Success In Middle East","text":"“The View” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin on Monday and Tuesday did not keep her promise of wearing a MAGA hat on-air if President Donald Trump successfully got all of the Israeli hostages in Gaza released.\n\nDuring a Dec. 9, 2024, segment, Griffin vowed to wear the MAGA hat on the program and thank Trump for making that achievement.

We are entering his name forever into the eternal roster of true American heroes. He’s a true American hero.\" \n\nThe president later drew laughs from the crowd when he recalled Kirk working on his first presidential campaign in 2016. He noted the young activist \"liked him\" a lot, adding: \"I have no idea why. What the hell was he thinking?\"Trump also recognized Erika and acknowledged the \"unspeakable hardship\" the mother-of-two has endured since her husband was killed in September. \n\nThe president's infamous \"weave\" was on full display as he rambled off his administration's accomplishments and even took at dig at ex-Vice President Kamala Harris in between highlighting Kirk's work. \n\nAt one point, Trump noted how he had to race back to Washington D.C. after signing the Israeli-Hamas peace deal and confessed he almost asked Erika if she wouldn't mind pushing back the ceremony, but decided against it after finding out it was Kirk's birthday.This is a developing story.

There is none evident here. How can he tell voters he has the comportment to govern?\n\nAnd how hard is it for Virginia Democrats to demand that he face consequences for his behavior? Where are Sens.

He stayed, defying all of the pressure.\n\nAt the time, Warner and Kaine said in a joint statement, “We no longer believe he can effectively serve as the governor of Virginia and that he must resign.”\n\nSo did every major national Democrat, from Kamala Harris to former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to Joe Biden. Yet there is no call for Jones to exit the race.\n\nPerhaps it is because Democrats know it is too late to replace him on the ballot. Early voting has already started, and perhaps they don’t want the Republicans to score a win in the off-year cycle. Or, perhaps, and this is the worst possible scenario, the Democrats are secretly OK with what Jones texted.\n\nJones has a host of other problems as well. He was stopped by law enforcement in 2022 for going 116 mph in a 70-mph zone, an infraction that could have resulted in jail time for reckless driving. Instead, his lawyer and the commonwealth’s attorney worked out a deal by which Jones was only required to do 1,000 hours of community service, the bulk of which was performed by Jones for his own political action committee in lieu of jail time.\n\nVirginia Democrats come across looking as though murder and gaming the system are not issues that deserve consequences. They aren’t going to stick their necks out to make Jones leave the race.\n\nThis story has totally blown up the race. However, the lingering question remains about the mindset of the Virginia Democrats, and indeed the mindset of national Democrats.","summary":"“The stakes couldn’t be higher,”&#160;Jay Jones, the Virginia Democrat running for state attorney general, said Monday in an X post.

Eric posted a video from a bookstore in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, inviting people to pick up signed copies of his book. “Bunch of signed books here, first come first serve,” he said. “Come over to Barnes and Noble, Palm Beach Gardens, a bunch of signed books.”Social media users were quick to notice that the store appeared empty. Netizens started mocking the turnout, with one user commenting, “Looks empty,” and another saying, “No one has been waiting for you.” One quipped, “You couldn’t write a postcard, buddy,” while another added, “Your family had Gaza under siege and now you have our rights and freedoms under siege.

Trump alleged that Griffin sent him letters praising him before joining “The View,” though it has not been confirmed as to whether or not she sent him any letters.\n\n“I’ll tell you about Alyssa. She worked here, she gave me the most beautiful letter when the time came up, the election was rigged, I left. She gave me the most beautiful letter you’ve ever seen. I was ‘a great president. What a great job,'” Trump said. “Some of the letters have been quoted, this is Alyssa, who I never thought was very outstanding. I figured she would not make it. And she didn’t have a big role here either. And then we had January 6 and she left after that or before that. But she gave me the most beautiful letters. And even the months after she left and while we weren’t here any longer, she sent other letters. [A] glowing letter, [a] beautiful letter. And then she got hired by The View and they gave her a couple of bucks and she changed her view very quickly.”\n\n“I never thought she would make it. I never thought she had what it took in any way. But she’s on The View. But it just shows what a fraud The View is,” Trump continued.

The hostages’ freedom is part of the first phase of Trump’s peace agreement, along with the withdrawal of Israeli troops to a designated line.\n\nFollowing the peace deal, Griffin stated that Trump and the administration deserve “tremendous credit” for the achievement.\n\nGriffin worked as a press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence and as a special assistant to Trump from October 2017 to September 2019. She then served as a press secretary for the Department of Defense. After leaving the administration in 2021, she joined “The View” and became a harsh critic of her former boss.\n\nGriffin did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\n“The View” co-host warned on several occasions that Trump was “wholly unfit” to be president and stated on the program that she voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the previous election.

Because I heard today was Charlie’s birthday.”\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei, who had been visiting with the president at the White House earlier, stayed on to attend the ceremony.\n\nTrump has awarded a string of presidential medals going back to his first term, including to golf legend Tiger Woods, ex-football coach Lou Holtz and conservative economist Arthur Laffer as well as to Yankees Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, the latter of which came during the 2020 State of the Union. He awarded posthumous medals to Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley.\n\nThis term, Trump has also announced his intentions to award the medals to Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and a close former adviser, and to Ben Carson, who served as Trump’s first-term secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nKirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 and Trump praised him as one of the key reasons he was reelected last year.\n\nBut Kirk’s politics were also often divisive. He sharply criticized gay and transgender rights while inflaming racial tensions. Kirk also repeated Trump’s false claims that former Vice President Kamala Harris was responsible for policies that encouraged immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally and called George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a national debate over racial injustice, a “scumbag.”\n\nAs Tuesday’s ceremony was underway, the Trump administration said it had revoked the visas of six foreigners who U.S. officials deemed had made derisive or mocking comments about Kirk’s assassination. The six who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa.\n\nThe move comes as the Trump administration and its supporters have zeroed in on people who made critical comments about Kirk, leading to firings and other discipline.\n\nTrump wrote in a social media post hours before it started that he was moving the ceremony from the White House’s East Room to the Rose Garden to accommodate a crowd he said would be “so big and enthusiastic.”\n\nTrump paved over the grass there and put in a patio area, and talked happily about the medal ceremony being one of the first major events in the new space. He noted how the weather had cleared up after it was expected to be raining, saying: “I was telling Erika, God was watching. And he didn’t want that for Charlie.”\n\nKirk’s widow said she asked their 3-year-old daughter what she might have given her father for his birthday, and she responded a stuffed animal and a cupcake while saying he hoped he’d get a birthday surprise. Erika Kirk said her husband was sometimes hard to buy presents for, but the medal was the perfect gift.\n\nErika Kirk said her husband might one day have run for president “but not out of ambition. He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed from his servant’s heart.”\n\nShe said God began a “mighty work” through her husband, and she intends to see it through. She finished her remarks by saying Charlie’s story reminds us that “to live free is the greatest gift but to die free is the greatest victory.”\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Kirk’s widow’s name is Erika, not Erica.\n\nAssociated Press writers Michelle L. Price and Matthew Lee contributed to this report.","summary":"The assassinated activist inspired a generation of young conservatives.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/10/14/charlie-kirk-presidential-medal-of-freedom/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287767130223.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 18:41:28","author":"Gqlshare,The Associated Press","authors":["Gqlshare","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.432},{"id":369223492,"title":"Obama Dooms Rising Democrat Star","text":"If there’s one kind of male that gets Barack Obama extremely jazzed up, it is a baby-faced white man who believes he can flip a Senate seat in Texas blue.\n\nWhen Beto O’Rourke, then a ‘rising star‘ of the Democratic Party, lost his Senate race to incumbent Ted Cruz in 2018, Obama still believed he was the future — that is, 2020 presidential material. Perhaps it was because the former president saw in Beto a self-aggrandizing, narcissistic personality not unlike his own. After the loss, he called Beto an “impressive young man” and compared him to … himself. ObamaWorld was equally as smitten. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\n“What I liked most about [O’Rourke’s] race was that it didn’t feel constantly poll-tested,” Obama said at the time. “It felt as if he based his statements and his positions on what he believed. And that, you’d like to think, is normally how things work. Sadly it’s not … The reason I was able to make a connection with a sizeable portion of the country was because people had a sense that I said what I meant. And that’s a quality that, as I look at what I’m sure will be a strong field of candidates in 2020.”\n\nO’Rourke has since crashed out. Once the darling of liberal media, his influence within the party has waned. He lost his bid for Texas governor in 2022 to Greg Abbott by nearly 1 million votes. Although he has found a new career running the Soros-backed Powered by People PAC, his chances at ever holding political office again are slim to none. He certainly never lived up to the absurd RFK and JFK comparisons.\n\nIn his early assessment of Beto, Obama was wrong. But not to worry. The media has long moved on from Beto, and so has Obama. The former president now has his eyes on a new man with aspirations to flip Texas blue.\n\nJames Talarico, a little-known 36-year-old Texas state lawmaker, sat down with Joe Rogan for a podcast in July. At one point in their conversation, Rogan told him that he must run for president someday.\n\n“We need someone that’s actually a good person,” Rogan said.\n\nLiberal outlet Politico was googly-eyed and later interviewed Talarico, noting that he was an aspiring preacher who had a large TikTok fanbase. In other words, he might be the perfect Democratic candidate who could win over rural conservative Christians and flip a Senate seat held by Republicans since 1990. Social media clout? Check. A Christian? Check. A Christian who believes God is “non-binary“? Oh baby. Talarico is running for four-term incumbent John Cornyn’s Senate seat in 2026.\n\nLo and behold, Obama has leaped onto the media’s bandwagon, as he did with Beto. In a podcast interview published Monday, Obama came very close to announcing a full-on bromance with Talarico. The praise was also strikingly similar to his Beto endorsement as he argued that Talarico is a man of conviction and moral compass who believes in what he is preaching.\n\n .@BarackObama: There’s this young state rep, James Talarico… He’s terrific. Really talented young man. @marcmaron: There is something grounded about him that you had too. Obama: A guy like him, his starting point is ‘Let me say what I believe.’ pic.twitter.com/p2oTqIRv7N — Team Talarico (@TeamTalaricoHQ) October 13, 2025\n\n“He’s terrific, a really talented young man,” Obama said.\n\nObama went on to say, “First of all, if you understand your convictions, you’ve got a moral compass, you’ve got a code, you’ve spent time wrestling with what it is that you care about and what you believe, then it’s a lot easier now to be open and actually listen to other people as opposed to constantly trying to beat off anybody who might contradict your current perspective. And I think a guy like [Talarico], his starting point is, let me say what I believe.”\n\nSurprisingly, the former president stopped short of comparing Talarico to himself.\n\nTalarico may end up squaring off against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has launched a primary challenge, rather than Cornyn. Although he is a dream candidate for coastal progressives, Talarico’s views on God, sexuality, and transgender athletes may come back to haunt him.\n\nIn a 2021 hearing, Talarico said that “modern science obviously recognizes that there are many more than two biological sexes. In fact, there are six.” He also opposed popular Texas legislation that restricted biological men competing in girl’s sports. “Some things are more important than perfectly fair competition in sports,” he argued during debate on the bill.\n\nThese views may fly in Austin, with its population of California transplants, but not rural Texas.\n\nThe Obama Curse?\n\nObama has a rather poor history when it comes to endorsing major candidates. Famously, he snubbed his vice president, Joe Biden, in 2016, endorsing Hillary Clinton instead. When it came time to endorse Biden in 2020, Obama held out for as long as possible, and didn’t announce until after Bernie Sanders threw in the towel and endorsed Biden. He endorsed Kamala Harris (not that he had a choice), but his support and rally appearances did not seem to have much of an effect. And, of course, Obama was a Beto backer in 2018.\n\nTalarico may get lucky if Paxton defeats Cornyn in the primary. Paxton has a fair share of baggage — enough, in my view, to sway moderate Republicans and independents. But if Talarico manages to escape the Obama curse and see his star rise to Washington, D.C., it won’t be because of Obama’s endorsement — it will be in spite of it.\n\nThese days, Obama does not have as much sway within the Democratic Party as he did in years past. Starved for attention and longing for the time when he was the unequivocal leader, Obama keeps stepping into the limelight to remain relevant. It’s a “humiliation ritual.” He should get out before it gets worse. (RELATED: Barack Obama’s Humiliation Ritual Keeps Getting Worse)\n\nMaybe Obama can take up painting in retirement, like his predecessor, George W. Bush. Instead of painting soldiers with PTSD, he can paint portraits of himself.","summary":"What do you think?","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/14/barack-obama-james-talarico-texas-senate-race-beto-orourke/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F10%2FMixCollage-14-Oct-2025-01-28-PM-4615-scaled-e1760463086431.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 18:11:19","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.054},{"id":369215828,"title":"Meghan Markle shares cryptic message on the future of Netflix programme","text":"Meghan Markle has spoken about the future of her Netflix programme, With Love, Meghan, at Fortune's annual Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington DC. The Duchess of Sussex is spoke on a panel at the event with Fortune’s editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell, where Shontell quizzed Meghan on a potential third season of the lifestyle programme. Season two of the show, which aired in late August, was widely panned by critics after its release, with many publications only giving the show a two-star rating. Now, Meghan has issued a cryptic response when asked if a third season could be coming to the streaming service. When asked by Shontell if a follow up season could be in the works, Meghan seemed to dodge the question and not give a straight answer, instead opting to talk about her upcoming holiday special, which she announced would be airing in November. Meghan said: \"So I think looking at that format — again, it's a year of learns — so we're able to say, 'Eight episodes for two seasons — it's a lot of work'.\" \"And having done Suits for seven years, I remember what goes into a production. I also recognize how much people want content in different sizes. Part of what we're testing out now is, it's amazing to sit and watch a show for 30 minutes, but how can I give you a recipe in two minutes? And where can I share that with you? And how that continues to grow As Ever.\" Meghan teased that the holiday special would include gift wrapping techniques, as she used to teach \"advanced gift wrapping\" between acting auditions. Meghan also spoke about the new deal she and Prince Harry signed with Netflix , saying the deal gives them \"flexibility\" to pitch their content elsewhere if it's \"not the right fit\". She said: \"My husband and I were in an overall deal with Netflix [...] and then the extension of it which was such an incredible sign of the strength of our partnership was now being in a first look deal, which is also exciting because it gives us flexibility to go to our partners first, and then at the same time be able to shop content that might not be the right fit for Netflix but has a home somewhere else.\" The anticipated second season of Meghan's show, which follows the widely-panned first season that premiered earlier this year, and saw Meghan share cooking, crafting, and hosting tips with a range of celebrity pals and experts. And after just hours of its premiere, was savaged by critics who deemed it everything from \"needy\" to \"narcissistic\". According to People magazine , the three-day summit in Washington will also feature talks by former Vice President Kamala Harris on her presidential campaign and recently released book; Selena Gomez on her Rare Beauty brand; Kara Lawson on coaching the USA Women's Basketball Team and Brené Brown on team leadership and company culture, amongst others. It comes after a whirlwind few weeks for the duchess. She made a surprise appearance at Paris Fashion Week last Saturday before heading to New York City, where she and Harry received an award last night. The couple, co-founders of the Archewell Foundation, received the Project Healthy Minds' Humanitarians of the Year Award in recognition of their campaigns to make the online world a safer place for families and young people. Accepting the award, Meghan spoke candidly of her two children and their futures, saying: \"Our children, Archie and Lili, are just six and four years old. Luckily still too young for social media, but we know that day is coming.”","summary":"The Duchess of Sussex has travelled to Washington DC for the Fortune's annual Most Powerful Women Summit, where she discussed if her lifestyle show will be renewed for a third season","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/meghan-markle-shares-cryptic-message-36067342","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36068901.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Screenshot-2025-10-14-at-172115JPG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 17:21:26","author":"Charlotte Foster","authors":["Charlotte Foster"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.2},{"id":369214470,"title":"The Lowly Stay Takes Center Stage","text":"SCOTUS' \"stay jurisprudence\" – the standards the Court uses to decide, inter alia, whether or not, during the weeks and months and sometimes years that are required before a final judgment is issued in any case, Executive Branch officials must obey the injunctions that have been entered against them – is of growing importance these days.\n\nIt's becoming increasingly clear – I'd call it obvious, even - that the lowly stay, heretofore a rather pedestrian and deeply unspectacular procedural device, is a central pillar of the President's strategy for dismantling statutory and constitutional constraints on executive power.\n\nHere's how it works. The pattern is mind-numbingly familiar by now, having been repeated in dozens and dozens – probably hundreds, by now – of cases[1]:\n\n1 The President issues an Executive Order, authorizing and directing his subordinates in the Executive Branch to do something (or to stop doing something that they had previously been doing).\n\nNobody connected to the Oval Office appears to spend much time worrying about whether the action complies with constitutional and statutory requirements,[2] or whether the President is authorized to do what he wants to do; he orders it done, and his subordinates start the process of getting it done. Rescind Harvard's federal grants. Close down US AID. Revoke the security clearances of everyone working at WilmerHale. Deport Venezuelan migrants. Close down the National Science Foundation. Impose a travel ban on 19 countries. Raise tariffs on Vietnamese textile imports. Lower tariffs on Vietnamese textile imports. Etc.\n\n2 Lawsuits challenging the action assert that it violates some constitutional or statutory provision, or is otherwise beyond the power of the President to accomplish unilaterally through an Executive Order.\n\n3 The challengers seek immediate, temporary relief, in the form [first] of a Temporary Restraining Order and [immediately thereafter] a Preliminary Injunction, ordering the Administration to cease whatever it was that it was doing (or had plans to do) while the case is being heard.\n\nTo obtain a P.I., the challengers must, of course, persuade the trial court, inter alia, that (a) they are \"reasonably likely\" to prevail on the merits (once the case reaches a final judgment), and that (b) they will suffer \"irreparable harm\" if the interim relief is not granted.\n\n4 The Administration raises many objections – most of them procedural - to the motion for a P.I. \n\nAs it has, of course, every right to do: Standing, mootness, ripeness, justiciability, sovereign immunity, jurisdiction, the \"political question\" doctrine, etc.\n\n5 But in the end, the court grants plaintiffs' requested relief.\n\nNot always! But the Administration has lost and continues to lose an enormous and an alarming number of these cases at this preliminary stage[3] - \"enormous\" in comparison to any other presidency in US history,[4] and \"alarming\" because these are, after all, cases in which a federal judge (and often more than one federal judge) has said: \"It is likely – at least on my first look at the case - that the Administration is breaking the law.\"[5]\n\n The Administration immediately seeks a stay of the judgment and the order for an injunction. And, increasingly often:\n\n7 The Supreme Court grants the Administration's emergency application for a stay of the lower court's order. \n\nAgain, not always. But it has happened a lot, including in some of the highest-profile challenges to Administration action.[6]\n\nObtaining a stay means, as both a practical and a legal matter, that the Administration may disregard the injunction entirely – i.e., it can do pretty much whatever it wants – until a final judgment has been reached and all avenues of appeal have been exhausted. These cases take a great deal of time to litigate to final judgment – months at a minimum, often years – even in the best of circumstances[7]; when the entry of a stay gives one of the parties such an obvious incentive to use every device imaginable to delay the proceeding as much as humanly possible - because it gets to do pretty much whatever it wants, lawful or not, in the interim – it can stretch out for years.\n\nHence the importance of the Court's rules regarding stays. If we are ever unfortunate enough to have a Chief Executive who would like total, one-man control over everything the federal government does or doesn't do, one who acts on dozens of different fronts simultaneously as though there were no legal or constitutional constraints on his power, a Court that was too generous with its stay-granting power would play right into that authoritarian-wannabe's hands.\n\nOf course, the President will, ultimately, prevail in some, perhaps even many, of those cases. He will also lose in many; I am quite confident that the highest Court will find that he cannot unilaterally revoke birthright citizenship, that he cannot unilaterally set tariff rates, that he cannot unilaterally order federal troops into our cities to quell civic unrest or \"fight crime,\" that he cannot order ICE agents to round up anyone who looks Hispanic and poor and take them downtown for questioning, he cannot unilaterally turn over the information in the Social Security Administration databases to his friends and political supporters, that he cannot unilaterally revoke all of a university's federal contracts because he doesn't approve of their DEI policies, etc.\n\nBut because the Court has granted the Administration's request for a stay of the lower court injunctions regarding each of these matters, he can do all of those things. And more. At least, for a good long while.\n\nSo perhaps I was wrong when I wrote that the President and his legal advisers give no thought whatsoever to the legality or illegality of the President's actions. Maybe they are cleverer than I give them credit for; maybe they understand more than I do about how the process works, and the Oval Office conversation has actually been going like this:\n\nPresident to Legal Advisor: \"I want to deny all federal disaster assistance to states that voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. Write me up an Executive Order to that effect.\"\nLegal Advisor: \"Um, Mr. President, I don't think you can do that.\"\nP: \"No? What'll happen if I do it?\"\nLA: \"The courts will surely tell you to stop.\"\nP: \"How long will that take?\"\nLA: \"Probably just a few days to slap you with an injunction – you really don't have a very good case, I'm afraid. However, ….\"\nP: \"'However' what?\"\nLA: \"Well, If we can get a stay of the injunction – and the Supreme Court's been pretty generous in handing those out - we can probably stretch it so that you can do it for a year or two.\"\nP: \"Now you're talkin'! Do it.\"\n\nSo we really do need to understand how the Court decides whether or not to grant a stay in cases in which the Administration is acting – or at least appears, at first glance, to a federal district judge and possibly to an Appeals Court panel as well, to be acting – unlawfully, if we want to understand whether and how our constitutional system can withstand this kind of assault by some dictator-wannabe.\n\nIt's a little hard to say how the Court is deciding these stay cases, given the custom that has arisen whereby the Court rarely reveals its reasoning when deciding cases on its \"emergency docket.\"[8]\n\nHere, though, is the standard formulation of the \"familiar rules that govern stay applications,\" taken from an opinion by Justice Gorsuch, concurring in a case granting the State of Idaho a stay last term (Labrador v. Poe, 2024):\n\n\"This Court, like every other federal court, is guided by the same 'sound principles.' Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434 (2009). We ask (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) whether it will suffer irreparable injury without a stay, (3) whether the stay will substantially injure other parties interested in the proceedings, and (4) where the public interest lies. Nken, 556 U. S., at 434.\n\nNotice that the Court does not ask whether the stay applicant is \"likely to succeed on the merits\"; it asks whether the stay applicant has made a \"strong showing\" that it is likely to succeed on the merits.\n\nThat strikes me as a pretty significant difference. And one that actually matters, too. Here's why:\n\nIn any contest or experiment with two possible outcomes – e.g., plaintiff wins/defendant wins, petitioner wins/respondent wins, Brewers win/ Dodgers win, the stock market goes up/the stock market goes down, it will rain tomorrow/ it will not rain tomorrow, etc. – an outcome is \"likely to occur\" only if it has a probability of occurrence that is greater than 50%.[9]\n\nThat means that the other outcome has a probability of occurrence that is less than 50%.[10]\n\nAnd that means that only one of the two possible outcomes can be \"likely\" to occur. If plaintiff is likely to prevail, the defendant is not likely to prevail (and vice versa). They're mutually exclusive categories; the plaintiff and the defendant cannot both be likely to prevail, just as it cannot be likely to rain tomorrow and likely not to rain tomorrow, or that the Brewers and the Dodgers are both likely to win tonight's game.\n\n\"Strong showings,\" though, aren't like that; they're not mutually exclusive outcomes in this way. Anyone who has ever attended a high school debate tournament (or a Supreme Court oral argument) knows that both sides in a 2-person contest can make a \"strong showing that they're likely to prevail.\" Happens all the time.\n\nSo in this sense, the \"strong showing\" requirement is a lower bar, easier to satisfy, than the \"likely to prevail\" requirement. There's nothing illogical about the position both that the Administration has made a strong showing that it should prevail, and that the challengers are likely to prevail (because they have made a stronger showing that they should prevail).\n\nPersuading a court that you have made a \"strong showing\" that you are likely to prevail on the merits does not require you to persuade the court that you have a greater than 50% chance of winning. As a logical matter, persuading a court that you're \"likely to win\" is equivalent to persuading a court that the other side is \"likely to lose.\" But persuading a court that you've made a \"strong showing\" that you're likely to prevail does not require you to show that the other side is likely to lose; it is perfectly logical to hold the position that the Administration, though it has made a \"strong showing\" that it is likely to prevail, is actually likely to lose – just as the lower courts in all of these cases have found.\n\nRemember: the cases we're talking about are cases in which a lower court has entered an injunction against the Administration. The Administration is applying for a stay precisely because it lost in the court(s) below, and it lost because the challengers persuaded the court below that, among other things, they were \"likely to prevail\" on the merits, and that the Administration was therefore not \"likely to prevail\" on the merits.\n\nIt follows, then, that when the Court grants a stay to the Administration, it is not overturning the lower court's finding that the challengers are \"likely to prevail\" on the merits, nor is it saying that the Administration is likely to prevail on the merits. \n\nIt is surprising how many otherwise perspicacious observers of the legal scene and developments in legal doctrine appear to misunderstand this point. Justice Gorsuch, for one. In the case I quoted from above, immediately after stating that the Court, when evaluating a stay application, first asks \"(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits,\" he writes:\n\n\"Applying that traditional stay test here yields a ready answer. Start with the first question: whether Idaho [the applicant for the stay] has shown it is likely to succeed on the merits . . .\"\n\nWeird, no? He just told us the first question is \"whether the applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits,\" and now he says the first question is \"whether the applicant has shown it is likely to succeed on the merits.\" Just sloppy drafting? Or is he signaling that the Court's position is that the lower court was incorrect when it granted the challengers a preliminary injunction?[11]\n\nAnd things get weirder. Though the Court as a whole is generally silent when dealing with these \"emergency\" stay requests, Justice Kavanaugh, to his credit, has written separately to explain his reasoning for joining the majority. In the recent case of Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, where the Court stayed a lower court injunction prohibiting ICE agents from detaining individuals based on nothing more than their race, ethnicity, clothing, and job-hunting activities,[12] he wrote:\n\n\"To obtain a stay from this Court, the moving party must demonstrate a fair prospect that, if the District Court's decision were affirmed on appeal, this Court would grant certiorari and reverse. The moving party also must show a likelihood that it would suffer irreparable harm if a stay were not granted. Those two factors are the \"most critical.\" Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434 (2009).\"\n\nA \"fair prospect\" that the Court would reverse the 9th Circuit's decision here – what, pray tell, does that mean?\n\nIt sounds like something out of Jane Austen or Thomas Hardy, no?\n\nFrom Blenheim peak, 'tis a fair prospect/Over the hills of Wessex to the sea …\n\nThat's presumably not what Justice Kavanaugh has in mind. I invite commenters to take a crack at what they think he does have in mind. To my mind, a \"fair prospect\" that the Administration will ultimately prevail is an even lower standard than either (a) a \"strong showing\" that it will prevail, or (b) a finding that it is \"likely\" to prevail. But maybe that's just me.\n\nNot surprisingly, here too commentators have, I think, been confused, and have missed the main point. Amy Howe on ScotusBlog, for instance, writes this:\n\n\"In a concurrence, Kavanaugh explained that the Trump administration had met both of the \"most critical\" factors that the court considers in deciding whether to grant temporary relief. First, he explained, \"given the significance of the issue to the Government's immigration enforcement efforts,\" the Supreme Court would be likely to grant review if the 9th Circuit were to uphold [the district court's] injunction.\nSecond, Kavanaugh continued, the Trump administration has shown not only that the Supreme Court would be likely to grant review, but also that it would be likely to reverse the lower court's ruling in the challengers' favor. [13]\n\nI don't think Justice Kavanaugh said that. By his own terms, he has determined that the Administration has shown it has a \"fair prospect\" the the Court would reverse, not that it is likely to reverse. It makes a big difference, I think.\n\nAll of which leaves the question: Why should the applicant for a stay have a significantly lighter burden than the applicant for a preliminary injunction?\n\n[1] See the excellent compendium of the 498 (as of 9/18/2025) cases filed against Trump Administration policies at https://clearinghouse.net/collections/38759, or the one at JustSecurity.com.\n\n[2] A week after the inauguration in 2025, I wrote:\n\n\"He [Trump] has figured it out: He can do whatever he wants, and nobody can stop him. Unilaterally impose 25% tariffs on Colombian imports? Do it! Withhold federal disaster relief to cities that don't assist ICE agents carrying out their raids? Absolutely! Halt all payments due for dispersal under NIH research grants until grantees dismantle their DEI programs? Sure!\nDoes anyone actually believe that, during the discussion in the Oval Office concerning those moves, Trump asked: 'Are we sure we have statutory and constitutional authority to do this?'?\"\n\n\"One Man Rule\", Jan 27, 2025.\n\n[3] In his guest post here on the VC several months ago, Prof. Abner Greene helpfully compiled a list of 28 cases (pending as of May 31, 2025 – 4 months or so after Inauguration Day) in which Administration officials had been enjoined from carried out a presidential policy directive. The pace has picked up considerably since then. See the compendia listed in note 1. [It does make me wonder: Are U.S. Attorneys doing anything besides defending the Administration in these lawsuits?] Visit either of those websites and click on any of the categories and notice how many \"Preliminary Injunction Granted\" labels you see. It is a remarkable record of lawlessness on the part of our government. That is has become so commonplace – another day, another outrage, and another P.I. - should not stop us from remarking, at every opportunity, on just how awful it is in its lawlessness.\n\n[4] I don't know of any actual data on the number of times that, say, Presidents GW Bush, or Clinton, or Eisenhower, were enjoined, even preliminarily, from doing what they wanted to do. I am nonetheless quite certain that the number was lower – probably by an order of magnitude or two -- than is the case with the Trump Administration (which is now in triple digits on this metric. See note 6 below.), despite having had a mere 8 months to achieve this grim milestone.\n\n[5] They're not, of course, final judgments that the Administration is acting unlawfully. Final judgments are, in most cases, months away – in part because there are some pretty complicated procedural and substantive legal issues in many of these cases, in part because the Administration has many tools, and the incentive, to delay the proceedings for as long as possible. These P.I.s only represent a judge's initial take on the matter. But still – 100+ and counting?\n\n[6] Here is my hastily-compiled and undoubtedly incomplete list of cases where SCOTUS has stayed preliminary injunctions against Trump Administration officials: Boyle v. Trump (D. MD) (firing CPSC Commissioners); Harper v. Bessent (DDC) (firing of MSPB members); Am. Fed. Gov't Employees v. Trump (ND CA) (mass firings of probationary employees); W.M.M. v Trump (ND TX) (Alien Enemies Act deportation power); AFSCME v.

If you're unfamiliar with the pace and process of complex constitutional take a look at some of the complete docket listings in some of the cases compiled at at https://clearinghouse.net/collections/38759, or JustSecurity.com. Scores, even hundreds, of docket entries for pretty much every case – motions challenging plaintiffs' standing or the case's ripeness for resolution, motions to dismiss, motions for summary judgments, motions requesting permission to file amicus briefs, motions to admit lawyers pro haec vice, motions requesting extensions of filing deadlines, motions requesting class certification, motions contesting any of the other motions, status conferences, transcripts of status conferences, motions to seal certain documents, motions to otherwise limit public disclosure of the court's deliberations, declarations averring or contesting the factual allegations in plaintiff's complaint, etc. Not to mention that the legal issues raised may be themselves thorny and complex, requiring time to research and review. It's more surprising that they ever reach final judgment than that it takes them a long while to do so.\n\n[8] See Justice Sotomayor's dissenting opinion in a recent case granting the Administration's request for a stay, Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo:\n\n\"The Court's order is troubling for another reason: It is entirely unexplained. In the last eight months, this Court's appetite to circumvent the ordinary appellate process and weigh in on important issues has grown exponentially. See, e.g., Trump v. J. G. G., 604 U. S. ___ (2025); Trump v. Wilcox, 605 U. S. ___ (2025); Noem v. Doe, 605 U. S. ___ (2025); United States v. Shilling, 605 U. S. ___ (2025).\nIts interest in explaining itself, unfortunately, has not. See Trump v. Boyle, 606 U. S. ___, (2025) (KAGAN, J., dissenting from grant of application for stay) (slip op., at 2–3)\nThere may be good justification for issuing an unreasoned order in some circumstances. See Labrador v. Poe, 601 U. S. ___ (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in grant of application for stay) (explaining how opinions on emergency applications \"can sometimes come at a cost\"). But some situations simply cry out for an explanation, such as when the Government's conduct flagrantly violates the law, or when lower courts and litigants need guidance about the issues on which they should focus.\n\n[9] Think about a single toss of a fair coin. Two outcomes: Heads or Tails. \"Heads\" is not a \"likely\" outcome of that toss. Neither is \"tails.\" Though each has exactly a 50% probability of occurrence, 50% is not sufficient to make something \"likely.\" The \"likely\" outcome of a two-outcome contest must have a greater than 50% chance of occurring.\n\n[10] Because the probabilities of the two outcomes summed together cannot be more than 100% (by definition).\n\n[11] Justice Sotomayor, too, appears to drop the \"strong showing\" language from time to time. See, e.g., her dissent from the Court's decision to grant a stay in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, a case involving ICE's detention policies.\n\n\"A stay is an 'intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review.'\" Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 427 (2009). This Court will not grant one absent \"extraordinary circum_stances.\" Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 463 U. S. 1315, 1316 (1983). The applicant bears \"an especially heavy burden\" where, as here, the matter remains pending before the Court of Appeals, and two lower courts have already denied such relief. Packwood v. Senate Select Comm. on Ethics, 510 U. S. 1319, 1320 (1994).\nOrdinarily, the Court considers the applicant's likelihood of success on the merits, the likelihood of irreparable harm absent emergency intervention, and the balance of the equities. See Nken, 556 U. S., at 434; see also Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. 183, 190 (2010). . . . An applicant must not only show a likelihood of success on the merits, but must also demonstrate that \"the implementation of the judgment pending appeal will lead to irreparable harm.\" Graves v. Barnes, 405 U. S. 1201, 1203 (1972).\n\nAs in Justice Gorsuch's case, one cannot help but wonder if this is a strategic omission. Justice Sotomayor has dissented from most of the Court's recent stay decisions, and would clearly like the Court to be applying a higher standard to the applicant's request than merely that it had made a \"strong showing.\"\n\n[12] Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo is one of the more inexplicable of the Court's recent \"emergency docket\" rulings staying a district court's preliminary injunction against an Administration policy. [See ScotusBlog entry here with links to the relevant primary documents, including the district court opinion here].\n\nLong-standing precedent allows immigration enforcement agents to \"briefly detain an individual for questioning if [the agents] have a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the [detainee] is an alien illegally in the United States.\" See U.S. v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873, 884 (1975). ;\n\nThis past summer, roving partrols of ICE agents were deployed to car washes, Home Depot parking lots, tow yards, bus stops, and other locations in and around L.A., detaining various individuals and demanding proof of US citizenship; individuals who could not provide such proof on the spot were transported to an ICE questioning center in downtown L.A. for further questioning.\n\nThe district court (CD CA) found that the agents' decisions about whether or not to detain someone were based \"solely on four factors: (1) the individual's apparent race or ethnicity; (2) whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent; (3) the type of location at which they were found (such as a car wash or bus stop); and (4) the type of job they appeared to work. Concluding that that that the presence of these four factors cannot satisfy the requirement of \"reasonable suspicion based on specific articulable facts,\" the court concluded that the challengers were \"reasonably likely to prevail\" in their challenge and that they would suffer \"irreparable harm\" if an injunction were not granted pending a full trial on the merits, and accordingly preliminarily enjoined ICE from using these factors, \"alone or in combination,\" in deciding whom to detain.\n\nThe Court's decision to stay the injunction is appalling, insofar as it allows continuation of the practice whereby armed agents of the United States government confront and detain individuals solely because they speak English with an accent, have brown skin, and are hanging around a Home Depot parking lot looking for construction work. I'm no expert on the 4th Amendment, but I would naively assume – and hope - that the 4th Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" prohibits this practice. The district court certainly took this position, in holding that the challengers are \"likely to succeed\" on their claim, as did the 9th Circuit in upholding the injunction and denying the Administration's request for a stay. Indeed, I would think a challenge to such a practice would be something of a constitutional slam dunk.\n\nBut in the meantime, the practice can continue.\n\n[13] See also Steve Vladek, \"Brett Kavanaugh's Defense of the Shadow Docket is Alarming\":\n\nStays are supposed to be an 'extraordinary remedy' meant for extraordinary cases where the three different things are true: First, the party seeking the stay must be likely to win their appeal. Second, it must be the case that not freezing the lower court ruling while it appealed would cause the appealing party 'irreparable harm.' And third the public interest must be served by such relief.","summary":"SCOTUS' \"stay jurisprudence\" is a bit of a mess","url":"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/10/14/the-lowly-stay-takes-center-stage/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/reason-logo-featured-placeholder.jpg.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 17:06:03","author":"Christian Britschgi,David Post","authors":["Christian Britschgi","David Post"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":369224852,"title":"Man who set fire to Pennsylvania governor’s mansion sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison","text":"Balmer had admitted to officials that he removed petrol from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails he used in the attack, Pennsylvania State Police said.\n\nHe turned himself in 13 hours after the break-in and admitted to “harboring hatred toward Governor Shapiro,” officials said. \n\nBalmer was asked in a police interview what he would have done if he had come face to face with Shapiro.

Candidate Abigail Spanberger Delivers ‘Word Salad’ When Asked About Males in Girls’ Locker Rooms","text":"Democrat Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger failed during a recent local television interview to clearly answer whether she supports allowing males into girls’ locker rooms. \n\nWhen Spanberger was questioned about an accusation from Republican Lt. Gov Winsome Earle-Sears that she is “fine with putting men in girls’ locker rooms,” Spanberger launched into a rant about federal funding rather than answering the question. Her refusal to directly answer questions about males in female spaces has been a pattern on the campaign trail, as the transgender issue has become a flashpoint in Virginia politics and the 2026 governor’s race. \n\nSpanberger, rather than address the issue directly, pointed to “conflicting evidence or conflicting interpretations” around the Title IX, and slammed the Trump administration for using its interpretation of the federal civil rights law as a “cudgel.” The Trump administration notably excludes “gender identity” from its interpretation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination is any education program as a condition of receiving federal funding. The Trump administration has investigated a handful of Virginia school districts and found them in violation of Title IX for allowing students to use bathrooms and play on sports teams according to “gender identity,” rather than biological reality. Spanberger said:\n\nThe reality is that the federal government has the ability to change the letter of the law, right? Through Congress, through the Senate, bills go to the president’s desk. Right now, what we are seeing is there are differences between what is the law of the land under Title IX and what are executive orders put out by the White House. And in circumstances where there are conflicting evidence or conflicting interpretations, the reality is the federal government has to be clear in what is the real guidance available to our schools as it relates to use of locker rooms. The reality is that we have multiple jurisdictions who believe they are following the letter of the law and have their lawyers conveying why. And at the end of the day, we have a president of the United States who is taking away and threatening federal funding.\nWhat I think is so egregious is that this is a tool that unfortunately this president continues to use of the threat of federal funding. Congress passed funding. It is not the president’s ability — this is, you know, basic Article One…If you believe in the constitution, the president doesn’t have the ability to just pull back funding. And it isn’t just to these public schools. It is to our research institutions. It’s for cancer research. It is for funding to conservation programs under USDA that are vital, vital, vital to so many of the farmers and producers who employ rotational grazing practices and other conservation practices, voluntary ones on their land who’ve been promised investments and the president just pulls back those funds.\nThe real challenge that exists here is, is that we have a president who is using congressional approved federal spending as a cudgel and just as an issue of principle, you know, right now it’s coming after the schools. Before, it was coming after conservation programs. Now, it’s also consistently across our universities and institutions of higher education and research, uh, it, it is a, it’s a, it’s a dire circumstance, but when it comes down to, um, you know, understanding the implementation of, of how it is that, you know, our kids are coexisting in the classroom, um, or on the sports field, yes, I do think that in, in many cases, it’s the local community that knows their community best, um, and, and can readily make decisions and provide guidance about how to ensure that all our kids are safe.\n\nEarle-Sears reacted to the clip of Spanberger’s interview in a post to X on Sunday, calling her opponent’s answer a “word salad.”\n\n“YIKES: Abigail Spanberger gives a 2-minute word salad defending her support for men in girls’ bathrooms and predators in their locker rooms,” Earle-Sears said.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also criticized Spanberger’s answer and compared her to former Vice President Kamala Harris, who is infamous for her long-winded, circular answers to interview questions.\n\n“This makes Kamala Harris sound coherent,” Miller said. “Short version: Spanberger wants psychologically disturbed men in your daughter’s restrooms and locker rooms.”\n\nFor years, Virginia has been one of the states at the center of the transgender debate, and ahead of the election, gender identity policies in schools have been under heightened scrutiny again. Along with those policies, gubernatorial candidates have weighed in on a heinous story of a transgender-identifying convicted pedophile who accessed several Virginia public school pools in off hours and allegedly stripped and fondled himself in front of women and minors in girls’ locker rooms.\n\nIn response to the chaos, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) issued a Executive Directive on Thursday ordering the state’s Board of Health to issue regulations barring transgender-identifying males from female sports and intimate spaces.\n\nDuring a debate last week, Spanberger was asked if she would keep or rescind that guidance. She refused to clearly answer yes or no.\n\nBreitbart News previously reached out to Spanberger’s campaign for comment on an update to the saga of convicted sex offender Richard Cox, and also asked whether she would rescind Youngkin’s guidance as governor. A spokesperson did not answer whether Spanberger would rescind the guidance.\n\n“Convicted sex offender Richard Cox is a predator who should be in jail — and that’s exactly where he is,” a spokesperson told Breitbart News via email.\n\n“Abigail is a parent of three daughters in Virginia public schools and a former federal law enforcement officer who went after child predators — nothing is more important to her than the safety of Virginia’s kids,” the spokesperson continued. “As Governor, Abigail will work with state and local law enforcement officers to keep Virginia kids safe and make sure sex offenders are prevented from preying on children and are prosecuted for their crimes.”","summary":"Democrat Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger failed during a recent local television interview to clearly answer whether she supports allowing males into girls' locker rooms. \n\n\nThe post Virginia Gov.

Freeman, a Democrat, declared earlier this year that she would not seek re-election to office after serving as the county’s top prosecutor for over a decade.\n\nICE cooperation has long been a contentious debate for law enforcement in Wake County, with a longtime Republican sheriff losing his bid for re-election in 2018 in an election that largely centered around the agency’s 287(g) program.\n\nIn nearby Mecklenburg County, Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., had been arrested 14 different times before going on to kill Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in a horrific stabbing in August that shocked the country. The brutal murder sparked debate over the use of cashless bail for repeat offenders and other individuals charged with serious crimes.\n\n“There was a time twenty some-odd years ago where I was going through some rough things, a drug addiction, and my brother helped see me through that,” Reginald Ferguson, Richard’s brother, said to WRAL. “Never once gave up on me, one time…He didn’t deserve to get killed and leave this earth.”\n\n“If he had never got out on bond, my brother would be alive today,” Reginald stated.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Mills Plans to Confront President Trump Again With Her Campaign for the US Senate","text":"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The New England governor who told President Donald Trump to his face that she would see him in court now plans to challenge Maine’s Republican U.S. senator at the ballot box.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Janet Mills cited her White House confrontation with the Republican president in February as proof that she should serve in the Senate, a bid she formally announced with a campaign launch video Tuesday.\n\n“I’ll stand up to Trump, just as I did in February,” Mills said in a telephone interview previewing her campaign with The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nMills’ comment referred to Maine’s legal challenge to Trump’s executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports. She publicly resisted pressure from the president during an audience with him and other governors in February.\n\nMills says she’s running to help mount a broader resistance to Trump, who she complained has cut food and health care aid for children and low-income Americans in the enormous tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July. She said she’s also running to oust five-term Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who voted for the measure.\n\n“I think the moment demands a lot more than we’re seeing from Susan Collins,” Mills said in the interview. “It demands a fighter and someone who will stand up and fight for the future of democracy and fight for the interests of Maine people, just as I have done for my entire career.”\n\nDemocrats target Maine in 2026\nDemocrats face an uphill challenge in their effort to retake the majority in the Senate in next year’s midterm congressional elections. The party would need to gain a net of four seats, while Trump carried most of the states holding Senate elections next year.\n\nNational Democrats see Maine as an important target. It is in the only place on the 2026 Senate election map where Republicans are defending a seat in a state carried last year by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nMills ticked through a list of former Maine senators “who have a proud tradition of defending democracy against those who threatened it,” including Margaret Chase Smith, William Cohen, George Mitchell and Olympia Snowe. Smith, Cohen and Snowe served as Republicans, while Mitchell was a Democrat, though all were known to have crossed party lines.\n\nCollins has long cast herself as a reflection of Maine’s independent spirit but has frequently voted with Trump on key issues.\n\n“I see Susan Collins as failing to live up to that legacy and failing to meet this unprecedented moment with the strength and courage that it demands,” Mills said.\n\nThough Collins voted to convict Trump after his 2021 impeachment over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Mills points specifically to her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as pivotal to the court’s 2022 decision to overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade case, which handed decisions about whether abortion should be legal back to the states.\n\nMills also faults Collins for voting to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump’s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services. While Kennedy has espoused anti-vaccine policy and ousted public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mills said, “I’m taking action with other states to expand vaccines, for instance, and preserve our public health infrastructure.”\n\nRepublicans were ready for Mills’ entry into the race with their own video Tuesday. The National Republican Senatorial Committee accused her, among other things, of defying the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations of people in the country illegally and its executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports.\n\n“No, thanks, Janet,” the ad concludes.\n\nMaine GOP Chairman Jim Deyermond said in a Tuesday statement that Mills is a handpicked choice of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who he said is “getting one of America’s most liberal, unpopular Governors to join a race where moderates have had historic success.”\n\nMills promotes transgender fight with Trump\nBut Mills’ campaign sees the fight over transgender rights as a strength.\n\nSpeaking to a group of governors in the State Dining Room, Trump called out the Maine governor, asking her “are you not going to comply” with the executive order on transgender athletes, to which Mills replied, “I’m complying with state and federal law.”\n\n“You better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any, any federal funding,” Trump responded.\n\nMills answered, “I’ll see you in court.”\n\n“Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one,” Trump shot back. “And enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”\n\nMills stoked Democratic enthusiasm in April when she said of the lawsuit Maine had filed against the Trump administration, “I’ve spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weaknesses.”\n\nIn May, the Trump administration agreed to reverse its decision to freeze federal money intended for a state child nutrition program over the state’s policy on transgender athletes.\n\nSpring ambivalence turns to autumn entry\nMills is barred by law from seeking a third term as governor. Throughout the spring and summer, she seemed to dismiss suggestions that she run for Collins’ Senate seat.\n\nA few other challengers have declared candidacies for the Democratic nomination, including oyster farmer Graham Platner, who has launched an aggressive social media campaign. Platner has the backing of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nMills points to the Republican-backed bill and its Medicaid cuts, a partial shutdown of the federal government entering its third week and still-high inflation as some of the reasons that ultimately compelled her to run.\n\n“The idea of being in D.C. for me is not something that’s fun,” she told the AP. “But the moment demands it.”\n\nBy THOMAS BEAUMONT and PATRICK WHITTLE Associated Press","summary":"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The New England governor who told President Donald Trump to his face that she would see&#8230; Continue reading Maine Gov.

The cover in question, unveiled on October 13, 2025, featured a low-angle shot of the president, elaborating on \"His Triumph\" in facilitating peace talks between the warring parties two years after the conflict began.Meanwhile, the corresponding article, published on Time Magazine's website on October 11, was titled 'How the Trump Administration Sealed the Gaza Ceasefire Deal.' While Trump was satisfied that the magazine wrote a \"relatively good story\" about him, he seemed irked at the photo used for the cover, dubbing it the \"Worst of All Time.\"In a post on Truth Social, the president complained that the magazine \"disappeared\" his hair and had \"something floating on top of [his] head\" like a small floating crown. He described the picture as \"weird,\" adding that he always hated \"underneath angle\" photos.“Time Magazine wrote a relatively good story about me, but the picture may be the Worst of All Time. They “disappeared” my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?” he wrote.Meanwhile, in its article, Time Magazine detailed how the US president helped bring about the Gaza ceasefire deal with the help of Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law. The magazine added that Witkoff and Kushner's \"painstaking efforts\" developed \"the framework of an accord that promises, at least for now, to quiet one of the world's most destabilizing conflicts.\" The article also noted that the ceasefire deal could become \"a signature achievement of Trump's second term.\" The conflict escalated after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, which reportedly killed about 1200 people. Following this, Israel retaliated with military attacks in Gaza, which have killed thousands of Palestinians over the past two years.Trump has been Time Magazine's Person of the Year twiceDonald Trump has been named Time Magazine's Person of the Year twice, once in 2016 and the other time in 2024. Both instances came after he won the presidential election that year. In 2024, the president was one of the 10 candidates shortlisted for the honor, which included Kamala Harris and Elon Musk. In his description on the short list, the publication highlighted Trump's 2024 presidential election win \"in a stunning political comeback,\" writing:\"He has reshaped the American electorate, activating young male voters who propelled him to a decisive victory that saw him win the popular vote for the first time and turn every swing state red. His 2024 win is history-making in multiple ways: he will be the oldest President in U.S. history, and he was convicted earlier this year by a New York jury of 34 counts of fraud, making him the first convicted felon to be elected President.\"Kayleigh McEnany @kayleighmcenanyLINK&#128680; President Trump has been named \"Time Person of the Year.\"\"Since he began running for President in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,\" Time wrote. \"Trump is once again at the center of the world, and in as strong a position as he has ever been.\" ⬇️When he was first made Person of the Year in 2016, Trump called it a \"great honor\" that \"meant a lot\" to him during an interview on NBC's Today show, as reported by the BBC.

'Tis I, Stephen Colbert. Folks, I’m sorry I couldn’t be with you in person today, but I’m a perfectionist and I just didn’t have enough bunting for my Mugato cosplay.

They know \"completely without merit\",' Colbert joked, poking fun at the Paramount film that bombed at the box office.\n\nHe then cited a phony statement, joking that the network said, 'You may take our money, but you will never take our dignity.\n\n'You may, however, purchase our dignity for the low, low, price of $16 million. We need the cash.'\n\nThe comedian claimed the pay our came in light of the company's $8.4billion merger with Skydance, which got approval from the Trump administration in July.","summary":"Stephen Colbert gave Donald Trump  rare praise during his Monday night before turning it into an attempt to save his show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15190775/stephen-colbert-praise-donald-trump-gaza-peace-deal-canceled.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/14/14/102974261-0-image-a-3_1760449768340.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/13/9216432125138811464/1024x576_MP4_9216432125138811464.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-14 14:00:01","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":369156360,"title":"'Doctor Who' actress admits she had 'Trump derangement syndrome' before Gaza peace deal","text":"British actress Frances Barber conceded Monday that she's changed her view on President Donald Trump following his role in brokering a peace deal between Israel and Hamas earlier this week. \"I had TDS and I'm now eating my words,\" she wrote on X Monday, reposting a photo showing a \"Thank You\" message to Trump written on a Tel Aviv beach.

It's been a big year for the Duchess of Sussex, having launched a series of new ventures and returning to social media with a bang. Two series of her lifestyle show, With Love, Meghan, have dropped on Netflix , and Meghan also released the first series of her second podcast offering: Confessions of a Female Founder. Alongside this, the Duchess has launched her lifestyle brand As Ever, with many of her initial product runs quickly snapped up by her fans. Now tongues are wagging that Meghan might be planning even bigger business moves as she's been spotted at various glitzy events over the past month, including Paris Fashion Week - her first public trip to Europe in years. The Duchess re-embracing both social media and the lifestyle space represented something of a return to form for Meghan, who for many years ran a successful lifestyle blog, The Tig, while she worked as an actress. In the last few weeks she's mingled with fashion tycoons like Anna Wintour, delivered a speech after being crowned Humanitarian of the Year alongside her husband Prince Harry , and lunched with her pal Serena Williams in the Big Apple's Soho House. And on Tuesday, she's set to join the likes of Selena Gomez and Kamala Harris at Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit in Washington DC to give a lecture on the world of entrepeneurship. Meghan posted a reel round-up of her trip on her New York Instagram , which included pop icon Ed Sheeran , feminist trailblazer Gloria Steinem, and a look at the immaculate wardrobe she took with her. The video showcased several racks of designer clothes with matching high heeled shoes lined up along the floor to match her several luxury outfits. As Meghan filmed the rows of clothing, Harry made a casual cameo, standing in the doorway smiling in a pair of grey track pants. The Duchess also reportedly enjoyed a low-key dinner with the new editor-in-chief of American Vogue, Chloe Malle, tucked away in a corner of a lavish NYC hotel. With these high-profile sightings and catch-ups, one PR expert told the Daily Mail that the Duchess might be looking for a way to reposition herself, with some of her ventures, like her TV show and podcast, landing mixed reviews. \"It's Meghan 3.0. She's on manoeuvres and looking for yet another relaunch,\" the expert told the outlet. The expert opinion comes as the new Creative Director of Balenciaga, Pierpaolo Piccioli, the debut show of which Meghan attended, revealed that the Duchess had asked if she could attend the show. \"Meghan and I met some years ago, and we've been texting ever since. She reached out and said she'd love to come to the show,\" the designer told The Cut, explaining there was \"no strategy or big orchestration\". Meghan's spokesperson is reported to have described her appearance as \"the culmination of many years of…friendship\". It comes as the Duchess shared a never-before-seen snap of her daugher Lilibet in a new social media post. In order to mark International Day of the Girl, Meghan shared an adorable photo of Lili running across the grass in a pink outfit. It was followed by a sweet mother-daughter picture, which showed the pair admiring the garden. It was accompanied by the caption: \"To all the girls - this world is yours. Do everything you can to protect your rights, use your voice, support each other. We will do the same for you. It’s your right and our responsibility. Go get ‘em girl! Happy International Day of the Girl.\"","summary":"Duchess Meghan has stepped back into the spotlight, making a series of high-profile appearances, and has been spotted catching up with a bevy of her A-list pals recently - and one expert thinks it's a key sign of more to come","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/inside-meghan-markles-shock-new-36066368","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36066512.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Meghan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 13:05:42","author":"Emma Mackenzie","authors":["Emma Mackenzie"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.489},{"id":369152774,"title":"Maine Gov. Mills plans to confront President Trump again with her campaign for the U.S. Senate","text":"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The New England governor who told President Donald Trump to his face that she would see him in court now plans to challenge Maine’s Republican U.S. senator at the ballot box.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Janet Mills cited her White House confrontation with the Republican president in February as proof that she should serve in the Senate, a bid she formally announced with a campaign launch video Tuesday.\n\n“I’ll stand up to Trump, just as I did in February,” Mills said in a telephone interview previewing her campaign with The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nMills’ comment referred to Maine’s legal challenge to Trump’s executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports. She publicly resisted pressure from the president during an audience with him and other governors in February.\n\nMills says she’s running to help mount a broader resistance to Trump, who she complained has cut food and health care aid for children and low-income Americans in the enormous tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July. She said she’s also running to oust five-term Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who voted for the measure.\n\n“I think the moment demands a lot more than we’re seeing from Susan Collins,” Mills said in the interview. “It demands a fighter and someone who will stand up and fight for the future of democracy and fight for the interests of Maine people, just as I have done for my entire career.”\n\nDemocrats face an uphill challenge in their effort to retake the majority in the Senate in next year’s midterm congressional elections. The party would need to gain a net of four seats, while Trump carried most of the states holding Senate elections next year.\n\nNational Democrats see Maine as an important target. It is in the only place on the 2026 Senate election map where Republicans are defending a seat in a state carried last year by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nMills ticked through a list of former Maine senators “who have a proud tradition of defending democracy against those who threatened it,” including Margaret Chase Smith, William Cohen, George Mitchell and Olympia Snowe. Smith, Cohen and Snowe served as Republicans, while Mitchell was a Democrat, though all were known to have crossed party lines.\n\nCollins has long cast herself as a reflection of Maine’s independent spirit but has frequently voted with Trump on key issues.\n\n“I see Susan Collins as failing to live up to that legacy and failing to meet this unprecedented moment with the strength and courage that it demands,” Mills said.\n\nThough Collins voted to convict Trump after his 2021 impeachment over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Mills points specifically to her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as pivotal to the court’s 2022 decision to overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade case, which handed decisions about whether abortion should be legal back to the states.\n\nMills also faults Collins for voting to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump’s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services. While Kennedy has espoused anti-vaccine policy and ousted public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mills said, “I’m taking action with other states to expand vaccines, for instance, and preserve our public health infrastructure.”\n\nRepublicans were ready for Mills’ entry into the race with their own video Tuesday. The National Republican Senatorial Committee accused her, among other things, of defying the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations of people in the country illegally and its executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports.\n\n“No, thanks, Janet,” the ad concludes.\n\nBut Mills’ campaign sees the fight over transgender rights as a strength.\n\nSpeaking to a group of governors in the State Dining Room, Trump called out the Maine governor, asking her “are you not going to comply” with the executive order on transgender athletes, to which Mills replied, “I’m complying with state and federal law.”\n\n“You better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any, any federal funding,” Trump responded.\n\nMills answered, “I’ll see you in court.”\n\n“Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one,” Trump shot back. “And enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”\n\nMills stoked Democratic enthusiasm in April when she said of the lawsuit Maine had filed against the Trump administration, “I’ve spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weaknesses.”\n\nIn May, the Trump administration agreed to reverse its decision to freeze federal money intended for a state child nutrition program over the state’s policy on transgender athletes.\n\nMills is barred by law from seeking a third term as governor. Throughout the spring and summer, she seemed to dismiss suggestions that she run for Collins’ Senate seat.\n\nA few other challengers have declared candidacies for the Democratic nomination, including oyster farmer Graham Platner, who has launched an aggressive social media campaign. Platner has the backing of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nMills points to the Republican-backed bill and its Medicaid cuts, a partial shutdown of the federal government entering its third week and still-high inflation as some of the reasons that ultimately compelled her to run.\n\n“The idea of being in D.C. for me is not something that’s fun,” she told the AP. “But the moment demands it.”","summary":"“I'll stand up to Trump, just as I did in February,” Mills said.\n\n\nThe post Maine Gov.

And as a result of that, they are too darn slow and they are raising costs at really an alarming rate,” Shapiro told Bloomberg Radio last month.\n\nAccording to the governor, there is bipartisan support for reforming PJM going forward—and if the network is resistant to changing, Pennsylvania is “willing” to leave, he said.\n\nWhy Are Pennsylvania Utility Bills Rising?\n\nAfter PJM’s latest capacity auction, during which the grid operator paid power generators to have enough electricity available to meet requirements during times of peak demand, Pennsylvanians were told to expect increases between 10 percent and 20 percent in their electricity bills over the next three years. \n\nThe main reason behind these prospected increases is that demand for energy is expected to grow massively in the coming years, with the grid operator estimating that peak demand will jump by 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030. \n\nPart of the story is the investment that Pennsylvania and surrounding states are making into new technology, including power-hungry data centers fueling artificial intelligence. This new tech is driving up demand for electricity and, consequentially, utility bills for the region’s residents.\n\nShapiro claims that Pennsylvania has the capacity to “do both” at “affordable rates,” telling Bloomberg Radio that the state is able to allow residents “to flip the switch on and not see added costs when the lights go on in their homes” and “be open for business.” \n\nWindmills at the Flight 93 National Memorial on September 11, 2025, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. (Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)\n\nThe reason why this is not working out, he said, is that PJM is “slowing down” Pennsylvania’s efforts. “If they can’t move quickly, if they can’t reform themselves, we’re going to figure out how to do this on our own,” he told the station.\n\nPJM would need to build new power plants to keep up with growing demand—but they are not motivated to do so, because Pennsylvania does not allow utilities to pass the cost onto ratepayers. Lawmakers have recently introduced legislation to change that, but it might be too late for the urgency felt by Pennsylvania residents struggling with higher costs—and their governor.\n\nShapiro said last month that PJM has “months, not years” to come up with reforms that would lower bills for customers. \n\nNewsweek contacted Shapiro’s office and PJM via email for comment on Tuesday.\n\nCould Pennsylvania Go Its ‘Own Way,’ As Shapiro Said?\n\nPJM is the largest electricity grid in the nation, serving one-fifth of Americans. While allowed, breaking away from it would not be easy for Pennsylvania—or any other state which is currently served by it.\n\nPennsylvania is in fact not the only state considering leaving PJM, which has found itself in the midst of a storm. Lawmakers in New Jersey ordered the state’s utility commission to evaluate whether it should leave the network, an option that is also being considered by lawmakers in Maryland.\n\nIn order to leave the PJM, Pennsylvania and the other 12 states which are part of it would need to order the utility companies that own the transmission lines within the state to also leave. On top of that, they would need federal regulatory approval and oversight. \n\nUtilities ordered to exit PJM could then join to form a new network, but they would still have to repay PJM for the power they had committed to purchase in the coming years and cover other costs, including maintenance.\n\nShapiro’s goal, however, seems to be forcing PJM to make changes before states push the nuclear button and leave the network. But it is unclear whether the company is willing to, or can, make the changes the governor wishes for.\n\n“Meeting the demands of a rapidly changing energy landscape will require solutions that extend beyond any one institution,” PJM spokesperson Dan Lockwood said in a statement reported by media outlet Whyy. \n\n“It will require PJM, the industry, and especially our states all working in concert. PJM will continue to fulfill its mandate of maintaining reliability in as cost-effective a manner as possible for the 67 million people we serve.”\n\nAre you a Pennsylvania resident worried about higher utility bills?

So multiple sources of big money are a must, as are major allies.\n\nNot only do these allies go on the road as surrogates at times, but they recruit other supporters, some of whom provide the first essential, big money. For a candidate to alienate the most powerful individuals in their political party even before a race gets going seriously is an unheard-of no-no.\n\nThat’s what former Vice President Kamala Harris may have done, though, in her campaign memoir, “107 Days,” published during a season when many candidates usually issue bland autobiographical tomes that purport to carry important messages aimed to draw millions of voters.\n\nMost don’t attract many voters and contain few important messages. However, the new Harris book is different. It’s almost like a deliberate effort to alienate potential supporters and snub her nose at the money they could raise.\n\nTake her complaint about Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, whom she briefly considered as her vice presidential running mate in 2024: He was initially reluctant or noncommittal when she asked for his endorsement just after former President Joe Biden gave up the Democratic nomination for his office and handed it off to Harris.\n\nDid Pritzker want a day or two to determine whether the party would accept Biden’s edict and quickly anoint Harris as the candidate? Did he want to be offered an incentive? Both would have been reasonable responses to Harris’s quick ascension. His pace did not satisfy Harris, though, a fact now announced in print.\n\nSo much for Pritzker’s support if Harris runs again in 2028. And there’s her response to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, her fellow endorsee of former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and her longtime supposed friend and stablemate (they’ve shared campaign consultants).\n\nShe claims he didn’t take her first call after Biden dropped out, texting back, “Hiking. Will call back.” He didn’t do that. So even though he did issue a full endorsement within hours, that was too slow for Harris, who apparently expects her colleagues to ask “How high?” the moment she says “Jump.”\n\nIf this sounds like minor byplay, that’s what it should have been. It probably wasn’t worth a mention in her book, or any other, but reflects an irritability that hasn’t worked well for any modern presidential candidate except Donald Trump. The rest have all tried to appear universally amiable.\n\nHarris sprinkled other, similar, bon mots though her book. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, whom she considered for vice president, is “overly ambitious (and) confident,” Harris writes, and “would want to be in the room for every major decision.” Shouldn’t any veep want that?\n\nThen there’s Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Biden’s transportation secretary. He would have been “too big a risk,” as she didn’t believe the electorate was prepared to back both a gay man (Buttigieg) and a Black woman (herself) simultaneously.\n\nShe writes that Buttigieg was actually her first choice for vice president, though, even though she picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. What now, if Walz is re-elected next year? If someone wanted to alienate powerful Democrats, it would be difficult to do it more thoroughly than Harris seems to have tried to do.\n\nMark Kelly, a senator from Arizona, “lacks political battle scars.” Does that mean he’s too popular, because he certainly has other kinds of scars as the steadfast, supportive husband of onetime assassination target Gabby Giffords.\n\nAll of this raises the question of whether Harris really wants to run for president again. Would she have criticized so many powerful Democrats if she were hungry for their support and the further backing they could bring along in 2028?\n\nHarris plainly didn’t want to be governor of California or go through the rough campaign that she’d need to win that job. Now she’s also given voters plenty of reason to wonder how much she wants to be president.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net.","summary":"Why would she risk alienating sources of funding, other aid — as she did — if she wants to try again at being president?","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/14/elias-digs-at-fellow-dems-in-harris-book-suggest-shes-not-running-in-2028/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SJM-L-HARRIS-1007-9.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 12:30:23","author":"Thomas Elias","authors":["Thomas Elias"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":369132300,"title":"77 Year-Old Democrat Jumps In Race To Unseat Republican — But First Must Beat Bernie-Backed Oyster Farmer","text":"Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills launched a Senate bid on Tuesday, aiming to unseat longtime incumbent Republican Maine Sen. Susan Collins in a race that may determine control of the upper chamber during the midterms.\n\nMills, a term-limited governor, officially declared her candidacy after being lobbied by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to enter the race. The 77-year old Senate hopeful will begin the campaign with near universal name recognition and the backing of the establishment wing of the Democratic Party, but will have to fend off competitive primary challenges from several far-left opponents including an insurgent oyster farmer endorsed by Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. (RELATED: Democrat Enters Crowded Key Senate Race, Muddying Waters And Helping GOP Incumbent)\n\nThe expected announcement comes after Mills’ campaign appeared to mistakenly declare her candidacy in a since-deleted announcement video and fundraising page on Friday.\n\n“Folks, do you want Democrats to take back the Senate?” Mills said in the video that briefly appeared on her social media. “Well, I’m Gov. Janet Mills, and I’m running to flip Maine’s Senate seat blue.”\n\nThough Mills will likely start the primary contest as an early favorite given her tenure leading Maine Democrats, several political newcomers are vying to take her down and are making the case they are best-suited to face Collins in the general election.\n\nSanders-backed oyster farmer and Marine veteran Graham Platner, 41, is working to consolidate support among the party’s left flank.\n\nJordan Wood, a 36 year-old former congressional aide to embattled now-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter, has also vowed to stay in the race even if Mills declared her candidacy.\n\nPlatner is viewed as the strongest contender to challenge Mills due to his endorsements from the left of the party — including support from former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna — and enthusiasm among the grassroots.\n\nThe showdown between Mills and the Sanders-endorsed candidate could highlight divisions among Democrats over generational change and support for Israel — two issues currently roiling the party as it plots a strategy back to power.\n\nSanders has notably called on Mills to pass on the race, arguing the primary clash between Platner and the governor would be “unnecessary & divisive.”\n\nLeaders We Deserve, a controversial group working to elect younger, more progressive Democrats, endorsed Platner’s campaign alongside various other youth advocacy organizations on Monday evening. Leaders We Deserve is founded by 25 year-old activist David Hogg.\n\nPlatner has pushed anti-Israel messaging at the center of his campaign messaging and has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of committing genocide in Gaza. He has also declined to back Schumer as Democratic leader.\n\nPlatner raised $3.2 million in the third fundraising quarter, which runs from July to September, Axios first reported.\n\nThe winner of the Democratic primary contest could struggle to oust Collins, who has a proven track record of winning tight races over her five Senate terms. She defied a bevy of polling in 2020 to cruise to victory in 2020 by nearly nine percentage points despite President Donald Trump losing the state by the same margin.\n\nCollins is the lone Republican incumbent to represent a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won last November.\n\nDemocratic groups are still expected to spend aggressively to defeat the incumbent senator because retaking Senate control would likely be impossible without winning in Maine.\n\nMills is also expected to face scrutiny about her age during the primary contest. She would be the oldest freshman senator in U.S. history if elected to the Senate in 2026.\n\n“Janet Mills is ten years older than I am, and now I’m wondering why I decided not to run for Congress again next year because I didn’t want to be part of the aging problem in Congress,” former Democratic Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild, who lost reelection in 2024, wrote on X on Friday. “And, if she wins, her term would be SIX years, making her 84 at the end of her first term.”\n\nHowever, Mills pointed to her viral clash with the president over transgender policies in education and sports earlier this year as evidence of her willingness to fight Trump and congressional Republicans in her campaign announcement video. Mills has thus far rejected the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX, which bars biological males from competing on girls and women’s sports teams in school athletic programs.\n\n“We stood up to Trump and stopped him from cutting the school lunch program for Maine kids,” Mills says in the ad, referring to the Trump administration’s threats to withhold federal funding due to the state’s transgender policies.\n\nNational Republican groups are likely to spotlight concerns about Mills’ age and her left-wing record as governor as they work to reelect Collins. The incumbent senator has not officially declared her candidacy for a sixth term, but has said she intends to seek reelection.\n\n“Janet Mills wants to be the oldest freshman Senator in American history after a record of failure that turned Maine into one of the weakest economies in New England,” National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement.\n\n“The only thing Mills has gotten right in her career is praising Senator Susan Collins’ effective and proven leadership,” Senate Leadership Fund executive director Alex Latcham said on Tuesday. “So while Democrats fight among themselves, Senator Collins will keep doing what she’s always done — delivering for Maine families.”\n\nBefore serving two terms as Maine’s first female governor, Mills was a former state lawmaker and state attorney general.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The former actress tied the knot with Prince Harry in 2018 but they stepped back from their royal roles just two years later. Prince Harry and Meghan now live a more private life with their family in LA. Since then, the pair have been behind multi-million pound documentaries, with Meghan presenting a brief podcast series on Spotify. In 2022, the couple featured in Harry and Meghan for Netflix , and she later fronted the lifestyle programme With Love, Meghan for the platform, which has aired for two series and is in line still to have confirmation for a third. The pair currently hold a 'multi-year, first look agreement for film and television projects' with Netflix . Additionally, Meghan runs her enterprise As Ever, and notably launched it by distributing samples of her preserves to her famous pals earlier this year but was reportedly feeling 'adrift' as the entire venture seemed to have faltered. Now, a PR expert has suggested that the former Suits actress is preparing to transform herself once more according to reports in the Mirror . They revealed to the Daily Mail: \"It's Meghan 3.0. She's on manoeuvres and looking for yet another relaunch.\" It comes as Meghan is scheduled to speak as a 'high-profile business founder' at Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit in Washington DC, and will appear alongside former US presidential candidate Kamala Harris and actress Selena Gomez. Since launching in April, Meghan's As Ever brand has rolled out various products, including wine, with several ranges flying off the shelves within minutes. However, no official sales figures have ever been revealed. A pal close to the Duchess revealed to the Daily Mail: \"At the moment she is literally lost because the whole jam-making business did not work out in the way she thought it would. \"Nobody has seen any figures, but I don't think they are that good. I know they just released a Sauvignon Blanc, but it's not going to make her lots of money because Netflix owns the business.\" Netflix serves as a partner in As Ever, with Alison Boshoff from the publication noting: \"This would be disputed by Meghan, but certainly the streamer is an investor and will be taking a big slice of any profits. \"It is also heavily involved in running the business as Meghan, despite her talk of being a 'female founder', is entirely inexperienced in commerce.\" During a chat with Bloomberg this summer, Meghan confirmed that Netflix is her sole partner and backer in As Ever. When quizzed about her aspirations for her brand, she replied, \"I don't want it to feel generic, cookie-cutter, or phoned in.\" Yet, a friend of the Duchess told the publication: \"She just wants to make money, she wants to be a billionaire The trouble is, she doesn't know how.\" The Duchess recently took to her lifestyle brand's Instagram page to subtly announce the addition of a new wine to the range, a 2024 Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. Meghan announced the new offering with a cryptic post on social media, captioned: \"We heard you missed us. We're back...and we brought a friend.\" After sharing a sneak peek of the new tipple online, Meghan then jetted off to France for her surprise appearance at Paris Fashion Week, with her new wine going unnoticed. Meghan's Instagram post first displayed a gift box of her famous apricot spread and orange marmalade, both already staples in the As Ever range, followed by an image of the new wine chilling in an ice bucket. The official As Ever website provided more details about the white wine, which is the third varietal of wine available for purchase from the Duchess of Sussex's brand. \"Our first Sauvignon Blanc is bright and balanced, with citrus aromatics, a smooth finish, and refreshing versatility,\" reads the official description. \"Crafted for everyday dinners and celebratory gatherings alike, this thoughtfully made wine is perfect for sharing, gifting, and savouring in every season.\" Priced at $30 (£22) per bottle and sold in sets of three ($90), half cases ($159) and full cases ($300), As Ever's new Sauvignon Blanc is priced the same as the line's 2024 Napa Valley Rosé and the sold-out 2023 Napa Valley Rosé.

She is freckled (who knew Charli xcx had freckles?) and makeup-​free. (She is also bra-free, though that we have seen before.) Her ubiquitous Balenciaga and Mugler bags are elsewhere—she is wearing Bottega Veneta flats and a stomach-covering vintage T-shirt featuring three buxom women drawn by fetish artist Eric Stanton, as well as jeans by Guess, which are impossible to look at without triggering the lyrics of Charli’s song of the same name featuring Billie Eilish.\nGeorge Daniel, drummer for The 1975 and her husband of two weeks, keeps walking by with a beatific smile. Every time he does, Charli exclaims his name in excitement, as if she’s run into him somewhere she wasn’t expecting to rather than in their kitchen. “This is George,” she tells me delightedly, introducing us as he heads out for a hike with their rescue mutt, Nico, named for the singer. “Are you going to Runyon?” Charli asks about the hiking destination that is as well-trafficked in Los Angeles as the Erewhon smoothie line. No—George and Nico are headed to Bronson Caves. “Oh, cute!” Charli says. Everything to do with Daniel is cute. Soon they’ll be on a second wedding-cum-honeymoon in Italy. “It will be lovely,” Charli says. “Just eating mountains of pasta and drinking spritzes.”\nGeorge and Charli’s kitchen is open to the patio and features a truly enormous dining room table with bench seating. Taylor Marie Prendergast’s moody black-and-white art hangs on every wall, and a large easel holds a drawing of a tree that Charli sketched. The whole tableau is, right now, being blasted by morning sun from massive east-facing windows. I ask about the life events that made the purchase of this opulent home possible, and Charli openly wonders whether she can trust me enough to answer my questions.\nEarly hits like “Boom Clap” and “I Love It” were huge, but Charli wasn’t particularly. As she told Kareem Rahma on his interview series SubwayTakes last year before Brat came out, “Some artists have a song, but a song isn’t enough.” Charli says many friends have asked her, “You are in your 30s now—do you feel like you’re more equipped to handle this? What do you think would’ve happened if this had happened when you were 18?” But, Charli says, it kind of did happen—she was almost a plus-one to the world-famous songs she had created, which allowed her to travel and perform internationally and to engage with a kind of half version of what was to come. She was featured in publications like The Guardian and Rolling Stone, but the framing tended to focus on Charli’s permanent status in the waiting room of A-list-hood, where she was left to toil in niche brilliance. “I dipped my toe in, but I wasn’t fully in,” she says. “I think having that experience probably equipped me well for this happening.”\nSo now that brat is over…. Charli stops me as I put that to her. “I don’t really get to decide when it’s over or not,” she says. “I think that’s up to the world.” It will eventually exist “as a relic.” “I don’t think people will forget it,” she says. On the other hand, “It’s not fucking New Wave.”\n“The end will be interesting,” Charli says. “Because then I have to look at myself in a different way and be stripped of the thing that everyone identified me with.” Whatever this post-brat version of Charli xcx is, she says, “I won’t be staring into the abyss wondering what I’m gonna do.”\nAt least part of what she’s gonna do is turn into a movie star. Charli has seven films coming out soon, including three that debuted at the Toronto or Venice film festivals in September. There’s Erupcja, an indie film that emerged from her friendship with playwright Jeremy O. Harris and an unplanned meeting with director Pete Ohs at Clandestino. Charli also features in the fantasy 100 Nights of Hero, starring Emma Corrin, and the eco-satire Sacrifice, with Chris Evans and Anya Taylor-Joy.\nCharli will have a lead role in The Moment, distributed by A24, a revisionist history focused on the aftermath of Brat’s release in which she stars with Alexander Skarsgård. She is also writing songs for two major projects, including the Anne Hathaway–led pop idol epic Mother Mary.\nBut this is just the next moment. “I not only know that this won’t last forever,” Charli says. “I’m also really interested in the fact that it doesn’t.”\n“Oh, my God,” I say. “That’s Charli.”\n“There it is,” she says, smiling again.\n“I’m always thinking about how I look and what I would change about my face,” Charli says, citing her favorite plastic surgery website RealSelf for giving her the resources to know that she can’t achieve a permanent version of the braid eye tilt with sugar threads. At some point, she says, she “probably will get” a mid-facelift. “I’m fucking thinking about all the shit that I could do and pull and stretch and morph on my face, all the time,” Charli says. “I have to just remind myself that maybe I can’t get too sucked into that.”\nShe recently stopped getting Botox. “I miss it,” she says mournfully. Her acting roles were what prompted the break from paralytic injectables. “I did a couple of audition tapes where I had Botox, and my eyebrows were doing that crazy thing when they kind of lift.” She drags up the outer edges to demonstrate the look, which evokes Jack Nicholson’s distinctive brows. “They look great on him,” Charli says.\nThe xcx persona embodied by the face is also a real facet of Charli’s life and personality that was first amplified long ago. “I see some analogy with someone like Dolly Parton, who is a performer, and you’re using that character. It is part of you, but there’s a little bit of that role-playing going on,” says Charli’s longtime collaborator A.G. Cook. At the same time, “It’s a very real version of Charli that is becoming more known,” Cook says.\nCharli grew up as a multiracial “frizzy-haired” little girl in Essex, near London. She is the only child of a white British entrepreneur and a Gujarati Indian flight attendant and nurse who came to the UK after her family was expelled from Uganda by the dictator Idi Amin. Charli’s parents supported her interest in the arts by taking the teenager to perform at illegal raves. She signed a deal with Asylum/Atlantic Records in 2009, half her life ago. Of Atlantic, Charli says, “It used to be quite a turbulent relationship, and now it’s just really not.” She partially attributes the shift at the label to the fact that “they used to really not like that I was kind of a bitch, and now I guess they know it can sell.”\nCharli is pleased that Atlantic does not demand she “collaborate creatively.” “I’m not open to feedback,” she says. “Like, that’s not what your job is. We can all pretend that it is, but it’s not.”\nI ask if she ever does just nod along and pretend their input is valuable simply to get through the meeting. “I don’t go to the meeting,” she says. Lest this make her seem rude, Charli clarifies, “I don’t wanna make it sound like the label are idiots. They’re definitely not. But I think it’s like, everybody has their strengths, right?” The label’s role: “They’re a bank,” she says. They advance Charli money to go off, do her thing with people she actually does want to collaborate creatively with, come back, tell them what and when the rollout is, and rent the tractor loader so she and Eilish can ride through a jillion bras and panties in the “Guess” music video. At this point, Charli says, “They want to just do that. They want to support the vision.” The vision is lucrative, after all.\n“We’re in a good place, and I wouldn’t swap it for anything,” Charli says, adding, “The devil you know.”\n“I don’t even think my driving factor has been, ‘I wanna be the biggest pop star ever in the world,’ or anything like that,” Charli says of her career goals. “I always just wanted to make music on my own terms and have as many people listen to it as possible, which sounds really simple. But I think I’ve really struggled over the years, because I’ve never felt like I fit in. Am I supposed to be this underground left artist, or am I supposed to try and be this commercial package? And I think before Brat, I just gave up on fighting with myself on that. I really said, ‘Okay, I am going to make this record in this specific way, and I’m actually fine with the consequences of that; if it means no one hears it, if it means I get dropped by my label.’ ” As we know, the consequence was Charli becoming one of the biggest pop stars in the world.\nIn April 2024, less than two months before the release of Brat, Charli and Troye Sivan announced they were co-headlining the Sweat tour, a six-week North American arena run. Last spring, Sivan was the bigger artist, promoting his album Something to Give Each Other. The single “Rush” was, in Sivan’s words, “popping off.” Charli told Sivan she was anxious she would negatively impact the tour. “I was worried that people would be like, ‘Oh no, who’s this girl preventing us from hearing “Rush”?’ ” she says. “Um, and then obviously, you know, things kinda changed for me.”\nOn June 7, Brat debuted. On June 27, Charli made a surprise appearance at Sivan’s solo London show. He had the idea that the stage should go black, then turn the sickly color of the album cover, then Charli would appear in silhouette.\n“The sound that came out of the crowd when she appeared with the wind in her hair and the Brat green background behind her…. It was a completely overwhelming response,” Sivan says. “I get chills thinking about it now.” He was thrilled as a friend but also as a fan. “I am so happy to be a part of the community of gays that have been following her for so long,” Sivan says. Charli reciprocates the devotion; she says she feels “super indebted to” her queer fans.\n“She’s been our queen for a really long time,” says Sivan. “I feel very honored to get to represent the gays that have died for her for forever.”\nCharli is a completist when it comes to seeking out people’s opinions about herself, from the gays that die for her to journalists. She told me she reads every bit of coverage about herself—that the social media climate affects her. She wants to know how people discuss her, how critics perceive her, what the newer listeners make of all of this. “It’s fascinating to see how people ingest your personality and spit it back out—what people cling on to, what people miss,” Charli says. “I’m always interested in, like, what does the casual viewer think? And they probably think I’m a girl who parties and does drugs and is a little bit bitchy.”\nSo is “365” a commentary on people’s perception of her? “No, I am saying, ‘I’m a 365 party girl,’ ” Charli says. “ ‘365’ is a song about going to a party, feeling yourself, feeling really hot, but essentially getting really crazy because you’re running away from something. Then, as the song progresses, everything gets a little wilder and more fucked up sonically as the person is getting more wild and fucked up. And by the end of it, it’s kind of sad.”\n“If enough people say that it is true on the internet, it becomes the truth,” Charli says of all the misperceptions about her. I ask why she doesn’t correct the record. “You can’t,” she says—that just makes it bigger. “Fact-checking is dead,” Charli tells me, which will come as a surprise to Vanity Fair’s research department. She says doing this cover story and being vulnerable and open while imagining what, say, the Daily Mail will aggregate from it is scary, even though the theoretical concept of how information is decontextualized fascinates her. “I have a big mouth, and I say shit and sometimes it gets me in trouble,” Charli says. “You seem lovely. But were you trying to get me on your side, so I would reveal more? I don’t know.”\nCharli appeared on the podcast Las Culturistas two days before Brat debuted. During the interview, she wavered about whether she would reveal who the album’s songs were about. “My thing is, people are gonna guess,” she told hosts Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers before declining to name the inspiration for “Girl, So Confusing,” about a complicated relationship with another female musician who has similar hair to Charli’s. “I think you probably both have an accurate guess,” Charli said. “It’s probably that person.” (It was Lorde, who likely would have remained anonymous if she hadn’t accepted Charli’s invitation to “work it out on the remix.”) It felt like—or at least practically functioned as—the moment when Charli decided to let Brat speak for itself. “Exactly,” Charli’s frequent collaborator Aidan Zamiri confirms of her choice to not explicate songs that dropped enough hints to be fairly explicit to fans paying close attention though remained inscrutable (but googleable) to the casual viewer who’s only aware she’s a little bit bitchy. “Charli is very instinctive about how she wants to share information, and I liked that one of the things she said about the album is that she tried to not lean into metaphor,” Zamiri says.\nWith the exception of the omnipresent Julia Fox (“I’m so Julia”—“360”) and Lorde, Charli has mostly left it up to the internet to imagine the truth about the subjects of her music.\nA New York magazine writer tried to get Charli to discuss whether “Sympathy Is a Knife” is about Taylor Swift, as was a common interpretation of lyrics that mentioned dreading seeing someone backstage at her boyfriend’s show. (In 2023, Swift dated Daniel’s 1975 bandmate Matty Healy, who would subsequently crowd-surf at Charli and Daniel’s Italian wedding redux.) The song features a momentary fit of resentment in the chorus:\n\nCause I couldn’t even be her if I tried\n\nI’m opposite, I’m on the other side\n\nI feel all these feelings I can’t control\n\nOh no, don’t know why\n\nAll this sympathy is just a knife\n\n“You do the silence game,” Charli told the magazine, refusing to acquiesce to a discussion about whether she’d thought of leaving out a particularly revealing line. “But I know that well—where you go silent and want me to talk more. But I don’t care about it being awkward. We’ll sit in silence.”\n“I think I’m just quite direct and blunt,” Charli tells me when I ask about that moment and talk about how different it feels from how warm she’s been today. “I hate this phrase, but what you see is what you get with me. People think it’s all some kind of performance, but it’s not. I’m not sat here talking to you being the way that I am onstage. But I think there is a correlation in that there’s a messiness and a lack of perfection. It’s the combination of talking about those things whilst also embracing them and really struggling with them is what makes me whole. And I think that it makes me honest. You can vouch for me, I hope.”\nI tell her I can’t fact-check her heart, but my impression is that Charli is incredibly sincere.\n“Or I’m a psychopath,” she says, cackling.\nIn October, Swift released The Life of a Showgirl, featuring “Actually Romantic,” which appeared to misinterpret Charli's song about self-doubt as a diss track, with lyrics like, “I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave,” and, \"Wrote me a song sayin' it makes you sick to see my face.\" Swift has not confirmed who “Actually Romantic” is about, beyond saying it's someone who had a “one-sided, adversarial relationship with” her. (If you write an adversarial track about someone, is the relationship really one-sided?) Pretty much everyone immediately believed the song was about Charli; Swifties swarmed.\nSince the Showgirl drop, Charli hasn’t exactly been in witness protection, popping up on the Saturday Night Live stage to support musical guest Role Model, anointing him with her signature sunglasses. The saga continues in the comments section, but so far Charli has avoided engaging directly, including in the pages of Vanity Fair. She declined to comment on the situation.\nThe document became the genesis for The Moment. Zamiri and Bertie Brandes finished the screenplay in a few months with input from Charli, and Zamiri filmed it last spring. “I really don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who works as hard as Charli does,” Sivan says, noting that in between Sweat dates, Charli would take on roles in movies, including Gregg Araki’s I Want Your Sex, in which Araki says Charli does a “top-notch” American accent and nailed a scene in which “she’s faking an orgasm with Cooper Hoffman’s character.” What was Sivan doing during his downtime? “Resting,” he says.\nOne project Charli turned down during this period was a tour documentary. She felt the market was already saturated with similar projects and says, “I feel like my problem with a lot of musician documentaries is it often shows the musician coming up against some kind of opposition and eventually overcoming it to be the hero. And that’s just not been my experience, you know? Maybe it has been a lot of other people’s, and that’s awesome.”\nCharli calls The Moment “a 2024 period piece.” “It’s not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way, but the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make one,” she says. “It’s fiction, but it’s the realest depiction of the music industry that I’ve ever seen.”\nAsked to describe his role, Skarsgård says he plays someone whom “the record label convinces Charli is the hottest director out there at the moment; the right person to capture the essence of Charli xcx and get the most out of this phenomenon that brat was.”\nDirector Zamiri calls Skarsgård’s character “one of the villains or antagonists of the film.” (Charli herself may be another one; she describes her role as “sort of a hell version of myself.”) Zamiri is cagier about the plot, saying only that the film explores what would have happened if Charli had made “entirely different choices” around brat. (As far as we know, in this counterfactual, Charli’s viral X post “kamala IS brat” still does not make Harris win the presidential election against Donald Trump. At least, as Charli told Zane Lowe, she’s “obviously happy to be on the right side of history.”)\nThe Moment features a score by Cook. Skarsgård did not reveal to Charli until after they’d wrapped that she was his second most-played artist on Spotify in 2024. (The first was a Japanese pop star from the 1970s and ’80s named Eiichi Ohtaki, which Skarsgård concedes is a very brat choice.) He has just seen Charli perform for the first time at a music festival in Gothenburg, Sweden, a few days before we speak and says, “I got to see the snippets of that when we shot the movie. But the other night when I got to see the full show, it was really remarkable how the second she steps offstage, she sheds that part of her personality. Then she’s back to being this sweet little Charli.”\nCharli views making The Moment as an almost therapeutic exercise. “I always find it hard to sit down and look at things with distance, because I am always moving on to the next thing,” she says. “I think that I process myself through my work. I’m writing about myself and my thoughts all the time, and my thoughts about what people think about me.” Charli gestures toward infinity with a Queen Elizabeth wave. “The meta-ness continues.”\nThe obvious follow-up to Brat would have been to make more music, as Charli had done after her previous five studio albums—especially now that there was the option that, as she says, “You could just do more of that thing because now that’s what people see you as. You’ve solidified this brand that people seem to understand and want to digest very easily.” That was not particularly inspiring to Charli. And also, as she’d word-vomited to Zamiri, she’d basically gotten everything she wanted.\n“Did I need everyone’s validation to feel that way?” Charli asks of her secondhand self-acceptance. “I guess I probably did, and that’s probably why I am an artist. But I think once I had that experience, that’s reward enough for me to feel satisfied in that area for a while.” Twenty minutes later, her zen has evaporated somewhat. “I don’t think one day I’m gonna wake up and be like, ‘I feel confident, and I’m done with feeling anything else other than confidence,’ ” Charli says. “Some days I feel totally destroyed and completely in the depths of misery. But I also need the high contrast to be able to create anything. If I was happy all the time, I probably wouldn’t be making art.”\nWhile Charli says she doesn’t know if or when she’ll release another album, she’s already been working on more music, albeit for a fictional character. She and Jack Antonoff wrote songs for Mother Mary, the David Lowery film in which Anne Hathaway plays a famous musician. “We were making music that I don’t think I would ever make for my artist project”—songs for Charli xcx—“but still music that I truly love.”\nIn addition to contributing music for Hathaway’s character, Charli told her (at her request) what being a pop star is like. She was “so generous sharing her experiences,” Hathaway says. “It was like chatting with a girlfriend.”\n“She was the opposite of aloof,” Hathaway says. “I was delighted at how friendly and real she was. Her talent is one that’s easily underappreciated because the end result feels so fun and achievable, but it’s actually a stunningly rare feat.”\nOvercompensating creator and star Benito Skinner met Charli at a party at Cara Delevingne’s house. He and his boyfriend Terry O’Connor, who subsequently collaborated with Charli on the look and rollout of Brat (and the Kamala Harris post), became close with her and Daniel. “If you don’t believe in love or straight relationships, which I usually don’t, I believe in this one,” Skinner says. Before a 1975 show at Hollywood Bowl, Charli got glam to be in the audience because, she told Skinner, “I’m hot girlfriend tonight.” At Coachella, Skinner stood with Daniel while Charli performed. “I just watched him watch her,” Skinner says. “It was so sweet. He just had his Aperol spritz, and that’s his queen.”\nCharli and Daniel got married in London’s Hackney district in late July. The planning wasn’t painstaking; they just happened to have time in their schedules and made it work. Charli didn’t get her Vivienne Westwood dress until five days before the ceremony.\n“It’s cool to be married,” Charli says in a tone that would also be appropriate for talking about an interestingly shaped rock. “I never really saw it for myself, to be honest.” Her own parents didn’t wed until she was 16. “I think one day they were, like, feeling it,” she says. “And I think that’s so sweet.”\n“It was cool to feel so in love, and do it our way,” Charli says, now ceding a bit of gushiness to her husband. “We both kind of just wanted to not feel the pressures of the things you’re supposed to feel when you get married.”\nCharli did not want to feel, she says, like “this is the day of your life as a woman. I’m like, it’s actually just another cool day.” They woke up, had breakfast at Allpress in Dalston, “and then we just went and did it,” Charli says. “It was cute. He’s the best.” While she does not mention his less flattering angles—and, based on everyone I talked with, he doesn’t seem to have many—Charli says, “He really understands who I am at my best and at my worst.”\n“When he’s deep within making a 1975 record and needs perspective, we can talk about it, and vice versa,” Charli says. “It feels very calming to have that. Sometimes, you have to really grapple with fear and expectation and it being over.”\nWhen I talk to Charli a few weeks later, right after the Brat tour is over, she has already moved on to the next thing, which she acknowledges “is probably some kind of a protection defense mechanism from having to sit and feel the empty space of the silence between creative projects.”\nCharli launches into describing her next enterprise: writing songs for Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Wuthering Heights, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. “That’s the world I’ve been living in,” Charli says. Despite the internet’s apparent horror at the idea that the film might feature pop music anachronistic to the largely 18th-century setting—someone posted that it was like the “matcha dubai chocolate labubu of film”—she tells me it’s an “elegant and brutal sound palette…. It couldn’t be more different from Brat.”\nThe end of that sentence could apply to Charli’s entire shift to film, which has bled even into her social media. In addition to her many acting roles, Charli has cultivated an amusing cinephilic presence on the movie review site Letterboxd under the handle itscharlibb, where she chronicles her personal consumption and, occasionally, the status of her projects. (Sample review, of Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth: “watched this whilst george built lego ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ .”)\n“I saw the film Phantom Thread,” Charli says of the Paul Thomas Anderson film about the self-inflicted tortures of being an artistic genius. The main character, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, only steps away from his work when he’s sick, so his wife deliberately gives him toxic mushrooms so he can take breaks and they have time to connect. (It’s actually a really nice relationship.) “I was like, ‘Oh, my God, that’s so me,’ ” Charli says. “When I get sick, George nurses me back to health, and that’s when I feel calm.” She adds, “But he doesn’t poison me.” (There’s no way for me to fact-check!) Charli says she can only rest when her body shuts down and tells her, “No, Charli, you must stop.” “Life’s so short,” she says. “There’s so much I want to do. I want to just constantly be doing it.”\nPhotographed exclusively for VF by Aidan Zamiri in Los Angeles. Sittings Editor Max Ortega. Hair products by Bumble and Bumble. Makeup products by H&M Beauty.

Nearly the same percentage of people who said they believed in the QAnon conspiracy, 81 percent, said they voted for Trump.\n\nConversely, a majority of Black Protestant voters (83 percent), 72 percent of unaffiliated voters, 67 percent from non-Christian religions, and 62 percent of Jews all backed Kamala Harris.\n\nThere was a split among Roman Catholic voters: 59 percent of white Catholics backed Trump, while 55 percent of Hispanic Catholics went for Harris.\n\nA poll by Pew Research Center came up with similar results.\n\nThat survey, of a nationally representative sample of 8,937 Americans from across the U.S., found that overall, 4 percent believed God chose Trump because He believes in his policies, while another 32 percent think Trump’s election is part of God’s plan, although God may not necessarily agree with his program. Nearly half, 49 percent, said God doesn’t get involved in elections, while 14 percent said they don’t believe in God.\n\nWhen it comes to white evangelicals, those numbers are much higher, with 8 percent believing God ordained Trump because He agrees with his policies, and 63 percent thinking his election is part of God’s plan, whether the deity agrees with his policies or not. Their beliefs held firm with regards to Joe Biden’s election in 2020 with 67 percent of white evangelicals believing his victory was part of God’s plan – but with the stark difference that a negligible percentage believed that God agreed with his policies.\n\nIn Pew’s survey, 51 percent of respondents who identify as white and evangelical said religion plays a big role in shaping their vote. That is larger than any other religious group by at least 14 percentage points. \n\nWhite evangelicals are also more likely to believe God chose Trump as a candidate because He approves of Trump’s policies and that supporting Trump is directly correlated to being a “good Christian,” Pew found. However, overall that proportion is very small: 5 percent believe God chose Trump and agrees with his policies; compared to 3 percent who believe the same about his predecessor, Barack Obama. \n\nThe survey found that 80 percent of Christians think that “good Christians” can disagree about Donald Trump. Eleven percent said “good Christians” should support him, while seven percent said they should oppose him. \n\nThe Public Religion Research Institute’s survey found a correlation between church attendance and support for Trump. \n\nIn general, white Christian voters who said they attend church weekly were more likely to vote for Trump than former Vice President Kamala Harris. But even among white evangelicals who said they rarely attend church, 77 percent said they voted for Trump – also higher than any other group.\n\nTrump has built a strong base, including a large number of those who identify as white and evangelical, in part by appealing to the desire to integrate religious beliefs in every facet of life through religious freedom, as well as tackling progressive culture-war policies. \n\nThat group of voters has remained by Trump’s side through the years, despite alleged infidelity scandals, accusations of wrongdoing, impeachments, criminal indictments, felony charges and other misconduct allegations that some have considered sinful. \n\nIn part, it’s because many say their faith in a higher power is directly correlated to their political leanings. \n\nTrump’s ties to religious conservatives appear to be stronger than ever before, with the president occasionally comparing himself to Jesus Christ and using rhetoric that creates an us-versus-them mentality. \n\n“Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out the churches, just like every fascist regime has tried to co-opt them and control them and, in America, the radical left is trying to do both,” Trump told a room filled with members of Christian media in February 2024.\n\n“They want to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags. But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you,” the president added. \n\nTrump’s perceived godliness has only been deepened for some by his surviving two assassination attempts. \n\nAt Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally in October 2024, his friend, David Rem, painted Trump as a savior while comparing Trump’s opponent, Harris, to “the devil” and “antichrist.”\n\nIn June, televangelist Paula White claimed Trump surviving an assassination attempt in July 2024 “wasn’t a coincidence” but “God’s sovereign divine miracle.”\n\nIn the past nine months, Trump has signed an executive order establishing an anti-Christian bias task force in the Department of Justice, stated that they will allow churches and houses of worship to endorse political candidates without losing their IRS tax exempt status, and appointed White to lead the White House Faith Office. \n\nHe’s also taken steps to quash progressive policies that religious conservatives have often opposed, such as blocking Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, an organization vilified for providing abortions, and rolling back transgender rights, especially for minors. \n\nTrump portrayed the late conservative Christian influencer Charlie Kirk as a martyr and blended politics and religion to insinuate the “radical left” was trying to take down Kirk’s values.\n\nAs a result, white evangelicals have a resounding approval rating of Trump, with 72 percent approving of his current job handling, 69 believing the administration’s ethics are excellent or good, and 57 percent trusting Trump more than previous presidents. \n\nThat is far greater than the general public’s 40 percent approval rating.","summary":"President especially enjoys sweeping approval ratings and strong support from white evangelicals, who make up a significant part of his MAGA base, new polling shows","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-evangelical-voters-maga-b2842752.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/14/10/GettyImages-1209136110.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0eMbvmZv-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-14 11:29:56","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.075},{"id":369105426,"title":"Schumer, Clinton lead Democrats praising Trump for Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal","text":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and Bill and Hillary Clinton are leading a chorus of prominent Democrats praising President Donald Trump for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and the release of the remaining living hostages.

But when Trump rips away healthcare from millions of Americans and drives up costs on everything from groceries to housing to trucks and cars, then turns around and gives corporate CEOs a massive tax cut – and Susan Collins helps them do it after she helped him overturn Roe v.

Janet.'”\n\nAs the only GOP senator serving in a state won by former Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Democrats see Collins as the most vulnerable incumbent seeking reelection in the party’s quest to overcome an unfavorable midterm map and retake the majority.\n\nBut Collins has for decades fought off Republican and Democratic challengers, proving to be a formidable opponent as one of the most centrist and bipartisan members of the Senate. Her second-quarter campaign filings showed a steady stream of money from supporters, raising $2.4 million in the three-month period that ended with June and had $5.25 million cash on hand.\n\n“I won’t sit idly by while Maine people suffer, and politicians like Susan Collins bend a knee as if this were normal,” she said. “My life’s work has prepared me for this fight, and I’m ready to win this election will be a simple choice.”\n\nMills, a top recruit of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), is unable to seek a third consecutive term under Maine law but could seek a third nonconsecutive term in 2030. \n\nShe joins an already crowded field of other Democratic Senate hopefuls who are mostly political newcomers, including brewer Dan Kleban, oysterman Graham Platner, and former congressional aide Jordan Wood.

Mills plans to confront President Trump again with her campaign for the US Senate","text":"By THOMAS BEAUMONT and PATRICK WHITTLE\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The New England governor who told President Donald Trump to his face that she would see him in court now plans to challenge Maine’s Republican U.S. senator at the ballot box.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Janet Mills cited her White House confrontation with the Republican president in February as proof that she should serve in the Senate, a bid she formally announced with a campaign launch video Tuesday.\n\n“I’ll stand up to Trump, just as I did in February,” Mills said in a telephone interview previewing her campaign with The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nMills’ comment referred to Maine’s legal challenge to Trump’s executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports. She publicly resisted pressure from the president during an audience with him and other governors in February.\n\nMills says she’s running to help mount a broader resistance to Trump, who she complained has cut food and health care aid for children and low-income Americans in the enormous tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July. She said she’s also running to oust five-term Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who voted for the measure.\n\n“I think the moment demands a lot more than we’re seeing from Susan Collins,” Mills said in the interview. “It demands a fighter and someone who will stand up and fight for the future of democracy and fight for the interests of Maine people, just as I have done for my entire career.”\n\nDemocrats target Maine in 2026\n\nDemocrats face an uphill challenge in their effort to retake the majority in the Senate in next year’s midterm congressional elections. The party would need to gain a net of four seats, while Trump carried most of the states holding Senate elections next year.\n\nNational Democrats see Maine as an important target. It is in the only place on the 2026 Senate election map where Republicans are defending a seat in a state carried last year by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nMills ticked through a list of former Maine senators “who have a proud tradition of defending democracy against those who threatened it,” including Margaret Chase Smith, William Cohen, George Mitchell and Olympia Snowe. Smith, Cohen and Snowe served as Republicans, while Mitchell was a Democrat, though all were known to have crossed party lines.\n\nCollins has long cast herself as a reflection of Maine’s independent spirit but has frequently voted with Trump on key issues.\n\n“I see Susan Collins as failing to live up to that legacy and failing to meet this unprecedented moment with the strength and courage that it demands,” Mills said.\n\nThough Collins voted to convict Trump after his 2021 impeachment over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Mills points specifically to her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as pivotal to the court’s 2022 decision to overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade case, which handed decisions about whether abortion should be legal back to the states.\n\nMills also faults Collins for voting to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump’s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services. While Kennedy has espoused anti-vaccine policy and ousted public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mills said, “I’m taking action with other states to expand vaccines, for instance, and preserve our public health infrastructure.”\n\nRepublicans were ready for Mills’ entry into the race with their own video Tuesday. The National Republican Senatorial Committee accused her, among other things, of defying the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations of people in the country illegally and its executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports.\n\n“No, thanks, Janet,” the ad concludes.\n\nMills promotes transgender fight with Trump\n\nBut Mills’ campaign sees the fight over transgender rights as a strength.\n\nSpeaking to a group of governors in the State Dining Room, Trump called out the Maine governor, asking her “are you not going to comply” with the executive order on transgender athletes, to which Mills replied, “I’m complying with state and federal law.”\n\n“You better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any, any federal funding,” Trump responded.\n\nMills answered, “I’ll see you in court.”\n\n“Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one,” Trump shot back. “And enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”\n\nMills stoked Democratic enthusiasm in April when she said of the lawsuit Maine had filed against the Trump administration, “I’ve spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weaknesses.”\n\nIn May, the Trump administration agreed to reverse its decision to freeze federal money intended for a state child nutrition program over the state’s policy on transgender athletes.\n\nSpring ambivalence turns to autumn entry\n\nMills is barred by law from seeking a third term as governor. Throughout the spring and summer, she seemed to dismiss suggestions that she run for Collins’ Senate seat.\n\nA few other challengers have declared candidacies for the Democratic nomination, including oyster farmer Graham Platner, who has launched an aggressive social media campaign. Platner has the backing of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nMills points to the Republican-backed bill and its Medicaid cuts, a partial shutdown of the federal government entering its third week and still-high inflation as some of the reasons that ultimately compelled her to run.\n\n“The idea of being in D.C. for me is not something that’s fun,” she told the AP. “But the moment demands it.”\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Maine Gov.

Someone might want to alert American political leaders.\n\nIn the era of social media, Democratic and Republican politicians have grown hypersensitive, and responsive, to activists who seemingly live their lives online. Whether on X, formerly Twitter, where the right ruminates over every alleged infraction committed by the left and demands swift and often constitutionally questionable action, on Bluesky, where the echo-chamber boomerangs in the opposite direction, on Truth Social, where President Donald Trump ruminates over, well, everything, or on Facebook and TikTok, Democrats and Republicans appear only too eager to satisfy the digital mob, convinced that social media is simply a gathering place where constituents are communicating their priorities.\n\nThey’re wrong.\n\nI’ve long argued as much, based on years of traveling the country and talking to voters, including those interested enough in politics to attend campaign rallies or knock on doors for candidates. But fresh polling from the Democratic firm Global Strategy Group adds some data to bolster my conclusion.\n\nThe Democrats\n\nAs pollster Angela Kuefler explained during a presentation for Third Way, the centrist Democratic think tank in Washington that commissioned the survey, just 37% of Democratic primary voters post on social media platforms weekly, with 33% posting less often and 31% never posting.\n\nThat’s nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters — even at a moment of major political discontent and anxiety over Trump, to say nothing of the future of their party.\n\n“This is the most important slide,” Kuefler declared, as she introduced these findings to reporters last week, during an expansive PowerPoint presentation. How so? Because Kuefler’s (and Third Way’s) goal ahead of the 2028 presidential contest is to convince Democrats to stop choosing rhetoric and policy proposals based on what they’re hearing and reading from a minority of activist voters on social media.\n\n“People who post the most often,” Kuefler added, “are fundamentally different than the vast majority of these Democratic primary voters,” leading many elected Democrats to embrace “far left policies” that even most Democratic voters oppose, never mind the broader electorate.\nKamala Harris, the former vice president and 2024 Democratic nominee, might wish she’d had this data, and heeded that advice, when seeking the White House in 2020. But as mentioned, Democrats are hardly the lone offenders.\n\nRepublicans, too\n\nTop GOP figures, too, often mistake the rantings of right-wing activists and influencers for political gospel. But only a minority of GOP voters and those who lean Republican “regularly” rely on social media for news.\n\nAt 40%, Facebook is the most frequented social platform for news by Republicans and GOP leaners. At 14%, Elon Musk’s X is among the least used for news, per a Pew Research Center poll conducted in late August. This survey data matches my experience with Republican voters.\nBut to check my priors, I consulted with Washington Examiner columnist Salena Zito, who lives just outside Pittsburgh and covers Republican voters in Rust Belt battlegrounds (and elsewhere) like a hawk, and keenly understands their connection to Trump. Zito’s verdict?\n\n“It has been my experience as a reporter to take everything that I see online with a grain of salt. In other words, the audience tends to skew more toward people who are, what I call — and what other people call — ‘the very online,’” said Zito, author of “Butler: The Untold Story of the Near Assassination of Donald Trump and the Fight for America’s Heartland.” “What I see online rarely gives (an accurate view of) what I see with voters, in particular in the places that decide elections.”\n\n“What happens on social media does not dictate how people are feeling. There’s so much nuance that’s missing,” she added. “You really have to get on the ground and be much more granular with people as opposed to letting social media dictate how you think the country is feeling.”\n\nAmerican politics appears to be drowning in combative commentary and internet memes. Republicans revel in “owning the libs.” Prominent Democrats, intent on proving to their activist base that they’re fighting to stop Trump, have dialed up profanity in their rhetoric. And yet, none of this is how most voters, left or right, are living their lives day-to-day. Worried about the economy; illegal immigration; Trump’s multifaceted executive overreach? Absolutely. Angry and rude to their neighbors while fearing the end of the republic? Hardly.\n\nDuring the final weekend before Election Day last year, my colleagues at The Dispatch and I fanned out across the swing states. At both Harris and Trump rallies, we asked supporters of each candidate how they would react, and what they would do, if the opposing White House contender won. They told us they would be disappointed and yes, worried, about the future. But virtually all voters we interviewed told us they would go about their everyday lives and hope for the best while looking ahead to the next election — as they always have.\n\nOur leaders, and those interested in joining them in elected office, would do their political ambitions and the country well to realize that.\n\nDavid M.

I'm good at making peace,” he said to the BBC about his peace-making efforts at the Egyptian summit.\n\nTIME magazine has since released a cover depicting Trump’s ‘Triumph’, which accompanies an article detailing how the Republican administration ‘sealed’ the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n\nThe cover story also references envoy Steve Witkoff, former advisor and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and the ‘painstaking efforts’ they went through to ‘quiet one of the world's most destabilizing conflicts’.\n\nWhile the father-of-five has called the article ‘relatively good’, he has taken issue with the image the outlet chose to promote it.\n\nThe photograph is a low-angle shot of Trump taken outside, wearing his signature navy suit and red tie combo.\n\nDespite TIME magazine hailing the peace deal as a potential ‘signature achievement’ of his second term, and a ‘strategic turning point for the Middle East’, the POTUS is less than impressed.\n\n“Time Magazine wrote a relatively good story about me, but the picture may be the Worst of All Time,” he wrote via his social media site, Truth Social. “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one.\n\n“Really weird!”\n\nTrump remarked that he did not like taking pictures from ‘underneath angles’ and that the image the magazine used was ‘super bad’ and ‘deserved to be called out’.\n\n“What are they doing, and why?” he questioned.\n\nTrump first appeared on the cover of TIME in 1989 and is a two-time Person of the Year winner.\n\n“To be on the cover of Time as Person of the Year is a tremendous honor,” he told NBC in 2016. \"It means a lot, especially me growing up reading Time magazine. And, you know, it's a very important magazine.”\n\nHe made the cover again in 2024, beating out former Vice President Kamala Harris, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and podcast host Joe Rogan, among others.\n\nThe magazine claimed he was bestowed the crown for ‘marshaling a comeback of historic proportions, for driving a once-in-a-generation political realignment, for reshaping the American presidency and altering America's role in the world’.\n\nDespite being lauded by the outlet on multiple occasions, Trump appears to have a fickle relationship with TIME.\n\nIn 2015, he complained about not being chosen for the magazine cover during his first run for office, as the award went to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, writing at the time: “I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite. They picked a person who is ruining Germany.”\n\nHe'd also previously slated the magazine’s annual 100 Most Influential People list, branding it a ‘joke’ in 2013.","summary":"![CDATA[The POTUS called the image 'super bad' and said it deserved to be 'called out']]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/donald-trump-time-magazine-cover-criticism-451534-20251014","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/bltee9e0bcfb8ed562d/68ee10b7fa463c2b9c7a584b/trump-lashes-out-time-magazine-picture.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 09:28:08","author":"Ella Scott","authors":["Ella Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":369094056,"title":"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Selena Gomez, and the IMF—all on the same stage","text":"IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, who joined us fresh from the first day of the annual World Bank-IMF meetings, talked about how “the private sector is more agile, more adaptable” in this environment, comparing global trade to water: “You put [up an] obstacle, it goes around it.” \n\nSAIC chief Toni Townes-Whitley talked about the need to keep up with U.S. adversaries that are operating in “multiple modes” and can “use their entire industrial base.”\n\nAnd bestselling author Brené Brown talked about the need to develop new skills and reimagine leadership essentials for this new era, in a conversation that we recorded for the Leadership Next podcast.

Hamas also returned 4 dead bodies but said it was having difficulty locating 24 other corpses it kept during the war. Israel returned 1,700 Palestinian prisoners. President Trump addressed the Israeli parliament and urged the president to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been charged with corruption. Trump also complained about the way his hair looked on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nGoogle to build $15 billion AI center in India\n\nGoogle Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian announced Google’s biggest AI hub outside the U.S. on Tuesday.

He has accomplished what Former President Joe Biden could not. He did so not by punishing and scorning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Biden did, but by both reassuring him that the United States was a staunch ally and by putting pressure on him to accept an end to the war. This, on one side of the ledger, he combined on the other with wrangling America’s Sunni Arab partners to put unprecedented pressure on Hamas to surrender its hostages. Hamas was offered a choice between this deal or annihilation. It would have been nice if the terrorists had received both, but one can’t have it all.\n\nTrump celebrated on Monday, saying, “The Arab and Muslim world came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free.” He offered hope that these nations would now join the Abraham Accords and establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel.\n\nThis point must be emphasized: Trump has accomplished something of global significance and a profound strategic and moral worth. Anyone caviling at this is not arguing in good faith.\n\nThe president is derided by bien pensants as a clown and as dangerous, but in fewer than ten months since reentering office, Trump has ended a war and freed innocents held at death’s door while they and their families were pushed toward despair.\n\nTrump has also achieved the possibility that was unthinkable only a short time ago, that the Middle East might in the foreseeable future be defined not by perpetual chaos but by prosperous cooperation. Trump does not yet have a Nobel Peace Prize, but history will praise what he has just done.\n\nIt will think less of Trump’s domestic political opponents of past and present. As he made history on Monday, one of the most absurd Nobel Peace Prize laureates of all, Barack Obama, was pontificating about saving democracy and posting about his latest podcast appearance. Biden did not comment on the historic agreement. Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign challenger, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, continued flogging her book but grudgingly congratulated Trump while associating herself with those who baselessly claim that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza.\n\nTrump’s deal hugely benefits Israel. After two years and one week of war, the Jewish nation has been made whole again with its people. The agreement will bolster Israel’s diplomatic standing, reinforcing its regional strength. Hamas has been gutted, losing many thousands of commanders and rank-and-file terrorists, and vast reserves of armaments, funds, and facilities. The new agreement demonstrates the terrorist group’s isolation politically, even from key supporters Qatar and Turkey.\n\nThe region’s leading terrorist sponsor, Iran, is quiet after devastating U.S.-Israeli attacks on its nuclear program, and the disemboweling of its primary proxy, the Lebanese Hezbollah.\n\nTrump will have to live up to his pledge to ensure the peace holds into the second stage of negotiations, but the terrorists are weaker, having been forced to give up the hostages, their only leverage against Israel.\n\nThe Jewish state had to release 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, many of them terrorist murderers, to get their citizens back. By agreeing to a ceasefire, Israel also risks Hamas living to fight another day. But if hard-headed and patient diplomacy can see Hamas dismantled as a viable military and political force, this agreement will usher in a much better future for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.\n\nMoral history is measured not in posturing rhetoric but in physical results that improve lives. Trump has plainly secured a great victory. He has freed innocents, forced a terrorist group into diminished isolation, and crafted a credible new hope for a far better Middle Eastern future. There are difficult days ahead. But Trump can be proud, as he is, of what he has accomplished.\n\nThe president has shown that no conflict is beyond the resolution of his mediating influence. In the second stage of negotiations between Israel and Hamas, as with his diplomatic endeavors toward Ukraine, North Korea, and Iran, let us hope that Trump builds on this formidable success.","summary":"President Donald Trump celebrated the release of the final 20 Israeli hostages from Hamas dungeons on Monday, telling Israel‘s Knesset that “after two harrowing years of darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families.” Referring to the repatriation of the remains of hostages who died in Gaza, Trump [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3848222/trump-historic-vindication-israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25286438748074.jpg?w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 09:00:00","author":"Washington Examiner","authors":["Washington Examiner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068}]}
