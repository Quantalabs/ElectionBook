Lennon took to the platform after the Republican presidential nominee posted: ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT’ to Truth Social following the popstar’s official endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, declaring: ‘Hating on Taylor Swift is not a good look.’ Lennon, 48, said although he has never been a fan of Swift’s music, he acknowledges she is a ‘uniquely successful American.’ ‘A young woman who has done things in a way that no one has done before her. She is the kind of American that should be respected and in fact treasured,’ he wrote in the lengthy post. ‘We need more not less Taylor Swifts in our world. People who thrive continually and consistently are exactly the kind of person both parties should embrace,’ he urged. He then declared it is ‘not a good look’ for some ‘grumpy old dude’ to get angry at her. ‘A more “presidential” or gracious criticism might have been something like “She is a brilliant young woman. I have a lot of respect for what she has accomplished. I don’t believe she knows the reality of the party she is endorsing. I hope her fans are able to make up their own minds and understand the big difference between a talent in music and an understanding of politics or economics,”‘ he suggested. ‘Old man yells at moon is not a good look,’ he quipped, before saying he wasn’t endorsing either party in the November election. The next day, the late son of John Lennon returned to the platform to share had heard Swift’s 2014 hit Bad Blood – admitting he didn’t love it. ‘I can’t believe I forgot this one but I actually remember a Taylor song called Bad Blood (or something). I remember she rhymed “mad love” with “bad blood” and that kind of made me uncomfortable,’ he wrote in reference to the track. ‘This is only to say that it was not true I don’t know any songs,’ he clarified. ‘I know that one. I have nothing against her. I have a lot of respect for what she has accomplished. I certainly could never do what she does.’ Swift, 34, endorsed Harris and her vice-presidential candidate, Tim Walz, following the presidential debate on September 10. ‘I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,’ she wrote on an Instagram post. Swift signed her backing of Harris with ‘Childless Cat Lady,’ in reference to Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, who said in a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson that the U.S. is being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and ‘a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.’ The singer has a massive fanbase of Swifties and more than 283 million followers on Instagram. Her post endorsing Harris was liked more than nine million times in less than a day and could help drive support for Democrats. Previous posts from the star urging people to register to vote have been directly linked to an uptick in registrations as some of her biggest supporters closely monitor her every word. Trump responded to the endorsement saying he is ‘not a Taylor Swift fan.’ ‘I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time. She couldn’t… you couldn’t possibly endorse Biden. You look at Biden. You couldn’t possibly endorse him,’ he said on Fox & Friends the day after the presidential debate last week. He called Swift a ‘very liberal’ person and tried to brush off her backing Harris.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAlthough John Lennon&#8217;s son thinks Donald Trump should Shake It Off, he does admit he&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: John Lennon&#8217;s Son Opens Up About the Taylor Swift Lyric That Made Him Feel &#8216;Uncomfortable&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/john-lennons-son-opens-up-about-the-taylor-swift-lyric-that-made-him-feel-uncomfortable/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-John-Lennons-son-reveals-the-Taylor-Swift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 00:16:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":256741420,"title":"US Fed cuts key lending rate by jumbo half percentage point","text":"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point, the first cut in 4 1/2 years, in a major policy shift less than seven weeks away from the presidential election. After the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the central bank announced the decision to reduce the rate to the 4.75 to 5.0 percent range from its 23-year high, putting an end to its post-pandemic tightening cycle. FOMC members' new median economic projections showed that the federal funds rate would be cut to 4.4 percent at the end of this year -- a hint that the Fed could further lower the rate later this year. The rate reduction came as inflation has been getting closer to the Fed's target of 2 percent. Last month, annual consumer inflation fell to 2.5 percent. The latest median projections indicated that Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation may fall to 2.3 percent at the end of this year and 2.1 percent at the end of next year. During a press briefing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank has \"in fact begun the cutting cycle now\" while highlighting that the US economy is \"in a good shape.\" \"Our decision today is designed to keep it there. More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape. Our intention is really to maintain the strength that we currently see in the US economy,\" the chair said. \"We will do that by returning rates from their high-level ... We're going to move those down over time to a more normal level,\" he added. But he said \"no\" to a question of whether the central bank effectively declared a decisive victory over inflation. \"The goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis. We are close, but we are not really at 2 percent,\" he said. \"We are not saying mission accomplished or anything like that. But I have to say though we're encouraged by the progress that we have made.\" From March 2022 to July last year, the central bank raised the key rate 11 times under an aggressive campaign to cool inflation that hit a peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022. After the hikes, the Fed kept the rate steady eight consecutive times. This week's Fed rate cut put the gap between the key rates of South Korea and the United States at 1.5 percentage points. The timing of the rate cut has been anticipated by both consumers and businesses as it will lower their borrowing costs -- a reason why it has taken on political overtones during the election season. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump opposed a rate reduction close to the general election, saying in a Bloomberg News interview in May, \"It's something that they know they shouldn't be doing.\" But for his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, the rate cut could be a boost for her campaign given that the reduction signals that the fight against inflation has fared well. Mindful of the political discourse, Powell underlined that the Fed is not \"serving any politician\" but is working for \"all Americans.\" \"Countries that are democracies around the world ... all have what are called independent central banks, and the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors, maybe, people who are in office,\" he said. \"I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation. We do work to serve all Americans. We are not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing,\" Powell added. In a social media post, President Joe Biden commented on the rate reduction. \"We just reached an important moment: Inflation and interest rates are falling while the economy remains strong,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"The critics said it couldn't happen – but our policies are lowering costs and creating jobs.\" (Yonhap)","summary":"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point, the first cut in 4 1/2 years, in a major policy shift less than seven weeks away from the presidential election.

They’ve only hardened my resolve to use my time on Earth to make America great again for all Americans, to put America first,” said Trump, whose ear was grazed with a bullet at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania. “It was the second one in eight weeks by a violent radical-left mobster,” the ex-president said. “This evil would-be assassin got within a few 100 yards of where I stood. But thankfully, our outstanding Secret Service agent, and they are outstanding, spotted the barrel of his rifle in the bushes. Can you believe that?” “The reason I’m here,” Trump told the fawning audience, was because “we are going to win New York.” The over-the-moon audience included a woman who flashed her bare breasts while jumping around in the stands — before she was escorted out by police. “That’s the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it, and we’re going to do it,” added Trump, who made a similar claim in 2020 before losing to then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points. “We have to do it. We do it, and the election nationwide is over. We take over the White House and we fix up our country,” the ex-president said to the crowd of New Yorkers and residents of nearby states. “I say to the people of New York: With crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump! What the hell do you have to Lose?” he said. Of illegal immigrants in the Empire State, Trump said, “You got to get rid of these people. Give me a shot, you will have a safe, New York within three months… for every New Yorker being terrorized by this wave of migrant crime. November 5 will be your liberation day because you are living like hell.” The Post overheard crowd attendees saying Trump has to win the election but they fear Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, will somehow win in the end. Rally-goers included superfan Marlene Lowe, 48, of Harrison, NY, who came decked out in white cowboy boots, denim shorts and a T-shirt that said “Yes, I’m a Trump Girl – Get Over It!” “He’s hanging in there for us. It’s the least we can do for him. The man gets shot once, almost shot a second time, and he doesn’t miss a beat. Of course I wouldn’t miss an opportunity to see him up close in person. Maybe I can get him to sign my hat,” she said. Patrick Hill, 28, of Cherry Hill, NJ, said “he should have been dead twice, but here he is again. The man cannot be killed. Trump lives! Now let’s help him take this country back again and seal the border and undo the damage Biden wreaked on us over the past three-plus years.” Trump vowed not to hold a grudge against New York for its state officials prosecuting him in civil and criminal cases. “Despite all of the persecution I’ve endured from the corrupt judicial system in New York,” added Trump, who was convicted May 30 of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments, “I love the people of this state and I want to give back.” “I’m going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime and reduce your levels of stress,” he went on. “The only thing that I will increase are your incomes and your love for your state will come roaring back.” The Republican boasted of polls released Wednesday afternoon by the Teamsters union showing that nearly 60% of the union’s members supported his candidacy against Harris. “I was honored to receive the endorsement of the rank and file membership of the Teamsters. I love the Teamsters,” said Trump. Typically, he said, “it’s automatic, they endorse the Democrats automatic — for many, many decades. But you know what? They looked at her, they said, ‘We’re not going there, I’m sorry.’ These are tough people.” Trump used the speech to bash Harris’ performance on issues including the US-Mexico border — while entertaining his audience, including admitting he hadn’t read his wife’s forthcoming new memoir “Melania” because he was “so busy” and that ” if she says bad things about me, I’ll call you all up and I’ll say, ‘don’t buy it.'” The 45th president also announced that he was preparing to visit Aurora, Colo., where Venezuelan gang members have intimidated residents, and Springfield, Ohio, which has been inundated by Haitian migrants, whom Trump incorrectly said have been eating cats and dogs. Trump, who is in a close race against Harris in national and swing-state polls, at one point cited a survey showing him up 5% and opened that “we should be 35 up, to be honest with you. Some people can’t break an old habit. That’s really what it is.” “God has now spared my life — it must have been God, thank you — not once but twice,” Trump said. “We’re gonna have the greatest win in history while we pull this one off. It will be legendary..”","summary":"UNIONDALE, N.Y. — Former President Donald Trump basked in the adulation of thousands of supporters on Long Island Wednesday night — insisting that recent attempts to kill him had “hardened my resolve&#8221; and predicting he would be the first Republican candidate to win New York state in 40 years. &#8220;These encounters with death have not...","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/18/us-news/trump-tells-boisterous-long-island-rally-he-will-win-new-york-after-assassination-plots-hardened-my-resolve/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/trump-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 00:13:00","author":"Diana Glebova,Reuven Fenton,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Reuven Fenton","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":256741264,"title":"MAGA Fans at Vance Rally Boo Rate Cut That Will ‘Alleviate Inflation’","text":"A crowd assembled to hear Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance speak on Wednesday reacted strongly to a reporter’s question about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by half a percentage point, booing as the journalist pointed out that the move would take the strain off Americans struggling with rising prices. “Just on the Fed cutting—it’s a very Wall Street Journal-y question, but the Fed cut the interest rate today by a half a percentage point,” the reporter can be heard saying in footage of the Raleigh, North Carolina rally, “[that’s] going to alleviate inflation for a lot of people. And so if you have any reaction to that?” As the audience jeered, Vance replied, “Look, my reaction is… half a point is nothing compared to what American families have been dealing with for the last three years.” He smirked as the crowd whipsawed in the other direction, cheering. The Fed’s decision to lower interest rates by 50 basis points is its first such move since the early days of the pandemic, and comes after nearly two years of steady increases—11 times, for a total of 5.25 percentage points. An aggressive but widely expected move, the announcement is nevertheless a watershed moment for both the American economy and consumers on the ground, who should start to feel some financial strain taken off their wallets as the effects of the cut take hold. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to purchase goods, buy a house, or expand a business. They also inevitably lead to inflation as the market grows—hence the need for raising interest rates. But the pivot is an indicator of the central bank’s belief that the worst of inflation is over, as well as a stopgap measure for a slowing economy. It is unclear if more cuts are on the way, but Fed chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Wednesday that it was at least a possibility. “We’re going to take it meeting by meeting,” Powell said, according to The New York Times. “We made a good, strong start to this, and that is frankly a sign of our confidence, confidence that inflation is coming down.” Officials on both sides of the aisle used strikingly similar language in hailing the decision as a win, with Vice President Kamala Harris calling it “welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices” and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson as “welcome news for consumers.” Johnson tempered his reaction by challenging the Fed’s timing, calling it “suspect” that rates were slashed “right on the eve of an election.” Former President Donald Trump ran with that line of questioning during a Wednesday pitstop at a so-called “bitcoin bar” in New York City. “I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming they’re not just playing politics,” Trump said, referring to the central bank. “The economy would be very bad, or they’re playing politics, one or the other. But it was a big cut.”","summary":"Ronda Churchill/ReutersA crowd assembled to hear Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance speak on Wednesday reacted strongly to a reporter’s question about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by half a percentage point, booing as the journalist pointed out that the move would take the strain off Americans struggling with rising prices.\n\n“Just on the Fed cutting—it’s a very Wall Street Journal-y question, but the Fed cut the interest rate today by a half a percentage point,” the reporter can be heard saying in footage of the Raleigh, North Carolina rally, “[that’s] going to alleviate inflation for a lot of people.

The stolen non-public material had been acquired by the Iranian actors through cyber breaches. The hackers sent unsolicited emails to people connected to the Biden campaign in an effort to interfere with the 2024 election, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). According to a joint statement issued by the federal agencies, the emails “contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails.” While no responses from the recipients were reported, the federal agencies said Iranian hackers “have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump’s campaign to U.S. media organizations.” The FBI reiterated that these activities are part of Iran’s broader strategy to disrupt U.S. electoral processes and sow discord. Iran, along with Russia and China, is actively attempting to exacerbate societal divisions in the United States as the country approaches the November elections, the agencies said. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible,” the statement said. Authorities warned that foreign actors view the United States as vulnerable during elections and make efforts to undermine it. “Efforts by these, or other foreign actors, to undermine our democratic institutions are a direct threat to the U.S. and will not be tolerated,” the agencies said. The Trump campaign announced on Aug. 10 that Iranian hackers had stolen and leaked sensitive internal documents to media outlets including Politico, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. So far, none of the outlets have disclosed the contents. The Trump campaign issued a statement Wednesday urging Harris and Biden to clarify whether they used the hacked material. “This is further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror,” said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign national press secretary. Morgan Finkelstein, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign, said the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement. “We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,” Finkelstein said.","summary":"The FBI and other agencies said the hackers also attempted to send the stolen material to U.S. media outlets.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/fbi-iranian-hackers-tried-to-pass-hacked-trump-campaign-information-to-team-biden-5726596","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/11/id5722267-GettyImages-2171266186-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:59:59","author":"Caden Pearson","authors":["Caden Pearson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.505},{"id":256740772,"title":"California to test new law against AI-generated fake election videos","text":"SACRAMENTO, Calif. – California now has some of the toughest laws in the United States to crack down on election deepfakes ahead of the 2024 election after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed three landmark proposals this week at an artificial intelligence conference in San Francisco. The state could be among the first to test out such legislation, which bans the use of AI to create false images and videos in political ads close to Election Day. State lawmakers in more than a dozen states have advanced similar proposals after the emergence of AI began supercharging the threat of election disinformation worldwide, with the new California law being the most sweeping in scope. It targets not only materials that could affect how people vote but also any videos and images that could misrepresent election integrity. The law also covers materials depicting election workers and voting machines, not just political candidates. Among the three law signed by Newsom on Tuesday, only one takes effect immediately to prevent deepfakes surrounding the 2024 election. It makes it illegal to create and publish false materials related to elections 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter. It also allows courts to stop the distribution of the materials, and violators could face civil penalties. The law exempts parody and satire. The goal, Newsom and lawmakers said, is to prevent the erosion of public trust in U.S. elections amid a “fraught political climate.” The legislation is already drawing fierce criticism from free speech advocates and social media platform operators. Elon Musk, owner of the social media platform X, called the new California law unconstitutional and an infringement on the First Amendment. Hours after they were signed into law, Musk on Tuesday night elevated a post on X sharing an AI-generated video featuring altered audios of Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. His post of another deepfake featuring Harris prompted Newsom to vow to pass legislation cracking down on the practice in July. “The governor of California just made this parody video illegal in violation of the Constitution of the United States. Would be a shame if it went viral,” Musk wrote of the AI-generated video, which has the caption identifying the video as a parody. But it’s not clear how effective these laws are in stopping election deepfakes, said Ilana Beller of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization. The group tracks state legislation related to election deepfakes. None of the law has been tested in a courtroom, Beller said. The law’s effectiveness could be blunted by the slowness of the courts against a technology that can produce fake images for political ads and disseminate them at warp speed. It could take several days for a court to order injunctive relief to stop the distribution of the content, and by then, damages to a candidate or to an election could have been already done, Beller said. “In an ideal world, we’d be able to take the content down the second it goes up,” she said. “Because the sooner you can take down the content, the less people see it, the less people proliferate it through reposts and the like, and the quicker you’re able to dispel it.” Still, having such a law on the books could serve as a deterrent for potential violations, she said. Newsom’s office didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether Musk’s post violated the new state law. Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, author of the law, wasn’t immediately available Wednesday to comment. Newsom on Tuesday also signed two other laws, built upon some of the first-in-the-nation legislation targeting election deepfakes enacted in California in 2019, to require campaigns to start disclosing AI-generated materials and mandate online platforms, like X, to remove the deceptive material. Those laws will take effect next year, after the 2024 election.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. – California now has some of the toughest laws in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: California to test new law against AI-generated fake election videos first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/california-to-test-new-law-against-ai-generated-fake-election-videos/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/OCJTCGTQINF7DIXI55YVLEZJ5U.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:54:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.038},{"id":256740688,"title":"Iran hackers tried to interest Biden staff with stolen Trump campaign info, FBI says","text":"Iranian hackers sought to interest President Biden's campaign in information stolen from the rival campaign of former President Donald Trump, sending unsolicited emails to people connected to the Democratic president in an effort to interfere in the 2024 election, the FBI and other federal agencies said Wednesday.There's no evidence that any of the recipients responded, officials said, preventing the hacked information from surfacing in the final months of the closely contested election.The hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Mr. Biden's campaign before he dropped out.

US Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris is polling two percentage points ahead of Republican nominee and ex-US President Donald Trump, according to the results of a survey by Fox News TV. According to the poll, 50% of its participants are ready to support Harris at the presidential election, with 48% of those polled supporting Trump. The vice president has improved her positions since mid-August when she was one percentage point behind Trump, polling 49% to 50%. The survey was held from September 13 through 16 among more than 1,100 respondents nationwide. The margin of error is three percentage points. The US presidential election is slated for November 5.

JD Vance, criticized the state of the U.S. economy Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point in a move Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said was meant to keep the economy in “good shape.” Trump made the comment during a visit to a cryptocurrency-themed bar in New York City. (Photo by ... [+] Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Trump told reporters during a visit to a New York City bar the rate cut “shows the economy is very bad, to cut [interest rates] by that much, assuming [the Fed] is not just playing politics”—though the Fed makes its decisions independent of lawmakers, and Trump chose Powell to lead the central bank. The former president also called the decision to lower rates by 50 basis points “a big cut.” Inflation remains above the Fed’s long-term benchmark of 2%, but declined to 2.5% last month—the lowest rate since early 2021. Vance was asked for his reaction on the rate cut during a rally in North Carolina, provoking boos from the crowd before he said a half-point reduction “is nothing compared to what American families have been dealing with for the last three years.” Powell said Wednesday during a press conference the economy “is growing at a solid pace,” adding the rate cut was made to keep the economy in “good shape.” Powell also mentioned the status of inflation during the conference, saying it “is coming down” while the labor market remains “in a strong place.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

And I think that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2%, so I think that is what enables us to take this strong move today,” Powell said during the press conference. Contra House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday the “timing” of the cut “is a little suspect,” before adding the decision is “welcome news for consumers.” Vice President Kamala Harris called the move “welcome news for Americans.” Key Background The Fed has not slashed rates since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The reduction brings the federal fund rates down between 4.75% and 5% after it remained between 5.25% and 5.5% since last year, after the Fed moved to aggressively hike rates to combat decades-high inflation. Trump suggested months ago the Fed could cut rates before the election, telling Bloomberg a pre-election rate cut is “something that they know they shouldn’t be doing.” However, the move to lower rates coincided with the cooling of inflation and a rise in unemployment (the Fed usually increases rates when inflation swells), though the 50 basis point cut was on the upper end of consensus estimates. Powell said the decision involved “a lot of discussion back and forth” but, despite one dissenting vote within the Fed, there was “broad support” for slashing rates 50 basis points.

During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump gave airtime to a far-right conspiracy theory that insisted Haitian immigrants who had recently settled in Springfield were eating local pets. That story, which filtered into the Trump campaign by way of running mate JD Vance, is an admitted fabrication. That hasn't stopped a deluge of bomb threats and other disruptions in the town since the rumor took hold in GOP circles. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Republican mayor Rob Rue worried about the \"strain\" that a Trump visit would bring to Springfield. “It would be an extreme strain on our resources,\" he shared, per NBC News. \"So it’d be fine with me if they decided not to make that visit.\" Rue's comments follow a similar sentiment from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. Over the weekend, the Republican governor countered Trump's claims about immigrants eating pets and lauded recent immigrants to Ohio. \"What we know is that Haitians who are in Springfield are legal. They came to Springfield to work. Ohio is on the move and Springfield has really made a great resurgence,\" he said, during an interview with ABC This Week. Both President Joe Biden and Harris have countered Trump's claims about Haitian immigrants and accused the former president of spreading dangerous rhetoric. “This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop,” Biden said in a press conference at the White House last week.","summary":"Mayor Rob Rue worried that a Trump visit would strain the city after a week of threats brought on by Trump lies","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/09/18/fine-with-me-if-they-decided-not-visit-springfield-mayor-tells-stay-away-following-pet-lies/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/08/donald_trump_2165592768.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:31:40","author":"Alex Galbraith","authors":["Alex Galbraith"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":256739820,"title":"Psychologists explain the reasons behind Kamala Harris using different accents, following her recent use of a strange Spanish accent during a public appearance.","text":"Kamala Harris has raised eyebrows on the presidential campaign trail for using ‘fake accents’ that experts suggest could be a result of a confidence issue. Harris, who was born in California and spent some of her childhood in Canada, has been accused of putting on Midwestern, Southern and even French accents during depending on who her audience is. And just today, social media erupted after a video of the vice president appeared to speak with a Spanish twang while talking at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual Leadership Conference Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert, who owns a practice in New York, said there are two main reasons people alter their accents, which in psychology circles is known as ‘mirroring’ or the ‘chameleon effect.’ The latest ‘fake accent’ took Americans by surprise. Harris appeared to say ‘I love you back’ with a Spanish twang to a group of her supporters on Wednesday. Some do it out of empathy, so others find them trustworthy and to show they want to experience another person’s emotions. Others put on different accents to fit in because they feel like an outsider of a group and want to conform. Alpert told DailyMail.com that he thinks that is the case with Harris. ‘Using a fake accent could also be a result of feeling self-conscious around a particular group and feeling like she has to make changes to her baseline voice in order to be accepted – to some extent this a natural and normal way to handle people we might perceive as different than ourselves,’ Alpert said. ‘There’s a possibility she feels like she won’t fit in, so she overcompensates by taking this whole accent thing to the extreme. ‘I think there could be an element of Harris trying to gain acceptance across these different demographics. But again, I think it’s backfiring.’ As well as shaping her accent to suit certain groups, Harris has also been accused of shaping her policy stances to fit what is currently popular. In 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris endorsed the ‘defund the police’ movement in an interview with the hosts of the Ebro in the Morning show. This was a stark difference from when she ran for Attorney General of California in 2010, her ad production imitated the tense proficiency of a Law and Order episode. ‘Our justice system needs drastic repair,’ Harris said as she walked confidently with law enforcement officers, hair blowing in the wind as a helicopter buzzed overhead. She has also said that she would shut down Donald Trump’s border wall project and once called it a ‘medieval vanity project’ and a ‘waste of taxpayer.’ But in August, Harris has allegedly and suddenly vowed to sign a bill that would allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to continue building a wall along the southern border, according to a report. Harris was a major supporter of the Green New Deal in 2019, which call for public policy to address climate change, but this year she swore of off any prior assertion that she opposed fracking in a bid to win battleground Pennsylvania. While her shift in policies has come under fire over the years, her ‘fake accent’ has taken center stage in the last few months and some Americans have viewed it as superficial. ‘By altering her accent she might be perceived as inauthentic or manipulative and ultimately could undermine trust if the audience feels she is not genuine,’ said Alpert. ‘Authenticity is critical in building meaningful connections with the electorate and if people perceive the accent as disingenuous, it could damage Harris’s credibility. ‘In Harris’ attempt to connect with a specific group, there is a risk of alienating other audiences. ‘If her accent change is seen as pandering or insincere, it might alienate people who view it as a superficial attempt to fit in rather than a genuine expression of solidarity.’ Harris is not the only human to have put on a different speech, as many Americans have and some experts believe their is a social aspect to the chameleon effect – subconsciously replicating the physical actions of another human. Dr Nan Wise, a licensed psychotherapist who has appeared on The Today Show, said: ‘When you talk to children, you’re gonna sound different, right. ‘When you talk to old people, you’re gonna sound different. And even if you talk to people who are not native language speakers you automatically adjust.’ Dr Wise also noted that Harris’ strange accent is something ‘we humans do automatically kind of a matching and a mimicry, noting it is done unconsciously. ‘Human beings are very social animals, and some of this accommodation goes along with the way we’re wired to connect and to unintentionally mimic aspects of our social environments,’ she explained. However, a 2021 study led by the University of Pennsylvania found that code-switching is a thought-out behavior. Dr Wise also claimed that the accent makes Harris appear trustworthy, but Alpert suggested it could be doing the opposite. ‘By altering her accent she might be perceived as inauthentic or manipulative and ultimately could undermine trust if the audience feels she is not genuine,’ he said. ‘Authenticity is critical in building meaningful connections with the electorate and if people perceive the accent as disingenuous, it could damage Harris’s credibility.’ Harris put on the ‘fake accent’ during a press conference September 17 while speaking to in a discussion with the journalists at the National Association of Black Journalists. The code-switching, when a person alternates between languages in a conversation, is not a recent behavior for Harris as she adopted a languorous southern drawl during at a Georgia rally in July 2024. But years before in 2021, she was accused of slipping into a cod French accent while speaking to scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. The vice president is half Jamaican and half Indian, and spent her childhood in San Francisco and Canada. Danielle Wade, a licensed clinical social worker, wrote in MedicalNewsToday: ‘Some perceive it as a negative because it may reinforce stereotypes.’ But she noted that the behavior could be ‘a way of preserving one’s identity and culture.’ Harris is not the first presidential candidate to switch up their speech as Hilary Clinton came under fire for the same behavior during a 2015 campaign stop in Columbia, South Carolina. Clinton, who grew up in Chicago, put on a southern drawl during an event with minority women small-business owners. Dr Yalda Safai, a psychiatrist in New York City, said that Clinton has long tried to use fake accents to appear relatable, but ‘it just feel completely flat’ among American voters. On the other hand, Alpert explained how people respect political figures who are more true to themselves. ‘Bill Clinton, I thought, was masterful at that,’ he continued. ‘I thought he just resonated with whoever he was speaking to, from highly educated New Yorkers to poor people, he just he always seemed to be true to himself, and was widely accepted. ‘I think the same is true with Donald Trump. We’ve all heard the description, the Blue Collar billionaire. He just speaks his mind and is consistent across the different speeches and audiences.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris has raised eyebrows on the presidential campaign trail for using&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Psychologists explain the reasons behind Kamala Harris using different accents, following her recent use of a strange Spanish accent during a public appearance. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/psychologists-explain-the-reasons-behind-kamala-harris-using-different-accents-following-her-recent-use-of-a-strange-spanish-accent-during-a-public-appearance/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/18/18/89823131-0-image-m-13_1726679532805.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:27:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045},{"id":256740902,"title":"'Straight up fascist project': Vance slammed for vowing to call legal immigrants 'illegal'","text":"JD Vance, the junior Republican U.S. Senator who represents the people of Ohio, is on his tenth day of attacking the twelve to fifteen thousand legal Haitian immigrants in Springfield, after he spread the lie that 20,000 “illegal migrants” from Haiti were dropped on the city and started to steal the pet cats and dogs of its residents, and eat them. The claims have been so thoroughly debunked that The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday published a report: “How the Trump Campaign Ran With Rumors About Pet-Eating Migrants—After Being Told They Weren’t True.” “Estimates of the number of immigrants vary, but Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday that roughly 15,000 Haitians immigrated to Springfield over the past four years,” The Journal reports. “They were able to immigrate legally under a Biden administration policy granting Temporary Protected Status to Haitians as part of a program created by Congress in 1990 to protect immigrants from countries deemed too dangerous to return to.” That 1990 law, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), was signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush. But according to Senator Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee who has a law degree from Yale, the law is illegal and so are the Haitian immigrants, which is false. READ MORE: GOP Furious Trump-Appointed Fed Chair Cut Interest Rates ‘This Close to an Election’ At a small rally in North Carolina on Wednesday (full video), a Politico reporter told Senator Vance, “the majority of the Haitians in Springfield came under TPS, so they are here legally. And I know you’ve expressed a lot of your issues with the TPS program and wanting to change that under a Trump Vance administration, but I guess my question for you is, if you become the vice president under a Trump administration, what will you guys do about the migrants that are already there since they did arrive legally? And a follow up to that, if you plan to deport them, how would you do that legally?” Vance did not answer any of those questions. “Well, look,” he replied, seemingly frustrated, “this is, this is a media and Kamala Harris fact-check that I want to, I want to clarify and clear up right now.” “Now the media loves to say that the Haitian migrants, hundreds of thousands of them, by the way, 20,000 in Springfield, but hundreds of thousands of them all across the country, they are here legally.” “And what they mean is that Kamala Harris used two separate programs, mass parole and temporary protective status. She used two programs to wave a wand and to say, ‘we’re not going to deport those people here.’ Well, if Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I’m still going to call them an illegal alien. An illegal action from Kamala Harris does not make an alien legal. That is not how this works.” Senator Vance is wrong. First, that is exactly how it works. The Biden administration extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) (not temporary protective status, as Vance called it) twice, given the dire circumstances in Haiti. There is nothing “illegal” about the program, nor are the immigrants here under the program “illegal,” as the Ohio freshman senator falsely insists. Vance continued his remarks, to applause, calling the TPS program “completely bogus,” and “straight out of George Orwell.” “That makes her border policy a disgrace and I’m still going to call people ‘illegal aliens,'” Vance vowed, attacking Vice President Harris, as the audience cheered. “Who in this room, who in this country, consented to allowing millions of aliens to come into this country?” he asked, as some in the audience shook their heads no.

He used to love immigrants. Now he blood libels them. Just like how he used to call his idol Trump ‘an American Hitler,'” commented The Nation’s Dave Zirin. “This is just shocking,” declared former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. “Mr. Vance is blatantly calling a legal action illegal. I’ve studied my whole life how democracies break down. This is how it happens folks. I hope he really doesn’t believe this. Politicians say a lot of crazy things during elections. I fear he might.” “When you hear people refuse to make distinctions between legal and illegal immigration, it’s safe to assume they want to use the latter as a tool to go after the former,” observedattorney Mark R.

(AP) — California now has some of the toughest laws in the United States to crack down on election deepfakes ahead of the 2024 election after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed three landmark proposals this week at an artificial intelligence conference in San Francisco. The state could be among the first to test out such legislation, which bans the use of AI to create false images and videos in political ads close to Election Day. State lawmakers in more than a dozen states have advanced similar proposals after the emergence of AI began supercharging the threat of election disinformation worldwide, with the new California law being the most sweeping in scope. It targets not only materials that could affect how people vote but also any videos and images that could misrepresent election integrity. The law also covers materials depicting election workers and voting machines, not just political candidates. Among the three law signed by Newsom on Tuesday, only one takes effect immediately to prevent deepfakes surrounding the 2024 election. It makes it illegal to create and publish false materials related to elections 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter. It also allows courts to stop the distribution of the materials, and violators could face civil penalties. The law exempts parody and satire. The goal, Newsom and lawmakers said, is to prevent the erosion of public trust in U.S. elections amid a “fraught political climate.” The legislation is already drawing fierce criticism from free speech advocates and social media platform operators. Elon Musk, owner of the social media platform X, called the new California law unconstitutional and an infringement on the First Amendment. Hours after they were signed into law, Musk on Tuesday night elevated a post on X sharing an AI-generated video featuring altered audios of Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. His post of another deepfake featuring Harris prompted Newsom to vow to pass legislation cracking down on the practice in July. “The governor of California just made this parody video illegal in violation of the Constitution of the United States. Would be a shame if it went viral,” Musk wrote of the AI-generated video, which has the caption identifying the video as a parody. But it’s not clear how effective these laws are in stopping election deepfakes, said Ilana Beller of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization. The group tracks state legislation related to election deepfakes. None of the law has been tested in a courtroom, Beller said. The law’s effectiveness could be blunted by the slowness of the courts against a technology that can produce fake images for political ads and disseminate them at warp speed. It could take several days for a court to order injunctive relief to stop the distribution of the content, and by then, damages to a candidate or to an election could have been already done, Beller said. “In an ideal world, we’d be able to take the content down the second it goes up,” she said. “Because the sooner you can take down the content, the less people see it, the less people proliferate it through reposts and the like, and the quicker you’re able to dispel it.” Still, having such a law on the books could serve as a deterrent for potential violations, she said. Newsom’s office didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether Musk’s post violated the new state law. Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, author of the law, wasn’t immediately available Wednesday to comment. Newsom on Tuesday also signed two other laws, built upon some of the first-in-the-nation legislation targeting election deepfakes enacted in California in 2019, to require campaigns to start disclosing AI-generated materials and mandate online platforms, like X, to remove the deceptive material. Those laws will take effect next year, after the 2024 election.","summary":"By TR&#194;N NGUY&#7876;N SACRAMENTO, Calif.

Is that true?","text":"Former President Donald Trump regularly criticizes President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over what inflation is costing families, citing one figure in particular. At a Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13, Trump blamed Harris for causing “the worst inflation in American history, costing us and the typical family $28,000.” He also highlighted the $28,000 figure at recent rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona. Under President Biden, year-over-year inflation — or the pace of price increases — peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the highest monthly figure in about 40 years, but it has since cooled considerably. In August, inflation hit a three-year low of 2.5%. Lower inflation means the rate of price increases has slowed, but not that prices themselves have decreased. CBS News’ price tracker shows the cost of everyday household expenses remain higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. Economists told CBS News that Trump’s $28,000 figure is largely correct. Citing the figure on its own, however, ignores the crucial context that inflation led to income growth, not just price hikes. Data indicates that over the last three and a half years, many Americans have seen a net positive increase in their finances. Where the $28,000 figure comes from The estimate that inflation has cost the typical American household $28,000 since Mr. Biden took office is consistent with an inflation tracker from Republicans on Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. The tracker is based on government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of state-level personal consumption expenditures — one measure of spending on goods and services. The study tracked monthly costs for the average American household in each state since January 2021. From that point through July 2024, the average cumulative increase in household costs among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., was $27,950, due to inflation. In an update for August 2024, the increase rose to around $29,000. Economists told CBS News the estimate for the total increase in household costs in the last three and a half years is likely in the correct range. Experts generally agree that household costs have increased since January 2021, although the precise number differs depending on the specific metrics used. Comparing price increases under Trump and Biden The Republicans on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News they did not do a similar analysis of how household costs changed under Trump’s administration. Government data shows prices also grew under Trump, but by much less. The Consumer Price Index for all items increased by around 8% over Trump’s four years in office. By comparison, the total increase in consumer prices thus far under Biden is around 20%. Of course, the two faced markedly different economic circumstances during their time in the White House. While Trump’s administration enjoyed low inflation and healthy job growth for much of his time in office, the pandemic leveled the economy toward the end of his term. Early in the Biden administration, inflation reached modern highs as the economy recovered from employment and global supply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many other countries around the world also saw high inflation due to the pandemic — in some cases far higher than the U.S. The Federal Reserve believes keeping inflation at a low, stable rate of around 2% year-over-year is best for a well functioning economy where people and businesses can plan financially. It’s typical for prices to grow throughout a presidential term. A reduction in prices, or deflation, is generally not thought of as desirable by economists, and price increases are considered a feature of a healthy economy. How incomes have fared under Biden Economists say price increases should be compared to income increases to fully understand how inflation is affecting people’s finances. Mark Zandi of the independent Moody’s Analytics told CBS News that due to inflation, the median American household spent $905 more in August 2024 to purchase the same goods and services than they did in August 2021. However, the median household made $1,073 more in August 2024 than it did three years ago. Cumulatively, the Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News that their calculations show the average family earned $35,390 in additional wages and salaries between the start of Mr. Biden’s term and July 2024 — a figure that’s more than $7,000 greater than the total increase in household costs over that time period estimated by the committee’s Republicans. As of last year, Americans’ incomes had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census, in 2023, median household income rose a healthy 4%, to $80,610, on par with earnings in 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis. Another way to measure the financial health of Americans is to look at government data on real disposable personal income, which reflects after-tax income adjusted for inflation. This income figure includes not only wages and salaries but also income from investments and government subsidies. Disposable personal income has been higher on average during Mr. Biden’s term than it was in December 2020, Trump’s last full month in office. According to Gary Burtless, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, real disposable personal income per person has been above $49,407 — where it was in December 2020 — for 30 of the 43 months of Mr. Biden’s term so far. “Given that Americans’ actual real incomes have increased over the course of the Biden administration, it’s a little hard to see the basis for claiming that ‘inflation under Biden has cost the typical U.S. family $28,000,'” Burtless said.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump regularly criticizes President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over what inflation is costing families, citing one figure in particular.  At a Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13, Trump blamed Harris for causing &#8220;the worst inflation in American history, costing us and the typical family $28,000.&#8221; He also highlighted the $28,000 &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump says inflation has cost households $28,000 under Biden and Harris.

Claims of pet killing have been chalked up to mere racism.

But flipping the script such that “the suffering of the people of Springfield” refers to a group of people warding off insults is not fair to the one suffering from housing and education inaccessibility. Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) has stated that none of the bomb threats, which make up most of the perceived violence, have had “any validity at all” and that the threats have been made by foreign actors. Pieces that ignore DeWine’s clarifications are inconsistent with their allegiance to the Springfield city manager’s statement that there have been “no credible reports” of pet harm. Of course, this is typical misdirection. In ignoring the difficulties caused by a massive influx of immigrants, the media can avoid the fact that no other place wants the same for itself. Liberal elites successfully moving illegal immigrants out of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, show their own spin on NIMBYism.

It was also the largest lead for any presidential candidate since Biden held a 5-point advantage over Trump one year ago.The apparent polling boost, coming on the heels of what most viewed as a winning debate performance for Harris, appears to have been fueled in part by the Democrat achieving her largest-ever leads among millennial voters, white voters and men.The newest edition of the poll, conducted earlier this week, finds that 47 percent of male registered voters now support the vice president—a significant improvement from the 39 percent who backed her when she first entered the race.Harris has also gained 6 points of support from all white voters since Biden dropped out of the race, climbing from 36 percent in July to 42 percent in the newest poll.A larger boost for the Democrat came from millennials, with a 57 percent majority of voters age 30 to 44—a group mostly consisting of millennials—saying in the new poll that they prefer Harris, while only 45 percent backed her in July.Additionally, support for Harris has substantially improved among Black and Hispanic voters since July, with the vice president garnering support from 78 percent of Black registered voters and 60 percent of Hispanic registered voters in the latest poll.Only 44 percent of Hispanic voters and 63 percent of Black voters supported Harris in July. Hispanic support for Harris was at an all-time high in the new poll, while the vice president saw her highest figure of support among Black voters, 81 percent, in late August.Trump held advantages over Harris among voters age 45 and older in the new poll. However, the only demographic groups that showed majorities supporting the former president were white voters at 52 percent and voters 65 and older at 55 percent.The poll also showed that Harris received an overall 4 percent post-debate bump in support—the vice president and former president were tied at 45 percent just before meeting in Philadelphia on September 10.Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns via email on Wednesday.The new poll was conducted among 1,445 registered U.S. voters from September 15 to September 17, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent. Previous editions of the weekly poll each had margins of error of 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent among registered voters.An average of recent national polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight shows Harris leading Trump by 3.3 percentage points as of Wednesday evening, while an average from RealClearPolitics shows the vice president leading by 2 points.On the day of the debate, Harris was leading Trump by 2.5 points in the FiveThirtyEight average and 1.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average.","summary":"The vice president was handed her biggest lead over former President Donald Trump in a poll released on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-surging-three-key-groups-polls-show-1955988","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2474887/kamala-harris-three-key-groups-poll-boost.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:14:59","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":256739342,"title":"Iranian hackers tried but failed to interest Biden campaign in stolen Trump info, FBI says","text":"Iranian hackers sought to interest US President Joe Biden’s campaign in information stolen from rival Donald Trump’s campaign, sending unsolicited emails to people connected to the Democratic president in an effort to interfere in the 2024 election, the FBI and other federal agencies said on Wednesday. There is no evidence that any of the recipients responded, officials said, preventing the hacked information from surfacing in the final months of the closely contested election. The hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Biden’s campaign before he dropped out. The emails “contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former president Trump’s campaign as text in the emails”, according to a US government statement. The announcement is the latest effort to call out what officials say is Iran’s brazen, ongoing work to interfere in the 2024 election, including a hack-and-leak campaign that the FBI and other federal agencies linked last month to Tehran. The US Justice Department has been preparing charges in that breach, Associated Press has reported. The FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have said the Trump campaign hack and an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign are part of an effort to undermine voters’ faith in the election and to stoke discord. The Trump campaign disclosed on August 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets – Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post – were leaked confidential material from inside the Trump campaign. So far, each has refused to reveal any details about what it received. Politico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source – an AOL email account identified only as “Robert” – passed along what appeared to be a research dossier that the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. The document was dated February 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. In a statement, Morgan Finkelstein, a spokeswoman for Kamala Harris’ campaign, said the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement since learning that people associated with Biden’s team were among the recipients of the emails. “We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,” Finkelstein said.","summary":"Nobody on the US president’s team is known to have responded to the unsolicited emails offering the hacked material.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3279061/iranian-hackers-tried-failed-interest-biden-campaign-stolen-trump-info-fbi-says","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/19/f31c071b-8501-4af3-8418-11cddb0b7b05_3358ce1a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:13:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.653},{"id":256739420,"title":"Elon Musk boosts fake Trump rally bomb threat and false claims about the election","text":"Elon Musk is using his social media platform to promote misinformation about the U.S. presidential candidates in the lead up to the November election, amplifying false claims Wednesday about a Trump rally bomb threat and immigrants eating pets in Ohio. While Musk’s posting of provocative, incendiary content on X is nothing new, the speed with which he has promoted false claims in recent days is striking given the breadth of Musk’s digital reach, with his posts regularly finding their way atop users’ feeds. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App The most prominent of Musk’s conspiratorial posts came in the wake of an alleged second assassination attempt on former U.S. president Donald Trump, after which Musk wrote in a now-deleted X post that “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.” After much backlash, Musk, who has pledged his support for Trump, ultimately deleted his post, stating that it was meant as a “joke.” During the same weekend, however, Musk also joined a chorus of conspiracy-minded X users circulating a hoax “affidavit” from a purported “whistleblower” that claimed last week’s ABC News debate was rigged to help Kamala Harris. ABC has since confirmed the typo-ridden document was fake. Then on Wednesday, Musk reshared a bogus claim that a bomb had been discovered near the site of a planned Trump rally in Long Island. Police said in a statement that “reports of explosives being found at the site are unfounded.” While Musk’s pithy reaction to the fake threat is still live on X, the initial post has since been deleted. Musk’s own post has been earmarked with a crowd-sourced “community notes” fact-check that makes clear the claim was false. Still, in the post’s first two and a half hours, it garnered 4.3 million views and was reshared 9,800 times. Also on Wednesday, Musk reshared a video falsely claiming the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, admitted in March that there had been reports of Haitian immigrants eating pets, captioning the post “Always Be Cheating News,” a clear knock on ABC’s moderators, who had fact-checked Trump’s false claims on the matter at the debate. The edited video instead showed a Springfield resident sharing that he had heard unconfirmed reports about domesticated animals being harmed. Both the city’s mayor and manager both state during the hearing they have seen no proof of such claims. Musk’s post, which boosted false claims about Haitian immigrants that have been promoted by Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, leading to dozens of bomb threats at schools and municipal buildings in the Ohio city, garnered more than 7.9 million views and 36,000 reshares. Top science and technology headlines, all in one place Hours later, Musk shared a map purporting to be from Nate Silver, the renowned statistician and FiveThirtyEight founder, projecting a 312-226 electoral college victory for Trump in November, saying the election was “trending well.” The map, however, was a fake. The real map from Silver’s newsletter platform, “Silver Bulletin,” published Wednesday shows several states in play, including Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Silver himself noted that “the race is really a tossup” in the post. Meanwhile, in simulations from FiveThirtyEight, which Silver parted ways with last year, Harris was forecast to win the election in 64 out of 100 simulations. X did not respond to a CNN request for comment Wednesday on Musk’s posts. Musk is far from the only figure spreading false information on the platform, though he is easily one of its biggest voices. Many of the bogus claims propelled by the billionaire in recent days were also buoyed by other major right-wing voices. Since acquiring Twitter in 2022, Musk has gutted the company’s moderation teams and altered its policies, allowing misinformation and hate speech to spread on the platform. Musk also reinstated the accounts of previously banned conspiracy theorists, created financial incentives to post viral content, and ended the legitimacy of verified badges. But the combination of Musk’s 198 million-strong following coupled with an algorithm boosting his posts has elevated false claims that would typically be confined to less visible corners of the internet. Though Musk has styled himself as a free-speech absolutist, his tendency to champion posts from fringe, right-wing voices while regularly attacking news organizations and journalists presents a major issue for voters seeking reliable information online during an already-turbulent election period.","summary":"Elon Musk is using his social media platform to promote misinformation about the U.S. presidential candidates in the lead up to the November election, amplifying false claims Wednesday about a Trump rally bomb threat and immigrants eating pets in Ohio.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/elon-musk-boosts-fake-trump-rally-bomb-threat-and-false-claims-about-the-election-1.7043513","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/9/18/elon-musk-posts-fake-news-1-7043527-1726700820280.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:13:00","author":"CNN","authors":["CNN"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":256739136,"title":"Brett Favre Uses Patrick Mahomes to Take Shot at Taylor Swift","text":"Former Green Bay Packers legend and Hall of Famer Brett Favre is not a fan of celebrities using their status to influence political opinions.

A Kremlin-aligned group, dubbed Storm-1516 in the report, created a fake San Francisco-area website in August to publish a video featuring a paid actor talking about the alleged incident. In the video, a young Black woman claimed she “cannot remain silent anymore.” The site was taken down shortly after being created, and a CBS News fact-check found no public records, news reports, or police information to back up the 2011 story, but that didn’t stop millions of people from seeing it on social media, according to the report. “As the election approaches, people get more heated,” Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “People tend to take in information from sources they don’t really know or wouldn’t even know to evaluate.” The troll farm also posted a fake video showing two Black men beating up a bloodied white woman at a Trump rally. Another Russian group, meanwhile, allegedly spread online claims about Harris’s stance on gender-affirming surgeries, using images of a fake Times Square billboard. The Independent has contacted the Harris campaign and the Russian Embassy in the U.S. for comment. On Monday, Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta said it was banning Russian state media organization from its platforms. “After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,” Meta said in a statement. Russian officials told the AP “Such selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable.” Earlier this month, Dimitri Simes, a Russia expert and former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, was indicted for allegedly breaking U.S. sanctions by working for Russian state TV.

It is in the Global South. It is in technology. We need to step up our game across the board.\"President Joe Biden's administration has been pressing China about technology exports to Russia that US officials say have allowed Moscow to ramp up military production for its war in Ukraine.\"The challenge is, we've got to get more support here on this,\" Campbell said of US sanctions on Chinese firms, an issue he said he has been raising on visits to Europe.Campbell said that most of Washington's European allies shared concerns on China's ties with Moscow but were still reeling from the \"huge shock\" of slashing energy imports from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.\"For many of these countries, doing business with China has been a big deal for 15 or 20 years,\" he said.Acting on China, after Russia, could feel like \"kind of a one-two punch. You can understand leaders in Europe have some anxieties.\"China argues that, unlike the United States, it is not providing weapons to either Russia or Ukraine, but Washington says Beijing is providing support that has military uses.Campbell's tough talk comes despite easing tensions between the United States and China under Biden, with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump more frequently speaking in Cold War terms about confronting Beijing.Biden and his political heir Kamala Harris have supported dialogue with China even as their administration presses ahead with tough measures including a sweeping ban on exports of advanced chips.Since a summit last year between Biden and President Xi Jinping in California, China has agreed to key US requests of restoring military communications and cracking down on ingredients in fentanyl, the drug behind a US overdose epidemic.Campbell contended that the Biden administration has strengthened the US position since taking over from Trump, in part by bolstering alliances. \"Four years ago, the general view globally was that China had eaten our lunch, that they were going to surpass us, economically and commercially, that we were in the midst of some sort of hurtling decline,\" he said. \"I do not think that is what the general belief is today.\"Meeting another key ask of the Biden administration, China freed an American pastor, David Lin, who had been detained since 2006, the State Department confirmed Sunday.The United States had raised the case of Lin and other detained Americans with China, including when Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of a meeting in Laos in July. The State Department considers two other US citizens, Kai Li and Mark Swidan, to be wrongfully detained by China, but activists say far more Americans are behind bars or prohibited from exiting. The mother of Swidan, detained over drug trafficking charges he denies, told a separate congressional hearing that Biden needs to engage with China on its proposals to free him.\"His case is a clear injustice, yet it continues to be ignored by those with the power to act,\" she said in a statement to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.Peter Humphrey, who was detained with his wife in China from 2013 to 2015 and has since become a specialist on such cases, said a \"massive number\" of Americans cannot publicly raise their cases for fear of retribution by Beijing.He said he was held with 11 other men in a packed cell with no privacy or furniture, sleeping on the floor and eating from dog bowls pushed under the bars.He said he lost 22 pounds (10 kilos) while in detention, which he described as \"torture designed to crush the human spirit and force out a confession.\"","summary":"China presents the top challenge to the United States in all of its history, surpassing the Cold War, a top US official said Wednesday, as he urged Europe to get tougher on Beijing.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/china-top-challenge-us-history-senior-diplomat-1851724","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1860277/kurt-campbell-now-us-deputy-secretary-state-speaks-next-senior-south-korean-official-kim.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:06:17","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.145},{"id":256739140,"title":"Kamala Harris Takes Lead Over Trump in Fox News Poll","text":"A new Fox News national poll shows that Vice President Kamala Harris is beating former President Donald Trump by 2 percentage points.The survey shows a 3-point shift among registered voters in their feelings around the candidates in the 2024 presidential election since August.Last month, Trump had a 1-point advantage, but now Harris is ahead by 2 points. The Democratic candidate was polling at 50 percent of favorability in the Fox survey, while her opponent received 48 percent of the support.Trump supporters—72 percent—say they like his policies and record. Almost 20 percent say they \"simply dislike Harris.\"Harris' supporters are a bit more mixed, with 42 percent liking her policies and record, 24 percent liking her character, and 33 percent backing her because they dislike Trump.The new polling comes after multiple events that could have provided additional support to Harris. The Democratic National Convention was held in August. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the presidential race and shared his support for Trump, with Kennedy's name being removed from some of the ballots throughout the country. Harris has received endorsements from politicians like Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Representative Liz Cheney, as well as celebrities like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish.Trump also faced an apparent second assassination attempt.The biggest changes, according to the Fox polling, come from the independent and Hispanic voters.In August, independent voters favored Trump by 8 points. They now favor Harris by 12 points.Last month, Hispanic voters favored Trump by 6 points. They are now favoring Harris' campaign by 12 points.\"It is important to remember that estimates among small subgroups are more volatile and tend to swing more than others, and that applies here,\" Fox noted.In August, Fox also shared that Harris was closing the gap with Trump in the Sun Belt states, which includes Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas as well as battleground states like Georgia, South Carolina, Arizona and Nevada.Harris also holds onto many of Biden's voters from the 2020 election, with 93 percent of his voters, according to Fox. Trump also, however, is keeping nearly all of his voters from four years ago, at 94 percent. Among 2020 non-voters, Harris is up by 3 points.\"Harris' advantage over Trump on a variety of personal traits is clearly helping her,\" says Shaw. \"It's a big deal that she's been able to fight to a draw on protecting free speech despite aggressive Republican efforts to highlight the Biden administration's censorship of right-leaning views on social media.\"This also marks the first time that Harris has hit 50 percent support in the Fox polls since she stepped up to become the presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket.Even still, Daron Shaw, a pollster who conducts Fox News surveys, suggests that Trump may still win the Electoral College.\"Our best estimates are that if Trump is within 2 points of Harris nationally then he will likely win in the Electoral College,\" Shaw said. \"These data showing a Trump edge in the key counties and battleground states suggest that's probably right.\"","summary":"The Democratic candidate has received 50 percent of the potential vote for the first time since joining the ticket.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-kamala-harris-donald-trump-polling-1956031","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2474887/kamala-harris-three-key-groups-poll-boost.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:05:43","author":"Monica Sager","authors":["Monica Sager"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":256738994,"title":"Trump says inflation has cost households $28,000. Is that true?","text":"Former President Donald Trump regularly criticizes President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over what inflation is costing families, citing one figure in particular. At a Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13, Trump blamed Harris for causing \"the worst inflation in American history, costing us and the typical family $28,000.\" He also highlighted the $28,000 figure at recent rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona.Under President Biden, year-over-year inflation — or the pace of price increases — peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the highest monthly figure in about 40 years, but it has since cooled considerably. In August, inflation hit a three-year low of 2.5%. Lower inflation means the rate of price increases has slowed, but not that prices themselves have decreased. CBS News' price tracker shows the cost of everyday household expenses remain higher compared to pre-pandemic levels.Economists told CBS News that Trump's $28,000 figure is largely correct. Citing the figure on its own, however, ignores the crucial context that inflation led to income growth, not just price hikes. Data indicates that over the last three and a half years, many Americans have seen a net positive increase in their finances.Where the $28,000 figure comes fromThe estimate that inflation has cost the typical American household $28,000 since Mr. Biden took office is consistent with an inflation tracker from Republicans on Congress' Joint Economic Committee. The tracker is based on government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of state-level personal consumption expenditures — one measure of spending on goods and services. The study tracked monthly costs for the average American household in each state since January 2021. From that point through July 2024, the average cumulative increase in household costs among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., was $27,950, due to inflation. In an update for August 2024, the increase rose to around $29,000.Economists told CBS News the estimate for the total increase in household costs in the last three and a half years is likely in the correct range. Experts generally agree that household costs have increased since January 2021, although the precise number differs depending on the specific metrics used. Comparing price increases under Trump and BidenThe Republicans on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News they did not do a similar analysis of how household costs changed under Trump's administration.Government data shows prices also grew under Trump, but by much less. The Consumer Price Index for all items increased by around 8% over Trump's four years in office. By comparison, the total increase in consumer prices thus far under Biden is around 20%. Of course, the two faced markedly different economic circumstances during their time in the White House. While Trump's administration enjoyed low inflation and healthy job growth for much of his time in office, the pandemic leveled the economy toward the end of his term. Early in the Biden administration, inflation reached modern highs as the economy recovered from employment and global supply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many other countries around the world also saw high inflation due to the pandemic — in some cases far higher than the U.S.The Federal Reserve believes keeping inflation at a low, stable rate of around 2% year-over-year is best for a well functioning economy where people and businesses can plan financially. It's typical for prices to grow throughout a presidential term. A reduction in prices, or deflation, is generally not thought of as desirable by economists, and price increases are considered a feature of a healthy economy. How incomes have fared under BidenEconomists say price increases should be compared to income increases to fully understand how inflation is affecting people's finances.Mark Zandi of the independent Moody's Analytics told CBS News that due to inflation, the median American household spent $905 more in August 2024 to purchase the same goods and services than they did in August 2021. However, the median household made $1,073 more in August 2024 than it did three years ago.Cumulatively, the Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News that their calculations show the average family earned $35,390 in additional wages and salaries between the start of Mr. Biden's term and July 2024 — a figure that's more than $7,000 greater than the total increase in household costs over that time period estimated by the committee's Republicans.As of last year, Americans' incomes had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census, in 2023, median household income rose a healthy 4%, to $80,610, on par with earnings in 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis. Another way to measure the financial health of Americans is to look at government data on real disposable personal income, which reflects after-tax income adjusted for inflation. This income figure includes not only wages and salaries but also income from investments and government subsidies. Disposable personal income has been higher on average during Mr. Biden's term than it was in December 2020, Trump's last full month in office. According to Gary Burtless, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, real disposable personal income per person has been above $49,407 — where it was in December 2020 — for 30 of the 43 months of Mr. Biden's term so far.\"Given that Americans' actual real incomes have increased over the course of the Biden administration, it's a little hard to see the basis for claiming that 'inflation under Biden has cost the typical U.S. family $28,000,'\" Burtless said.","summary":"Economists told CBS News the calculation is incomplete, since average household incomes have also risen over that time period.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-inflation-cost-households-28000-biden-harris-fact-check/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/30/28b7538d-d1e6-4469-a72a-b90b86de6cf6/thumbnail/1200x630/8b2f5fa9eeb54071a624f4a39c333d7e/gettyimages-2168336208.jpg?v=1736e554a81339b452bb43c01c071a51","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3186163_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:04:54","author":"Laura Doan","authors":["Laura Doan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.542},{"id":256741378,"title":"New poll: Republicans disagree with Trump and want him to debate again","text":"Last Thursday, Donald Trump ruled out a second presidential debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Republican voters disagree with him. A new Civiqs poll conducted for Daily Kos poll shows that a plurality of Republican voters (46%) think there should be another debate, while 42% think there shouldn’t. But that’s not the only aspect of the debate where Trump and his voters don’t quite see eye to eye. “Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris,” he insisted on his Truth Social platform. Those polls Trump was touting—like a web poll from the far-right outlet Newsmax—aren’t exactly high-quality polls. But Republicans aren't as enthusiastic about Trump's supposed win as he is. The new Civiqs poll finds that only 66% said Trump won, while 12% said Harris won. That’s a stark difference from Democratic voters' view of the debate: 94% think Harris won, and only 2% think she lost. Given how polarized America’s politics are, you wouldn’t expect a 28-percentage-point gulf between partisans saying their candidate won a debate. In other words, Democratic voters felt much better about their candidate’s debate performance than Republicans did about their candidate. Of course, Trump has experience in turning off even his most loyal supporters. A recent Wall Street Journal article found that people are indeed leaving Trump's rallies early, as Harris claimed and Trump disputed during the debate. And those early exits are likely due to how much time he spends rambling incoherently about things like “the late, great Hannibal Lecter” and how bitter he still is about losing the 2020 election. The New York Times found that at three recent rallies, his speeches averaged over an hour and a half, with folks dipping out the longer he rambled. “We thought it was our best debate ever—it was my best debate ever, I think, and it was very interesting,” Trump said in the media spin room following the Sept. 10 debate.

In a speech Friday, Trump said, “I’m angry about illegal Haitian migrants taking over Springfield, Ohio,” even though the majority of the Haitians in Springfield are there legally. In an interview on Sunday, Vance left the impression that he was making things up to amplify the smear against Springfield’s Haitian community: “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.” What Trump is doing is important to the outcome of the election, and it’s not simply the usual race baiting aimed at charging up part of his base. He has failed for weeks to come up with an effective line of attack against Kamala Harris. But with Springfield, he has found a fear-driven argument that places the issue of immigration right into the town square of a Midwestern city in one of the most electorally important states, and it looks like he and Vance see this as a more potent argument than just talking about the Southern border: There’s reason to believe that they’re trying to stoke public anger and garner public support around immigration policies that Trump promoted in his first term and that he presumably hopes to act on in a second.","summary":"The Springfield fable is part of a crusade to throw immigrants out of the country.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/trump-haitians-immigration-springfield.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/tfbg/tfbg-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:00:11","author":"Charles M.

Since tying the knot in 2022, the couple now share two children, Sterling and Patrick, and are excitedly expecting their third. \"Happy Birthday to one of the greatest humans ever, my husband, best friend and the best daddy ever! \" she gushed on Instagram. \"We are so grateful you are ours! We Love Youuuuuu.\" The Instagram tribute featured a series of adorable snaps showcasing the couple's blissful life with their young and expanding brood. Brittany went all out for the occasion, decking their home with an extravagant balloon display. Among the guests was none other than Taylor Swift, the pop icon dating Pat Mahomes' Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce, quashing any speculation of a feud. Last season saw Brittany and Swift often side by side as the Chiefs clinched consecutive Super Bowl victories. However, this season has seen a change, with the pair not spotted together at Chiefs games, including the recent nail-biting 26-25 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals at Arrowhead. The rumour mill spun into overdrive when Mahomes liked a policy picture of former President Donald Trump on Instagram, while Swift is known for her support of Vice President Kamala Harris, sparking talk of a potential rift. However, it's reported that Brittany is reconsidering her support for the ex-President after he expressed his dislike for Swift, following her endorsement. A source revealed to Mail Online: \"This deeply bothered Brittany because Taylor is like a sister to her and she has done absolutely nothing wrong. She didn't mention Trump in her post and is allowed to speak her mind.\" Swift was snapped at the event alongside fellow Chiefs WAGs Chariah Gordon and Sheawna Weathersby, who are partners of Chiefs stars, Mecole Hardman and Chris Jones.

The powerful union decided to stay neutral in a presidential race for the first time in over a quarter-century - despite releasing internal polling of the union's rank-and-file membership showing majority support for Trump. And the populist former president and his campaign quickly spotlighted the strong support among union workers. \"It's a great honor. They're not going to endorse the Democrats. That's a big thing,\" Trump told reporters shortly after the Teamsters announcement, during a stop in New York City ahead of holding a rally on nearby Long Island. DAVID MARCUS: WHY TEAMSTERS MEMBERS THINK TRUMP, NOT HARRIS, IS THE REAL FRIEND OF THE WORKING MAN In a release titled \"Union Workers Support President Donald Trump,\" the campaign highlighted the former president's more than 25-point margin over the vice president in both on-line and phone survey's of Teamsters members. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued in a statement that \"the hardworking members of the Teamsters have been loud and clear — they want President Trump back in the White House! These hardworking men and women are the backbone of America and President Trump will strongly stand up for them when he’s back in the White House.\" The powerful union, which has over one million members in the U.S. and is deeply connected to working-class voters in the key Midwestern general election battlegrounds and in other swing states across the country, until now had endorsed the Democratic candidate for president in every election since 1980. And the Teamsters became the only one of the nation's top ten not to back Harris in the 2024 presidential showdown. Asked if the move by the Teamsters will impact the election, Trump said \"I think it will. Yeah, I think so. The Teamsters carry a lot of weight.\" Trump's support among Teamsters has surged since Harris replaced President Biden at the top of the Democratic Party's 2024 ticket two months ago, the union's data indicated. The union's polling prior to Biden dropping out showed the president was ahead of Trump among members, 44.3% to 36.3%. DNC APPARENTLY SNUBS TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT FOLLOWING HIS HISTORIC RNC SPEECH Biden made history as the first president to walk the picket lines with striking workers. In explaining the reasoning for declining to endorse a 2024 presidential candidate on Wednesday, the union said in a statement, \"The union’s extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump.\" Teamsters general president Sean O'Brien said that \"neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business.\" \"We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges,\" O’Brien added. O'Brien, speaking to reporters on Monday after the union’s executive board meeting with Harris [the board met earlier this year with Trump and separately with Biden], said that the polling of the rank and file members would be an important factor – but not the only factor in whether they would endorse – and if so – whom they would endorse. UNION LEADER'S PROVOCATIVE RNC SPEECH DRAWS IRE FROM SOME IN ORGANIZED LABOR O’Brien noted that any endorsement is \"going to come down to the rank and file members, the polling and also the discussion and deliberation of the general executive board.\"He also reiterated his criticism of Trump's recent comments in an interview with billionaire business mogul Elon Musk – when the former president praised the tech CEO for retaliating against striking workers by firing them – which is illegal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Asked if Trump's comments would impact the Teamsters endorsement, O'Brien said \"it plays into the decision.\" The Harris campaign, in a statement to Fox News after the move by the union not to back either major party presidential nominee, pointed to endorsements from \"many Teamsters locals and rank-and-file.\" \"While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said. Hitt added that \"the Vice President’s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her - alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor. As the Vice President told the Teamsters on Monday, when she is elected president, she will look out for the Teamsters rank-and-file no matter what - because they always have been and always will be the people she fights for.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.","summary":"In an internal poll, rank-and-file members of the Teamsters preferred former President Trump over Vice President Harris by 44.3% to 36.3%.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-camp-touts-union-workers-support-after-teamsters-shock-announcement","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/931/523/GettyImages-2161594214-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 22:57:14","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":256740132,"title":"JD Vance boasts he’ll keep calling Springfield Haitians ‘illegal aliens’ even though he knows they aren’t","text":"JD Vance has suggested that he will continue to call Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio “illegal” aliens despite knowing that they’re here legally. During a campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina on Wednesday, Vance was asked by Politico what would happen to migrants in the country under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, such as many of those in Springfield, during a possible second Trump administration. The Republican vice presidential nominee was also asked how the administration would go about deporting migrants in the country legally. “The media loves to say that the Haitian migrants hundreds of thousands of them, by the way, 20,000 in Springfield, but hundreds of thousands of them all across the country, they are here legally,” Vance said. “And what they mean is that Kamala Harris used two separate programs, mass parole and temporary protective status ... to wave a wand and to say, ‘We're not going to deport those people here.’” He added: “Well, if Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I'm still going to call them an illegal alien. And illegal action from Kamala Harris does not make an alien legal. That is not how this works.” Many of the Haitian migrants currently in the US came to the country under the Biden administration’s TPS and Humanitarian parole program, which allows migrants from Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Venezuela to come to the US legally if they have a sponsor and meet certain requirements. Some who are eligible can wait in the country as their permanent immigration status is ironed out. The city of Springfield states on its website that “YES, Haitian immigrants are here legally, under the Immigration Parole Program. Once here, immigrants are then eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Haiti is designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security for TPS. Current TPS is granted through February 3, 2026.” Several reports have now confirmed that an aide to Vance was told by a Springfield official previously this month that the claims about Haitian migrants stealing and eating domestic pets were baseless but that former President Donald Trump’s running mate went ahead and spread the claims anyway, according to the Wall Street Journal and ABC News. On September 9, city manager Bryan Heck told a Vance staffer in a call that the “claims were baseless.” But Vance chose not to remove a post on X that he shared that very same morning claiming that “reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” The following day, Trump made the same claim during the presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. The Vance campaign handed The Journal a police report to try to back up their claims, but the report turned out to have been based on a mistake. The woman who filed the report, Anna Kilgore, had lost her cat and believed her Haitian neighbors may be to blame. But her cat came back home unscathed several days later, and Kilgore apologized to her neighbors. She told ABC News that she believed that her neighbors could have been behind her cat’s disappearance because of rumors being spread on Facebook and TikTok. “I wish I could take it all back,” she told ABC News.

He then claimed that the rumors come “from firsthand accounts from my constituents.

The rally will be held in Uniondale, New York a city on Republican-leaning Long Island in the deep-blue state of New York. Long Island is home to several highly competitive congressional districts that could determine control of the House in the next Congress. Ahead of the event, a large crowd had already assembled at the venue, the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which seats around 13,000 people. Most seats were filled. The failed plot was top of mind for attendees. William Diver, a 70-year-old from Farmingville, New York, called the attempted assassination “disgusting” and expressed hope that the federal government could find answers to the events that unfolded that day. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii has been charged with two federal gun crimes over the incident, with further charges expected as both federal and state authorities probe the case. Others questioned the adequacy of the Secret Service’s protective measures. The agency has been under intense scrutiny since the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, two months ago, which increased after the Florida incident. “It was terrible. It was horrible,” attendee Ariel Kohan said when asked about the recent attempt on Trump’s life. “The Secret Service has to step up and do a much better job. But, you know, like, thank God for that one secret service agent that saw the barrel of the gun sticking out of the shrub,” Kohan added, referencing the Secret Service agent who noticed a rifle sticking through the fence at the golf course and immediately began to open fire. Acting Service Service Director Ronald Rowe defended the agency’s measures at the golf course, calling them “effective.” President Joe Biden acknowledged that the agency “needs more help,” and suggested that Congress consider giving them more funding. Congressional leaders are mulling providing additional funds. Trump promised in that post that he would “get SALT back,” referencing the state and local tax (SALT) federal deduction that’s important to residents of high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. Under Trump’s 2017 tax legislation, SALT deductions were capped at $10,000 per filer. Some Republicans have pushed for getting rid of the deduction altogether, though New York Republicans are generally supportive of uncapping it. Polling shows that the state, despite Trump’s optimism, is likely to be won by Vice President Kamala Harris in November. But Republicans have seen a much stronger performance on Long Island, where the party controls three of the island’s four House seats—seats that could be crucial in ensuring a Republican-led House for Trump should he regain the White House. Earlier the same day, fears arose regarding a reported bomb threat near the area. The rally comes after the 1.3 million member Teamsters Union announced that it wouldn’t make an endorsement for president for the first time since 1966. Trump marketed the decision as a win for Republicans, calling it “a big thing” that the powerful union wasn’t endorsing Democrats.","summary":"Attendees at the Long Island rally shared their reactions to the gunman at the Trump Golf Course on Sunday.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-to-hold-new-york-rally-first-since-2nd-assassination-attempt-5726550","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/18/id5726271-GettyImages-2172740083-Donald-Trump-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 22:56:05","author":"Joseph Lord,Michael Washburn","authors":["Joseph Lord","Michael Washburn"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":256739054,"title":"US says Iran sent info from Trump hack to Biden associates","text":"In August, officials warned that Iran hopes to \"stoke discord\" and undermine confidence in US institutions ahead of the November election.

(It’s been in business 179 years, even longer than The Atlantic.) As an aspiring nerd in my youth—I began college as a chemistry major—I read it regularly. In 2017, I contributed a short article to it about the public’s view of science, drawn from my book The Death of Expertise. But the magazine’s decision to break with tradition and endorse Kamala Harris—only the second such nod in the magazine’s history—is a mistake, as was its 2020 endorsement of Joe Biden, on multiple levels. I understand the frustration that probably led to this decision. Donald Trump is the most willfully ignorant man ever to hold the presidency. He does not understand even basic concepts of … well, almost anything. (Yesterday, he explained to a woman in Michigan that he would lower food prices by limiting food imports—in other words, by reducing the supply of food. Trump went to the Wharton School, where I assume “supply and demand” was part of the first-year curriculum.) He is insensate to anything that conflicts with his needs or beliefs, and briefing him on any topic is virtually impossible. When a scientific crisis—a pandemic—struck, Trump was worse than useless. He approved the government program to work with private industry to create vaccines, but he also flogged nutty theories about an unproven drug therapy and later undermined public confidence in the vaccines he’d helped bring to fruition. His stubborn stupidity literally cost American lives. It makes sense, then, that a magazine of science would feel the need to inform its readers about the dangers of such a man returning to public office. To be honest, almost any sensible magazine about anything probably wants to endorse his opponent, because of Trump’s baleful effects on just about every corner of American life. (Cat Fancy magazine-—now called Catster-—should be especially eager to write up a jeremiad about Trump and his running mate, J. D. Vance. But I digress.) Strange as it seems to say it, a magazine devoted to science should not take sides in a political contest. For one thing, it doesn’t need to endorse anyone: The readers of a magazine such as Scientific American are likely people who have a pretty good grasp of a variety of concepts, including causation, the scientific method, peer review, and probability. It’s something of an insult to these readers to explain to them that Trump has no idea what any of those words mean. They likely know this already. Now, I am aware that the science and engineering community has plenty of Trump voters in it. (I know some of them.) But one of the most distinctive qualities of Trump supporters is that they are not swayed by the appeals of intellectuals. They’re voting for reasons of their own, and they are not waiting for the editors of Scientific American to brainiac-splain why Trump is bad for knowledge. In fact, we have at least some evidence that scientists taking sides in politics can backfire. In 2021, a researcher asked a group that included both Biden and Trump supporters to look at two versions of the prestigious journal Nature—one with merely an informative page about the magazine, the other carrying an endorsement of Biden. Here is the utterly unsurprising result: In other words, readers who supported Biden shrugged; Trump supporters decided that Nature was taking sides and was therefore an unreliable source of scientific information. But even if Scientific American’s editors felt that the threat to science and knowledge was so dire that they had to endorse a candidate, they did it the worst way possible. They could have made a case for electing Harris as a matter of science acting in self-defense, because Trump, who chafes at any version of science that does not serve him, plans to destroy the relationship between expertise and government by obliterating the independence of the government’s scientific institutions. This is an obvious danger, especially when Trump is consorting with kooks such as Laura Loomer and has floated bringing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s crackpot circus into the government. Instead, the magazine gave a standard-issue left-liberal endorsement that focused on health care, reproductive rights, gun safety, climate policy, technology policy, and the economy. Although science and data play their role in debates around such issues, most of the policy choices they present are not specifically scientific questions: In the end, almost all political questions are about values—and how voters think about risks and rewards. Science cannot answer those questions; it can only tell us about the likely consequences of our choices. Also unhelpful is that some of the endorsement seemed to be drawn from the Harris campaign’s talking points, such as this section: An endorsement based on Harris’s tax proposals—which again, are policy choices—belongs in a newspaper or financial journal. It’s not a matter of science, any more than her views on abortions or guns or anything else are. I realize that my objections seem like I’m asking scientists to be morally neutral androids who have no feelings on important issues. Many decent people want to express their objections to Trump in the public square, regardless of their profession, and scientists are not required to be some cloistered monastic order. But policy choices are matters of judgment and belong in the realm of politics and democratic choice. If the point of a publication such as Scientific American is to increase respect for science and knowledge as part of creating a better society, then the magazine’s highly politicized endorsement of Harris does not serve that cause.

JD Vance said Wednesday that Haitian migrants with legal immigration status are “illegal aliens” who have been unlawfully protected from deportation, suggesting that would change if Trump wins the election. Immigration is a top issue for Republicans, and one of Trump’s hallmark campaign promises is to enact the “largest-ever deportation” in American history on day one of his presidency if he’s elected. Asked what the Trump administration would do about migrants that are already in the country legally after a speech in Raleigh Wednesday, Vance suggested that those migrants were granted protection unlawfully and attacked Vice President Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, over the current administration’s use of mass parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for people that arrive from specific countries. “What is fundamentally illegal is for Kamala Harris to say we're going to grant parole, not on a case by case basis, but to millions of illegal aliens who are coming to this country,” Vance said. “That does not magically make them legal because Kamala Harris waved the amnesty wand. That makes her border policy a disgrace, and I'm still going to call people illegal aliens.” The Biden administration recently extended the temporary legal protected status for unauthorized migrants from Haiti living in the U.S. through Feb. 3, 2026, a designation that protects against deportation but does not confer permanent legal status. While Vance speaks about Haiti specifically, nationals from more than a dozen other countries including Venezuela, Syria, Ukraine and Afghanistan can also be awarded TPS. The community of Springfield, Ohio, a mid sized city between Dayton and Columbus, has been roiled by bomb threats, evacuations and harassment towards its residents after Vance, Trump and other Republicans spread lies that Haitian immigrants there were stealing pets and eating them, among other false claims The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Vance’s staff reached out to the Springfield city manager to inquire about the veracity of the provocative claims, learned those claims were false and shared them anyway. “He asked point-blank, ‘Are the rumors true of pets being taken and eaten?’” City Manager Bryan Heck told the outlet. “I told him no. There was no verifiable evidence or reports to show this was true. I told them these claims were baseless.” The harassment and attention reached a fever pitch after Trump mentioned Springfield on the presidential debate stage last week, as part of the Republican push to highlight the Biden administration’s unpopularity in its handling of illegal immigration and border security issues. In North Carolina, Vance continued to play the role of Trump campaign attack dog, saying the “disgraceful” stance of the Biden-Harris administration on immigration has been, “we're going to let in millions of illegal aliens to make your housing costs higher, to make your hospitals overwhelmed, to make your local schools impossible for your children to learn in.” “Who consented?” Vance asked. “Who in this room, who in this country consented to allowing millions of aliens to come into this country unchecked, unvetted? None of us did.” Vance also deflected a question about how the administration would grapple with the economic aftermath of mass deportations that would disproportionately affect industries like agriculture and construction that rely on migrant labor. “Well, first of all, if you talk to farmers, farmers are as upset about the open borders as almost anybody else,” he said. “So I think farmers, and certainly I reject the idea that the only way to have a productive farm economy is to allow 25 million legal aliens into this country, it doesn't make enough sense.”","summary":"The Republican vice presidential nominee continues to rail against Haitian migrants living in Ohio, though many have Temporary Protected Status, as the GOP escalates its hardline immigration stance.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/g-s1-23667/vance-haiti-migrants-tps-parole-immigration-pets-springfield","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4738x3159+0+0/resize/4738x3159!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F58%2F6626b1604b44b3eb391c959e5e07%2Fap24262717323060.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 22:50:29","author":"Stephen Fowler","authors":["Stephen Fowler"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":256738046,"title":"Harris’ alarming anti-Israel stance would endanger its very survival","text":"To avoid alienating voters, Kamala Harris is staying mum on the details of her presidential agenda. Yet she’s already left enough clues about her intentions toward Israel for its supporters to be highly alarmed. Her interview Tuesday at the National Association of Black Journalists made that clear yet again. Harris would stick 100% to her team’s current approach, which has dragged out the war by impeding Israeli military progress. She’s blasting Israel and pushing a “cease-fire” that would set up another horrifying round of warfare. She’s proud of the Harris-Biden halt on US weapons to Israel: “I am entirely supportive of . . . the pause that we put on the 2,000-pound bombs,” Harris boasted. “So, there is some leverage we have had and used.” It all conforms to her team’s obscene view that the Hamas terrorists and their Israeli victims are moral equals. “This war has to end,” she lectures — by “getting a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal.” Deal? How about an Israeli victory? “Israel has a right to defend itself,” she allowed, but “how it does so matters, and far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” Harris is pushing a “two-state solution” to “ensure that Israelis have security, and Palestinians, in equal measure, have security, self-determination and dignity.” To that end, she’s “putting pressure on all parties.” Where to start? Hello? Everyone wants the war to “end.” Except Hamas. The terror group openly says that if it survives, it’ll launch more Oct. 7-style slay-fests and continue its war on Israel. A cease-fire, then — even a supposedly permanent one — won’t “end” the war. Only a full defeat of Hamas will ensure Israel’s future security. So why does Harris think both sides need to be pressured? (For the record, Israel has agreed to most cease-fire plans on offer; Hamas rejected them.) The veep’s plea that “far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed” is one form of her pressure on the Jewish state. But how does Kamala know how many “innocent” Palestinians have died? By relying on casualty figures from Hamas, which notoriously lies about them? Nor does it distinguish Hamas casualties from those of non-fighters — maybe because it regards (with good reason) all Palestinians to be anti-Israel fighters. Many “civilians,” recall, took part in Oct. 7 and harbored hostages. Overwhelming majorities of Gazans back the war on Israel, want it destroyed and would re-elect Hamas in a heartbeat. Yet even if you assume thousands of innocents have been killed, remember: Hamas started the war and is the one prolonging it — it can surrender whenever it chooses. Hamas purposely embeds itself among civilians to maximize non-combatant deaths. Israel has done more to protect civilians than any other military in any recent war. Harris’ demand for a two-state solution that ensures Israel’s security while providing Palestinians with “self-determination and dignity” is pure Loo-Loo Land thinking: A Palestinian state would jeopardize Israeli security, which is why most Israelis oppose it. And Gaza essentially had “self-determination” when Israel withdrew from it in 2005. It was Hamas that denied Gazans dignity, using billions meant for peaceful infrastructure to instead build a tunnel network from which to launch attacks. It’s easy to dismiss Harris’ words as mere campaign rhetoric, crafted to maximize votes but not necessarily to reflect actual policy. Yet in the meantime, her both-sides-ism plays directly into Hamas’ hands, emboldening it to demand more in negotiations and to hold out until it’s assured it will survive. That’s costing lives, including those of Americans. Indeed, Hamas might’ve been defeated already if the Harris-Biden team’s support for Israel were as “ironclad” as they claim — or if (perish the thought!) the White House had sent US forces to help Israel rescue American hostages. Finally, look at the aides Harris has tapped for national security, Mideast and Jewish issues. Like Philip Gordon, an Iran appeaser with troubling ties to people close to Tehran who helped draw up the disastrous 2015 Iran nuclear deal and opposed the killing of top Iranian terror thug Qasem Soleimani. Or Ilan Goldenberg, who also backed the Iran-deal fiasco and reportedly helped get sanctions slapped on Israelis — the veep’s “golden boy” who “should alarm every friend of Israel,” Jerusalem Post editor-in-chief Zvika Kelin has warned. And Tim Walz, her running mate, is head-over-heels for antisemitic Israel-hater Rep. Ilhan Omar and once praised a Muslim imam who allegedly backed Hamas. That Harris won’t disclose her broader agenda should trouble all voters. When it comes to the Jewish state, though, she’s made her views all too clear — and they’re far more than troubling for Israel’s supporters. Adam Brodsky is The Post’s deputy editorial-page editor.

The moratorium stopped approvals for exports from all U.S. LNG projects. Lance, who spoke at the Gastech conference in Houston, stressed that the industry needed permitting reform, “and we need more infrastructure.” U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm promised at that time the pause would be over “in a matter of months,” but nine months later, the uncertainty that it caused became deep and profound. The uncertainty is less worrisome in the near term than in the future because the energy industry doesn’t plan its business for what will happen in the next two or three months. It plans its business, similar to agriculture, now for the next ten, even twenty years. Late last week, Reuters reported from Singapore that the major buyers of U.S. LNG flagged risks of purchasing cargoes from the U.S. following the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to pause export permits to non-free trade agreement countries. “Officials from Taiwan’s CPC Corp and Germany-based SEFE, which trades LNG cargoes and sells in Asia, stressed the importance of reliability of supply while responding to a question on the impact of the U.S. export pause on Asian markets,” the outlet said. So where will these countries purchase their LNG’s going forward? The answer is Russia. Jane Liao, CEO of CPC Corporation’s natural gas business in Taiwan, said at the APPEC Conference last week that, in terms of dealing with the U.S., “We are quite ambivalent now, meaning we prefer something that is more firm.” Liao said Chinese and Indian purchases of Russian LNG cargoes would ensure the market remains balanced, and it will continue to purchase from Russia. This is why Lance called the moratorium “this crazy LNG permitting pause.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The consequences will be dire for the industry in four to five years, but they also carry national security implications now.

During her debate with former President Trump last week, Harris boasted of the Biden administration’s efforts to get U.S. troops out of war zones like Afghanistan. MILITARY EXPERTS REJECT HARRIS CLAIM OF ‘NO US SOLDIERS IN COMBAT ZONES’ \"There is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century,\" she claimed. \"That is just a complete lie,\" Banks told Fox News Digital. \"This video proves that we have troops being fired on.\" \"Without a doubt,\" U.S. troops are being fired at regularly, added Banks, an Afghanistan veteran and Armed Services Committee member. \"We have troops currently in Syria. We still have troops in Iraq. We have troops in the Middle East. The Houthis are using our Navy ships as target practice. We have dangerous threats around the world, and Kamala Harris is trying to score cheap political points and lie to the American people right before the election to say that we don't have troops in combat zones,\" Banks said.

The Defense Department is in talks about a plan to pull Americans out of Iraq beginning next year. In an operation last month, U.S. troops and Iraqi forces killed a senior commander with the Islamic State, in addition to several other prominent militants, for a total 14 ISIS operatives. Five U.S. troops were wounded in the raid itself and two were injured from falls during the operation. The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power and declared a caliphate over swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014. It was defeated in Iraq in 2017, but attacks by ISIS sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria have been on the rise over the past few years. The Pentagon told Fox News Digital that service members are stationed in various dangerous locations but noted that those deployments are made by the executive branch and not due to wars declared by Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"An aspect of military service includes serving in locations where hostile actions may occur,\" a defense official said. \"Those locations are designated by executive order and/or the secretary of defense. \"However, it’s important to note that just because a service member is in one of these locations does not mean they are engaged in war,\" the official added. \"The U.S. is not currently engaged in a war and does not have troops fighting in active war zones anywhere in the world.\"","summary":"New video of U.S. troops being shot at overseas flies in the face of Vice President Kamala Harris’ claim the U.S. does not have troops in an active combat zone, according to Rep.

But after that date, the list had “no mention of Harris at all.” Behind that change is the way the site classifies “outright leftist or socialist outlets” as mainstream sources while “conservative outlets like Fox News” are rated unreliable. “Reducing our understanding of knowledge to assertions made by a small subset of supposedly ‘reliable sources’” adds “bias into the encyclopedia.” “Wikipedia is a testament to the limitless power of collaboration and an odds-defying wonder of human achievement.” But it may be “fated to achieve exactly the opposite of what its founders intended.” From the right: Trump Got Crime Trend Correct ABC moderator David Muir’s claimed, in the Trump-Harris debate, “The FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country,” stats Trump retorted are “a fraud.” The Washington Examiner’s editorial board fact-checks: New data from The Bureau of Justice Statistics last week “show Trump is right about crime and Muir is wrong.” Under President Biden, the FBI made the process for how “local law enforcement agencies report crime to the bureau . . . more complicated and burdensome,” so now “some of the largest and most troublesome cities [are] failing to report at all.” “The DOJ, however, did not change its methodology,” and per its latest numbers, “crime is much higher under the Biden-Harris administration than it was during [Trump’s] presidency.” Eye on NY: State Gov’t Hikes Insurance Costs “The latest round of health insurance premium hikes announced by New York regulators adds to evidence that state policies are drowning consumers instead of helping them,” warns the Empire Center’s Bill Hammond. The Department of Financial Services’ premium hikes averaged 13%, “or four times the inflation rate, for non-group or individual policies.” Small-group policies rose 8%, “or more than double the inflation rate.” Albany also “drives up health coverage costs through heavy-handed taxation and regulation” — imposing “coverage mandates without properly weighing the costs against the benefits.” Thus, a new proposal barring “copayments or coinsurance for asthma inhalers” would boost “costs for everyone else.” “Instead of making hollow boasts, state officials should focus on truly improving the affordability of health coverage — which starts with rolling back the taxes and regulations that make things worse.” Culture critic: Exposing the ‘Anti-Racist’ Con In his new film “Am I a Racist?” Matt Walsh “poses as a liberal activist who is earnestly and hilariously seeking the counsel of unsuspecting DEI experts” — performing “a public service,” cheers The Wall Street Journal’s Jason L. Riley. Walsh “isn’t mean-spirited or adversarial. He poses straightforward questions and lets his interlocutors discredit themselves. Along the way, the DEI industry is revealed to be something of a racket.” The film may prompt more companies to scrap their DEI programs, which studies show do little if any good. “If your main focus isn’t ending racial bias but merely changing the color of the person on the receiving end, you aren’t seeking justice” but “prolonging racial tensions.” And as Walsh’s film makes clear, “you’re part of the problem.” Social-media watch: Meta’s ‘River-Sea’ Mistake “The recent decision by Meta’s oversight board legitimizing the slogan ‘from the river to the sea’ is shameful and dangerous,” thunders Michael Herzog at The Hill. “This slogan is overwhelmingly used in the context of expressing hatred toward Israel and rejecting the Jewish people’s right to self-determination,” typically “by Palestinian terrorist organizations and their sympathizers. Hamas’s 2017 charter” uses the phrase. “Oct. 7 to the end of 2023” saw “more acts of antisemitism ‘than in any full year on record,’ ” per the Anti-Defamation League. “In this fraught environment, the slogan” has become “an integral part of the scenery and increasingly dangerous.” “Respect the right to free expression” but admit “that this call cannot be disassociated from violence or threats thereof.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Wikipedia users “who accessed the ‘List of executive branch czars’ article on July 24” would’ve seen Kamala Harris listed, reports Ashley Rindsberg.

On Monday, Hillary declared on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC talk show that the federal government should criminally prosecute Americans who share “propaganda” — which she made no effort to define. Hillary has long been one of America’s foremost censorship advocates. In 2022, she wailed that “tech platforms have amplified disinformation and extremism with no accountability” and endorsed European Union legislation to obliterate free speech. But as we’ve seen, “disinformation” is often simply the lag time between the government pronouncing something a falsehood and the government getting debunked. That awkward fact didn’t deter Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, now the Democratic vice presidential nominee, from declaring, “There’s no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech, and especially around our democracy.” Who knew the North Star State’s version of the First Amendment has a loophole bigger than Duluth? After The New York Post shot down Biden’s Disinformation Governance Board in 2022, Biden appointed Kamala Harris as chief of a White House task force to protect “women and LGBTQI+ political leaders . . . and journalists” from vigorous criticism on the Internet (or as the administration preferred to call it, from “online harassment and abuse”). The Harris-Biden censorship schemes have been denounced by federal courts and by Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), chair of the House Cybersecurity Subcommittee, sent the White House a letter last week noting that the administration had repeatedly “advertised its willingness to manipulate the content of social media sites.” Mace called for the cessation of federal censorship that might taint the 2024 election and requested copies of all official “communications with social media companies . . . concerning the concealment or suppression of information on their sites.” The odds of the White House complying with that request are on par with the New York Giants winning the Super Bowl this season. Meanwhile, Hillary’s own career is that of a political elitist out to righteously blindfold all Americans but herself. When she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Clinton exempted herself from federal records requirements and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), setting up a private server in her New York mansion to illegally handle her official email. The State Department ignored 17 FOIA requests for her emails and said it would need 75 years to release the messages of her top aides in response to a GOP lawsuit. The Federal Bureau of Investigation shrugged it off when Hillary’s aides used a program called BleachBit to destroy 30,000 of her emails that a congressional committee had subpoenaed. Federal Judge Royce Lamberth labeled the Clinton email cover-up “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.” Pirouetting as a champion of candor is a novel role for the former senator. Shortly before the 2016 election, a Gallup poll found that only 33% of voters believed Hillary was honest and trustworthy, and only 35% trusted Donald Trump. The Clinton-Trump tag team made “post-truth” the Oxford English Dictionary’s 2016 word of the year. Hillary believes the lesson of George Orwell’s “1984” is that good citizens should shut up and grovel: In her 2017 memoir, she claimed that the book warned of the dangers posed by critics of the establishment who “sow mistrust toward exactly the people we need to rely on: our leaders, the press, experts who seek to guide public policy based on evidence.” Does she imagine Orwell dedicated his novel to Stalin? And now, to sanctify censorship of Trump and his supporters, Hillary is yet again invoking the Russian peril. This despite the 316-page report released last year by Special Counsel John Durham, who confirmed that in mid-2016, as she suffered a public shellacking over her email scandal, Clinton “approved a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisors to tie Trump to Russia as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.” President Barack Obama was briefed on the Clinton proposal “to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by Russian security services.” FBI officials relied on the “Clinton Plan” to target the Trump campaign — even though no FBI personnel took “any action to vet the Clinton Plan intelligence,” the Durham report noted. Hillary’s scams were even too much for federal scorekeepers: The Federal Election Commission in 2022 levied a $113,000 fine on her 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee for their deceptive FEC filings that covered up their role in manufacturing the Steele dossier, which spurred the FBI’s illegal surveillance of Trump campaign officials. Is the charge of “disinformation” becoming simply another stick that rulers can use to flog uppity citizens? But if politicians have no obligation to disclose how they use their power, and can persecute citizens who expose their abuses, how in Hades can American freedom survive?

What did they know and when did they know it?” Last month, the Trump campaign said some of its internal communications had been hacked after Politico began receiving emails from an anonymous account that included internal campaign documents. The campaign pointed to a Microsoft report that suggested Iranian hackers “sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign.” The FBI is reportedly preparing criminal charges in connection with the hack, the Associated Press reported last week. The hack comes as foreign powers are allegedly stepping up attempts to interfere in the 2024 presidential election. A report from Microsoft earlier this week alleged that Kremlin-aligned troll farms spread false news stories to damage the Kamala Harris campaign. The Independent has contacted the Russian Embassy in the U.S. for coment. Earlier this month, law enforcement agencies seized 32 Russian-backed websites prosecutors say were designed to sow disinformation and discord ahead of 2024 elections and boost Donald Trump’s campaign. Two employees of Russia’s state RT network were also charged with launching $10m propaganda campaign enlisting popular right-wing social media influencers. September also saw federal officials indict Dimitri Simes, a foreign policy expert and former Trump campaign adviser, for allegedly breaking sanctions by working with a Russian state TV channel. He denies wrongdoing.

With Smart kicking off the much-anticipated season, viewers can expect her usual wit and (possibly) some impressions, based on her latest appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert where she tried impressions for the first time—though she noted at the time, “I only do two.” “I do Maggie Smith [from Downtown Abbey] and Woody Woodpecker,” she explained to Colbert. Bargatze, a Grammy-nominated comedian out of Nashville, will take the helm the following week for his second time after hosting last year. He’s known for his “clean and relatable comedy for all age groups,” according to his website and has been lauded for his “clean, Christian comedy”—so he isn’t likely to cause controversy for the long-running show, which has faced backlash for having a variety of controversial figures on the show, like Nikki Haley and Elon Musk, in recent seasons. A lot of the excitement on social media Wednesday seems to be for the show’s next three episodes, featuring Grande as host and Nicks, Eilish and Roan as musical guests. Grande hosted for the first time 2016, and has been a musical guest three times. Eilish has also hosted once and been a musical guest three times. Season 50 will be Chappell Roan’s first appearance on the show alongside Mulaney, who’ll be hosting for the sixth time. He posted to social media after he was announced as a host that it was “the first time I'm hearing of this”—the Daily Beast has reached out to confirm whether or not he’s joking.

They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.” Pretty much er’rybody and they mama have called bullshit on Haitians in Springfield eating animals, including the Republican governor of Ohio and the Republican mayor of Springfield. Even the city’s police chief said it’s not true – and you know something wild was said when a police chief is defending a group of Black folks. Trump’s statement was glaring nonsense statement from a man who has built his entire political career on saying things that don’t make no damn sense. Just the same, he’s doubled down on his foolishness, claiming that he will “mass deport” Haitians in Springfield, according to the BBC. Problem is, members of our country saw fit to give this fool a platform and power, so his words have actual, real-world consequences…truth be damned. There have been threats of violence in the city. Haitian parents have kept their children home because schools in the Springfield area have received bomb threats. A whole ass college (Wittenberg University) has cancelled sporting events and in-person classes because they fear for the safety of their students...all because a dude with a disturbing relationship with tanning lotion said something blatantly false on television. Nearly all of the Haitians in Springfield are there legally, and because many fled a living situation the likes of which most of us will never experience: Gang violence runs rampant in Haiti, and the political leaders of the country seem unable to get a handle on it. After the July 2021 assassination of Jovenel Moïse, the 43rd president of Haiti, the country’s residents have dealt with food insecurity, displacement and constant threats to their life. Many Haitians came to the small town of Springfield in search of normalcy – instead they find themselves victims of a rumor so ridiculous it barely merits repeating out loud. But Black Americans already know what’s up: the Pan-Africanism movement of yesteryear demanded that we come together as part of the same diasporic community in the face of violence from our oppressors. Elders in the South put it a different way: Black folks is Black, no matter where you go. Many of us encounter the same struggles living in a country built on the myth of whiteness as an ideal. Use whatever platform you can access to push back against this narrative plaguing our Haitian brothers and sisters in Ohio. Because if we don’t…who will? ———- Lawrence Ware is a teaching assistant professor of philosophy at Oklahoma State University and associate director of its center for Africana Studies.
