Tim Walz received a text message from a fellow Minnesota Democrat. \"I've never lost with you on top of the ballot,\" Rep. Angie Craig wrote. In describing the text to CBS News, she added \"LOL,\" saying she'd teased him at the time about his status as a top contender for the job. Craig, who represents the far southern suburbs of Minneapolis in one of the most competitive and moderate House districts in America, took an early stand against the leader of her own party. Soon after President Biden's dismal debate performance, she called on him to drop out of the race.After his departure, Craig championed Walz for VP. \"He can talk to anybody, anywhere, about anything,\" she told CBS News. Craig said Walz is a political force in \"so many swing states and battleground districts.\"The governor's first month as his party's vice presidential nominee is raising optimism among Democrats about their prospects in two battleground House races where Walz has roots. In Minnesota's 2nd District, Craig faces a stiff challenge as she pursues her fourth term. And in Walz's birthplace of Nebraska, where he campaigned in mid-August, Democrats are hoping his connections will help them oust veteran incumbent Republican Don Bacon. Both races are expensive, close and could have an outsized impact on the balance of power in the House, where Republicans are clinging to a very narrow majority heading into the November elections.The Republicans trying to win those seats have aggressively criticized Walz, questioning the quality of his record as governor and doing their best to tie Democratic House candidates to GOP anti-Walz messages.Craig says Walz has won her swing district handily when he's been on the ballot as governor. \"He campaigns aggressively. He shows up anywhere,\" she said. \"I once went turkey hunting with him at the beginning of the season; then we were at a gay rights gala that same weekend. His range is truly extraordinary.\"Craig's challenger, Republican Joe Teirab, is trying to appeal to the large number of voters in the 2nd District who have a history of splitting their tickets. A former federal prosecutor, Teirab is going after Walz over his response to the 2020 unrest in Minneapolis in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. \"Tim Walz has failure on his record,\" Teirab told CBS News. \"And I think people are going to be voting on that.\" He argues that Walz has not shown enough support for law enforcement, and he believes that policing and public safety will be key issues in battleground races, including in Minnesota.\"People here know that we need to support law enforcement to uphold public safety,\" Teirab said, adding that \"after the 2020 riots, it was a lot harder for law enforcement departments to recruit and retain talent.\" Teirab brings up his own record as a prosecutor when he campaigns. \"I've had to throw a lot of drug traffickers behind bars,\" he told CBS News. \"I'd love to be part of the effort to stem that tide in Congress.\" Craig, however, has the backing of some in law enforcement and announced a series of endorsements by groups including the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association. In Omaha, Nebraska, and its own 2nd Congressional District, another battleground race has included talk of a visit by Walz. The VP nominee, who grew up in small-town Nebraska, campaigned in the 2nd District on Aug. 17, underscoring the significance of Nebraska's distinctive system of awarding presidential electors by congressional district.Longtime Republican incumbent Don Bacon, who has a history of defeating both conservative Republican primary opponents and Democratic general election challengers, has accused Walz of shifting to the political left in the years since he won the governorship in Minnesota. \"I think his support in this district will dissipate,\" Bacon told CBS News. \"But we've got to be good at messaging it.\"Bacon said he would have been more concerned about his electoral prospects if Harris had instead selected Gov. Josh Shapiro, a first-term Pennsylvania Democrat, as her running mate. \"I think Shapiro was a much more threatening vice president than Walz,\" Bacon said. \"In the end, Walz's roots or connections here may not be relevant enough. I think he was helpful up front, but I don't think it's going to be helpful in the long run.\"Bacon's Democratic challenger, state legislator Tony Vargas, is hoping Walz can boost Democrats' appeal to blue-collar voters in Nebraska. Vargas, likeWalz, is a former schoolteacher. He told CBS News, \"Seeing Gov. Walz on the ticket is something that we've been talking about at my events. We need working-class people in Congress. Gov. Walz is incredibly supportive of organized labor.\"\"We need examples of what working class individuals look like in Congress and at the top ticket of the presidency in the executive branch,\" said Vargas. During Walz's campaign stop in Nebraska last month, Vargas said he talked with him about the chances of flipping the House from Republican to Democratic control.Both parties are claiming to have the momentum in the races for the Minnesota and Nebraska House seats. The race for the two seats has attracted millions in campaign spending.Craig said the switch at the top of the ticket has boosted Democratic candidates across several battleground states, but she still says her race will be a \"tough fight\" and a \"hard push.\"In several battleground districts, including the 2nd District of Nebraska, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has touted fundraising success by challengers seeking to defeat incumbents. Walz's addition to the presidential ticket underscores the impact of the historic withdrawal of President Biden from the presidential race. The reconfigured ticket has provided Democrats with a blast of enthusiasm, more favorable polling, volunteers and donations. Craig and Vargas told CBS News they've noticed a significant uptick in enthusiasm among prospective voters during door-knocking and campaign events.Republicans say they expect the initial enthusiasm among Democrats to wane. \"President Trump and JD Vance have to be focused on the economy, border, crime, and they need to be pretty clear about what Harris and Walz have stood for in the past,\" Bacon said. \"And if they do that, I think we'll be fine.\"","summary":"Rep.

The Veterans For Responsible Leadership advocacy group mocked the musical hopeful’s earnest attempt, writing, “Pretty brave of Lara Trump to release a music video when she can’t sing.

The twice-impeached former president, who lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, said in an interview on Fox News’ Life, Liberty & Levin on Sunday, Sept. 1, that he had \"every right\" to interfere with the presidential race. \"It’s so crazy, that my poll numbers go up. Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election, where you have every right to do it, you get indicted, and your poll numbers go up,\" said Trump, 78, per The Hill. \"When people get indicted, your poll numbers go down.\" In August 2023, Trump, who is accused of attempting to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia, was indicted on four criminal counts by a federal grand jury investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and the 2020 election. That same month, the state of Georgia also presented a 41-count, 98-page indictment against Trump and 18 other defendants related to the case. Although the former president initially faced 13 felony counts, including racketeering (violation of the Georgia RICO Act), Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee threw out three of the charges in March. Trump went on to say during his appearance on Fox News’ Life, Liberty & Levin that \"this is the worst case of election interference that anyone’s ever seen, certainly in our country.\" \"They do this in Third World countries; they have some of it in South America, but they don’t do it a lot, believe it or not.

The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Her comments came during a rally before cheering union members marking Labour Day in the industrial city of Pittsburgh, where Harris said U.S. Steel was \"an historic American company and it is vital for our country to maintain strong American steel companies.\" \"U.S. Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated, and I will always have the backs of America’s steelworkers,” she said. That echoes Biden, who repeated Monday what he's said since March — that he opposes U.S. Steel's would-be sale to Nippon, believing it would hurt the country's steelworkers. It's little surprise that Harris would overlap with Biden on the issue, but nonetheless constitutes a major policy position for the vice-president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed his vice-president in July. Biden took the stage first and was met with chants of “Thank You, Joe” as he and Harris appeared in an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall. The president called Harris the only “rational” choice for president in November. He said choosing her to be vice-president was the “single best” decision of his presidency and told the union members that electing her will be “the best decision you will ever make.” Biden also started to say, “Kamala Harris and I are going to build on this” as if he were still running and she was his running mate — but he corrected himself. It underscored just how much the race has changed and how Harris has been careful to balance presenting herself as “a new way forward” while remaining intensely loyal to Biden and the policies he has pushed. Her delivery is very different — and in some cases she's pushed to move faster than Biden's administration — but the overall goal of expanding government programs to buoy the middle class is the same. “We know this is going to be a tight race till the very end,” Harris told the Pittsburgh crowd. The joint rally with Biden was Harris' second of the day and followed Pittsburgh's Labor Day parade, one of the country's largest. It was their first joint appearance at a campaign event since the election shakeup six weeks ago. Democratic presidential nominee U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally in Savannah, Ga., Thursday, Aug. 29, 2024. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo) Harris opened her Labor Day campaigning solo with an event in Detroit, where hundreds of audience members wore bright yellow union shirts and hoisted “Union strong” signs. The vice-president said “every person in our nation has benefited” from unions' work. \"Everywhere I go, I tell people, ‘Look, you may not be a union member, you’d better thank a union member,” Harris said, noting that collective bargaining by organized labor helped secure the five-day work week, sick pay and other key benefits and solidify safer working conditions. “When unions are strong, America is strong,” she said. The 81-year-old Biden has spent most of his lengthy political career forging close ties with organized labor. The White House said he asked to introduce Harris in Pittsburgh — instead of the usual other way around — because he wanted to highlight her record of supporting union workers. In addition to opposing the Nippon Steel sale, Biden has endorsed expanding tariffs on imported Chinese steel — a rare instance of political overlap with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has cheered steeper foreign tariffs on many imports. Still, in a statement Monday, U.S. Steel said it remains “committed to the transaction with Nippon Steel, which is the best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities, and customers.” America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective “The partnership with Nippon Steel, a long-standing investor in the United States from our close ally Japan, will strengthen the American steel industry, American jobs, and American supply chains, and enhance the U.S. steel industry’s competitiveness and resilience against China,” the company said, noting that it employs nearly 4,000 people in Pennsylvania alone. David B. Burritt, U.S. Steel’s president and CEO, said Nippon Steel has announced plans to invest “approximately $1.3 billion in U. S. Steel union-represented facilities, on top of the $1.4 billion capital commitment they previously announced.” The Harris campaign released a statement countering that sentiment from David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers union, who said Harris' opposition to the sale “once again made it clear that she will always stand up for steelworkers.” The 59-year-old Harris has sought to appeal to voters by positioning herself as a break from former president Trump's acerbic rhetoric while also looking to move beyond the Biden era. Harris events feel very different from Biden's, which usually featured small crowds. But the vice-president's agenda includes the same issues he's championed: capping the cost of prescription drugs, defending the Affordable Care Act, growing the economy, helping families afford child care — and now her position on the sale of U.S. Steel. The vice-president has promised to work to lower grocery store costs to help fight inflation. She's moved faster than Biden in some cases, calling for using tax cuts and incentives to encourage home ownership and ending federal taxes on tips for service industry employees. But she's also offered relatively few specifics on major policies, instead continuing to side with Biden on top issues. Harris appeared onstage with Biden after the president addressed the opening night of last month's Democratic National Convention, but they had not shared a microphone at a political event since Biden himself was running against Trump. At that time, the campaign was using Harris mostly as its chief spokeswoman for abortion rights, an issue they believe can help them win in November as restrictions grow and health care worsens for women following the fall of Roe v. Wade. Top headlines on Canadian politics, all in one place For more than 3 1/2 years, Harris has been one of Biden's chief validators. Now the tables are turned, as Harris looks to lean on Biden — a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania — to help win the potentially decisive state. Although the vice-president has appeared more forceful in speaking about the plight of civilians in Gaza, as Israel's war against Hamas there nears the 11-month mark, she also has endorsed Biden's efforts to arm Israel and bring about a hostage deal and ceasefire. Israel said Sunday that it had recovered the bodies of six hostages captured during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that ignited the Gaza war, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. The revelation prompted thousands of Israelis to demonstrate in the streets, demanding a cease-fire deal. Before appearing together in Pittsburgh, Biden and Harris met in the White House Situation Room with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team. From there she went to Detroit before their joint appearance later Monday. “History will show what we here know: Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents,\" Harris said in Pittsburgh. “And as we know Joe still has a lot of work to do.”","summary":"Kamala Harris says they oppose U.S. Steel's sale to Japan during a campaign event with Joe Biden in Pittsburgh on Monday.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/harris-says-she-opposes-u-s-steel-s-sale-to-japanese-firm-during-campaign-event-with-biden-1.7022912","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/9/2/kamala-harris-joe-biden-cammapgin-event-1-7022914-1725320258577.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 23:41:26","author":"Colleen Long, Erin B.

The song, “Hero”, was first released in May but Trump, and co-singer Madeline Jaymes, only released the music video late last month. It features moody shots of Trump and Jaymes singing in a music studio and, at times, also on a fire escape. The video is cut with a photo montage of real firefighters, and what seems to be staged footage of firefighters rescuing people. It’s unclear when Trump filmed the music video (the earliest sneak peek was posted in July.) The duo makes a heartfelt tribute to firefighters, over some heavy autotune. “You’re going through the fire, and the flames getting higher. You’re my hero. You’re my hero,” they sing. “You’re climbing up the ladder and the screams getting louder. You’re my hero. You’re my hero.” Despite the emotional lyrics, some on social media appeared to find Trump’s voice distracting. On YouTube, the top comments were less than complimentary. “Someone who cares about Lara needs to be honest and tell her she can’t sing,” one person wrote. “After hearing this, I miss Yoko Ono,” another person commented. On Instagram, a commenter called out Trump for being “the rich adult version” of “kids who got participation trophies.” “Guys, I’m starting to think Lara Trump has a “music career” only because her last name is Trump,” an X user joked. Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, has been releasing music for nearly a year now, starting with her infamous rendition of Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down”. Since then, she has released two original songs, “Hero” and “Anything is Possible”. In between her musical releases, Trump has been busy with her political career. Earlier this year, she was tapped to co-chair the RNC with former North Carolina Republican Party chair Michael Whatley. That was thanks to an influential endorsement from her father-in-law, the Republican Party nominee for president. During her RNC acceptance speech, Trump promised to “work hard” to get her father-in-law re-elected and promised to spend “every single penny” toward getting him back in the White House.

Harris argued that former President Donald Trump “is trying to pull us backward, including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize.” She charged that Trump, 78, “blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers,” opposed efforts “to raise the minimum wage” and appointed “union busters to the National Labor Relations” Board while making the case that Pennsylvania workers should vote for her in November. The battleground state’s 19 Electoral College votes could swing the election for either candidate.

The Post’s Isabel Vincent reported exclusively Friday that Iran is funding anti-Israel, pro-Hamas groups and campus protests via a network of activist groups whose names bear no sign of Tehran’s ties. For instance, members of the Texas-based Rise Against Oppression (which downplays its links to Iran) “reclaimed” a student center at Houston University in April. Many pro-Palestinian groups also get funding (directly, or via the radical Tides Foundation) from the Maximum Difference Foundation, the US family charity of an extended clan whose members back in Iran are tight with the family of Iran’s former President Akbar Rafsanjani and have worked with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. “Following the October 7th attacks . . . Tehran has poured money and logistical support into anti-Israel and pro-terror rallies, encampments and civil disorder,” said Sam Westrop, director of Middle East Forum’s Islamist Watch project. Westrop added that the Iranian regime “appears to operate mosques, activist and student groups that are deeply involved in pro-terror demonstrations, alongside Beijing-backed and Hamas-aligned groups.” In July, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines revealed: “We have observed actors tied to Iran’s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters.” Is the rest of the Harris-Biden administration asleep at the switch in the face of a Tehran-backed fifth column movement inside of the United States? Seems so: The White House is striving to appease the protesters, with both Israel-skeptical Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and the anti-Israel Uncommitted National Movement at the DNC claiming that Kamala Harris has “expressed openness” to restricting or ending aid to Israel. Harris-Biden have always been soft on Iran, but letting Tehran manipulate US protests and then bending to the protesters is beyond appalling.","summary":"As colleges begin the new school year, \"pro-Palestine\" protesters need to start asking who's really calling the shots: It may be agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/opinion/will-harris-biden-act-to-counter-iranian-agents-behind-anti-israel-campus-protests/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/democratic-presidential-nominee-vice-president-88819953-e1725314986121.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 23:07:13","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":255488682,"title":"Hamas Official Says Guards Have New Orders in Dealing With Hostages","text":"A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing said Monday that its forces have been operating under new orders on how to handle hostages if Israel's military closes in on their position, according to a report from Reuters.The spokesperson, Abu Ubaida, did not provide details of what the orders entail but that the instructions were given to those tasked with guarding the hostages after Israel rescued four of its citizens taken in the Hamas attacks on October 7 from a Gazan refugee camp in June. Israel was accused of potentially committing war crimes during the rescue operation, which killed at least 274 Palestinians, according to Gazan health officials cited by the Associated Press.\"Let it be clear to everyone that, following the incident in Nuseirat, new instructions have been issued to the Mujahideen tasked with guarding the prisoners,\" Ubaida said in the statement, which was also reported on by the Jerusalem Post. \"These instructions outline how to handle the situation if the occupation army approaches the location where the prisoners are being held.\"The statement comes a day after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it recovered the bodies of six hostages—including an Israeli-American—from a tunnel in the southern Gazan city of Rafah. The deaths spiked labor strikes and protests across Israel on Monday as demonstrators put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach an immediate ceasefire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages.Ubaida blamed Israel's government for the hostages' deaths, saying in his statement, \"Netanyahu's insistence to free prisoners through military pressure, instead of sealing a deal means they will be returned to their families in shrouds. Their families must choose whether they want them dead or alive.\"During a press conference Monday, Netanyahu dismissed calls to reach a ceasefire deal in light of the hostages' deaths and reiterated that the 11-month war in Gaza can only come to an end once Hamas is eradicated from Gaza.\"What message would it send Hamas...Slay hostages and you'll get concessions?\" the Israeli leader told reporters.President Joe Biden has worked for months to secure a ceasefire deal that would allow both a pause in fighting and the release of the remaining hostages in Hamas' control. The White House has faced pressure from some progressive lawmakers over its handling of the war in Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has been pressed by pro-Palestinian activists to consider an arms embargo on Israel if elected into office in November.Gazan health officials say that over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its military response to the October 7 attacks. At least 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attacks, and Israel has said that over 250 others were taken hostage. During a week-long ceasefire last November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners under Israeli custody.In a statement on Sunday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of the hostages in Gaza, blamed Netanyahu for failing to bring those being held captive by Hamas home safely.\"For 11 months the Israeli government led by Netanyahu failed to do what a government is expected to do—return its sons and daughters home,\" the statement read. \"A deal for the return of the hostages has been on the table for over two months.

Trafalgar, which polled between Aug. 28-30, sees Trump sweeping 44 electoral votes from the pivotal Blue Wall states in November, eking out narrow wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin inside the polls’ margins of error. Insider Advantage handled polling in four other battlegrounds between Aug. 29-31, with Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina going to Trump. To be sure, each of these states remains a statistical dead heat — meaning they could ultimately go either way come election day. However, the polling is a departure from recent polling that shows Vice President Kamala Harris making gains in the states that will decide the election. In the Wolverine State, Trafalgar has the former president scoring a narrow victory, 47% to 46.6%. Pennsylvania shows a wider Trump lead: 47% to 45%. While winning by 2% wouldn’t constitute a landslide, it would be a bigger win than Trump’s modest 0.72% victory in the state eight years ago. Meanwhile, Wisconsin splits the two extremes, with Trump over Harris 47% to 46%. Though that margin seems narrow, considering that Trump won the state by 0.77% in 2016 and lost it by 0.63% in 2020. It’s worth noting that the RealClearPolitics polling average currently shows all three of these states going toward Harris, with Michigan having shifted on Aug. 29. In Arizona, Trump leads 49% to 48% in the race for 11 electoral votes, a smaller margin than the 0.3% Biden win four years ago, and one that would trigger an automatic recount in the state. Trump leads by more than 12 points with independents. A 9.5% lead with independents buoys Trump in Nevada to a 48%-47% lead, where six electoral votes are at stake. Trump lost the state in both 2016 and 2020. Meanwhile, Trump leads Harris 49% to 48% in North Carolina, less than the 1.34% margin of victory he secured in 2020, and despite Harris leading with independents 50% to 46%. He could take 16 electoral votes in the Tar Heel state. Georgia represents the only deviation, with Harris up 48% to 47.6% in the race for 16 electoral votes. She holds the smallest possible lead with independents, 45.2% to 45.1%.","summary":"The surveys have Trump narrowly winning six of the seven swing states that will decide the 2024 election.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/us-news/latest-swing-state-polls-suggest-trump-could-score-decisive-victory-against-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/latest-swing-state-polls-suggest-88818449.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YqMTVu0D-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:44:35","author":"A.g.

The internet phenomenon took off in earnest in June with the release of the singer's sixth studio album Brat, which featured a now-famous lime green cover with the title in all lowercase. The unique aesthetic took off like wildfire, particularly on TikTok. Charli XCX herself explained the meaning of the word \"brat\" in a TikTok video. “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes. Who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like, parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it’s brat. You’re brat. That’s brat,” she said in the video. Then, Brat cemented its place in the summer zeitgeist when President Joe Biden announced he was stepping down from the 2024 presidential election, and Charli XCX expressed her support for Vice President Kamala Harris by tweeting, \"Kamala IS brat.\" That tweet, which to date has over 55 million views, then inspired countless TikToks, social media posts, and explainers on cable news networks. Naturally, Harris' campaign quickly co-opted the aesthetic and changed their social media banners to mimic the Brat album cover art. The Kamala HQ Instagram page, which regularly shares memes, used the \"Brat\" look to declare, \"Welcome to Kamala HQ. This is the official rapid response page of Vice President Harris' presidential campaign.\" The post also included a screengrab of Charli XCX's tweet about Harris, and featured the caption, \"And when we put this to bed the internet will go crazy.\" Former President Barack Obama also enjoyed a Brat Summer. He listed \"365,\" the last song on Brat, on his summer playlist that was shared on social media Aug. 12. \"It wouldn’t be my playlist if it didn’t include an eclectic mix,\" he wrote. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Charli XCX's new declaration follows previous speculation that the trend was waning, which she denied in an Instagram post on July 25. Sharing headlines from various outlets declaring the trend dead, Charli cheekily captioned her post at that time, \"oh ? see u next week :)\" The singer now seems to have changed her mind after Labor Day weekend, a holiday that unofficially marks the end of summer. (The season, however, lasts through Sept. 22.) But, who knows, maybe \"Brat Summer\" could pave the way for \"Brat Autumn.\" Stranger memes have happened, after all.","summary":"&#34;Goodbye forever brat summer,&#34; she wrote on social media.","url":"https://ew.com/charli-xcx-declares-the-end-of-brat-summer-8705282","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/bNx_48gDvrCucwxYANtk98TMttg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charli-xcx-090224-e886d6c3c2f34fdd96d09c4609af4e39.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/P4I1icgO-GQ0UtFMY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:42:57","author":"Lauren Huff","authors":["Lauren Huff"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.319},{"id":255487228,"title":"Vets Who Served With Tim Walz in National Guard Blast Him as 'Impersonator'","text":"Veterans who served with Minnesota Governor and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz in the National Guard criticized him on Monday over his service, calling him an \"impersonator.\"Since Walz was announced as Kamala Harris' running mate, critics have scrutinized his military record and alleged that he has made misleading statements about his service with the National Guard. Figures including GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance have also accused Walz of \"stolen valor\" for calling himself a retired command sergeant major.Walz served in Minnesota's National Guard for 24 years, reaching the rank of command sergeant major, but that rank was later removed due to the failure to complete needed coursework. Walz's title was then reduced to master sergeant.Appearing in a Monday interview with Megyn Kelly, four National Guard veterans who served alongside Walz, Tom Behrends, Paul Herr, Tom Schilling, and Rodney Tow, spoke on and criticized Walz for his previous statements on his service.In the in-depth hour-long interview, when asked by Kelly about Walz's rank and \"how does it make you feel,\" Behrends took aim at the governor, calling him a \"military impersonator.\"\"You know this guy is a military impersonator with that...like you said he's a retired command sergeant major, he said it so many times that it just makes a person sick hearing. Yeah the state of Minnesota said he can say he served as a command sergeant major, which he has never said 'I served as a command sergeant major', he blabs that he is a retired one,\" Behrends said.Herr then remarked that Walz is a \"habitual liar\" stating that \"he lies about everything. He lies about stuff that doesn't even make sense.\"\"We have stolen valor [because] people make decisions that are cowardly, and they come back and they try to live vicariously by robbing...all the other soldiers of all the benefits...and all the sacrifices,\" Herr added.Newsweek has reached out to Walz's campaign spokesperson and the Harris campaign via email for comment.In addition to Walz's rank, critics have also alleged that Walz falsely claimed that he was deployed to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan as part of the National Guard.Walz, who served with the Minnesota National Guard from 1981 to 2005, was sent overseas only once and not in a direct combat role. He then did not deploy to Iraq in 2005 as he decided to leave the Guard to pursue his political career.When asked about Walz not deploying, Herr also aimed Walz, stating that not going into the trenches is a \"morale crusher\" and is \"morally indefensible.\"However, some Democrats have also pushed back on the attacks including Democratic Representative Adam Smith, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.When asked about the deployment, Smith pointed towards the timeline of when Walz decided to leave, adding that it is \"an absolute lie\" to claim Walz did not want to deploy.\"He decided to run for Congress in February. He got out of the military in May, and his unit was called up in July, and I believe didn't deploy until, like, six months after that,\" Smith told Kelly in a previous interview. \"He did not get out of the National Guard because he didn't want to deploy. To claim that is an absolute lie.\"The veterans' comments come after Walz was asked in his joint interview with CNN on Thursday about his military service and a previous comment he made about carrying weapons \"in war\", responding, \"I said, we were talking about in this case—this was after a school shooting—the ideas of carrying these weapons of war and my wife the English teacher told me my grammar is not always correct. But again, if it's not this, it's an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it's an attack on my dog.\"Walz added, \"The one thing I'll never do is I'll never demean another member's service in any way. I never have and I never will.\" Walz was never in combat, and the Harris campaign previously commented that he \"misspoke\" when saying \"in war.\"","summary":"Four National Guard veterans who served alongside Tim Walz took aim at the Democratic vice presidential nominee for his service.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/veterans-who-served-tim-walz-national-guard-blast-him-impersonator-1947767","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462766/tim-walz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:35:17","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":255487830,"title":"President Biden joins VP Harris for Labor Day campaign blitz","text":"President Biden joins VP Harris for Labor Day campaign blitz On this Labor Day, Democrats have been on the campaign trail working to secure the vote of union workers in battleground states.

JB Pritzker declared Monday that nobody should “underestimate” former President Donald Trump’s ability to beat Vice President Kamala Harris in their upcoming high-stakes debate. “He has won a couple of debates that he did,” Pritzker said of Trump during an appearance on CNN. “Certainly, people would say that he won the debate against President Biden a couple of months ago,” the Harris surrogate added. Pritzker, 59, argued that Trump, 78, bested former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in at least one of their three 2016 presidential debates and that despite Harris being a “tremendous person with great capability” she should be cautious on stage with the former president. “We saw that he won the debate against Hillary Clinton when he ran the first time,” the governor said. “He’s not to be underestimated.” “We shouldn’t be thinking that somehow Kamala Harris has a greater ability to win a debate than Donald Trump,” Pritzker continued. “They’re going to come in as significant rivals with very, very different points of view.” Pritzker explained that one of Harris’ keys to victory in the showdown will be conveying her message without “getting flummoxed” by Trump. Harris and Trump and scheduled to square off for the first time on Sept. 10, in a debate hosted by ABC News. Veteran pollster Frank Luntz argued on CNN Monday that the debate will be “everything” for voters. “When the voters see side-by-side the two candidates and they listen to what they say, not just in the answers, it’s the body language. Is there contempt? Does someone fold their arms? Do they look at the individual when they’re speaking? Do they seem presidential in their approach?” Luntz explained. The pollster and political strategist suggested that voters will be interested to see if Trump can “keep quiet” and “listen to a response” and if Harris can “seem open minded” and “willing to take in information.”","summary":"\"I don't think anybody should underestimate Donald Trump,\" said Pritzker, during an appearance on CNN. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/us-news/gov-jb-pritzker-says-dont-underestimate-trump-in-high-stakes-debate-against-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-yf25p1awg-1725313780995.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725299605&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mLt9QkBY-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:26:45","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":255486940,"title":"Hamas vows to kill hostages at ‘risk’ of rescue, and Biden ups his presure on Israel","text":"Hamas has now basically admitted it killed those six hostages rather than risk their liberation — indeed, all but boasted of it. Meanwhile, the Harris-Biden administration seems to be taking the tragedy as license to push Israel into a cease-fire deal that could let the terrorists re-supply. Asked by a reporter Monday if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had done enough to secure a hostage deal, Biden gave a flat “No” while claiming “we’re very close” to proposing another hostage deal this week, and “Hope springs eternal.” Hamas refused to accept the last cease-fire offer, even as Netanyahu was signaling (some) willingness to bend on the crucial question of the Philadephi corridor: Who is to control the Gaza-Egyptian border during any ceasefire? Cairo, it turns out, had let the area be riddled with smuggling tunnels on its watch, so Bibi is reluctant to let the IDF cede control even temporarily now — lest Hamas take the opportunity to re-arm and/or get its top leaders out of Dodge. We doubt Biden or Kamala Harris is willing to send in US forces to do the job, so slamming Bibi as the prez did is tantamount to saying that Israel must give Hamas a lifeline to get the remaining hostages freed. Maybe that’s what Israel should do, but Washington pushing Jerusalem to bend is pretty rank — especially when Biden’s motive is fundamentally selfish: He wants a ceasefire in place to cement his own legacy, and to boost Harris’ chances in November. And this is after Harris-Biden pushed Israel to hold off on operations that could’ve freed hostages weeks or months ago. Especially when Hamas now brags it’ll kill hostages rather than let them be rescued. Israel faces its own divisions on these questions; an American leader determined to be a true ally wouldn’t be stirring the pot purely to serve his own domestic political aims. But, plainly, that’s not how Biden or Harris rolls.","summary":"Hamas has now basically admitted it killed those six hostages rather than risk their liberation — indeed, all but boasted of it.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/opinion/hamas-vows-to-kill-hostages-at-risk-of-rescue-and-biden-ups-his-presure-on-israel/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2024-tel-aviv-israel-bodies-88817792-e1725314825684.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:25:52","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":255488214,"title":"Angel Family of Rachel Morin Calls Out 'Lack of Acknowledgment, Compassion' from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris","text":"The Angel Family of Rachel Morin, the 37-year-old mother of five who was murdered allegedly by an illegal alien MS-13 gang member, says President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have lacked compassion throughout the tragedy. “The Morin family is deeply disappointed by the lack of acknowledgment and compassion from President Biden and his administration,” the Angel Family’s attorney Randolph Rice said in a statement: The silence is deafening, and it sends a troubling message that the safety and well-being of American citizens are not a priority. This lack of concern serves as a reminder of the apparent disregard by the Biden administration for the victims of preventable crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Like many others, the Morin family deserves recognition and action from their leaders to prevent such tragedies from happening again. [Emphasis added] Oppositely, Morin’s brother spoke at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July at the invitation of former President Donald Trump, and Morin’s mother recently joined Trump at a campaign press conference at the United States-Mexico border. On August 5, 2023, Morin went for a walk at the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Harford County, Maryland. When Morin did not return home, her boyfriend, Richard Tobin, reported her missing. The following day, her body was found on the side of the trail. On June 15, 2024, the Tulsa Police Department arrested 23-year-old Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez, an illegal alien from El Salvador with ties to the MS-13 gang, in connection to Morin’s murder. Prosecutors have alleged that Martinez Hernandez brutally raped, bludgeoned, and strangled Morin to death in what they say is the most horrific case in Harford County history. Martinez Hernandez was indicted in July on first and second-degree murder charges, and on rape, sexual offenses, and kidnapping charges. Martinez Hernandez, who remains in police custody, will stand trial in October. Martinez Hernandez is among more than two million known illegal alien got-aways who have successfully crossed the border on Biden and Harris’s watch. On three occasions in 2023, Border Patrol agents apprehended Martinez Hernandez — twice in January in New Mexico and Texas, as well as once in February in New Mexico. On each occasion, he was returned to Mexico. Sometime after he was last returned to Mexico, Martinez Hernandez crossed the border and made his way to California, where he allegedly assaulted a woman and her child. He later traveled to Maryland, where he was accused of raping and murdering Morin. Before crossing the border, Martinez Hernandez was accused of murdering a woman in his native El Salvador after leaving a bar with the victim. The woman’s body was discovered days later.

Jared Polis gaslights on Tren de Aragua takeover of  Aurora, Colo. apartment  buildings","text":"Migrant gangs are turning Aurora, Colo., apartment complexes into hellholes, and the Democratic governor is turning a blind eye. It’s an unhappy consequence of being a suburb of sanctuary-city Denver: Venezuelan migrants have spread from the Mile High City, with allegedly gang-affiliated ones claiming apartment buildings as their turf, terrorizing residents. One chilling video shows suspected Tren de Aragua members stalking through the complex with guns. Another, from the same complex, shows two men breaking into a unit with a tire iron. Mayor Mike Coffman confirmed that at least two buildings have been taken over, calling it an “organized criminal effort,” and adding, “I think we’re the victim of a failed policy at the southern border.” City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinsky has warned: “I worry about everything that I know regarding this gang. And I worry about everything that I don’t know.” But despite the mountains of evidence, Gov. Jared Polis (D.) is flat-out denying that it’s happening. On Wednesday, his office called the invasion “a feature of Danielle Jurinsky’s imagination” and sneered that Polis “really hopes that the city council members in charge stop trashing their own city when they are supposed to keep it safe.” This is gaslighting at its worst. Was it Jurinsky’s “imagination” when local ringleader Jhonardy Jose Pacheco-Chirino and some of his thugs reportedly beat a man at one of these complexes? Or when he was involved in a shooting that wounded two men at the same complex? Was it her imagination that prompted one apartment-dweller to tell Fox31 Denver, “It’s been a nightmare and I can’t wait to get out of here”? Jurinsky has long been blaring the alarm on the migrant crisis’ impact on her city. She’s called out the Harris-Biden administration for the “suffering” of Aurorans and slammed Denver officials for incentivizing migrants to flock the Mile High City region in droves by offering free housing and other taxpayer-funded goodies. Polis is a relatively moderate Democrat: He’s advocated for getting rid of Colorado’s income tax and making the state more business-friendly; he traveled to the White House in February to push Harris-Biden to address border security and call for more funding to cities being overwhelmed by migrants. But he’s also contributed to migrants’ overrun of the state: He signed a sanctuary law in 2019, prohibiting probation officers from “providing an individual’s personal information to federal immigration authorities,” and in June, he signed measures making it easier for migrants to get drivers’ licenses and government aid. The gang’s power-grab in Aurora is inconvenient for Polis, hence his “don’t believe your lying eyes” approach. By late Friday, it seemed he’d leaned on Mayor Coffman to shush, or at least to combat the “taken control” narrative — even as the city requested an emergency court order “to clear the apartment buildings where Venezuelan gang activity has been occurring.” Later in the weekend, Polis tweeted that “taking over buildings has no place in Colorado,” and he’s “been in touch” with Aurora officials over the past month and “offered any and all state assistance” to “back up any operation by the Aurora Police Department.” That is: Don’t blame me! The national migrant crisis has become so undeniable that even Kamala Harris has dropped the pretense that all is well. Polis can continue to try to sell the lie that Aurora’s officials are “imagining” a gang takeover, but the town’s residents, like Americans in Dem-run cities across the country, are living the ugly truth.","summary":"Aurora has been experiencing the unhappy consequences of being a suburb of sanctuary-city Denver; Venezuelan migrants, some of whom are gang members, have spread from the Mile High City and are claiming apartment buildings as their home turf, terrorizing residents.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/opinion/gov-jared-polis-gaslights-on-tren-de-aragua-takeover-of-aurora-colo-apartment-buildings/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-edkso6cka-1725314103679.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725299763&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7c6CfVek-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:09:02","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":255486760,"title":"Kamala Harris goes viral with 'cringe' new accent at Detroit rally, sparks 'Foghorn Leghorn' comparisons","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris raised eyebrows during her Labor Day rally in Detroit, Michigan, unveiling what critics call a new \"accent.\" Harris spent her Monday holiday in the Motor City hoping to shore up blue-collar union workers in the critical battleground state that she wants to keep blue in the November election. \"You better thank a union member for the five-day work week,\" Harris told the crowd with a noticeable shift in her dialect. \"You better thank a union member for sick leave.

On Labor Day Monday, Charli XCX bid farewell to Summer 2024, which was musically defined by her iconic, chartreuse-colored pop album. “Goodbye forever brat summer,” Charli wrote on X. Following Brat’s success, Rolling Stone declared that “the world had finally caught up” with the singer. Brat, which dropped on June 7, dominated the cultural conversation this summer, thanks to lyrics in songs “Von Dutch” and “360,” such as “I’m everywhere, I’m so Julia.” Charli continued growing the album’s impact with massive remixes of some of the LP’s songs, including the “Girl, So Confusing” remix with Lorde and the Billie Eilish version of “Guess,” and an expanded version of the album called Brat and It’s the Same but There’s Three More Songs So It’s Not. The album also spawned a TikTok dance challenge with her song “Apple.” The LP even had a political crossover. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign played into Charli XCX’s Brat summer aesthetic by changing their X header to the chartreuse aesthetic of the British singer’s album after she was announced as a nominee. Charli also later tweeted, “Kamala IS brat.” “To be on the right side of democracy, the right side of women’s rights is hugely important to me,” Charli told New York Magazine about the politics-music crossover last month. “I’m happy to help to prevent democracy from failing forever.” Brat summer itself might be over, but its songs will live on forever — and during Charli’s upcoming joint tour with Troye Sivan this fall. Shortly after sending out the post, Charli blasted a Community text to her fans with a link to tickets for her upcoming Sweat tour. “U ready?” she wrote.

Harris “is expected to say that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and operated and stress her commitment to always have the backs of American steel workers,” her campaign says. That's similar to Biden, who has said that he opposed U.S. Steel's would-be sale to Nippon in order to better “maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.\" But it still constitutes a major policy position for the vice president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris in July. Harris has been careful to balance presenting herself as “a new way forward” while remaining intensely loyal to Biden and the policies he has pushed. Her delivery is very different — and in some cases she's pushed to move faster than Biden's administration — but the overall goal of expanding government programs to buoy the middle class is the same. The vice president began marking Labor Day with a rally at a high school gymnasium in Detroit, where hundreds of audience members wore bright yellow union shirts and hoisted “Union strong” signs. She noted that one of the nation's first Labor Day parades happened in Detroit around 140 years ago and that “every person in our nation has benefited” from unions' work. \"Everywhere I go I tell people, ‘Look, you may not be a union member, you’d better thank a union member,” Harris said, noting that collective bargaining by organized labor helped secure the five-day work week, sick-pay and other key benefits and solidify safer working conditions. “When unions are strong, America is strong,” she said. In addition to opposing the Nippon Steel sale, Biden has endorsed expanding tariffs on imported Chinese steel — a rare instance of political overlap with Republican former President Donald Trump, who has cheered steeper foreign tariffs on many imports. Still, in a statement Monday, U.S. Steel said it remains “committed to the transaction with Nippon Steel, which is the best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities, and customers.” “The partnership with Nippon Steel, a long-standing investor in the United States from our close ally Japan, will strengthen the American steel industry, American jobs, and American supply chains, and enhance the U.S. steel industry’s competitiveness and resilience against China,” the company said, noting that it employs nearly 4,000 people in Pennsylvania alone. David B. Burritt, U.S. Steel’s president and CEO, said Nippon Steel has announced plans to invest “approximately $1.3 billion in U. S. Steel union-represented facilities, on top of the $1.4 billion capital commitment they previously announced.” © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

She also touted her goal of creating an “opportunity economy,” which she claimed would allow citizens “not just to get by” but to “get ahead.” Former President Donald Trump wants to pull the United States back to a time “before workers had the freedom to organize,” Harris warned her supporters. The vice president harped on Trump administration policies, accusing the former president of blocking overtime benefits “for millions of workers.” Trump supported “so-called right to work laws,” Harris said, to loud boos aimed at Trump. Harris’s claim about Trump and overtime pay is one she and Walz have perpetuated, but PolitiFact recently deemed it “misleading.” The claim stems from a judge blocking an Obama administration policy on overtime rules during the Trump administration. Instead of challenging the judge, Trump set his own policy that extended overtime benefits to workers. However, it included millions fewer than what the Obama-era policy would have had. Harris’s busy day on the campaign trail also included a stop at a labor union hall in Pittsburgh with President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Walz spoke to a friendly crowd in Milwaukee in front of a podium with a sign that read “Laborfest.” Trump, for his part, wrote in a Labor Day message on Truth Social that “under Comrade Kamala Harris,” average citizens are acutely feeling the painful effects of high inflation on a holiday weekend.

The Trump campaign pushed back against that allegation, and said it was invited by families of the fallen soldiers to attend the event.\"If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans, military families, and service members should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,\" Harris said shortly after the initial report came out.Trump \"disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,\" she added.Analysts who spoke to Newsweek said Harris' attack line could backfire and reignite criticism of the administration's handling of military matters it might rather not relitigate, particularly the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago.After Harris lodged her criticism, Trump's campaign released a statement from many of the Gold Star families who invited him to Arlington National Cemetery for what became the photo-op in question. They defended the Republican presidential nominee and insisted that Harris was the one politicizing the memory of their fallen loved ones, even cutting an ad for the Trump campaign slamming Harris that circulated widely online over the holiday weekend.\"President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children's deaths,\" said the families in a joint statement. \"He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.\"Harris' decision to attack Trump over the incident at Arlington is likely to harken back in the minds of some voters to Trump's disparaging remarks about military figures, from his infamous comment about Senator John McCain — \"I like people who weren't captured\" — to his alleged remarks about World War II veterans being \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" That, at least, could have been the political strategy.But some analysts believe Harris's decision to criticize Trump on military matters carries enormous risks given the Biden administration presiding over the 2021 withdrawal, which resulted in scenes of chaos beamed around the world as well as the loss of 13 U.S. service members.Since then, polls have consistently shown that the aftermath of the Afghanistan exit is the first point at which Biden's popularity took a turn, beginning a long and slow slide that never recovered before he they eventually forced him to end his reelection campaign. The debacle remains a sore point for many Americans, particularly Gold Star families who feel the administration failed their loved ones.\"From a political perspective, it's not a bad move, but it's a risky one,\" said Chuck Coughlin, an Arizona-based political strategist. \"They're going to focus on the Afghanistan situation initially, but there's also a competing narrative about Trump's disrespect for military personnel that could gain traction. It might come down to which narrative is louder.\"The Harris campaign faces a dilemma, balancing the contrasting narratives of Trump's alleged disrespect for military personnel and the Biden administration's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal—a decision that has fallen relatively flat thus far as an attack line against Harris.\"Biden and Vice President Harris have had to defend the decision to withdraw troops, arguing that while the Doha Agreement was initiated under Trump, it ultimately required execution and couldn't be ignored,\" said political strategist Sergio Gutierrez.\"Their challenge has been twofold: to justify ending a long and costly war while also addressing criticism of how the withdrawal was managed,\" he added.Further complicating the military narrative is the controversy surrounding Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who has faced accusations of \"stolen valor\" from Trump's running mate, JD Vance. Walz, a veteran with 24 years of military service, has been accused by Vance of embellishing his military record for political gain.Weeks after that storyline first emerged after Walz was chosen, and just as it may have been settling down post-convention, four veterans who served with Walz in the National Guard sat for an interview with conservative commentator Megyn Kelly on her podcast Monday, accusing him of grossly exaggerating his military service.\"He lies about everything. He lies about stuff that doesn't even make sense,\" one of the guardsmen said.Walz has fiercely defended his service, arguing that such accusations are an insult to all veterans.The issue of military service, particularly the sacrifices made by service members and their families, was until recently something of a third rail in politics. (John McCain once famously used footage from Arlington Cemetery in a campaign ad by accident, but immediately deleted it and acknowledged the mistake.)But ever since Trump delivered that shocking rejoinder to McCain's military record as a P.O.W., Democrats have seen an opening to tie the former president up on the issue. Both Coughlin and Gutierrez are among those who believe there is an opportunity for Harris to leverage the most recent controversy at Arlington, given Trump's strained relationship with veterans and military personnel.\"Military service of that nature is truly noble. However, exploiting such sentiments for political gain could backfire for both sides, as anything that attempts to exploit that is largely looked upon with derision,\" Coughlin noted.","summary":"As the 2024 campaign heats up, Harris criticized Trump for disrespecting the military, but analysts warn it could backfire.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/can-gold-star-families-saddle-kamala-harris-bidens-afghanistan-baggage-1947760","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462040/kamala-harris-chicago.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:44:42","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":255485210,"title":"Once neglected, Asian Americans now courted in knife-edge election","text":"NEW YORK -- On July 27, Doug Emhoff walked onto a stage in a small Wisconsin city 1,200 kilometers northwest of Washington.

Critics claim the vice president nominee used a ‘fake accent’ when speaking to a teachers union during a swing state campaign push in Michigan on Monday. Social media erupted with accusations the Democratic presidential candidate altered her voice during the remarks praising teachers union members at a Detroit high school. Harris has faced allegations and mockery of allegedly using different accents before, and the claims, and they are now emerging with just two months until election day. ‘New Kamala accent just dropped,’ one X user wrote in response to a clip of Harris speaking to a teacher’s union at a high school in Detroit, Michigan on Monday. In her remarks, social media users claim that Harris adopted an urban accent to relate to the working class crowd. ‘You may not be a union member but you better thank a union member for the five day work week,’ Harris said in a tone of voice atypical of the one she uses in her usual stump speeches. She went on: ‘You better thank a union member for sick leave. You better thank a union member for paid leave. You better thank a union member for vacation time.’ ‘I’m from California. We all talk like this,’ an X user sarcastically wrote alongside a phonetic spelling of how Harris spoke in her remarks: ‘I’m gonna make sure to thanka union memba today.’ At another point an audience member shouted something about her future beyond just the 2024 election. Harris, still employing this new accent, replied with a large smile and laugh before leaning over the podium and saying: ‘Let’s just get through the next 64 days.’ ‘New Kamala accent just dropped,’ one user wrote on X. Harris was in Detroit on Labor Day speaking with union members at Northwestern High School’s gymnasium about the contributions of unions to the labor force. The vice president is half Jamaican and half Indian. The Trump campaign has accused her of using her blackness to her advantage when it suits her and has pointed to the fact that she touted her Indian-American heritage when she became a U.S. Senator in 2017. Trump also said during a hostile interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago last month in an interview that Harris only started ‘promoting’ her blackness when she ran for president. ‘I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,’ he said during the annual convention. ‘So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?’ Discovery Institute journalist Jonathan Choe noted on X, formerly Twitter, that it was a code switch Harris was using to relate more with a predominantly black and urban audience listening to her remarks on Monday. ‘Kamala Harris code switching again as she busts out a new accent at a rally in Detroit,’ he wrote. The latest criticism comes after Harris was also mocked in July for faking a southern accent during a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia. ‘You all helped us win in 2020 and we gonna do it again in 2024,’ Harris told voters in her fake Southern accent. Harris commonly slips into a Southern accent when speaking to voters in Southern communities. The VP grew up in San Francisco, California and spent her high school years in Montreal, Canada. She faced similar criticism on the campaign trail in 2020 when she extending her vowels during an even in Florida when she said: ‘We will tell them we were hangin’ out in a parking lot this particular Saturday afternoon with Kamala and all our friends.’ Outkick writer Ian Miller posted of the latest accent use on Monday: ‘At some point, Kamala’s going to speak in England and adopt a full on British accent and everyone will pretend like it’s totally normal.’ Outkick writer Ian Miller posted of the latest accent use: ‘At some point, Kamala’s going to speak in England and adopt a full on British accent and everyone will pretend like it’s totally normal.’ ‘BREAKING: Kamala Harris unveils a new urban accent in Detroit,’ the pro-MAGA account End Wokeness wrote. ‘This is cringe pandering,,’ another wrote. ‘Kamala is using her new ‘accent’ when talking to a certain demographic of people.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris is facing more allegations of flip-flopping, but this time it&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Social media is buzzing about Kamala Harris&#8217; accent during her speech to teachers union first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/social-media-is-buzzing-about-kamala-harris-accent-during-her-speech-to-teachers-union/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Social-media-erupts-over-Kamala-Harris-fake.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:40:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.073},{"id":255485980,"title":"Did the Philadelphia Eagles endorse Harris for president?","text":"At a bus stop on 34th Street, in Philadelphia’s University City section, a giant poster, between 5 and 6 feet tall, was enclosed in a case at a bus stand for the city’s public transportation company. It featured a cartoonish graphic resembling Vice President Kamala Harris, who wore an Eagles helmet, held a football, and had on a black top. Then there was the Eagles logo above the word “Kamala,” which was above text that said “official candidate of the Philadelphia Eagles.” Apparently, this image was not the only one in the city. Social media featured numerous posts of the graphic being reported in locations throughout Philadelphia’s Center City area. The posters’ existence caused quite a frenzy throughout the city, with many people angry the team would support a candidate like Harris. It also left people wondering if the poster is as authentic and legitimate as it looked and why the Eagles would endorse a presidential candidate when the organization has never done so. In search of answers to these questions, I contacted the Philadelphia Eagles media relations officials. The team directed me to a statement it had posted on its social media accounts. “We are aware counterfeit political ads are being circulated and are working with our advertising partner to have them removed,” the release said. So, the first question was answered: The Philadelphia Eagles did not endorse Harris for president with political posters placed around the city. But if the Eagles didn’t do this, how could it happen? This wasn’t just some flier posted around the city on telephone polls. It was enclosed in a locked display case at a bus stand about 6.5 feet tall. I asked the Eagles this very question on Monday, but the team declined to comment. Instead, a media relations representative once again directed me to the team’s statement on social media as its only comment on the incident. Still searching for an answer, I contacted the media relations department at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Philadelphia’s public transportation company. It informed me that SEPTA doesn’t own the bus stands and is not responsible for the advertisements placed there. That responsibility belonged to the city of Philadelphia. “SEPTA does not own the bus shelters, so we don’t handle those ad spaces,” a representative said. “The shelters are owned by the city.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Attempts to contact the city of Philadelphia’s media inquiry department late Monday afternoon have been unsuccessful. This story will be updated accordingly. However, if true, this would seem to be an egregious violation of ethics. Philadelphia would have been responsible for publishing this deceptive image without permission from the Philadelphia Eagles. Furthermore, if the city approved it, it would also seem that this image was used as political propaganda to misrepresent the Philadelphia Eagles and try to interfere with people’s thinking about how to vote in the election.","summary":"It was a beautiful Labor Day in the Philadelphia area Monday afternoon.

You better thank a union member,'\" Harris said to supporters gathered at Northwestern High School in Detroit. \"For the five-day work week, you better thank a union member. For sick leave, you better thank a union. For paid leave, you better thank a union for vacation time.\"How Harris Regained Momentum With UnionsRepublicans have made inroads with union members in recent election years, despite labor leadership consistently endorsing Democrats at the top of the ticket. Exit polling in 2016 found that union households supported then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump by only 8 points—in comparison, in the 2012 election, Democrats won union households by 18 points, per the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.President Joe Biden improved Democrats' numbers among union households when he beat Trump in 2020, winning the voting block by 16 points, according to exit polls. But polling earlier this election season showed that Biden and Trump were nearly neck-and-neck for the union vote this fall, posing risks for Democrats in some key battleground states that Biden flipped by a narrow margin just four years prior.Harris, however, has secured endorsements from some of the biggest unions in the U.S., including the United Auto Workers Union, the American Federal of Teachers and the National Education Association, all of which joined her on stage in Detroit, Michigan, on Monday, where the vice president again vowed to fight for union workers if elected to the Oval Office.\"We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America's middle class,\" Harris told attendees.Recent polling has also shown Harris reclaiming the Democrats' lead with union voters. A survey from Emerson College released on August 16 found that the vice president was ahead of Trump by 14.8 percentage points among union voters in Pennsylvania (56.8 percent to 42 percent). Back in July, a similar poll found the former president leading union voters by 5 percentage points while Biden was still in the race.Harris also received promising numbers out of Michigan in an Emerson College poll released late last week—while 30.1 percent of union households said they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, Trump trailed by double digits, earning 20 percent of the vote. The survey was based on the responses of 800 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.4 percent.Despite the momentum, the race between Trump and Harris remains tight—RealClearPolling reports that Harris has just a 0.5 percent lead across polling in Pennsylvania, and is beating Trump on average by 1.1 percentage points in Michigan. As of Monday, the vice president was leading the race across national polls by 2.3 percent (47.1 percent to 44.8 percent), per RealClearPolling's aggregate.\"Let's not pay too much attention to the polls,\" Harris told rally-goers in Detroit. \"Let's know, like labor always does, we are out here running like we are the underdog in this race because we know what we are fighting for.\"Biden is slated to join Harris in Pittsburgh later in the day Monday at the city's Labor Day parade, alongside Pennsylvania Democrats Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Bob Casey.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment on Harris' campaign stops.","summary":"Union households could play a key role in either candidate securing the battlegrounds states of Michigan and Pennsylvania this fall.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/where-kamala-harris-donald-trump-stand-union-workers-polls-1947726","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462757/where-harris-trump-stand-among-union-voters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:32:29","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.092},{"id":255485420,"title":"Walz’s motorcade involved in a crash on the way to a campaign stop, with a 'few minor injuries'","text":"Several vehicles in Minnesota Gov.

Frank Luntz appeared on CNN, where he was asked what the presidential candidates had left to do in the final stretch between now and the election. “The debate is everything,” Luntz said. CNN anchor John Berman then asked him to elaborate. “Everything,” Luntz repeated. “When the voter sees side by side the two candidates and they listen to what they say, not just the answers, it’s the body language. Is there contempt? Does someone fold their arms? Do they look at the individual when they’re speaking? Do they seem presidential in their approach?” The upcoming debate has been scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia. There has been some recent controversy over the debate's rules, as the Trump and Harris campaigns disagreed over microphones. Harris's campaign wants the microphones to remain live throughout the debate, which is a departure from previous debate rules. The Associated Press obtained the debate rules from a senior Trump official, which reportedly said there would be no live audience, no written notes and that the mics would be muted when the other candidate is speaking. The Harris campaign told the AP that they are still discussing the mic issue with ABC. “It’s interesting that Trump’s handlers keep insisting on muting him, despite the candidate himself saying the opposite,” Harris spokesman Ian Sams told the AP. “Why won’t they just do what the candidate wants?” If the mics are live, Trump will have the opportunity to interrupt Harris and potentially derail the debate, a point Luntz highlighted during his CNN segment. “For Trump, can he keep quiet? Can he actually listen to a response, or does he have to respond to everything,” Luntz said. “For Harris, does she seem open-minded? Does she seem willing to take in information not just project?” Trump recently said he didn't care if the mics were muted, and went on to talk about his disdain for ABC News. “Each of them has different goals for that debate, but each one, in the end, has to prove that they’re ready, not just for that moment, but voters are thinking ‘who do I want to represent me two years from now, three or four years from now?” Luntz continued. As for Harris, Luntz said the vice president would have to show the public that she has improved since her 2020 Democratic primary debate - where she was panned. “She has to prove she has the capability to do it and Trump has to prove that he doesn’t treat her rudely, obnoxiously, because he lost a lot of female voters in 2020 who would have voted for him over policy but would not vote for him because of his persona,” Luntz said.","summary":"“When the voter sees side by side the two candidates and they listen to what they say, not just the answers, it’s the body language,” a pollster said. “Do they seem presidential in their approach?”","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/republican-pollster-trump-harris-debate-b2605906.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/31/15/SEI219322298.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mrXN5kfu-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:11:31","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":255488210,"title":"Kamala Harris Loses Support in Post-Democrat Convention Poll","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has lost support after the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll.

This marks a net one-point swing Trump’s way, showing no bump for Harris since she accepted her party’s nomination. The current poll also shows that Trump’s latest indictment over his challenge of the 2020 election results has not harmed his prospects. Moreover, the survey reveals how Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s departure from the field and endorsement of Trump has affected the race. The share of undecided Americans in this poll is four points higher than the August 21 poll, which had Kennedy at three percent of support. The option “other” has also increased by four percent, indicating lesser-known third-party candidates have drawn some of Kennedy’s support. The race between Trump and Harris is much closer than the contest between Trump and President Joe Biden at a similar point in the 2020 cycle, according to a Redfield & Wilton poll at the time. The August 20, 2020, survey of 2,000 respondents found Biden with a 10-point advantage over Trump. In that poll, Biden and Trump registered at 49 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Nine percent were undecided, while three percent went to third-party candidates. Harris is underperforming Biden by five points, while Trump outperforms his previous mark by three points. The latest poll finds the most influential issues are the economy, immigration, and abortion. When asked to pick three issues that would most impact their vote, 62 percent selected the economy, 36 percent chose immigration, and 34 percent said abortion.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has lost support since the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, per a Redfield &#038; Wilton Strategies poll. \n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris Loses Support in Post-Democrat Convention Poll appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/09/02/kamala-harris-loses-support-in-post-democrat-convention-poll/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Kamala-Harris-4-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:09:46","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":255483362,"title":"Election 2024: Here’s Why North Carolina Has Suddenly Become A Key Swing State","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Vice President Kamala Harris could become only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina in more than 40 years as the state has slowly shifted more to the left over the past decade—thanks in part to a growing high-tech corridor.

(Photo by JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts Polls show former President Donald Trump and Harris in a virtual tie, with Trump beating her by only a 0.4-point margin in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average and by 0.6 points in RealClearPolitics’ polling average, with a recent Emerson College poll showing Harris trailing by one, and two Morning Consult polls taken last month showing them tied. The Cook Political Report moved North Carolina from “lean Republican” to a “toss up” last week, writing that the state “looks more competitive than ever” since Harris’ entrance into the race, and the Cook Political Report Swing State Project survey taken in late July/early August shows Harris leading Trump by one point, 48% to 47%, after Biden trailed Trump by seven points, 41% to 48%, in the Cook survey taken in May. If Harris wins the state, she has a 96.7% chance of winning the election, according to political analyst Nate Silver’s Voter Power Index, which found Trump would have a 76.6% chance of winning the electoral college if he wins North Carolina. Harris has a 38.5% chance of winning North Carolina, similar to her odds in Georgia (37.4%), and there’s an 86% chance the states will vote together, according to Silver’s model, which considers various demographic characteristics, including age, income, race and education level and the states’ voting history in the past two elections. North Carolina’s shift to the left has largely been credited to a population increase among potential voters who typically back Democrats—including the highly educated—especially from a 5.6% increase since 2020 near the “research triangle” area of Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, according to the Brookings Institution. That area hosts three major research universities—Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina University—that have also sparked related industries in high tech and the life sciences, and made it the tenth-fastest growing area in the country, according to Brookings. And the overall percentage of North Carolinians with a bachelor’s degree—a Democratic-leaning demographic—has also increased by 1.4 million since 1990, according to a study by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Big Number 16. That’s how many electoral college votes North Carolina has, after gaining a vote after the 2020 census. The state has the eighth most electoral votes in the country, tied with Georgia. Surprising Fact North Carolina has only voted for one Democratic presidential candidate since 1980: Barack Obama in 2008. Key Background Harris holds an advantage over Trump in almost all of the seven battleground states, according to a recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey, the latest to show she has essentially erased Trump’s lead over President Joe Biden in the must-win states. Overall, she leads by two percentage points across the seven states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and she either leads Trump or is tied with him in each of them, the poll found. Harris has also pulled ahead of Trump in most recent national surveys and now leads him by 1.8 points overall, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average. Biden won six of the seven states, with the exception of North Carolina in 2020, solidifying his win.

President Biden called and spoke to Walz a short time later, as the president was traveling to a separate campaign stop in Pittsburgh with Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris’ campaign said that she also spoke with her running mate by phone after the crash and that he was not injured. The Harris campaign said the crash involved cars near the rear of the motorcade. Walz, who is also the governor of Minnesota, was riding closer to the front. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the crash, which occurred shortly before 1 p.m. local time and caused some minor injuries. The White House said that Harris was briefed on the collision and spoke with Walz to check on him and the staff. She’s expected to get updates throughout the day. A member of the traveling pool staff, who was in a van carrying reporters, was injured and being treated by medics, according to a pool report from a reporter traveling in Walz’s motorcade, who wrote that passengers were “violently thrown forward, as our van slammed into the one in front of us and was hit from behind.” The van carrying the reporters remained pulled over on the side of the road for several minutes afterward. Some reporters had scrapes and bruises and one had a bloody nose. Another feared having suffered a concussion and was initially looking to be taken to urgent care – but eventually climbed aboard a new van to accompany the rest of the press to the event. All who wanted to be checked out by paramedics were assessed, according to the pool report. The crash occurred after Walz and his wife, Gwen, were greeted at the airport by Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin. The trio embraced, chatted and posed for a photo before the motorcade began heading to the event. Monday’s campaign stops marking Labor Day were Walz’s first aboard the Harris-Walz campaign charter aircraft.

Chief Fails to Condemn Hamas in Response to Hostage Murders","text":"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is under fire for responding to the heartless murder of Israeli and American hostages in Gaza on Friday with a message that did not condemn or even mention the Hamas terrorists who abducted and killed them. I will never forget my meeting last October with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin and other hostage families. Today's tragic news is a devastating reminder of the need for the unconditional release of all hostages and an end to the nightmare of war in Gaza. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) September 1, 2024 “I will never forget my meeting last October with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin and other hostage families,” Guterres wrote on Sunday. “Today’s tragic news is a devastating reminder of the need for the unconditional release of all hostages and an end to the nightmare of war in Gaza.” The response to his post on the social media platform X was immediate and overwhelmingly negative, as hundreds of respondents called Guterres “sick,” “cowardly,” and “evil” for failing to condemn Hamas in his message. Some also took Guterres to task for using passive voice and vague allusions to “tragic news” to avoid even acknowledging what happened: Hamas terrorists murdered their prisoners in cold blood with execution-style gunshots to the head because the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was on the verge of rescuing them. “Hamas just murdered six Israeli and American hostages by shooting them in the head. Why can’t you say so? Why can’t you condemn them?” an exasperated Hillel Neuer, executive director of U.N. Watch, asked Guterres. “Won’t even say Hamas. Won’t condemn the terror group that took Hersh, held him hostage for 330 days, and murdered him. Says it all,” remarked a disgusted American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). “The Secretary-General not only has Israeli blood on his hands, but he has American blood on his hands, too. Since his ‘fig leaf’ meeting with the hostage families, he has done zero to help them,” said former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan. “He could have demanded visits from the Red Cross; he could have condemned Hamas and held them to account, but, instead, he spent his time criticizing the law-abiding democracy of Israel instead of the ISIS-like terrorists,” Erdan told Fox News on Sunday. “This is a new low, even for the Secretary-General. Even today, he wouldn’t condemn the evil Hamas terrorists, but. of course, you can’t condemn what you support,” Erdan said, dismissing Guterres as “morally bankrupt.” In a further embarrassment to the United Nations, as well as the Biden administration, Hamas was holding its prisoners in Rafah — the city in Gaza that the U.N., President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris heavily pressured Israel to stay away from. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, the only hostage Guterres mentioned by name, was the American that Hamas murdered on Friday. Goldberg-Polin, 23, was kidnapped by the terrorists during their heinous attack on the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023. The five Israeli hostages Guterres did not salute by name were 24-year-old Eden Yerushalmi, 25-year-old Ori Danino, 27-year-old Almog Sarusi, 32-year-old Alex Lobanov, and 40-year-old Carmel Gat. Yerushalmi and Gat were women. All but Gat were kidnapped from the Nova music festival; Gat was taken from a nearby kibbutz (communal village) in Israel. Joel B. Pollak / Breitbart News According to IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, all of the victims were shot multiple times by their Hamas captors “a short while before we reached them.” “Their bodies were found during the fighting in Rafah in a tunnel about a kilometer away from the tunnel from which we rescued Farhan al-Qadi a few days ago,” Hagari said. Farhan al-Qadi is a 52-year-old Bedouin Arab Muslim and Israeli citizen who was rescued alive from a Hamas tunnel by Israeli special forces on Tuesday. Al-Qadi was one of six Bedouins whom Hamas kidnapped on October 7. “Since Farhan was found, troops were given an emphasis on operating carefully even more than usual because of the understanding that additional hostages may be in the area,” Hagari said in his press conference on Sunday.","summary":"U.N.

Tim Walz of being a “habitual liar” about his military rank and the reasons he left his unit before it deployed to Iraq, with one joking that “a good place” for the Democratic vice presidential candidate to end up would be Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Tom Behrends, Paul Herr, Tom Schilling, and Rodney Tow told SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly in an interview released Monday about their time serving as Guardsmen with Walz, who last month was chosen as a running mate by Vice President Kamala Harris. “He’s a habitual liar,” Herr said. “He lies about everything. He lies about stuff that doesn’t make sense.” “We have stolen valor [because] people make decisions that are cowardly, and they come back and they try to live vicariously by robbing … all the other soldiers of all the benefits … and all the sacrifices,” Herr went on. “They want a piece of that — they feel slighted,” he told Kelly. “He’s a military impersonator,” added retired Command Sgt. Maj. Tom Behrends. “He took his uniform, and he literally turned it inside out and went off into whatever other realm he did, which was vote against anything that went on in Iraq, vote against Gitmo, vote against whatever.” “And by the way, Gitmo would be a good place for him to end up at,” Behrends joked, prompting laughter from the other three vets. Walz, 60, when he served in Congress voted to close down the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2009, but had a mixed record of voting on the Iraq war: at times, approving supplemental funding; at others, backing a full withdrawal of US troops. He has repeatedly claimed since his first run for public office that he was a “command sergeant major,” but he retired before finishing the necessary coursework for the rank and was subsequently demoted in September 2005 to master sergeant. Both Herr and Behrends retired as command sergeant majors. Other accusations of “stolen valor” that have dogged the Democratic vice presidential pick have included his statements suggesting that he deployed to combat zones in Afghanistan or Iraq. Those embellishments had often been floated while Walz recounted his military service to voters, either as a US House candidate or Minnesota gubernatorial candidate. During his first run for the governor’s mansion in 2019, Walz said at a campaign event, “We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.” His political campaigns have had to walk back the misleading comments about his rank and service record — including the Harris campaign, which has said he “misspoke” in the past and updated its webpage to reflect that Walz rose “to the rank of Command Sergeant Major,” without mentioning his demotion. Asked about the misleading remarks over the years, Walz told CNN last week that his “wife, the English teacher, tells me my grammar is not always correct.” “I speak candidly,” he also said, attributing his fabrications to his passion about gun control: “I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about about our children being shot in schools and around, around guns.” He has also gone on the offensive at campaign rallies, declaring that he is “damn proud of my service to this country. And I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person’s service record.” Some Democrats have also pushed back on the attacks as politically motivated “lies,” including Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. “He decided to run for Congress in February. He got out of the military in May, and his unit was called up in July, and I believe didn’t deploy until, like, six months after that,” Smith told Kelly. “He did not get out of the National Guard because he didn’t want to deploy. To claim that is an absolute lie,” he said. But those who served with him quibbled with that timeline, including Behrends who said Walz was well aware by late 2004 of the potential deployment to Iraq and filed his paperwork to run for Congress in February 2005. In fact, Walz’s own 2005 congressional campaign in March of that year touted that the then-candidate would go to Iraq if deployed, failing to mention his planned retirement just two months later. Herr noted that the future congressman had also sworn to his foxhole buddies: “You can count on me.” “He told me and other sergeant majors in the meetings that, ‘You can count on me. I will deploy with my unit,'” said Herr. “His words to my ear and others.” “You think their parents didn’t want their soldiers to take a pass, take a knee and maybe go on the next one or go on something that maybe isn’t so dangerous? You’re darn skippy,” he explained of the 500 service members under Walz’s leadership. “We’re all long in the tooth. We could’ve retired,” added Herr, who served 34 years in the National Guard. “We didn’t.” … And that’s the position that he was in.”” “And that’s the position that he was in,” Herr continued. “He didn’t care.

Ms Harris's campaign has accused Mr Trump of “dodging labor on Labor” day, despite his claims to be rallying the support of workers unions. “Donald Trump is ditching workers on Labor Day because he is an anti-worker, anti-union extremist who will sell out working families for his billionaire donors if he takes power,” spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement. Trump issued his own statement earlier on Monday on Truth Social in which he boasted of his own achievements in office and claimed all Americans were “suffering” during the holiday weekend.","summary":"Watch live as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for a Labor Day parade on Monday, 2 September.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-pittsburgh-speech-live-b2605860.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/20/06/APTOPIX_Election_2024_DNC_75011.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:45:11","author":"Holly Patrick","authors":["Holly Patrick"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":255486626,"title":"Putin’s visit to Mongolia defies ICC warrant and tests neutral nation’s ‘third neighbor’ diplomacy","text":"Vladimir Putin arrived in Mongolia on Sept. 2, the first time the Russian president has visited an International Criminal Court (ICC) member country since the body issued a warrant for his arrest in 2023. While officially commemorating a Soviet-Mongolian military victory in World War II, Putin’s visit will test the small central Asian country’s policy of neutrality and the reach of international institutions. Mongolia, a country of just 3.3 million people but with huge geographical territory, has long navigated its foreign policy in the shadow of Russia and China, with whom it has extensive historical and economic ties. The country has attempted to bolster its independence from its more powerful neighbors by developing cordial relations with so-called third neighbor countries that include the United States, Germany, Japan and South Korea. Through this approach, Mongolia has attempted to carve out a niche on the international stage, presenting itself as a neutral diplomatic meeting ground. Its annual Ulaanbaatar Dialogue, for example, is an opportunity for regional countries and other invited nations, including from the U.S. and EU member states, to discuss issues ranging from climate change to regional security and critical minerals. As scholars of Mongolia and China, we attended the last such dialogue in June 2024 and witnessed Mongolia’s diplomatic efforts firsthand. It is a strategy that has worked for the country, but as events like Putin’s visit highlight, it can be a tough balancing act. A closely watched visit The timing of Putin’s trip is officially linked to history. It marks both the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Khalkhin Gol – in which joint Soviet-Mongolian forces defeated Japanese troops in World War II – and the founding of Mongolia’s national railway operator by the two countries 75 years ago. Yet it is a third historical marker, the fifth anniversary of a comprehensive Russian-Mongolian strategic partnership, that highlights the visit’s significance from a modern geopolitical perspective. Alongside its friendly relations with “third neighbors,” Mongolia has maintained a close relationship with Moscow despite Putin’s pariah status in much of the international community. Most recently, in July, Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh met with Putin at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Yet Putin’s visit now – the first he has made to the country since 2019 – poses a challenge for Mongolia as it seeks to balance its obligations and alliances with the Western-led international order, of which the ICC is a part, and its desire to remain friendly with its powerful neighbors. Few things demonstrate this diplomatic tightrope walk like Mongolia’s membership in the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin over his alleged role in the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. Ukraine has urged Mongolia to detain Putin, citing the ICC’s founding treaty, the Rome Statute, which instructs member countries to take action if subjects to a court warrant enter their territory. However, the ICC lacks an effective enforcement mechanism, and member states may also be exempt from carrying out arrests if doing so conflicts with certain treaty obligations or diplomatic immunity offered to another party. Putin’s visit is expected to demonstrate how little can be done to rein in Moscow. Given the power imbalance between the states, Mongolia will likely show just how far it is willing to go to accommodate its powerful neighbor. Mongolia’s ‘Third Neighbor’ policy For almost 70 years, Mongolia was closely allied with the Soviet Union. But the fall of communism and subsequent geopolitical reorientation of the post-Cold War order forced the country to alter its economic and political relations. In so doing, Mongolia became the only former communist state in Asia to adopt a democratic political system and open economy. It won favor with the U.S. and other Western countries who embraced the country as a role model for the region. Putin’s expected trip is but the latest in a series of recent high-profile state visits as Mongolia seeks to maintain close relations with its neighbors, while also expanding partnerships with other nations. So far in 2024, Mongolia has received heads of state or foreign ministers from the U.S., Slovenia, the Philippines, Belarus, the United Kingdom and Germany. In 2023, Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene traveled to the U.S. and met with Vice President Kamala Harris, and to China to see President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang. Both French President Emmanuel Macron and Pope Francis have recently visited Ulaanbaatar. Mongolia can’t escape geography While soft power efforts have won Ulaanbaatar goodwill and friends around the globe, they do not trump geography. Landlocked between Russia and China, Mongolia remains vulnerable to the whims of its two giant neighbors. Mongolia is dependent on Russia for almost all its gasoline and diesel supplies and a substantial part of its electricity. Further, due to a legacy agreement from the Soviet era, Russia retains 50% ownership in several key infrastructure and mining projects in Mongolia. In particular, Russia is a partner in the Mongolian railway system, which has grown in importance as a trade corridor between China and Russia, and China and Europe. Mongolia fears that its fuel supplies and transportation network will be disrupted if Russia prioritizes its own energy needs in the midst of war over the interests of its neighbors, however deep those ties may be. Similarly, Mongolia is dependent on China for the majority of its non-energy imports, including food, consumer and industrial products. And China is the destination for 90% of Mongolia’s exports, primarily coal and copper. Both Russia and China have used their economic and political muscle as leverage over Mongolia in the past due to perceived slights, such as China’s disruption of trade and a key loan in 2016 in protest of a visit to Mongolia by the Dalai Lama. Mongolia and the new China-Russia alignment Mongolia and other states in Central Asia face new challenges as Russia and China grow closer politically and economically. Mongolia played the role of a buffer state between the Soviet Union and China for much of the 20th century, and counted on the rivalry between the two superpowers to gain and maintain its independent status. But the growing friendship between China and Russia – highlighted by Putin and Xi’s declaration of a “no limits” partnership in February 2022, just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine – raises the question whether China and Russia will begin to act in concert to gain even more leverage over Mongolia and other smaller states in region. It is these geopolitical concerns that Ulaanbaatar may be fixated upon during Putin’s visit. Even as Mongolia has been affected by the sanctions placed on Russia, seeing transportation and business links disrupted, the country has steered clear of confrontations with Moscow in international settings. Along with China, Mongolia routinely abstains from United Nations resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in a sign that Mongolia remains committed to its third neighbor policy, it has also been careful not to violate the sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and its allies. While Mongolia recognizes the importance of Putin’s visit to maintain good ties and the flow of fuel to the country, it will also be concerned with how the visit and its anticipated non-enforcement of ICC sanctions will hurt the country’s standing with global institutions and powers outside the region. In a shifting world order, Mongolia is working hard to maintain independence by emphasizing its role as a neutral state and friend to all. But visits such as Putin’s show how difficult that endeavor can be.","summary":"Mongolia has worked hard to craft friendly relations across the globe.

I voted Democrat in the past,” he told The Epoch Times. This year, however, he leans toward former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee—a notable shift from 2020 when he wrote in Tulsi Gabbard, former Democrat congresswoman, as his preferred candidate. Yet Domanick remains cautious. Before casting his vote this year, he wants to hear Trump’s plan for tackling inflation, which he believes is a key issue for many Americans. Neither candidate, according to him, has provided a concrete plan on how they will achieve their campaign promises. “They say what they’re going to do. They don’t say how they’re going to do it,” he said. “I think the No. 1 thing I would need to hear from Trump is gas prices. That’s where we got to start.” “Drill, baby, drill,” Domanick said, referencing a 2008 Republican campaign slogan frequently echoed by Trump in recent years. Lower gas prices, according to the math teacher, would lower transportation costs and, ultimately, reduce prices on store shelves. Domanick worries that the country is headed in the wrong direction, especially when he thinks about the future of his two high school-aged daughters. “Just think about college education. What I’m going to have to pay for them is going to be six figures in some cases, if I want them to go to a decent school,” he said. “I’m a math teacher, so I know all about compound interest,” he said, noting his concern about predatory student loans. He is not opposed to student loan forgiveness. However, he believes the government shouldn’t be selective in forgiving student debt based on political motivations. There needs to be a stronger and fair plan for families burdened by large school loans, he said. His 77-year-old mother, Linda Domanick, supports Trump and believes that the current state of the economy and her strong support for Israel are key factors influencing her decision to vote for the former president. “There’s so much wrong going on,” she said. “As a senior citizen living on disability, it’s becoming next to impossible to live. I’m going to put my house up for sale.” With just about 60 days remaining until the election, both the Trump and Harris campaigns are ramping up their outreach efforts to connect with voters in the Peach State. Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, took a two-day bus tour, visiting rural communities and suburbs in South Georgia to rally support in the state. Harris wrapped up her tour with a solo campaign speech in Savannah on Aug. 29, encouraging thousands of supporters to work hard until election day. A week earlier, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), held a rally in Valdosta, a town in southern Georgia located about 15 miles north of the Florida state line. “I left teaching because it just wasn’t working for me anymore,” she said. “I couldn’t sustain myself independently as a single woman, as a public-school educator.” Gibbons wishes to hear more about Harris’s stance on education policy. Gibbons believes current trends are putting educators in the crossfire between policymakers and parents. “I’ve had parents ask me to make sure their child is using the bathroom correctly. That’s not my job. That’s not what I do. That’s not what I had signed up for,” she said, referring to parents’ concerns about gender identity issues and policies in schools. She said that teachers are expected to take on many roles in the classroom, including acting as mediators between parents and children, as well as serving as mentors, psychologists, and counselors to their students and parents. “You have to work overtime because you’re with the students for 90 percent of the workday,” she said, noting that teachers also need time to plan lessons. Gibbons said she didn’t feel safe as an educator because of shooting incidents in schools around the country. “We would have to have intruder drills where all the children hide in the corner of the room with the lights off. And how do you explain that to a 6-year-old?” she said. Autumn Boyd, an 18-year-old student from Valdosta, is one of them, but she will not cast a vote in the upcoming election. Like many Gen-Zers, politics doesn’t interest her. “I don’t pay attention. I prefer not to because I don’t want to get wrapped up,” she said. Boyd is also worried about being bullied for her voting choice. She says that if she votes for one candidate, she‘ll face criticism; if she votes for the other, she’ll face the same. “I just rather not vote,” she said. She believes there is a huge political divide in the country and dislikes the misinformation spread by both campaigns. If Boyd ultimately decides to cast her ballot on Nov. 5, she said she would “probably vote for Trump” because she knows “more about him” than Harris. “Whoever wins, I just hope that we don’t get killed. That’s my biggest fear,” she said. “I don’t want war with another country.” Other eligible Gen Z voters are not enthusiastic about voting. Gallagher, who voted Democrat in 2016 and 2020, is currently leaning toward Harris but says he knows little about her work as vice president. He believes the more she can get out and interact with voters, the better. He notes that neither Harris nor Trump’s campaigns are active in his area. However, he sees negative ads every time he opens YouTube. “There are always those negative ad campaigns. That’s all you ever see,” Gallagher said. Robert Whalen, a 71-year-old retiree from Ludowici, Georgia, is concerned about taxes if Harris wins. “If she wins, we’re done,” he said. “Our taxes are going to go up again.” Whalen, a lifelong Republican, said he will vote for Trump in 2024, as he has in previous years. His main concerns are inflation, wars, and border security. He believes that Harris has not effectively addressed any of these issues during her tenure as vice president, whereas he is confident that Trump would tackle them from day one. Rising living costs are a particular worry for Whalen and his wife, Loisann Morey. The couple feels that Trump should prioritize the inflation problem, urging him first to bring down the gas prices. “I know he will,” Whalen said. “The nice thing about Kamala is that she knows how to communicate on everyone’s level. You know, she doesn’t talk down to people,” Mies said. She believes the United States is ready for a woman president. “It’s time. We need that change.” While she acknowledges the importance of the economy, Mies emphasizes that women’s rights, health care, and what she calls the imbalance in the Supreme Court are equally critical issues. Amber Ealy, 44, another rallygoer, shares the sentiment. She believes the right to abortion is the most critical issue. “I have a 4-year-old daughter, and it is absolutely ridiculous that she has fewer rights than I do,” she said, referencing the 2022 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision. Ealy anticipates the Harris campaign becoming much more active in Georgia. She notes that Chatham County, where Savannah is located, has traditionally been a Democrat stronghold. She hopes to see a shift from red to blue in neighboring counties across South Georgia. “Georgia will be blue,” she said.","summary":"With about 60 days remaining until the election, Trump and Harris are ramping up their efforts to connect with voters in the key swing state.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/in-battleground-georgia-voters-demand-solutions-to-inflation-key-issues-5716992","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/28/id5714557-08282024-DSC07073-Jon-Domanick-Linda-Domanick-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:34:04","author":"Emel Akan","authors":["Emel Akan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022}]}
