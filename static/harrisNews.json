I think that is more important right now,” Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair of the DSA’s city branch, told CNN.\n\nOther congressional Democrats in the city that could be targets for primaries from far-left challengers include Reps. Jerry Nadler and Yvette Clarke, the network reported. \n\nBut Jeffries’ team was ready to dig in.\n\n“Leader Hakeem Jeffries is focused on taking back the House from the MAGA extremists who just ripped health care away from millions of Americans,” Jeffries senior adviser André Richardson told CNN.\n\n“However, if Team Gentrification wants a primary fight, our response will be forceful and unrelenting. We will teach them and all of their incumbents a painful lesson on June 23, 2026,” he warned.\n\nThe beef is unfolding as pressure builds on state and local Democrats in the city to back Mamdani in the general election over fears they could face primaries if they don’t join the coalition. Mamdani will face Republican Curtis Sliwa in November, but former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams will appear on minor party lines on the ballot.\n\nCuomo lost the primary to Mamdani, while Adams dropped out of the race with his sights set on an independent run.\n\nBrooklyn state Assemblywoman Phara Souffrant Forrest, a DSA member whose district overlaps with Jeffries’ congressional district, warned Jeffries to be careful what he wished for.\n\n“Weird threat to make since Hakeem already went after @JabariBrisport [DSA state senator]and I.How’d that go for him, again?,” Forrest said in a statement on X Thursday.\n\n“2022 Primary Results:SD 22 Jabari Brisport: 70.4%. AD 57 Phara Souffrant Forrest: 67.2% If the leader wants another public beatdown, he knows where to find me,” Forrest said.\n\nForrest later toned down her criticism of Jeffries in a statement to The Post, but did not offer any bouquets, either.\n\n“There are no plans that I am aware of to primary Leader Jeffries. Our districts overlap and there is plenty of opportunity for collaboration on issues of shared importance,” Forrest said.\n\nJasmine Gripper, the co-chair of the local Working Families Party which supported Mamdani in the primary, also warned some House members they could face a fight.\n\n“If you are a mismatch, that does make you vulnerable to someone saying, ‘Maybe I’m a better match,’” she told CNN.\n\nBut Bronx Rep. Ritchie Torres, who endorsed Andrew Cuomo for mayor and could face a primary challenge next year, defended Jeffries and said any DSA challenge to the man who could be the first black Speaker of the House only benefits Donald Trump.\n\n“If you side against Jeffries,” Torres told The Post, “you’re doing the bidding of Donald Trump. You’re siding against the black political establishment in the US.”\n\nTorres accused DSA members of a “double standard” by not backing Kamala Harris for president while pressuring city Democrats to immediately endorse Mamdani for mayor. \n\nRobert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member from New York and a close ally of Jeffries, also slammed the DSA for picking a fight instead of helping Democrats win the House majority.\n\n“The choice is clear: Hakeem Jeffries as House Speaker or Donald Trump continuing to rule without any checks or balances on his power,” Zimmerman told The Post.\n\n“The DSA is being dangerously counterproductive and hypocritical,” he said.\n\nSome lefty activists said one House member who could face a real primary challenge is Rep. Dan Goldman, who represents lower Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn.\n\n“If Brad Lander ran against Goldman, we’d support him in a minute,” Arthur Schwartz, political director of the NY Progressive Action Network said, referring to the city comptroller, who lost in the primary for mayor but cross-endorsed Mamdani.\n\nThe tiff comes as Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, is trying to rally people around his candidacy who did not support him in the primary — particularly black and Jewish elected officials and their constituents. He and his campaign are conducting outreach campaigns with lawmakers and Democratic leaders to expand and consolidate his support heading into the general election.","summary":"A rift erupted between Zohran Mamdani's leftist Democratic Socialist allies and House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, with threats of running primaries against each other.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/10/us-news/hakeem-jeffries-team-blasts-zohran-mamdanis-liberal-team-gentrification-as-primary-threats-spark-nyc-dem-feud/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-ygw002o36-1752190477187.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752176100&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZPV40z8O-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-10 23:49:13","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":340397544,"title":"Trump to Assess Flood Damage While Highlighting Strong Connection to Republican Texas","text":"President Trump is flaunting his bond with deep-red Texas ahead of a Friday trip to the state, where he will assess deadly flooding that took the lives of more than 120 people.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R) has heaped praise on the administration this week for the federal response to the disaster, even as the Trump administration has made cuts to the nation’s climate and weather agencies and officials continue to push axing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThe camaraderie stands in stark contrast to the the California wildfires in January, during which Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) played a blame game for weeks over water access, the loss of thousands of structures and a dozen deaths.\n\nCritics argue that Trump’s handling of both deadly disasters showcases how he tends to politicize such events.\n\nJeremy Edwards, a former Biden White House and FEMA spokesperson, said he suspects if the Texas flooding had occurred in a state run by a Democrat, Trump’s sentiments would be very different.\n\n“I find it very hard to imagine that if this exact situation were to happen in a blue state with a Democratic governor, he would not immediately lambast them for steps that they did or didn’t take with regards to emergency alerts,” Edwards said\n\nOther critics noted how Trump’s predecessors went to great lengths to support communities, no matter how they tended to lean politically. \n\n“What I’d seen during the Obama administration and the Biden administration is presidents working with governors, regardless of party, to support the impacted community, whether it was in Florida with Biden and Gov. [Ron] DeSantis working side by side following the Surfside building collapse, Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Milton … putting politics aside,” said Michael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff in the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\n“Until this administration, I really haven’t seen emergency management being politicized the way it is,” Coen added.\n\nAbbott is expected to join Trump in Texas, where he will meet with first responders, receive a briefing from local elected officials and meet with family members of those affected, according to a White House official.\n\nFor his part, Newsom also greeted Trump on the tarmac in California when he visited the state shortly after he retook office, but before the trip, the president threatened to withhold federal wildfire aid because of concerns about the state’s water management.\n\nIn Texas, some other particulars are at play.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service (NWS), cut hundreds of staffers during a government overhaul earlier this year.\n\nAnd the warning coordination meteorologist for the NWS’s Austin-San Antonio office, who organizes the deployment of alerts about agency forecasts, took a Trump administration buyout in April.\n\nThat has put in the spotlight some of the cuts the Trump administration has implemented, and continues to threaten.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who is also expected to join Trump on the ground in Texas, this week said FEMA should be “remade” even as the agency responded to the floods and both Noem and Trump have insisted such disaster response should be managed by states.\n\n“We as a federal government don’t manage these disasters. The state does. We come in and support them, and that’s exactly what we did here in this situation,” she said.\n\nFEMA has especially been in the GOP’s crosshairs since Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina last year, a state Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris had been vying for during the 2024 election. \n\nThe North Carolina disaster was plagued by rumors that FEMA was avoiding red-leaning areas and not helping Republican households, at times hampering the response under former President Biden.\n\nA former Bush administration Homeland Security official said Trump’s response to the Texas floods comes amid a cascade of changes in federal government operations this year.\n\n“Disaster politics are always tricky, but this tragedy is amid the backdrop of DOGE and the administration’s broader efforts to reduce the federal role in disaster response,” the former Bush official said, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n“The president and the governor get along well and are very simpatico on immigration, but these situations normally receive a level of empathy that this president does not like to display,” the former official added.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to think so. He has praised his alliance with Abbott, citing it as a factor in the unified response to the floods at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.\n\n“The relationship with Texas and the governor has been obviously very good for years, with me,” Trump said. “The response has been incredible, and the fact that we got along so well, I don’t even think that’s a political thing, but we got along so well, and it was so unified. I think a lot of lives have been saved.”\n\nBut, if the administration faces negative reviews over the response in Texas, some critics are bracing for a similar blame game Trump has leaned on in the past.\n\n“I think this is going to be the same thing he does with the economy. When the economy is bad, it’s Biden’s economy. When the economy is good, it’s Trump’s economy,” said Edwards, a senior communications adviser at the Century Foundation. “And I think, if the response and recovery goes well and I hope it does it’s Trump’s FEMA, but if the response goes badly, it’s Biden’s FEMA.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Trump is flaunting his bond with deep-red Texas ahead of a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump to Assess Flood Damage While Highlighting Strong Connection to Republican Texas first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-to-assess-flood-damage-while-highlighting-strong-connection-to-republican-texas/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-Trump-to-survey-floods-as-he-flaunts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 22:21:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":340398062,"title":"Fresh proof America dodged a Kamala bullet despite her kid gloves treatment from the media","text":"In one more telling lowlight of the 2024 campaign, even a TikTok star felt obliged to protect Kamala Harris from . . .

Experts said the lawsuit had little grounds and what CBS did was routine journalistic practice. \n\nThe situation is “something I’m very concerned about,” Anna Gomez said at a panel discussion at the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which is meeting in Chicago this week. “I believe that the public interest requires us to look at how CBS acted in this case.”\n\nCritics have charged that CBS settled the suit to clear the way for governmental approval of a proposed merger of its parent company, Paramount, and Skydance Media. \n\nGomez, who was appointed to the FCC by former President Joe Biden, criticized CBS for its decision to settle, which she called “a private lawsuit against ’60 Minutes’ for reporting the news the way it should, for its editorial decisions.”\n\nTop officials with the news network left during settlement talks. Gomez charged that “CBS has now tempered how it reports the news. It pushed out the executive producer of ’60 Minutes,’ it pushed out the president of CBS News entirely to appease this president in a desperate attempt to get approval of this $8 billion to $9 billion merger by the FCC.\n\n“That is completely contrary — it is chilling and it is a very scary moment for our freedoms.” \n\nWhile CBS agreed to pay $16 million toward Trump’s future presidential library and legal fees, the network noted that it did not apologize for its actions. A CBS spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nAt the forum, Gomez also expressed concern over efforts to lift FCC restrictions on local media ownership that she says ensure viewpoint diversity, competition and “localism.”\n\n“My concern is with the owners looking to lift ownership caps on local broadcasters. This is done under the guise of promoting local journalism. I think it’s the opposite of that. I think it’s being done for the benefit of billionaire companies,” she said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2025/07/10/60-minutes-donald-trump-settlement-federal-communications-commission-fcc-anna-gomez","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/77416ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Ffd%2F488800ec4eed8666ca9ec3fd7643%2Fnahj","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 21:46:18","author":"Sun-Times staff","authors":["Sun-Times staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":340383922,"title":"Sarah Jessica Parker reveals why she won’t talk politics","text":"Sarah Jessica Parker has revealed why she rarely talks politics on social media – pointing out that elections were won and lost for centuries before the internet age.\n\nDuring an appearance on Nicolle Wallace’s The Best People podcast, Parker said she avoids having “complicated conversations” online.\n\n“I often don’t talk on social media because I don’t think it’s a place that’s deserving of any real complicated conversation.\n\n“I’m not interested in quick little snippets when it’s dealing with conflict or even elections sometimes,” she said.\n\nReferring to the presidential election, in which she endorsed Kamala Harris on Instagram, she added: “I really was so thoughtful about how I wanted to talk about the election because I think it turns into a distraction from a campaign.\n\n“It turns into fodder.

Billy Graham. We did this believing that our use of the clips of Rev. Graham, although not done with the prior permission of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), would meet the criteria for Fair Use under the US Copyright Act,\" the group wrote. The BGEA objected to the ads, claiming the group had infringed on its copyright by using video clips of Graham for political purposes without consent. REV.

Graham would have taken a side in publicly supporting one political candidate over another in an election, so we apologize to BGEA,\" Evangelicals for Harris said. The controversy started after the group released a series of attack ads against Trump that used footage of the late evangelist. One ad juxtaposed Graham's preaching about confession with a 2015 interview in which Trump said he wasn’t sure whether he had ever asked God for forgiveness. Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham and president of Samaritan’s Purse and the BGEA, publicly criticized the efforts at the time. ‘EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS’ COURTS ‘POLITICALLY HOMELESS’ CHRISTIANS TO BACK DEMOCRAT IN NOVEMBER \"The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris.

Maybe they don’t know that my father appreciated the conservative values and policies of President @realDonaldTrump in 2016, and if he were alive today, my father’s views and opinions would not have changed.\" In October, the group publicly vowed to fight legal threats from the BGEA. Months later, they retreated from this position, removing the ads and agreeing not to use any more clips of Graham or his organization without explicit permission. \"Our hope is that these actions and our commitment not to use Rev. Billy Graham within a partisan electoral context will clarify confusion over the message in our original ads; affirm the value and importance of Christian dialogue about the way we engage in politics, and prioritizes Christians remaining in communion despite differences,\" their Tuesday statement continued.

And to succeed, we need to be united as a team with a strong belief and passion in where we are heading.”\n\n“I understand and respect, however, that our chosen path is not for everyone,” he continued. “That’s exactly why we introduced the voluntary separation program. As we continue in this new direction, I want to ask those who do not feel aligned with the company’s plan to reflect on that.

If you believe in our next chapter, I’m excited for the work ahead of us,” Lewis concluded the memo. \n\nA spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment.\n\nLewis’ memo came less than two months after the paper launched its latest buyout program specifically targeting veteran staffers that would conclude at the end of July. \n\nAccording to a VSP document previously viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years. \n\nAll of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA). \n\nThe Post has suffered a dramatic decline in subscriptions, which was further fueled by multiple boycott campaigns against the “Democracy Dies in Darkness” paper over decisions made by its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. \n\nThe first was in October when Bezos halted the paper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election. \n\nThe second was in February when Bezos announced his directive for the Post’s editorial pages to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nBoth instances sparked a mass exodus of paid subscribers and several resignations, including opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos’ new policy. \n\nLast month, the Post tapped Adam O’Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, to lead the opinion pages.","summary":"Washington Post publisher and CEO Will Lewis is urging staffers who don't \"feel aligned\" with the paper's new direction to take a buyout and leave. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/10/media/washington-post-ceo-urges-staffers-who-dont-feel-aligned-with-paper-to-leave/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-ef18xle3o-1752175097171.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752160732&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 19:28:55","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.188},{"id":340366384,"title":"Longtime WaPo columnist quit after editors spiked column for being ‘too opinionated’","text":"Joe Davidson, the famed writer who had helmed The Washington Post's Federal Insider column for the past 17 years, revealed this week that he quit the paper in protest after one of his pieces was spiked for being “too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy.”\n\nIn a lengthy Facebook post, Davidson also took numerous swipes at Jeff Bezos, the mega-billionaire owner of the Post who has openly cozied up to Donald Trump amid the president’s return to power. This has included nixing the editorial board’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris last election and revamping the opinion section to focus on the traditionally conservative values of personal liberties and free markets.\n\nAccording to Davidson, who joined the Post in 2005 and began writing Federal Insider (then Federal Diary) in 2008, his job was no longer worth keeping when a column he submitted earlier this year was rejected because it was too harsh towards the president’s administration.\n\n“For me, the cost became too great when a Federal Insider column I wrote was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously,” he stated Tuesday. “My resignation, after 20 years with The Post, took effect this month.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to The Washington Post for comment.\n\nLate last month, Davidson wrote a “farewell” column acknowledging that he was leaving the paper “because of a policy restricting the level of opinion and commentary in news section articles.” While agreeing that “the policy can be justified journalistically,” he added that its “rigorous enforcement represents a significant reduction in the latitude I’ve enjoyed” since he took over Federal Insider.\n\n“Some readers who commented on my final column skewered Post owner Jeff Bezos,” Davidson pointed out in his Facebook post. “I have no reason to believe he was directly involved in my situation, but it would be naïve to ignore the context.”\n\nClaiming that the Amazon founder’s “policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant,” Davidson said that the “shocking” result of Bezos’ efforts to reshape the Post in recent months has led to “fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions.” \n\nIndeed, since Bezos blocked the Harris endorsement in October, the newspaper has experienced an exodus of talent across its newsroom, which has only intensified after Bezos announced the new opinion mandate in February, leading to the resignation of the section’s editor.

This has included nixing the editorial board’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris last election and revamping the opinion section to focus on the traditionally conservative values of personal liberties and free markets.\n\nAccording to Davidson, who joined the Post in 2005 and began writing Federal Insider (then Federal Diary) in 2008, his job was no longer worth keeping when a column he submitted earlier this year was rejected because it was too harsh towards the president’s administration.\n\n“For me, the cost became too great when a Federal Insider column I wrote was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously,” he stated Tuesday. “My resignation, after 20 years with The Post, took effect this month.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to The Washington Post for comment.\n\nLate last month, Davidson wrote a “farewell” column acknowledging that he was leaving the paper “because of a policy restricting the level of opinion and commentary in news section articles.” While agreeing that “the policy can be justified journalistically,” he added that its “rigorous enforcement represents a significant reduction in the latitude I’ve enjoyed” since he took over Federal Insider.\n\n“Some readers who commented on my final column skewered Post owner Jeff Bezos,” Davidson pointed out in his Facebook post. “I have no reason to believe he was directly involved in my situation, but it would be naïve to ignore the context.”\n\nClaiming that the Amazon founder’s “policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant,” Davidson said that the “shocking” result of Bezos’ efforts to reshape the Post in recent months has led to “fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions.”\n\nIndeed, since Bezos blocked the Harris endorsement in October, the newspaper has experienced an exodus of talent across its newsroom, which has only intensified after Bezos announced the new opinion mandate in February, leading to the resignation of the section’s editor.

Spine experts say that even small habits can hurt your spine in the long run if you don't pay attention to them. This is what you might be doing wrong.Small, unnoticed habits are often the first signs of back pain. Things you do every day, like slouching at your desk, lifting things the wrong way, or carrying heavy bags the wrong way, can hurt your spine. When should you take back pain seriously?Nicholas Clark, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery at Naples Comprehensive Health, which opened last month in Naples, Florida, told The Post, \"We are seeing a lot of patients present with pain after/during activities because of common spinal mistakes.\"He continued by saying that \"significant issues can arise over time, even though these issues may seem harmless.\" Before they break you, Clark outlines six surprisingly subtle habits to break.Live EventsOrthopedic experts say that if you don't treat them, they can cause chronic pain, disc problems, and even damage to the spine that lasts a long time.ALSO READ: Kamala Harris’ California governor bid sparks donor revolt: ‘Not backing her this time’ Here are six things you might do that could hurt your spine, along with detailed explanations of what they do, as per a report by The NY Post.1. Bad Lifting Techniques: If you lift things the wrong way, like bending at the waist instead of squatting, you can hurt your lower back and get serious injuries like disc herniations. If you lift kids wrong too often, this risk also applies to you. Bad lifting techniques can damage the structures of the spine, which can cause serious injuries that may need surgery to fix.2. Not Working on Core Strength: Weak core muscles don't do a good job of stabilizing the spine, which puts more strain on discs and ligaments when you move. Core strength is important for everyday tasks, and not working on it can cause back pain. Many people don't do exercises like crunches and planks that are important for the health of their spine because they only think of core workouts as a way to look good instead of as a way to improve functional stability.3. Ignoring Minor Discomfort: Don't ignore mild back pain or stiffness; it could be a sign of early problems like muscle strain or disc stress. Letting these symptoms go on can make things worse, like herniated discs or long-term arthritis. Getting medical help early can stop small problems from getting worse and causing big problems or permanent damage.4. Slouching While Sitting: A lot of people don't even know they're slouching when they sit for a long time at a desk or use a device. This position puts more stress on the discs in the spine and the muscles that support them, which could cause problems like forward head posture, kyphosis, or herniated discs. Bad posture can make your muscles weaker, which can make you more likely to get hurt when you move quickly.5. Too Much Device Use: Looking down at phones and tablets too much can cause \"tech neck,\" which makes the neck muscles work harder to hold up the head. This can cause long-term problems with spinal alignment, chronic back pain, and cervical disc degeneration. Over time, this stress can make the muscles in your neck and back weaker, which raises the risk of herniated discs and the pain that comes with them.6. Carrying Heavy Things Wrong: A lot of people don't think about how they are standing when they carry heavy things like bags or laptops. Carrying something on one shoulder makes the load uneven, which can cause muscle imbalances and possibly long-term pain or problems with the spine curving. Even small bags can hurt you over time, especially kids and people who ride the bus. People can better protect their spinal health and avoid long-term problems by recognizing and changing these habits.FAQsWhat simple habits are damaging your spine?Poor posture, carrying heavy bags, and ignoring early discomfort are just a few minor habits that can lead to serious back problems.Is occasional back pain a warning sign?Yes, mild aches can indicate underlying issues.

CBS and parent company Paramount agreed to settle Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit last week, setting the stage for a long-planned merger of Paramount and Skydance to become official once the FCC approves the deal. But Trump critics have blasted the settlement and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., sent a letter addressing concerns on Thursday to FCC Commissioner Olivia Trusty, who was nominated earlier this year by Trump. \"We write today regarding the proposed merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media now pending before the FCC. Paramount’s recent agreement to settle for $16 million a frivolous lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump against CBS — a Paramount subsidiary — over its editorial decision-making raises serious questions about Paramount’s rationale for the settlement and its implications for media independence,\" Markey and Lujan wrote. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP \"For that reason, we urge you to insist that the FCC conduct its merger review with the utmost transparency, including holding a full Commission vote on any order to approve the merger,\" they continued. \"The Paramount-Skydance merger is unique in the FCC’s storied history, with the sitting President actively litigating against a news organization whose parent is seeking FCC approval of a major media merger.\" Trump was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference through unethical editing to make her appear more articulate leading up to the 2024 contest. The Democratic lawmakers blasted the lawsuit as \"baseless,\" but said \"Paramount has nevertheless agreed to settle that lawsuit for $16 million.\" Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reportedly pushed for the settlement in hopes of paving the way for Trump’s FCC to approve the lucrative merger. LONGTIME '60 MINUTES' CORRESPONDENT STEVE KROFT, JON STEWART BASH CBS’ TRUMP SETTLEMENT AS ‘SHAKEDOWN’ \"This settlement casts a shadow over the proposed Paramount-Skydance merger and raises serious questions about the editorial independence of one of the nation’s largest media organizations. The Commission cannot turn a blind eye to this context,\" Markey and Lujan wrote. \"For that reason, in our May letter, we urged Chairman Carr to hold a vote on the merger by the full Commission, instead of unilaterally directing the Media Bureau to approve it on its delegated authority,\" they added. \"The FCC owes the public a transparent, deliberative process on such a high-profile and controversial issue,\" they added.

Paramount has defended the settlement. \"Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction,\" a Paramount spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

And with good reason: After decades of deception and distortion—considering its uncritical coverage of the wars in the Middle East, its peddling of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative, its inconsistent reporting on COVID-19, its selective ignorance during the 2020 election, and its efforts to conceal President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline—the corporate press has earned every ounce of the public’s suspicion.\n\nNow, Americans are tuning out the noise and tuning in to new voices to stay informed. UnHerd Washington Correspondent Emily Jashinsky has emerged as one of those voices. She joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss her new show with Megyn Kelly’s MK Media, “After Party with Emily Jashinsky,” the fallout from President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” and whether or not Zohran Mamdani represents the future of the national Democratic Party.\n\n“I’m very weirdly optimistic,” Jashinsky said of the alternative media’s rise. “I feel so strange about this because one of the reasons I got into media is because I’ve always been obsessed with media and I’ve always been so pessimistic. But the last, I don’t know, year or two, I’ve started to feel optimistic about media, not because there aren’t still very powerful bad actors, not because some of the new actors aren’t also bad, but because the demand for transparency from the audience, I think, is pushing us in at least a better direction.”\n\nJashinsky told The Daily Signal that the age of new media will be dominated by journalists who are able to “establish trust with [their] audience and to best establish transparency.” Jashinsky cited how “60 Minutes” selectively edited the interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee. “People were demanding the transcript, and I think that’s the way people like us, our age and younger, want to consume news.”\n\n“They really don’t want it to look or feel edited,” Jashinsky added. “There’s probably always going to be some editing, but they want stuff that’s live. We want stuff that’s transparent.”\n\nThe same can be said of alternative media’s class of commentators like Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson. “I think we’re in the golden age of reported commentary,” Jashinsky said. On digital shows and podcasts, “you’re able to do reported commentary on the fly in a way that, I think, is even more authentic and in a way that really resonates.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s ability to tap into the independent media ecosystem and the public’s craving for authenticity helped build a political coalition that propelled him back to the White House. \n\nThe breadth of that coalition, however, is both a blessing and a curse as the variety of interests within Trump’s camp compete for the president’s ear as he tries to act on his campaign promises. On July 4, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the massive budget reconciliation package that delivered on many of those promises, into law. \n\n”When you have very narrow margins in the House and a very narrow margin in the Senate, you end up absolutely having to keep a coalition together that includes [Rep.] Chip Roy and either [Sen.] Lisa Murkowski or [Sen.] Susan Collins,” Jashinsky said. That is no easy task. “What they need to do is get Chip Roy to a place where he is sufficiently satisfied, and they need to get Lisa Murkowski to a place where she’s sufficiently satisfied,” she explained. “In order to do that, both of those things are necessarily going to mean swallowing a very bitter pill, and it was always going to be the case.\n\n“I think that’s why Trump started, from the very beginning of the process, by branding this as the one big beautiful bill because he knew that tax cuts expire at the end of the year,” the journalist added. “Republicans were facing the choice of either do a ugly reconciliation bill or let taxes go up. Obviously, they’re going to decide with an ugly reconciliation bill.”\n\n“That’s something I think Elon Musk missed,” Jashinsky said of the feud between Trump and Musk that started during the budget reconciliation negotiations. “I think Elon Musk has been shockingly naive throughout this process, and I do really think that it’s naive thinking that you can just kind of come into Washington and convince the Republican Party that has these narrow margins that they have to do some type of generational action to take on government spending when the only way to pass legislation and get it to the president’s desk is, again, to please either a Murkowski or Collins and the moderates while also pleasing the Chip Roys and the Freedom Caucus guys.”\n\n“It was never gonna happen,” Jashinksy said.\n\nNevertheless, Trump was able to accomplish much more of his agenda in this budget reconciliation package than budget reconciliation packages from his first term. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act not only extended and made permanent tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act but also procured billions to secure the border, deport millions of illegal migrants, and revitalize the military.\n\nSome Democrats, however, are plotting the party’s comeback—New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani among them. Mamdani is officially infamous, constantly drawing ire from the long-time New Yorker who now lives in D.C. at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and courting support from some of the nation’s top Democrats. Will Democrats remake the party in Mamdani’s image?\n\nPotentially, Jashinsky said, but Mamdani’s coalition in New York might be much more fragile than it seems, and his victory in the Democrat primary for mayor might have more to do with New Yorkers’ hatred for his opponent, disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. To maintain his coalition, Mamdani needs to thread the needle.\n\n“You have to bring the progressives in with the cultural libertarians, and then you need to bring them in with the … upwardly mobile, affluent, educated, higher income people,” Jashinsky explained. The catch? To earn the support of New York’s cocktail party class, “you do have to do some of the cultural signaling, which is very interesting. And that’s what puts off the [cultural libertarians].”\n\n“I think the likeliest case scenario is that Mamdani has a somewhat embarrassing defeat at the hands of Eric Adams, another terrible candidate, and that sort of chills the fever for him nationwide, but who knows,” Jashinsky told The Daily Signal. Certainly, stranger things have happened.","summary":"Americans’ trust in the corporate media has cratered.

That’s what real clowns have to offer. If you’re still stuck on the broken comparison ingrained in our national dialogue, here’s an alternative: Try ‘buffoon.’”\n\nOkay, fine. The Washington Post is full of buffoons, and all the people who thought Bezos’s decision to forbid the paper from endorsing Kamala Harris was evidence that Bezos would turn the paper into a Trump-friendly publication are also buffoons.","summary":"Democracy dies in darkness… or clown noises; The Washington Post isn’t quite sure which.

In response to a “Politics War Room” listener’s question asking why Democrats are “fighting so hard for DEI,” Carville asserted the premise of the question was wrong, claiming it is now a universal belief that DEI is disastrous — before clarifying his criticism was broader than just DEI. (RELATED: Another Major Corporation Bends The Knee To Trump)\n\n“They don’t [fight for DEI]. And everybody is trying to get away from it. I read a story, [Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] AOC has scrubbed her site of pronouns,” Carville said. “Everybody knows this has been a big, giant, massive disaster. So there are two kinds of people in this debate. There are people like me that said, ‘This is a disaster and we’re still trying to wash the stench of this shit off. Every year that goes by, we get a little bit of a less stench. It was really stupid.'”\n\n“Then you have people say, ‘Well, it probably wasn’t that great an idea, but no one talks about it, so it didn’t hurt us in the election.’ Bullshit, it hurt us in the election,” he continued. “The whole thing hurt us. It hurt the image of the party. No one that I know of is really promoting this crap anymore. Maybe it’s some couple of museums and foundations. That’s about all that’s left for this nonsense.”\n\nCarville then said he felt compelled to clarify that his tirade was also focused on identity politics generally rather than solely DEI.\n\n“I need to clean something up here. When I was going on this rant about DEI, what was really at the core of it was the whole identity politics movement, of which clearly DEI was a part of,” he said. “But do I think that diversity should be a part of everything? I obviously do.”\n\n“The DEI was conflating that with a lot of the identity movement … you had these people coming up saying how not to be this and they were shaking companies down. They were doing seminars on how to not be a racist and stuff,” he added. “And people resented it. And I can understand that. No one wants to sit on a Saturday morning being mandated to be told that you’re some kind of awful human being. That part was definitely a racket. But I generally want to be clear — I’m generally supportive of any effort to bring more diversity to the organization.”\n\nSince President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, businesses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Target, Walmart, Boeing, Verizon and T-Mobile have begun to eliminate or scale back their DEI programs.\n\nPortraying former Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party as too far left on transgender issues was one of the most potent advertising campaigns in boosting support for Trump and Republican candidates down the ballot during the 2024 election, according to multiple reports. Two ads in particular featured the line, “Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you.”\n\nTrump’s second term has included endeavors to cut DEI out of the workforce and schools through executive orders, such as an one mandating the Labor Department eliminate affirmative action terms from federal contracts.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania also agreed with the Trump administration on July 1 to strip transgender swimmer Lia Thomas of previous records and titles while competing in women’s swimming.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Santoshi worried that the tween viewed Tate — an influencer accused of sexual assault and trafficking — as a joke to spring on strangers.\n\n“This kid was engaging with content that promotes blatant misogyny, and he didn’t even realize how harmful it was,” said Santoshi, now 18 and the national political director of Feminist Generation, a youth-led organization that opposes authoritarianism. The encounter was a chilling sign of how deeply the “manosphere” — a network of online influencers promoting male supremacy and far-right ideologies — had infiltrated popular culture.\n\nRelated | Why men are a problem for Democrats—and what we can do about it\n\nThe manosphere and parallel trends like the tradwife (traditional wife) movement — led by influencers who idealize marriage, motherhood and domesticity — are impacting even socially conscious students who say it’s hard to avoid this content brimming with toxic messages about gender. Over a half-dozen students told The 19th that after the 2024 election, which saw the manosphere blamed for young men’s rightward shift, they noticed changes in their classmates’ behavior — an uptick in sexist remarks, a sense of entitlement to girls’ attention and schadenfreude that yet another woman lost the presidency.\n\nNow, educators, parents and advocates are racing to counter the manosphere’s influence by addressing online gender dynamics with students — while youth themselves are pushing back through activism, their studies and debates with their peers.\n\nSantoshi’s introduction to the manosphere came via YouTube. Fifty-two percent of young men ages 18 to 23 are on that platform, according to 2023 report “The State of American Men” by the nonprofit Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice. In eighth grade, Santoshi discovered YouTube’s Jubilee channel, which presents discussions between people with opposing political views.\n\n“One of the topics was men’s rights activists versus feminists, and one person on the men’s rights activist side was a self-proclaimed incel,” Santoshi said, referring to the term used by men who resent being “involuntarily celibate” — many of whom have connected with likeminded individuals on platforms like Reddit. “He was saying all these objectively horrendous, terrible things about women, very infantilizing, very paternalistic.”\n\nThe manosphere — which dates back to the Y2K era, when anti-feminist men began to gather online — includes incels and men’s rights activists who feel disadvantaged by women’s social progress. Also involved are men going their own way (known by MGTOW), who have sworn off relationships with women; and pick-up artists who manipulate women into sex. The Equimundo report found that nearly half of young men trust at least one manosphere influencer. They have swallowed the “red pill” — a manosphere metaphor for embracing a reactionary and male supremacist worldview.\n\n“Similar to white supremacy, male supremacy can be an extremist ideology or movement in and of itself, but it’s also sort of embedded in American society,” said Rachael Fugardi, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, which tracks extremism.\n\nAn outgrowth of male supremacy, the manosphere’s dangers are too often downplayed, said Santoshi, who credited growing up in an egalitarian household with preventing influencers from enthralling him. Recently, his philosophy class at Stanford University discussed the toxic masculinity of Elliot Rodger, an incel who died by suicide after his 2014 rampage near the University of California, Santa Barbara, left six people dead and 14 injured.\n\n“People think it’s just these influencers who are trying to sell patriarchy to young men,” Santoshi said of the manosphere. “Elliot Rodger was a case study for what happens when male entitlement, white supremacy and these different entitlement ideologies combine and actually result in political violence.”\n\nThe gateway drug to the manosphere: algorithms\n\nThe vast majority of young men stumble onto the manosphere through innocent online queries, and algorithms set the trap, explained Geoff Corey, director of Advocates for Youth’s sex education project AMAZE.\n\n“They are looking to make friends, to look better, to win over girls or become better people,” Corey said. “Then, they discover that it seems like the only people creating content geared towards men are people who give them an easy answer for what they want, and that easy answer somehow leads to trickery, violence, unhealthy behaviors, bottling up emotions.”\n\nA teen might watch “gym-bro” motivational content or videos on “looksmaxxing” to enhance his appearance, only to be steered toward posts about the pitfalls of being a weak “beta male” instead of a dominant “alpha male.” Before long, the algorithm offers more of the same, ensnaring him in the manosphere’s quagmire. Social isolation makes youth more likely to get bogged down, according to Equimundo’s report. It found 65 percent of young men say no one knows them well.\n\nFugardi said that algorithms force-feed sexism to young people. “So much of this misogynistic content isn’t being searched out,” she said. Research from the United Kingdom revealed that 10 percent of boys ages 11 to 14 encountered harmful content, such as misogyny and violence, within 60 seconds of going online.\n\nMore than a particular political ideology, boys and young men are drawn to humor online, according to Corey. Comedic content creators may not peddle toxic rhetoric initially but simply behave in boneheaded ways that rack up page views. They go on to promote everything from extreme diets to polarizing politics.\n\nSam Dyer, a recent graduate of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, pointed to the viral fitness influencer Togi, a beefcake who recorded himself slapping a woman’s backside in one video and insulting WNBA fans in another. Dyer served as the fraternity caucus chair for It’s On Us, a nonprofit that fights campus sexual assault in stark contrast to the manosphere’s rape culture.\n\nTogi’s content, which routinely mentions steroids and betting, is largely humorous, Dyer said, but that doesn’t mean the influencer’s fans view him as a joke. “He just constantly records his lifestyle, which seems to be a lot of drugs and a lot of gambling and drinking and working out,” Dyer said. Given the Pew Research Center’s finding that 43 percent of teenage boys feel pressure to be physically strong, it’s no mystery why fitness influencers resonate with them.\n\nAs a fan of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which promotes mixed martial arts matches, Dyer is also familiar with Joe Rogan, a former commentator for the sport. Now host of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” the podcaster is linked to the manosphere because he leans into gender essentialism and conspiracy theories, a focus of the movement. Rogan welcomed Donald Trump to his show in October but reportedly refused to make arrangements for Kamala Harris to appear, going on to endorse Trump for president.\n\nRelated | Why is MAGA fighting about accused rapist Andrew Tate's US return?\n\nArguably no manosphere leader is as polarizing as Tate, whose prominence on social media has made him hard to ignore, Dyer said. More young men ages 18 to 23 (20 percent) trust Tate than rival manosphere figures like Rogan and Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist, according to the Equimundo report. The often shirtless influencer’s misogynistic posts — referring to childfree women as “miserable stupid bitches” and suggesting that women must “take some degree of responsibility” to avert rape — have seen him banned on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. Still, his content has spread like butter, finding fans in young viewers like the president’s son Barron Trump.\n\nTate emerged as a manosphere leader, Dyer contends, because his social media posts appealed to broad audiences. “He would gamble, he did kickboxing, so there were a variety of ways that he could interact with various people’s internet feeds,” Dyer said. “That became a way for people to get exposed to his more radical ideologies, especially towards women.”\n\nPerformance art or propaganda: the impact of tradwives\n\nJust as young men wrestle with the manosphere, young women are confronted with male supremacy through the tradwife trend.\n\nTradwife influencers like Nara Smith, who films herself cooking in expertly applied makeup and flawlessly coiffed hair, insist they’re simply sharing their passion for homemaking. Many of Smith’s followers regard her content as performance art. Her meal-prep wardrobe features dreamy blues and cherry reds in sequins, chiffon and faux fur — all while she whips up snacks like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, bread included, entirely from scratch.\n\nTradwife critics, meanwhile, argue that influencers like Smith, Hannah Neeleman and Estee Williams are anti-feminist since marrying young and having gaggles of children appear to be prerequisites to the lifestyle.\n\n“Male supremacy appeals to women as well. And, of course, the white supremacist project demands the participation of White women in the production of White babies,” said Pasha Dashtgard, director of research at the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University. The tradwife movement “is for men,” he stressed. “It’s not for women. It’s cosplaying what men think would be the ideal woman.”\n\nRelated | Why conservatives are obsessed with phony masculinity\n\nTradwife and manosphere influencers communicate that marriage and children aren’t optional, according to their detractors and some of their impressionable teen viewers.\n\n“The manosphere — I think that is just such nonsense,” said Sreshta Erravelli, 17, who recently finished 11th grade in New Albany, Ohio. “I can speak for so many girls I’ve talked to that it is really promoting just the worst culture ever for so many guys. Then, when you couple that with the whole tradwives trend, it’s definitely hard to reconcile both things at the same time.”\n\nBoys learn to be rugged alpha males from the manosphere, while girls learn to cater to men from tradwives, Erravelli has observed. Rather than teach that rejection is a part of life, the manosphere links rejection to weakness, causing boys to lash out when girls don’t reciprocate their feelings, she said. “You’re calling girls weird names just because she didn’t give you her number the first 20 times you asked.”\n\nDuring the rollout to the 2024 election, the gender divide among Erravelli’s classmates became clear. Some of them argued that a woman shouldn’t be president, an attitude that reflects the manosphere’s chauvinism.\n\n“When it came down to kids who were in favor of Trump, I think that they were definitely a little too gleeful about the fact that it was a man winning over a woman, which is just so weird to say in 2025,” she said. “It was just a conversation of, ‘Why are you so happy that a woman lost?’”\n\nWhile the manosphere elicits discomfort, she and her friends joke about Nara Smith whenever they cook. Threaded through their humor, though, is uncertainty concerning what tradwives signify about women’s roles in society.\n\n“It’s like, ‘Oh, you don’t know how to make your own butter at home. How are you gonna run a house?’” Erravelli said. “It’s kind of funny to look at this all from the perspective of a teenage girl. You get told not everything you see on the internet is real, and that’s true. But when you see that these ‘trends’ are just totally affecting everyone you know, it’s kind of hard to believe that they’re not.”\n\nThe teacher helping students counter the internet’s gender cues\n\nSome educators like Jessica Berg are helping students navigate toxic internet culture. Her gender studies class at Rock Ridge High School in Virginia covers everything from ancient civilizations to the present-day backlash against feminism to help students understand how patriarchy became the norm. As part of the course, students learn about digital misogyny and the tradwife trend. \n\nBerg launched the course after the 2016 election, when students kept asking her why Hillary Clinton, widely considered one of the most qualified presidential candidates in history, lost the race to a man who had never held public office. Since then, she’s seen a resurgence of sexism. Fifty-five percent of young men agree that “men have it harder than women” and just under half agree that feminism has bettered the nation, the Equimundo report found. Berg suspects the manosphere bears some responsibility for misogyny’s growth. After the 2024 election, far-right influencer Nick Fuentes’ post mocking women’s reproductive rights — “Your body, my choice” — spread among students. “Young males were texting that, DMing it, posting it to young women,” Berg said.\n\nHer class teaches students, mostly girls, to challenge sexist messaging. Blessing Amuga, one of her students, confronted a male acquaintance who claimed women were “too emotional” to be president. “That doesn’t even make sense,” Amuga said of that sexist stereotype. She went on to point out how Trump, who has lost his cool in office on multiple occasions, supports policies that are actively harmful to women, including controlling women’s bodies. His policies reinforce “the idea that men should control what you do, what you eat, how you act,” Amuga told him.\n\nHer classmate Isabella Hasbun noticed boys parroting Trump’s insults toward Kamala Harris, mirroring the manosphere’s misogyny. “Them seeing a White man calling a Black woman dumb and saying that she has no qualifications just enhances their own [preconceived] thoughts,” said Hasbun, a recent Rock Ridge graduate, like Amuga.\n\nHasbun has seen more tradwives on her TikTok feed than manosphere influencers. She questions anyone who suggests she should spend her time cooking at home. Of them, she wonders: “What are you doing with your life?”\n\nRianna Abdelhamid, who also took Berg’s class, said domestic life is fine for women who enjoy it. “But not everybody is like that,” she said. To those expecting her to be a tradwife, she offered three words: “No, thank you.”\n\nIt’s the manosphere, though, that Hasbun objects to most. “That is the worst type of man you will ever find,” she said of the trend’s followers. Post-election, she’s faced repeated harassment from boys, she said, recalling a group of them circling the car she and a friend were in at a drive-thru — “thinking that they had the privilege of actually talking to us.”\n\nBeing in Berg’s class has empowered Hasbun and her classmates to advocate for women, and, in turn, themselves. Abdelhamid now speaks up instead of staying silent when she’s concerned about sexism. Hasbun has grown more confident. When she has a disagreement related to gender, she trusts her perspective: “I’m well aware of what’s actually happening instead of just basing my opinion on what some random dude on TikTok said.”\n\nIs there an antidote to the red pill?\n\nInfluenced by social media, young people may not only slip into the manosphere but become radicalized to the point of performing extremist acts. As research director at PERIL, Dashtgard designs tools, guides and resources to obstruct that pipeline using a public health approach.\n\n“We work with all levels of civil society — teachers, parents, faith leaders, small business owners, any kind of trusted adult in the life of a child,” Dashtgard said. “We want to help understand the nature of radicalization and what they can do in order to disrupt that.”\n\nPERIL, in partnership with the Southern Poverty Law Center, released a guide last year called “Not Just a Joke.” The goal, Dashtgard said, is to arm the public with the knowledge needed to recognize radicalization before it occurs and engage youth without condemning or humiliating them. These resources, if distributed, can become a preventative model scalable in communities nationally.\n\nFugardi, of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project, said social media platforms could provide another avenue for solutions.\n\n“We should be looking for social media companies to do more as they’ve grown in influence in our society,” she said. “We should have high expectations for them to not just enforce their own rules [around content moderation], but also to release transparency reports about how they’re protecting young people over prioritizing profit.”\n\nThe AMAZE project, which posts animated sex ed videos to YouTube and other platforms, presents youth with alternatives to the manosphere’s messaging about manhood — including its framing of issues like relationships and sexuality. Through Equimundo’s Link Up Lab — a hub that allows organizations to test different digital strategies to provide young men with healthy ways to pursue belonging — AMAZE consults with youth on the materials it develops for the web.\n\n“We have videos on the stuff that a sex educator might cover in class, but we also try to answer a question that a young person is really searching for,” Corey said. “One of our most popular videos is ‘Does Penis Size Matter?’ That is not going to be in the health education curriculum, but it is what someone is searching for, and we create animated, funny content about that.” In the fall, AMAZE plans to release a video on looksmaxxing, a dangerous trend linked to steroid use and do-it-yourself body modification that feeds off teen boys’ insecurities about their physiques, jawlines and even their hair.\n\nJulie Scelfo, founder of the grassroots group Mothers Against Media Addiction, urges caregivers to co-view content with kids. Check their browser history, and if they repeat sexist ideas, ask where they heard them.\n\n“If your kid is exposed to Andrew Tate-type influencers, it’s critical to have conversations about who he is and what you think about the messages that he’s espousing,” she said.\n\nEarly discussions about toxic content are key. Once youth enter college, they’ve already absorbed gender constructs, Corey said.\n\n“AMAZE is unique in the sex ed space in that we offer health education, relationship education, puberty education that is targeted towards adolescents because we think that’s when they actually start developing their opinions and their views on the world.”\n\nSo, for that kid who confronted Aarush Santoshi, there’s still time. Parents have more sway than influencers, Corey contends — if they act before harmful ideologies take root.","summary":"Toxic masculinity and idealized motherhood content are flooding social media feeds — forcing educators, students and parents to navigate the manosphere.\n\n\n\nBy Nadra Nittle and Mariel Padilla for The 19th\n\n\n\n\nAarush Santoshi struggled for words when a preteen boy approached him on a New Jersey street, shoved a phone in his face and asked: “What are your thoughts on Andrew Tate?”\n\n\n\nThe kid’s smirk and the fact he was recording rattled Santoshi, a high school junior at the time.

Organized protests across all 50 states, coinciding with Trump’s military parade, were meant to draw attention to Trump’s anti-democratic and increasingly monarchical consolidation of power.\n\nIn areas of business and politics it’s undeniable that he acts like a wannabe king, feeling little affinity for pesky intrusions that typically define a Republic, like laws, the Constitution, or a separation of powers.\n\nHe’s also shown an unsettling affection for dictators, from Russia’s Vladimir Putin to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, to Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, to Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nIn fact, just this week, Trump came to Bolsonaro’s defense, urging Brazil to drop its prosecution of the former president for trying to overturn the results of his country’s 2022 election.\n\n“He is not guilty of anything, except having fought for THE PEOPLE,” Trump posted of Bolsonaro, a man who once said, “Let’s go straight to the dictatorship.”\n\nBut while Trump’s penchant for kings and dictators is clear, his hostile threats toward the media makes him more like a pirate.\n\nTrump’s marauding of the American media landscape began years ago, when, while campaigning in 2016, he threatened to “open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.”\n\nThe purpose was obviously to silence journalists, whose job it is to hold powerful people accountable. But it was also to terrorize them and inflict maximum pain.\n\nWhen discussing a failed 2006 $5 billion lawsuit he filed against Tim O’Brien and his book publishers for suggesting Trump wasn’t actually a billionaire, he said of the loss, “I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make [O’Brien’s] life miserable, which I’m happy about.”\n\nHe made good on his threats in 2020, when his campaign filed three libel lawsuits in 10 days, challenging what was obviously protected speech in opinion columns at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. All three suits were dismissed, one with prejudice.\n\nIn 2022, he again sued CNN, this time for $475 million over its use of “The Big Lie” to describe Trump’s baseless allegations of election fraud. It was also dismissed.\n\nSince then there have been others, including a defamation suit against the Pulitzer Prize board in 2022, but more recently a crush of threats and suits has sent a wave of fear and panic across the media, as they are intended to do.\n\nAnd sadly the media is, in most cases, capitulating.\n\nThere was his lawsuit against ABC News in 2024, in which ABC agreed to pay a $15 million settlement toward Trump’s presidential library in a case over George Stephanopoulos’ use of the word “rape” instead of “sexual abuse,” a distinction even the judge in that case said was without a difference.\n\nThen there’s the suit against The Des Moines Register and Ann Selzer over a poll that showed him losing to former Vice President Kamala Harris in Iowa. Just last week he dropped the federal suit, but refiled it hours later in state court. That case is still in progress.\n\nThen there was his suit against CBS News for editing an interview it conducted with Harris. CBS, caught in the middle of a lucrative pending merger between parent company Paramount Global and Skydance Media, also settled to the tune of $16 million.\n\nFormer “60 Minutes” correspondent Steve Kroft weighed in this week, calling it a “shakedown,” and likening it to paying “tribute to the king.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what it is. It’s a ransom meant to appease the pirates in the Trump administration.\n\nIn the early 1800s, a young America was forced to confront this very phenomenon. Pirates off the Barbary Coast of Africa had been collecting tribute to allow our merchant ships to sail safely to port. When ransom wasn’t paid, the pirates captured ships, tortured American sailors and either killed them or converted them against their will to Islam.\n\nThe question for then President Thomas Jefferson was clear, but difficult: “Whether their peace or war will be cheapest?”\n\nUltimately it was a war he convinced America to fight, in order for “our commerce to be free and uninsulted,” but also so that other nations didn’t underestimate our power. We won, and the U.S. never paid off pirates again.\n\nWe can’t keep paying Pirate Trump. As long as we keep buying our safe passage through the dangerous waters of covering him, he’ll keep looting and pillaging our journalistic institutions, ensuring they remain under threat.\n\nBecause the hard truth is, safe passage is just an illusion when pirates are in the area.\n\nS.E.

Most people experience New Jersey from the highway, where we see blighted, dreary cities, massive oil tanks, and spots where Jimmy Hoffa might have been buried. Over the years, I’ve never written about a New Jersey museum. There’s plenty of good ones, but the grandest, the art museum at Princeton, has been closed for a few years as the university builds a new home for it, and in driving through New Jersey, I’ve often been rushing to get someplace. And we Vermonters get more than our fill of New Jerseyans who come to the Green Mountain State for skiing, summering, leaf peeping, speeding — oh, they’ll kill you — and behaving like churls. We don’t mind people from New York and Connecticut. Living in Ye Olde Arlington, which is very rural, we don’t see many New Jerseyans, and when we do, they marvel at our reserve, our precise directions, and covered bridges. All of us, alas, have a horror story about people from Jersey.\n\nIn late May, I made my slogan-for-a-day “New Jersey and Me: Together at Last.” Today, I’ll write about the lovely, little Montclair Art Museum in spruce, swanky Montclair.\n\nI hadn’t been to the Montclair Art Museum since I worked on an exhibition on George Inness’s views of the Berkshires more than 20 years ago. Inness (1825–1894) lived in Montclair, and the museum is rich in his work. This is Inness’s 200th birthday, so why not see the celebratory gallery that the museum assembled to show the best things it owns? Aside from the Innesses at the museum, I remember the awesome views of New York City from this beautiful town and the monument to the many dead from the September 11 attack.\n\nThe museum isn’t only about Inness, though. It’s unique as the only museum in the country limited to both American and Native American art, with great things in both fields. When it opened in 1914 in a purpose-built Georgian Revival building, it was the first art museum in New Jersey open to the public. The early money for the museum came from the steam-drill heiress Florence Rand, while the core American collection came from the Irish immigrant William T. Evans, who split his art between the Smithsonian and Montclair. Rand enlisted the formidable Grace Nicholson, the Pasadena-based dealer in Native American art and a family friend, to give part of her collection to Montclair.\n\nThe Inness room is very, very beautiful and is well worth a visit to Montclair. Inness spans much of the era of the Hudson River School of American landscape and seascape artists. Like all the best artists from this period, he evolves, though in a most unusual way, ending his years painting landscapes that expressed his Swedenborgian religious beliefs. The gallery, displaying most of the museum’s 20 or so Inness paintings, is arranged starting with landscapes in full daylight and ending with moonlight scenes. Pictures from the 1850s are topographical and full of crisp detail. Inness doesn’t do spectacle like Frederic Church. He has an Italian period but, unlike Thomas Cole, doesn’t do ruins. He’s a Barbizon painter in the style of the French painters Camille Corot or Théodore Rousseau, but he’s American and a religious painter.\n\nInness’s scenes are everyday landscapes, but that’s where God is. Swedenborgian belief doesn’t have much truck with Heaven or Hell or even sin. Its faith is in lifelong regeneration through love, goodness, and beauty rather than through rules. The Clark Art Institute, where I was a curator at the time, has two splendid Inness paintings from 1893. Out of curiosity, I went to a Swedenborgian service in Cambridge once — it was squishy but very nice, Episcopal lite, and I didn’t choke from a surfeit of incense.\n\nInness’s work from the 1880s until his death, much of it painted in Montclair, is gauzy. It’s not Impressionist at all, since Inness isn’t much interested in the science of color and light. It’s dappled and dewy and very dreamy. All that love, goodness, and beauty induce a daze. His sunset pictures from the early 1890s are gorgeous. He’s a painter of memory, not anything he remembers but what we viewers want to remember. He invites that. The gallery is hung Salon-style and is long-term. Montclair’s curatorial style leans in the direction of very long labels, but, at least in the Inness room, interpretation is in a three-ring binder that visitors can carry. That’s all for the best, since Inness is an artist of immersion.\n\nThe museum has a lively exhibition program. I didn’t know Nanette Carter (b. 1954), an abstract collagist who uses Mylar as a surface. Her attractive, bewitching retrospective — Nanette Carter: A Question of Balance — ended on July 6, but a monumental banner by her, Shifting Perspectives, remains on view till August 10. Carter grew up in Montclair, where her father was mayor, and as a teenager she saw an inspiring Mondrian exhibition. She went to Oberlin College determined to be an artist and, afterward, to Pratt Institute.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Carter discovered the wonders of frosted Mylar, a polyester film developed in the ’50s. Tough and shiny, it’s often used for packaging and lids and for birthday-party helium balloons. Experimenting first with pencil drawings on Mylar, she found that the graphite lines looked like “poured black butter” — as descriptions go, a sensual adventure.\n\nShe sometimes layers woodcut, monotype, or painted strips of canvas on a Mylar sheet. The contrast of surfaces isn’t jarring. It piques curiosity. Forms seem to slide and then skate and dance across the Mylar surface. She’s also very good at simulating surfaces such as marble, slate, wood grain, metal, water, and clouds. Forms are often cantilevered, so balance becomes a subject. Cantilevered, a series from 2013 to 2021, uses the shape of the architectural element, extending horizontally and unsupported on one end, to suggest what she considers the disequilibrium of contemporary life.\n\nOf course, disequilibrium has marked every era of human existence since Eve bit that forbidden fruit and got tossed from Eden, her dummkopf man in tow. She’s the original toxic feminist. Ours are more operatic, but, as eras go, we live in a fat and prosperous time. I like the tense balance in the art in Cantilevered, what Carter calls the point where “holding on” and “letting go” seem to be at a standoff. Destabilizing, her current series, deploys irregular shapes, weird diagonals, zigzags, and different paint techniques from shape to shape. Afro Sentinels #3, from 2024, quotes African power figures and the bounty of terra-cotta warrior figures in Xian, China. Carter is black, but, stretch and strain as the curator does, she draws from, among others, Jacob Lawrence and the wonderful Al Loving but also Mondrian and Stuart Davis, who, like Carter, is jazz-infused. She’s still an original who makes art that people want to contemplate and from which they get pleasure.\n\nA Question of Balance does Carter no favors, and she doesn’t help herself by describing her recent work as a reaction to “the chaos of the Trump era and the global pandemic” and “contemporary angst and uncertainty over the fate of democracy.” These are disingenuous marketing stunts. And the show has plenty of gratuitous musings by a curator run amok. “Carter has a veritable laundry list of recent changes she finds disturbing,” the catalogue tells us, “an increasingly polarized Congress, threats to democracy, erosion of women’s rights, the rise about political extremism, and climate change, to name a few.” Blah, blah, blah. Carter lets the museum go to town. Hey, they’re giving her a nice show.\n\nCarter’s beautiful, beguiling shapes, and the perfect scale of her art — not too big, not too small — deserve better. By pushing her work as political and affixed to the front pages of the New York Times, the museum makes it time-limited rather than timeless and enduring. That’s a shame, but Montclair is the ultimate limousine-liberal suburb. It’s got not one but two Whole Foods stores. The moron Kamala Harris got 86 percent of the vote there in 2024. The museum is probably giving the locals what they want to hear. Carter’s short essay in the catalogue addresses her art — shocking, I know — and her family. She says the titles of her series sound foreboding but that the images themselves are upbeat. “Their sense of movement, rhythm, and color speak to my belief in hope,” she writes. She should have written the whole book.\n\nThe museum’s budget is about $6.2 million. It makes a third of its money, a hefty proportion, from earned income such as tuition from art classes, the very nice shop, memberships, and events. Its endowment, at about $14 million, isn’t microscopic, but it’s small, given Montclair’s affluence. As vain as many rich people are, Montclair’s might get the warm and fuzzy-buzzies giving to New York City museums or even to the art museum in Newark, which is all about diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. These peacocks should support the treasure in their own backyard. The museum gets about 75,000 visitors a year, which seems right for a ritzy suburb with 40,000 people. Locals, many snoots, probably go in greater numbers to New York museums.\n\nThe museum has embraced DEIA — diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility — big time. It invites the grievance pimps from the New Jersey Department of Civil Rights to harangue its staff and volunteer docents about bias. On the accessibility front, the museum’s collection isn’t online, so the public doesn’t know what’s there, which shows how phony a commitment to DEIA can be. Twenty years ago, when I went to the Addison Gallery as the director, I fast-tracked the digitization of its magnificent collection. The Montclair museum has a list of artists represented in its collection, from Copley to now. But what are the goods? Enquiring minds want to know. Keeping a collection a secret in 2025 is a case of incompetence.\n\nThe Montclair museum has very good taste in acquisitions. It has focused on photography over the last few years and has bought good things. A show of new photography acquisitions since 2000 was a treat. I love Karl Struss (1886–1981), whose velvety Lower Manhattan, from 1911, is a prize purchase. Struss is an unsung, though great, photographer, like Inness having a gauzy aesthetic, but I imagine he’s best known, if he’s known at all, as the Hollywood cinematographer for Charlie Chaplin movies, F. W. Murnau’s Sunrise, the original Ben Hur, and Mary Pickford’s first sound film, Coquette. I liked the museum’s new Native American photography, too. The curators are adept at finding talent before prices soar. Natia Lemay’s Four Generations is very good. She’s Canadian, from New Brunswick, so I don’t know why she’s in an American-only collection, and who in their right mind would want Canada as our 51st state?\n\nI loved my visit. The new Princeton museum opens this fall, and there’s the art museum at Rutgers, as well as the Morris Museum in Morris Township and historic houses. Montclair, though, is a place to visit.","summary":"There’s great art in the Garden State’s Montclair Art Museum.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/07/my-day-in-jersey/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Winter-Moonlight-Christmas-Eve.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 10:30:47","author":"Brian T.

In her new book out this week, Butler: The Untold Story of the Near Assassination of Donald Trump and the Fight for America’s Heartland, Zito weaves the harrowing events of that day into a broader story about the transformation of the Rust Belt and Trump’s historic political comeback.\n\nEditor’s Note: The following transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nNR: The scene of President Trump getting shot last July in Butler, coming to his feet, raising his fist in the air, and yelling “Fight!” instantly became one of the most iconic moments in American history. You were as close as you could get to Trump at that moment without being on stage. Can you describe where you were and what you witnessed, and specifically, what people who have only seen the video clip might have missed about the moment?\n\nZITO: So I was about four feet from the president. I was in an area that’s called the buffer. It’s traditionally just for security and photojournalists. There’s traditionally not a reporter in that area, but I was going to travel with him that day to Bedminster and do an interview. And so that’s why I was there. Some of the things I think that people miss that still stand out to me today is when the [illegal immigration] chart came down. If anybody has ever gone to a Trump rally, that’s not something that ever happened. I remember thinking in that moment, “My goodness, is he Ross Perot? Like, why? Why is he having a chart come down?” And in that same moment, he does something he also never does. He turns away with his neck, not his body, but with his neck to face the chart. Now, if you’ve ever gone to a Trump rally, that is not part of what he does — he is always facing the rally goers. The relationship between someone attending his rally and him is very transactional, very emotional, and so for him to turn away, I remember thinking in the moment, “What is he doing?” And it was in that moment that I heard “pop, pop, pop,” and I knew immediately that it was gunshots, because I’m a gun owner, and there are a lot of people I could hear saying, “Why are there firecrackers?” And I didn’t get down in that moment, I watched everything sort of play out in front of me.\n\nAnd when they say things happen in slow motion, when there’s a traumatic event, it really does happen in slow motion. I watched the Secret Service sort of surround him in a sea of blue, and I heard the second shots fire off. I knew he was at least okay, because he didn’t fall down. He knelt down and one of the things that stands out to me, that I don’t think people heard was — as he finally got his shoes on, that was something he was very insistent about, that they put his shoes on before they moved him out of the stage, from my vantage point, it looked like they knocked them off of him when they surrounded him — and I hear him say, as he’s about to stand up, before he said “Fight! Fight! Fight!” he said “U-S-A!” And I asked him about that the next day. And it’s a really emotional part of the book that really shows a different side of Trump that I don’t think people have seen before, and I’m not sure they always have seen since that, but he was very cognizant that it was important to him to not have people panic, and I don’t want to go into too much detail, because I think it’s an important part of the book, but that was a very significant moment for him, as someone who would go on to become president of the United States again.\n\nNR: You’ve had a lot of conversations with Trump over the years, and you talk about how the assassination attempt profoundly changed him, but in what way? Because to a lot of us observing things from the outside, we see sort of the same old Trump after maybe the initial aftermath, the early stages of the RNC speech, but otherwise, he seems just as vicious to his opponents and so forth. In what ways do you think the event changed him?\n\nZITO: I think there’s a moment when he talks about the “hand of God.” From the outset, people don’t think of Trump as someone who is deeply or profoundly religious, right? He doesn’t express it in a way that George W. Bush did or Jimmy Carter did, but he has this recognition that, in that moment and from that moment on, God was watching him, and that there was a reason that he didn’t die in that moment. There was a reason that he made the decisions that he did, decisions he never normally makes. . . . From the outside, you don’t necessarily see that, especially if you’re a critic of him, it’s very difficult for people to wrap their head around who he is, because he’s just [Trump] to them. As you said, very much the same person, but [he’s changed] even in the way that he handles the urgency of what he wants to accomplish. It goes back to those early conversations that he and I had right after he was shot — he called me the next morning, bright and early in the morning, probably several times that day — that he believes that he is supposed to accomplish things for the betterment of the country, that he is on a mission to do as much as he can because he was saved in that moment.\n\nNR: What’s great about your book is that it isn’t just about the assassination attempt, but about Butler as a place and the current moment in America more broadly. You write about how reporters often describe the disconnect between those in “flyover country” and the so-called coastal elites, but you note that there’s a more complicated distinction involving rootedness. [See book excerpt here.] Can you talk about this distinction and how Butler itself fits into this?\n\nZITO: Yeah, so in this country, there tend to be people who are rooted, who have a keen sense of “place,” that have been — and their families have been — from the same 50 miles, right? That is where they’re from, and they’re deeply connected to it, not just physically, but emotionally. And then there are people that are more transient, right? And they tend to be the people that move up and out. And there’s a perception among the people that move up and out that the people that stay behind are resentful. But it’s very much not the case. I mean, sure, there are people that feel stuck, but there are also more people that feel very happy in the choices that they’ve made, staying where they’re from.\n\nIt’s more and more so when I look at our profession, journalism. Most journalists, not all, but most journalists live in what I call the “super zip codes” in this country. And that doesn’t make them bad. That just makes them different from the people that they often cover, and they’re at odds because they don’t understand and know each other. People — and it’s not just our profession, it’s not just legacy media — it is our corporations, our institutions, academia, Hollywood, entertainment, and all of those cultural curators. Their headquarters and their boardrooms are often located in those super zip codes. And they all went to the same kinds of schools, and they all live in the same neighborhoods, and they all socialized with each other.\n\nAgain, that’s not bad, but when they are covering people that have very different experiences, they don’t understand who they’re covering. They often don’t know anyone that owns a gun, or sits in a pew every week, or went to a state school. And because they’re at odds with each other, the covering of them has become more of an anthropological exercise, as opposed to understanding their rootedness. . . . I think the statistic is eight out of ten people in Pennsylvania live within 100 miles of where they grew up. And these are people that just don’t leave, and it’s not because they’re dumb or they’re not smart, or they lack ambition. They just feel more rewarded by having that close proximity to family and experiences and tradition. Does that make sense?\n\nNR: Yes. And specifically, how would you say this relates to Butler?\n\nZITO: So Butler is a county where, I believe, eight out of 10 people live within four miles of where they grew up. This is a very rooted county and people, and it’s not heavily populated, but it is very interesting and dynamic. . . . You have working-class [residents], you have farmers, you have immigrants, and you have $2 million suburbanites, and almost all of them have stayed in Butler or came back to Butler. So they’re very, very rooted to the place they’re from. This is a place that presidents don’t come to. Now, presidents have come to Butler before they were president, before they thought about running, or after they were president, but not to campaign. Only two presidents have ever campaigned there, and that was John F. Kennedy, and the other was Donald Trump. It’s just one of those places that is very overlooked by politicians, but also by legacy media. You just don’t go to Butler.\n\nNR: If we flash back to November 2022, Trump’s standing within the party was much different than it is now. At the time, Republicans blamed him for underperformance in the midterms, and Ron DeSantis, coming off of a huge victory, was ascendant. It’s become popular for a lot of political reporters, including myself, to attribute Trump’s comeback to primary voters rallying around him after the string of indictments the following spring. But you actually identify the turning point for him as his appearance in East Palestine, Ohio, after the train derailment. Why is that?\n\nZITO: East Palestine was definitely the turning point. That was his inflection point. And, yes, did the indictments bolster his sort of legendary status among Republican voters? Of course they did. But if you went into February of 2023, that’s when he was at his lowest point in the polling in New Hampshire. I’m going to forget when that New Hampshire poll came out . . . showing him and DeSantis neck and neck. In fact, I think that DeSantis was ahead. [Editor’s Note: On January 26, 2023, the University of New Hampshire released a poll showing DeSantis with a 12-point lead in the state]. And Trump shows up in East Palestine, Ohio. It is sleet outside. He has galoshes on. He’s walking in a trench coat. He’s walking in, God knows what. Because nobody knew what was going on there, right? We didn’t know what was in the air. I know I had been covering it, and every time I came home, I came home with a headache and not feeling well. But he’s walking around that town talking to people, listening to people. He shows up with an 18-wheeler filled with bottled water, and he buys half the town McDonald’s, and he says something really, really important. He talks about the dignity of these people, and he talks about seeing them, and he won’t forget them.\n\nI thought he was off between November 2022 and until that moment. I didn’t think he had that thing that people loved about him. But when he did that, I was like, “Oh, it’s over. If he pulls ahead in the polls, and within the next week or two, it’s over. And it’s because of what’s happened here.” There are 42 miles that separate East Palestine and Butler — coincidentally, towns that my family came from. My great-grandfather was from East Palestine, Ohio. My great-great-great-great grandfather was one of the founding families of Butler. Those 42 miles, there were stretches of 42 miles like that all across the country. And those were the people that were going to put Trump into office, and that was the pivot moment. I didn’t just think he was going to win the primary in that moment. I thought he was going to win the election in that moment.\n\nNR: The Rust Belt changed dramatically between the time when Barack Obama comfortably beat John McCain in Pennsylvania in 2008 and Trump’s victory eight years later. How much of this is owed to Trump’s ability to connect to those voters, and how much is due to broader factors that may prove more enduring even beyond Trump?\n\nSo the disassociation with the Democrats, between the Democrat voters — the Rust Belt voters in places like Mahoning County and places like Johnstown, Cambria County, Luzerne, Erie — began between 2008 and 2012 if you look at their votes. If you look specifically at Pennsylvania, Barack Obama lost almost five percentage points between those two election cycles. But those voters didn’t go to Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney did not win them over. He didn’t speak directly to them. He didn’t tell them, “I see your pain.” People looked at him and said, “That’s a nice guy, but if my plant closes down, he’s the guy that’s going to bring the box to my desk and walk me out.” When Trump came down that escalator in 2015, and everybody talked about whatever he said about Mexico, all I heard was that he talked about the dignity of work. He essentially gave Bill Clinton’s announcement speech in October 1991. So it’s in part that the Democrats let these voters know where to go, and a bigger part [is] that Trump saw them and told them, “I see you. I respect what you do. You are my people. Come with me.” You know, why not? I mean, he basically said, “Why not? Nothing else has worked.”\n\nNR: You write toward the end that there will be a never be another one like Trump. If you consider the Trump phenomenon — the policy ideas and the general populist sentiment and trying to speak to people who have been forgotten — you could see somebody picking up that mold. JD Vance being the most obvious. But there’s also Trump, the celebrity, the performer, the guy who’s going to have everybody suddenly debating whether we should take over Greenland. What does the MAGA movement look like without Trump? And will it continue to dominate the Republican Party?\n\nZITO: I think that’s up to whoever takes over the mantle. And as to your point, it more than likely is JD Vance or Marco Rubio or a combination of both. And you see it with Vance in his ability to go on these podcasts and be both very wonky and policy-driven but also sort of funny and edgy and a little Millennial. So there’s an opportunity for that to continue. But Trump, whether you like him or not, you cannot dispute that he is a force of nature. And it’s unlikely there will ever be anyone else like him, at least in my lifetime.\n\nNR: Is there anything that you’d want to add that you think that people should know about your book?\n\nZITO: Well, I think what’s really important about this book is that it is a really granular look at the 2024 election on the ground and seeing what Democrats kept missing and what reporters struggled to define and wrap their heads around. If you were with me in Pennsylvania — and there were plenty of local Democrats that I talked to every day — it would be clear to you that neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris was going to win the state. And you could also see how much the coalition was just changing right in front of everyone. I can remember there was a rally. I think it was Lehigh Valley, right after Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. And this was a heavily Puerto Rican community in Pennsylvania. And everyone was writing like, “Oh, you know, he called them garbage, or he let someone call them garbage, and he’s going to lose the Puerto Rican vote.” And I remember getting there early in the morning, and they said there’s going to be this big rally against him now, but there’s six people there. And every Puerto Rican family and business owner that I’m talking to thinks that people have lost their minds, that they can’t even get a joke. And I remember being so frustrated that nobody else saw what I saw, I remember that being incredibly frustrating. So that’s what I wanted to bring to life in the rest of that book, to see it through people’s lives and people’s eyes — what was happening. So maybe they can treat these people who have moved their political affiliation with more respect and more recognition.","summary":"Zito weaves the harrowing events of that day into a broader story about the transformation of the Rust Belt and Trump’s historic political comeback.  ","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/07/qa-salena-zito-tells-the-inside-story-of-the-butler-assassination-attempt-and-donald-trumps-2024-political-comeback/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NR-Cover10.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 10:30:14","author":"Philip Klein","authors":["Philip Klein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":340183318,"title":"What Happened to Democrats' Patriotism? | Opinion","text":"\"And I'm proud to be an American,\" goes the refrain of Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA,\" an intensely patriotic song the country singer has frequently performed at political rallies and campaign events for President Donald J. Trump. As Americans marked the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence last weekend, polling data on patriotism highlighted an alarming trend. While almost all Republicans say they are \"extremely\" or \"very patriotic,\" scarcely more than one-third of Democrats now share that sentiment.It was not always this way. In 2001, according to Gallup, America's two major political parties were roughly even in national pride, with 90 percent of Republicans and 87 percent of Democrats identifying as \"extremely\" or \"very patriotic.\" Those figures diverged only marginally over the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In 2015, after six years under Obama, Republicans were still registering high levels of patriotism, at 90 percent, while Democratic patriotism had only slightly receded, to 80 percent, with no intervening year seeing the latter fall below the 74 percent recorded in 2007.The last decade, however, has seen patriotism among Democrats plummet while the Republican figure has remained virtually unchanged. In the course of just one year, from 2015 to 2016, the share of highly patriotic Democrats fell to a then-historic low of 68 percent. That figure further declined to 60 percent in 2018 before dropping to just 42 percent in 2020.Recovering the White House for four years after Trump's first term did little to encourage Democrats' enthusiasm for their country. By 2022, the midpoint of Joe Biden's time in office, extreme or very high levels of Democratic patriotism had anemically recovered to just 52 percent. The Republicans, meanwhile, dipped only slightly that year, to 84 percent, their lowest number on record.According to Gallup's most recent survey, taken in June, the Republicans have vaulted back to near unanimity, at 92 percent, while the Democrats have hit a new low, with just 36 percent saying they have a high level of patriotism. A less nuanced poll of registered voters taken in June by the Republican firm National Research, Inc., which merely asked if the respondents considered themselves to be \"patriots,\" found that 91 percent of Republicans answered affirmatively to that description compared to only 50 percent of Democrats. An alternative opinion question in the same survey found roughly equivalent figures among \"conservatives\" and \"liberals,\" at 87 and 51 percent, respectively.Notably, the Democratic patriotism dive began around 2015, as diversity, equity, and inclusion and critical race theory began to ooze from small academic circles through virtually the entire educational system. These ideologies carried criticism of the national past, the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, free speech, perceived structural inequalities, and \"whiteness\" into many American institutions. Patriotic feelings have sharply declined among the younger generations who were most exposed to that unhappy development. Regardless of party affiliation, according to Gallup, only 41 percent of Gen Z and 58 percent of millennial respondents claim to be extremely or very patriotic, compared to 71 percent of Generation X, 75 percent of Baby Boomers, and 83 percent of the \"Greatest Generation.\"For a political party even to be perceived as unpatriotic can be lethal in American politics. Gallup finds that 58 percent of all Americans still subscribe to high levels of patriotism. That figure, too, is a historic low, clearly dragged down by Democrats who express little love for their country.Democratic politicos are scrambling to explain away the results or find palliative measures. Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman (D) said of Gallup's results: \"in the greatest country in the world, that's just wrong. I'm unapologetically grateful for our nation and the American Way of Life—today, and always.\"As Biden put it in his first public address after Kamala Harris ingloriously lost to Trump, \"you can't love your country only when you win.\" The numbers show that, win or lose, Democrats don't love it very much at all. With the progressive faction now ascendant in Democratic politics it is hard to see that these sentiments will change—or make them more electable.Paul du Quenoy is President of the Palm Beach Freedom Institute.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"As Americans marked the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence last weekend, polling data on patriotism highlighted an alarming trend.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/what-happened-democrats-patriotism-opinion-2096032","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2680101/american-flags-dnc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 10:00:01","author":"Paul Du Quenoy","authors":["Paul Du Quenoy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":340237134,"title":"New poll finds most Californians believe American democracy is in peril","text":"An overwhelming number of California voters think American democracy is being threatened or, at the very least, tested, according to a new poll released Thursday by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies. The poll, conducted for the nonprofit Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, found that concerns cut across the partisan spectrum. They are shared regardless of income or education level, race or ethnicity. Californians living in big cities and rural countrysides, young and old, expressed similar unease. \"I do think that it's at a pretty dangerous point right now. The concerns are justified,\" said political scientist Eric Schickler, co-director of the Berkeley institute. \"Our democracy is not healthy when you have a president that's acting to unilaterally stop money from being spent that's been appropriated, or going to war with colleges and universities or sending troops to L.A.\" In the survey, 64% of California voters said they thought American democracy was under attack, and 26% felt our system of government was being tested but was not under attack. The poll did not investigate what voters blamed for putting democracy in peril. Democrats, who dominate the California electorate, were the most fearful, with 81% saying it was under attack and 16% who described democracy as being tested. Among voters registered as \"no party preference\" or with other political parties, 61% felt democracy was under assault, and 32% said it was being tested. Republicans expressed more faith — nearly a quarter of those polled said they felt democracy was in no danger. But 38% said it was under attack and 39% said it was being tested but not under attack. Concerns among Democrats may have been expected in California, given the state's liberal tilt and the widespread and relentless government upheaval since President Trump took office in January. But the opinions shared by Republicans indicates just how pervasive the concerns are about the future of a country seen as a worldwide beacon of freedom and democracy. Emily Ekins, director of polling for the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, said those findings are evidence of an unsettling new development in American politics. \"A couple years ago, Republicans felt that democracy was at risk and now Democrats feel that democracy is at risk. I think that this is pretty worrisome, because people are starting to view the stakes of each election as being higher and higher,\" said Ekins, who had no involvement with the Berkeley poll. \"They may feel like they could lose their rights and freedoms. They may not feel like the rules apply to them anymore because they feel like so much is on the line.\" Schickler said the political perceptions among Republicans have been recently fed, in part, by Trump's baseless claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. Continuous allegations that the U.S. Department. of Justice, including the FBI, and a \"deep state\" federal government bureaucracy were weaponized against him since his first term in office also contributed to the fear. Those claims were magnified by conservative news outlets, including Fox News, as well as Trump loyalists on social media, popular podcasts and talk shows. Even some Republicans who support the president or are agnostic about his tenure are likely concerned about the discord in American politics in recent months, Schickler said, especially after the Trump administration sent U.S. Marines and the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles as a protective force during widespread federal immigration raids and subsequent protests. Recent decisions by media companies to settle Trump’s lawsuits over complaints about stories and coverage also are concerning, he said, despite the merits of those allegations being suspect. This month, Paramount Global decided to pay $16 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris; the president claimed it was done to help her presidential campaign against him. Paramount’s leaders hope the settlement will help clear a path for Trump-appointed regulators to bless the company’s $8-billion sale to David Ellison’s Skydance Media. \"That's not how a democracy is supposed to work,\" Schickler said. \"I think the voters' concerns are rooted in a reality, one that's been building up for a while. It's not something that's just started in 2025 but it's been kind of gradually getting more serious over the last 20 or 30 years.\" The survey also found that 75% of California voters believe strongly or somewhat that special interest money has too much influence in state politics, a sentiment especially strong among Republicans. Slim majorities of California voters had little or no trust that Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature act in the best interest of the public. According to the poll, 42% of voters said they have a lot or some trust in Newsom to act in the public's interest; 53% said they trust his actions just a little or not at all. Those surveyed had similar sentiments about the legislature. The courts received the most favorable marks, with 57% of voters saying they trusted the judicial system to act in the best interest of the public. Technology companies and their leaders were labeled completely untrustworthy by 58% of those surveyed. Russia Chavis Cardenas, deputy director of the nonpartisan government accountability organization group California Common Cause, which has received grants from the poll-sponsoring Haas Fund, said the findings show just how much special interest influence in Sacramento, and Washington, erodes public trust in government, which may provide insight into their concerns about the health of the American democracy. \"I want to see folks from every political party, every race and every walk of life to be able to be engaged in their democracy, to be able to have a say, to be able to have representation,\" Chavis Cardinas said. \"So these numbers are concerning, but they also don't lie,\" she said. \"They're letting us know that folks here in California recognize the influence that big money has, and that the tech companies have too much power over elected officials.\" The poll surveyed 6,474 registered voters throughout California from June 2-6.","summary":"New poll finds that 90% of Californians believe American democracy is under attack or being tested.

According to XXL Mag, Nicki was one of the many other artists who joined Tidal in 2015 as its brand partners after Jay-Z relaunched it.However, five years later, the Roc Nation founder sold his majority stake of the company to Square for $297 million. Minaj later revealed that she was only offered $1 million as her payout, claiming that she was allegedly owed a bigger amount.In a tweet posted on Wednesday, July 9, the Anaconda rapper claimed that the amount calculated is \"about 100-200MM\". Minaj has also called out Hov directly, asking him to call her and settle \"this karmic debt\".Further, Nicki Minaj also warned others of not calling him \"Hov,\" declaring it \"blasphemy\".Besides Jay-Z, Nicki is also calling out the CEO of his record label, Desiree Perez, by bringing up her daughter's false detainment lawsuit. In another one of her tweets posted on Thursday (July 10), Minaj drew parallels between Perez's false statement about her daughter and those about the swatting attacks she has faced in recent years.In April 2025, iHeart reported that Nicki Minaj’s Hidden Hills home was swatted on April 10. Police rushed to the house after an anonymous tip claimed a Black woman had been shot and two others were on the property.But when officers arrived, they found no signs of trouble. The house was locked, and Minaj and her family weren’t home—or even on the West Coast at the time.Despite Nicki Minaj's tirade of tweets aimed at Jay-Z and Desiree Perez, neither has responded to them so far.","summary":"Nicki Minaj, who is making headlines for her accusations and digs at Jay-Z, Roc Nation, and others associated with them, was a subject of discussion on the July 9 episode of Charlamagne Tha God's The","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/news-you-accuse-somebody-something-even-do-charlamagne-tha-god-reacts-nicki-minaj-s-comments-jay-z","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/7c014-17521253060349-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 09:59:36","author":"Akanksha Mishra","authors":["Akanksha Mishra"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":340181144,"title":"The Expensive, Seductive Strategy That Doomed the Democratic Party","text":"A few months ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was holding a press conference with an almond farmer when reporters asked him about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the immigrant living in Maryland whom the Trump administration had accused of being an MS-13 gang member. The Department of Homeland Security had recently deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison because of an administrative error—and was refusing to rectify it, despite multiple court orders.\n\nGiven the chance to address Donald Trump’s suspension of due process and defiance of the judiciary, Newsom—a would-be leader of the national opposition—called the case a “distraction” from the president’s tariff policies. Despite growing public outrage, he wanted to stick to prepared remarks about almond exports.\n\nThis was the same man who once guaranteed “sanctuary for all who seek it” within California’s borders and who, more recently, had said he wanted to remake what the Democratic Party stands for. He practically oozes the aspiration to become its presidential nominee in 2028.\n\nBut that April day, the governor of the country’s largest nominal stronghold of liberalism insinuated that the White House was pleased—in a calculated sort of way—that elected Democrats were drawing attention to Abrego Garcia rather than the losses being suffered by the S&P 500. “They don’t want to be accountable to markets today,” Newsom said. Then, referring to the farmer, Christine Gemperle, with whom he was holding a press conference about a lawsuit he had filed over the tariffs: “They don’t want to have a real conversation with Christine, and what’s going on with the export uncertainty here in the Valley.”\n\nThe Gettysburg Address it wasn’t. (Should the Gettysburg Address have been more concerned with kitchen-table issues?) But it provided a candid glimpse into how many of the Democratic Party’s most important figures think. It was an acute case of Strategist Brain, you might call it, and a vivid example of how deep a hole the United States is in. (Newsom was not exactly wrong that the president’s unilateral and possibly illegal imposition of economy-crippling tariffs was also deserving of attention.) Yet while the story of how campaign strategists gained such a hold on the party explains a lot about its present impotence, it could also suggest a path back to both electoral success and actual working governance.\n\nDemocratic politicians—including presidents—come and go. But the party’s strategists endure, as does the kind of strategy they typically recommend. In the early 1990s, the most celebrated Democratic minds were Bill Clinton–affiliated operatives and pollsters like James Carville, Mark Penn, and Al From—advocates of pragmatic, fiscally moderate economic positions and bold breaks from progressive orthodoxy on cultural issues. They remain influential: Carville has a regular column in the New York Times; the newspaper recently published an interview with From and three fellow ’92 campaign veterans about what Democrats should do heading into the midterms. The illustration that ran with the article featured a photo of Hillary Clinton, who had hired Penn as her top 2008 campaign strategist.\n\nThere are newer gurus in elite party circles too—figures like onetime Barack Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, pollster and onetime Obama campaign staffer David Shor, and blogger Matt Yglesias—who are more proficient with new jargon and technology but give essentially the same advice: Follow the polls, talk about middle-class economic concerns, and occasionally make it clear that you’re not one of those liberals by taking a few contrarian, conservative positions on social or cultural issues.\n\nWhy have Democrats been taking advice from the same small circle of people—who were never chosen by voters, are never accountable to them, and haven’t worked in government in decades, if ever—for more than 30 years? Why don’t these people’s ideas ever seem to change? How might this contribute to the party’s national reputation for irrelevance and ineffectiveness, not to mention the state of the American system of government (i.e., on the verge of collapse)?\n\nThe answers I’d propose are not as straightforward as you might be guessing. You’re not about to read a case for principled leftism or political courage. Those concepts have their place, but the truth is that talking about middle-class economics while moderating strategically on wedge issues does win votes in biannual congressional elections and presidential races. The problem is that too many people in the party have forgotten that they’re supposed to do anything else. And while some bright Democratic minds have overcome this handicap in the past by virtue of their own keen instincts, might there be a smarter way to run things?\n\nIn the decades since the Democratic Party got its clock cleaned in the 1984 presidential election, it has gotten really good at one thing: finding candidates who are skilled fundraisers and using the money they raise to carpet-bomb small slices of undecided voters with poll-tested and focus-grouped ads that appeal to their vaguely moderate views on a handful of nationally resonant issues. In the present day, when losing control of the House can mean “There aren’t going to be vaccines or weather forecasts anymore,” this is high-stakes work. The people who carry it out are campaign strategists, and it makes sense they would feel owed a measure of gratitude and prominence.\n\nBut there was a time in the United States, as hard as it might be to imagine, when there were no celebrity political strategists. Candidates decided how to campaign, and people who worked for political parties decided what policies to pursue. Parties gauged voters’ responses thereto in a variety of ways, including interactions between voters and local party organizers. All of these people had their own selfish ambitions, but they had incentives nonetheless to think about the practical, long-term consequences of the decisions they made.\n\nThis was the era of strong parties, also known as political machines. And they had downsides: They could be corrupt, and they did not make decisions in a democratic way. In response, reformers pushed to limit the power they possessed, a lengthy effort that began during the Progressive Era of the early 20th century and culminated after the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. At that gathering, held during the Vietnam War, party leaders, including infamous machine Mayor Richard Daley, strong-armed through a pro-war platform as protesters were beaten in the streets outside. In its aftermath, Democrats adopted so-called binding primaries, in which voters, rather than party officials, selected candidates.\n\nAs party organizations lost their control over the way elections were conducted and funded, their power waned and their size dwindled. They became, in the titular words of a 2024 book by political scientists Daniel Schlozman and Sam Rosenfeld, hollow parties.\n\nAnd although the procedural changes that killed off party machines were supposed to put engaged, informed citizens back in charge of their government, that’s not what happened. The decline of party power coincided with the rise of suburbs and television, which contributed to a broader decline in civic participation. Just as bowling leagues and Kiwanis clubs suffered, so too did local party activity: In Pew’s surveys, the share of Americans who call themselves Democrats has fallen from a high of 51 percent in 1964 to 33 percent today. When Pew started collecting data in 1939, only 18 percent of respondents identified as independents; that number is now 35 percent.\n\nLater, the launches of Craigslist (1995) and the Google search engine (1998) began crushing local and regional newspapers. Geographic and cultural “polarization” hardened Americans’ partisan identities, which meant that fewer and fewer local and state-level elections were competitive—and that less happened in Congress once the elections were over. Democrats, hoping to escape their reputation as “the party of big government,” stopped advocating for New Deal–style big-ticket social programs and embraced so-called submerged state policies—the kinds that are built around little-noticed tax incentives and the outsourcing of government functions to third parties. For elected Democrats, this is a time of both gridlock and caution: There is less actual governing to do than there used to be, and the governing that does get done is less tangible to voters than it once was.\n\nBut elections keep happening nevertheless. Sometimes they are largely symbolic competitions between abstract visions of what it means to be American; sometimes they are consequential referendums on whether insurance companies should be able to deny you coverage for brain cancer because you have mild asthma. Feelings about and interest in elections have rarely been higher—and technology has made it possible to conduct public opinion polls, test and target messages, and sort demographic data on a massive scale.\n\nFor campaign strategists, in other words, this is a golden age.\n\n“It’s kind of remarkable how much consultants came out of the destruction of parties as a real organizing force in politics,” said Gregory Martin, a professor at Stanford University who studies the role of media and advertising in elections. “And how consultants have substituted for things that parties used to do.” Of the $16 billion spent on political campaigns in 2024, about half a billion went through the party’s national organization. The lion’s share of political spending, Martin has found, flows from campaigns (or super PACs) through their consultants to media firms that book TV advertising.\n\n“The core work of what a party does—determining what the message is, what does the party stand for, what policies does it pursue, what are the public rationales it offers—all those things have been outsourced,” Martin said. There is still a party machine, of sorts, in that Democratic decisionmaking is disproportionately controlled by a certain group of powerful individuals, like the ones who were accused of putting their thumb on the scale for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and helping cover up Joe Biden’s decline in 2024. But now those figures are part of a “blob” (that’s another Hollow Parties term) of consultants and fundraisers clustered on the coasts who have neither formal obligations to nor channels of communication with the vast majority of Democratic voters.\n\nConsultants, in other words, have different interests than formal parties do. Their incentive is to find work every two years, then to receive and spend as much money as possible while employed. And they have an incentive to work for the campaigns that are most likely to win, because that helps them get their next job. “We showed that the consultants that are the most high reputation, the ones who command the highest rates and had the best track records, work mostly for safe incumbents,” Martin told me. “Which is the opposite of what you would get if the party was trying to allocate a resource and maximize for its own goals. There’s a lot of very safe incumbents spending a lot of money hiring high-profile, prestigious consultants to run their campaigns. And there’s a lot of uncompetitive races where candidates are running TV ads, which are very expensive and which happen to generate profits for consultants.”\n\nThis also means that strategy consulting is the best way to build a stable, well-compensated career in government. “If you want to do well in politics, you can make a lot more money in a consulting firm than working on a campaign or on a staff,” Martin said. (In a recent appearance on Ezra Klein’s New York Times podcast, former Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez aide Saikat Chakrabarti described arriving in Congress and being invited to a seminar about how to get policy ideas from lobbyists—the implication being that congressional staffs are too small to do the work themselves.)\n\nBut reality encompasses long stretches of time between elections, during which conditions are shaped by factors besides reactions to message tests. Public opinion changes; opposing parties do things; “exogenous shocks” like pandemics and wars and market crashes occur. The party and its blob are finely tuned for outputting effective language about working across the aisle and protecting Social Security. They have proved much less adept at weighing competing short-term and long-term interests while responding to real-world events, protecting the party’s reputation and advancing its overall plan for improving the United States. There is no one left, really, whose job is to do that.\n\nIn 2002, as The Hollow Parties recounts, party leaders told Democrats at a “messaging retreat” that polling called for enthusiastic support of George W. Bush’s foreign policy. But as Hillary Clinton learned when her vote to authorize the Iraq war cost her the Democratic nomination in 2008, there is no reason to assume a correlation between a policy that tests well and one that works well. And even in an era of siloed information diets, reality does occasionally leak through to the electorate, even if it sometimes takes longer than one news cycle.\n\nDemocrats have long cultivated a penny-wise and pound-foolish relationship with public opinion data. For decades, the party’s presidents have gotten “tough” on the southern border by closing this or that loophole and ordering increased deportations—toughness polls well—without addressing the underlying situation: Roughly 700 immigration judges are somehow supposed to handle literally millions of asylum claims each year while the available legal pathways to citizenship remain narrow and convoluted. The border tends to stay chaotic, an issue for which voters blame Democrats.\n\nIn 2009 Democrats who wanted to project moderation and responsibility killed off major parts of Obama’s stimulus bill, which then failed to adequately stimulate the economy, leading (in part) to many of those members’ defeats in the 2010 midterms. (Obama’s advisers also counseled him against bailing out the auto industry—it polled poorly in Michigan—but he did it anyway, and it ended up being considered one of the keys to his 2012 reelection.) The same process repeated itself during Biden’s term, when centrist Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin vetoed the portions of the Build Back Better bill that would have benefited voters with young children and seniors who required in-home health care. The party settled instead for long-term investments in semiconductor manufacturing and green tech; those may be worthy initiatives, but polls showed that voters never ended up hearing about them.\n\nNot all of the party’s elected officials act this way. The most important thing about working with a campaign strategist, a political operative I know told me recently, might be figuring out when to ignore your campaign strategist. Jay Inslee, now 74 and still doing climate change activism, served three terms as the governor of Washington and was elected to Congress eight times. During his career, he had a habit of staking out decisive positions that eventually became party consensus. In 1998 he won a swing district by making the risky decision to turn the race into a referendum on the Republican impeachment of Bill Clinton. (Inslee argued that it had been a waste of time.) In 2017 he was among the first to protest Trump’s “Muslim ban.”\n\nWhen I spoke to him, he didn’t seem to think there was much of a trick to it. “I’ve made some decisions just based on my gut,” he said, “feelings about what I believe America is about. When I heard about the Muslim ban, I literally turned the car around and drove to SeaTac Airport. You just can’t resist your impulse to stand up for basic American values, what you think the nation is about.\n\n“I think there is also probably a spectrum of how much people are willing to tolerate risk,” he said. “And I think, on that spectrum, I’m also a person who has been willing to look at the longer term, to be confident in my ability to win the respect of my constituents—maybe not their agreement, but their respect.”\n\nInslee is not, he told me, against staying abreast of public opinion per se. “I think polling can be of assistance to any public official to say, ‘Look, you said X, but they heard Y, right?’ The language you’re using, making sure that you’re really communicating.” His style of data collection, though, is often more art than science. “I’m out talking to people and listening to them where they live. I’m in schools, listening to teachers and parents, I’m in homeless camps, listening to people. The office is not the place where you’re going to be able to read people’s feelings.”\n\nThe strategy guys who work out of fancy offices tend to have staying power, though, no matter how poor their advice on subjects other than campaigns turns out to be. Rahm Emanuel, for instance, ended his tenure as mayor of Chicago with an 18 percent approval rating and is now considering a run for president.\n\nFor this, the blame might extend beyond the world of politics. The U.S. is a country that rewards the clever, scalable, levered shortcut. Private equity, hedge funds, venture capital: For ambitious and high-functioning individuals, making morally disinterested, data-driven strategic decisions is the most obvious path to wealth and status.\n\nIt’s not uncommon, either, for those with this vocation to switch back and forth between finance and politics. (Consider how absurd it would seem today if a modern president spent his post–White House life, like Jimmy Carter did, helping build houses for poor families by hand—an intrinsically unscalable activity and a disastrously inefficient deployment of Carter’s human capital.) In addition to Emanuel, a part-time investment banker, a list of the most influential Democrats of the 21st century would also include hedge fund managing partner/economic policy guru Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder, VC investor, and megadonor Reid Hoffman. (Sam Bankman-Fried was on his way too.)\n\nBut the shortsightedness of the campaign strategist’s approach to governing parallels the financial industry’s fixation on short-term results—a fixation that often creates long-term problems that end up erasing whatever gains were made in the first place.\n\nIn a new book called The Unaccountability Machine, author Dan Davies describes how companies like Wells Fargo and Boeing raised their earnings by, respectively, incentivizing low-level employees to open as many accounts as possible on “behalf” of customers and outsourcing major parts of the manufacturing process. Those decisions led directly to huge scandals and big losses. “It’s really easy for an organization to fool itself, like Wells Fargo, that what it’s doing is really clever, it’s increasing revenue per customer,” said Davies on the Complex Systems podcast to host and tech-world figure Patrick McKenzie, “when what it’s actually doing is building up a huge operational risk liability for itself five or 10 years down the line.” Every individual decision to cut costs is supported by data: This will increase earnings, which will make the stock go up, which is what companies are supposed to do, according to the theory of maximizing shareholder value. But the wrong series of individually justifiable “good” decisions can function as one very big bad decision.\n\nTo understand how this happens in politics, consider the kind of research conducted by David Shor, the former Obama staffer whose data research and ideas about “popularism” and (surprise!) breaking from orthodoxy on cultural issues have made him a favorite of Democratic electeds. In 2024, for instance, Shor’s firm Blue Rose Research conducted a survey of more than 9,000 voters who were given a range of rhetoric about the Kamala Harris campaign to evaluate. It found, for example, that saying “You may not always agree with me” and using the words grow, both, economists, and military tested well. The notion of lifting up and fighting for the middle class by working “across party lines” and with “leaders in both parties” also polled favorably. (The messages that tested worst involved former allies of Trump’s describing him as a threat to democracy.)\n\nThe survey is not ideologically biased—“taking on price gouging,” for example, is an idea more associated with the Democratic left than with the center. And you can see why it has appeal: It’s science, and it tells you exactly what to do. If you do what it says but still lose, hey, you did your best.\n\nStill, this memo conveys only one type of data: how voters respond to a discrete set of messages after agreeing to take part in a survey for someone putting together a memo. There is a lot that’s not discussed in a document like this. For one, it can’t predict the cumulative effect of everyone in the Democratic Party using the same sanded-down phrases about “fighting for your family.” This, as Stanford’s Martin pointed out to me, is a classic tragedy of the commons, and it has caused a crisis in Democratic fundraising too: The party’s dominant mode of faux-personal email and text outreach might be empirically effective when used by one candidate, but not when used by all candidates, and its donors are getting fed up. Democrats, though they’ve done well to adapt their ’92-era messaging ideas to contemporary technology, still struggle with the “social” part of social media. (No one was making time at the watercooler to talk about Harris’ “opportunity economy.” Trump went viral on TikTok for economic promises he didn’t even make.)\n\nMessage testing can’t tell you how to handle contradictory or volatile voter beliefs—the public tends to say it supports both increased government spending and smaller government, for instance, and has shifted its position on whether there should be more or less immigration 10 times in the past 10 years. It can’t tell you, in the event that you enact a useful policy, how to make sure voters notice its effects and associate them with Democrats; conversely, it doesn’t tell you anything about the potential consequences of winning office and failing to follow through on something that you claimed, during your campaign, to support. Shor’s tests regularly find support for unambiguously liberal messages about taking on corporate special interests and raising taxes on the wealthy, but when Democrats actually hold power, this commitment somehow always ends up getting stuck to the bottom of the desk drawer.\n\nAnd what about the messages that never get tested because no one has the gumption and ambition to propose them? To run on protecting Social Security and Medicare, after all, Democrats initially had to invent Social Security and Medicare—and they had to do it without having yet paid someone to run the numbers on whether voters would approve of protecting these programs. The closest the party has come to creating a new pillar of popular support in the past 30 years was passing the Affordable Care Act’s protection against denying insurance coverage to individuals with preexisting medical issues. At the time, Emanuel reportedly advised Barack Obama to abandon the ACA push in favor of smaller agenda items that would have been easier to build bipartisan consensus around.\n\nFinally, let’s say that for years you’ve ignored subjects, like the confirmation of judges, that are statistically of little interest to low-engagement sections of the electorate. What if a Democratic policy that tests really well is frozen by an injunction issued by one of the right-wing activists that Republican presidents have, as a result, stuffed into the federal judiciary at disproportionate rates? And what happens to your campaign’s chances if you’ve let the opposition change the rules of elections in their favor so often that it’s not out of the question that they might decide to shut down elections for good?\n\nTrying to solve every problem by figuring out the right way to talk about it is an approach with limitations that probably should be obvious. Elected Democrats and the donors that keep the party running are, nonetheless, quite captivated by it. Newly elected Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, for instance, invited Matt Yglesias—the “issue salience” guru whose writing was said to be widely circulated in the Biden administration—to a $5,000-a-head donor retreat he held in March at something called the L’Auberge de Sedona resort. (Yglesias told Rolling Stone he was not accepting a fee to speak at the event.) Sometimes, like in the case of Newsom and the almond farmer, the elected officials appear to have become confused about when they are supposed to be running the country and when they are supposed to be positioning themselves for their next 30-second advertisement. The costs can be significant.\n\nLet’s imagine that Newsom had turned out to be right that the Abrego Garcia case was a loser for Democrats. He wasn’t—and, since then, he seems to have sharpened his thinking on taking a stand against immigration-related executive overreach—but just imagine. What if Democrats had stopped talking about Abrego Garcia and strategically backed away from supporting litigation in his case (and other similar cases)? Perhaps by refocusing the news cycle on the consequences of tariffs, they might have been able to knock 1 or 2 percent off Trump’s approval rating. What else might have happened?\n\nPicture it: In the absence of controversy, voters begin to perceive extrajudicial, permanent deportations as unobjectionable, routine, and effective. (It’s not uncommon for a wide majority of voters to initially agree that a given news event constitutes a major scandal, only to drift toward a 50–50 partisan split on the issue over time. There’s a very big example of this, in fact, that we’ll get to shortly.) Judges take the retreat as a signal that the Democratic Party doesn’t support their independence and authority. So do other civil society institutions that are under attack, like universities and law firms, who cut deals with the administration rather than confronting them in court. It’s a vicious circle of rats abandoning ship. Is it worth 1 or 2 points in the polls 18 months before an election? Particularly when Democrats themselves are on the list of future targets for harassment? There is a famous poem about this that, in its way, is about long-term strategy!\n\nIn similar fashion, Yglesias recently suggested that Episcopal Church volunteers should help the Trump administration resettle white South Africans—who are being flown to the U.S. at the behest of the executive branch’s many racial science conspiracy theorists while other refugees are denied entry indefinitely—in order to avoid raising the salience of immigration as a national issue.\n\nBut if you play dead for an entire presidential term while everyone in the U.S. who isn’t considered sufficiently white gets thrown into the back of a van, can you simply flip a switch to transform the country back into the world’s model of liberal democracy and cosmopolitan prosperity? Bear in mind, if the past is any guide, Democratic candidates will say in 2026 and 2028 that they need to win legislative majorities in order to defend constitutional government. That’s a goal so important, apparently, that no tactic is off the table in its service—even choosing not to defend constitutional government. What, as they say, are we doing here?\n\nAs polling writer G. Elliott Morris recently pointed out, the truly savvy politician stakes out positions that align with public opinion before voters get there, which is what Inslee did with impeachment and what Obama, but not Hillary Clinton, did with Iraq. (Inslee actually also did it with Iraq.) Morris illustrates nicely, with doodle-y hand-drawn arrows, why Democrats interested in pandering to the 2028 presidential electorate should be thinking about the entire potential range of beliefs the public might hold on a given issue then, not the isolated number that describes the belief it holds now.\n\n“The more you think long term, maybe you make some better decisions,” Inslee said. On immigration enforcement in particular, he said, “Trump has found some short-term ways it might be to his benefit, but as more and more soccer coaches and people in churches and people who work in retirement homes are shackled, you know, by masked officials and taken out of their communities, it’s not going to look so good, right?” The Democrats currently in Congress are not so sure.\n\nThis extends beyond matters of policy into what you might call the tilt of the playing field: Democrats recently lost voting leverage in the House of Representatives, for instance, because three elderly incumbents ran for reelection after being diagnosed with cancer, then won and died of cancer. Someone probably should have stopped them from doing that. During Biden’s term, the party failed to pass a bill protecting the vote-counting process and forbidding partisan gerrymandering because a decisive number of senators, concerned about their credentials as pragmatic moderates, felt that eliminating the filibuster to do so would be unpopular. Biden reportedly appointed centrist ex–Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland as attorney general because he felt that it would make for an admirable statement about Justice Department neutrality. Garland, in turn, refrained for two entire years from investigating Donald Trump’s role in Jan. 6 because he was allegedly worried about appearances.\n\nAppearances and “optics” come up a lot in reporting about how Biden and Garland approached Jan. 6—much more so than questions about what kind of person should serve as the chief national law enforcement officer in the wake of an insurrection, or what approach to the leader of the insurrection would best serve the interests of national stability. Biden and Garland, in other words, both approached their jobs as if they were strategists rather than public officials. So did Nancy Pelosi, on the night of Jan. 6 itself, when she reportedly shut down an immediate effort to impeach Trump because she thought that a slower, bipartisan effort would appear more responsible. In the end, with no Democrat having been willing to take one for the team to get the job done, the Supreme Court—stocked with partisan right-wing justices because the Republican Party had defied public polling and done some hardheaded realism with its seats—stepped in to issue a ruling about presidential immunity that foreclosed the possibility that Trump, whose favorability had gradually returned to its previous level as Jan. 6 faded from mind, would face trial before the election.\n\nIncredibly, this all led to Vice President Kamala Harris—the second-highest-ranking member of the team that had failed, in four years, to prosecute the person who’d tried to overturn the previous presidential election on live television—making a quote-unquote “closing argument” to voters about protecting democracy, at the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 rally. Vote for Democrats, she said, and they would do a thing or two about standing up for the rule of law. Maybe it tested well?\n\nA number of earnest ideas have been proposed for what Democrats could spend time and money on, besides the usual, to improve their reputation and long-term outlook. Some of those include rebuilding local news, organizing local chapters around service projects or social events, and supporting the growth of labor unions. In Nevada, the late Sen. Harry Reid put time and money into drastically expanding the on-the-ground presence of his state’s Democratic Party organization, creating notable turnout advantages. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has touted “deep canvassing,” which is just a gross way of saying talking to regular people even when there’s not an election coming up. Some political scientists think there’s evidence that it can work to change minds—and the amount of shoe leather that Zohran Mamdani and his volunteers expended seems to have contributed to his surprise victory in the New York City mayoral primary.\n\nA lot of these ideas are, in a way, the same idea: to raise the likelihood that someone encounters a Democrat in real life, while going about their day-to-day business as a human with friends, neighbors, and a family. As Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy put it in a recent interview with the Atlantic, the party needs to address the “spiritual crisis” of social isolation that has driven Americans toward right-wing politicians and influencers, except without the right-wing stuff.\n\nRight now, though, it’s all just talk. Actually doing it would require, well, a Jimmy Carter kind of commitment to building one house at a time. “I think we can all name the politicians who are hungriest and thinking the most about this,” said Daniel Schlozman, one of the co-authors of The Hollow Parties, when I called to ask him about the Democrats’ future. “And what I would say is, to all of them, ‘What are you doing?’ That is: ‘Are you thinking about getting organizations up, or are you doing it?’ My sense of Chris Murphy is he has some sense that people should be making more connections,” he said. “But it’s not that he’s going around Connecticut and saying, ‘We’re having a Murphy Picnic on Sunday.’ It’s that he’s going on podcasts and talking about the idea of the picnic.” (In fairness, Murphy’s staff points out that in addition to working on national organizing efforts, he just spent four days walking across his state meeting people and is helping put together a summer basketball league in Hartford.)\n\nMurphy critiques the center of the party from its left. On the flip side, there is moderate Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who recently sat for a long interview with the New York Times about the urgency of creating a new and presumably centrist Democratic “economic vision” in which she didn’t name a single specific idea for what such a vision would actually entail. It’s positioning-induced paralysis—being very clear on how you want to be perceived but not on what you need to do to get there.\n\nAs embarrassing as it sounds, to move forward, Democrats may need to look into their own hearts. “As far as shaping where I was from a policy standpoint, I didn’t find looking at polls terribly effective, because at least when I’ve run for public offices, it’s to try to make a difference, and that’s why I was doing it,” Inslee said. “If you don’t want to make a difference, why are you running? Let some other schmuck do it.” He also, for the record, feels that my take is a bit too cynical. “I think people would actually be surprised there’s more decisions made in Congress on what people believe is in the public interest than in venal self-interest,” he told me. “Many of those decisions are wrong. But!”\n\nIn the meantime, money continues to flow to consultants and strategists. The Times reported that a number of donors and operatives are putting together projects, some with anticipated budgets in the tens of millions of dollars, to fund and amplify influencers and podcasters—a belated top-down effort to adjust to the ways the national “narrative” is now created. (One of the people quoted in the article works for a super PAC, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried’s mother, that Bankman-Fried allegedly used to circumvent campaign-finance laws.) On June 3, Politico reported that a well-connected operative named Adam Jentleson will be launching a “messaging hub” called Searchlight, which will advocate for the adoption of “popular positions.” Noted a perceptive anonymous source: “We already have a bunch of entities who do that.”\n\nIronically, what the party could probably use most is a version of Trump who works for good rather than evil: someone who is attentive to the public mood but has a permanent and easily communicated agenda, who gets people off their butts at the state and local level, and who uses leverage to enforce the advancement of long-term goals even when it is not in the immediate interest of their personal “optics.” (This could also be a group of people, in the strong-party tradition.)\n\nWhat it might not need is more public opinion data and advice about how to find the sweet spot in the middle of it. If Democrats took a five-year sabbatical from polling and message testing, how much insight would the world really be deprived of? Everyone knows what polls say: Kitchen-table issues are good for Democrats, surges in crime and undocumented immigration are bad for Democrats, gender/race stuff is in the middle depending on what’s in the news, and it is always important to work across the aisle. One thing that seems to be forgotten by the crusading centrists citing current polls to decry the party’s 2018–20 leftward shift on race, immigration, and sexual identity issues, in fact, is that the polls were also shifting leftward at the time. In 2017 only one-fifth of the country believed that gender transitions constituted a “mental illness,” while the majority of Americans said that the country should do more to protect transgender rights and that they would welcome and support a friend who “came out” as trans. Picking a lane and sticking to it is the kind of thing that can prevent exuberant leftist excess too.\n\nPublic opinion can be fluid; a party that wants to succeed in the long term—and especially one that bears the burden, in a two-party system, of maintaining a functional country—needs to have priorities besides winning the next election. With these truths in mind, Democrats have a choice. They could put their heads together to make an educated guess about what the country might look like, think like, and need out of its government in 2028, then conduct themselves accordingly for the next three years. Or they could spend several hundred million dollars to find out again that the middle class likes the phrase “lift up the middle class.” Which do you think they’re more likely to choose?","summary":"During the Reagan revolution, Democrats settled on a new way to win—and it’s destroying them now.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/07/donald-trump-news-democrats-elections-strategist-brain.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/5f4b486a-5334-4729-bdad-babc0118805a.jpeg?crop=2700%2C1800%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 09:40:00","author":"Ben Mathis-Lilley","authors":["Ben Mathis-Lilley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.141},{"id":340072420,"title":"The View star's secret meltdowns and 'backstage tears' revealed in stunning confession on air","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jul 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe View star's secret meltdowns and 'backstage tears' revealed in stunning confession on air\n\n Have YOU got a story?

Griffin said with a laugh, adding facetiously, 'Have you done this job?'\n\n Humiliating Kamala Harris flub on The View that forced aides to beg hosts for a second chance \nGriffin added that her revelation reminded her of a meme from The Simpsons which she showed to the crowd, where Bart Simpson is showing his friend Milhouse where he goes to cry, adding, 'That's every corner of this building.'\nJoy Behar then asked, 'What did you cry about? Give me an example,' as Griffin admitted, 'This is a very hard job to do, and I, oftentimes, have the only opinion that's different at a table of five people.'\nSara Haines, 47, chimed in and said, 'Let me clarify, it's not just a Gen Z problem,' as Griffin joked that Haines has 'cried on air.'\n'Gen Z and maybe the generation before are talking about it because they can call it something. For years and decades and millenia, we have have all channeled it into other places,' Haines added.\nHaines admitted she does cry at work, and when Hostin asked what she cries about, Haines admitted, 'Every breakup I've ever went through. I try to hide it as well, but I don't hide in bathrooms because I hate bathrooms.'\n'Where I camped out was I took a coffee run with a girlfriend and come back very puffy,' Haines admitted.\n\n'I cry at work but I hide it, so my bosses will never know,' Griffin said, which clearly stunned Hostin, who asked, 'You cry at work?'\n\nGriffin added that her revelation reminded her of a meme from The Simpsons which she showed to the crowd, where Bart Simpson is showing his friend Milhouse where he goes to cry, adding, 'That's every corner of this building.'\n\nSara Haines, 47, chimed in and said, 'Let me clarify, it's not just a Gen Z problem,' as Griffin joked that Haines has 'cried on air.'\n\nGoldberg chimed in and said, 'The thing that shocks me, it's like, there is nothing that people should be able to do to you to make you cry, because let us support you, because nobody should be crying at this job, nobody,' as the audience applauded\nGriffin then added, 'I would like to state, for the record, this is a great job, and every time I have cried, (producer) Brian (Teta) gives great hugs.'\nGoldberg chimed in and said, 'The thing that shocks me, it's like, there is nothing that people should be able to do to you to make you cry, because let us support you, because nobody should be crying at this job, nobody,' as the audience applauded.\nGriffin joined The View as a permanent host in 2022, after making several guest-hosting appearances in 2021 and 2022.\nShe previously served as the Press Secretary for Vice President Mike Pence, Press Secretary of the Department of Defense and the White House Director of Strategic Communications during the first Donald Trump administration.\nWhoopi GoldbergThe View\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe View star's secret meltdowns and 'backstage tears' revealed in stunning confession on air\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

It's like $32 to maybe $35 million.\"\n\nThe \"advertising\" in question referenced reporting from Fox Business’ Charlie Gasparino on David’s alleged private agreement to run PSAs supporting Trump-backed causes.Outspoken CriticsTrump further fueled concerns by gushing over his \"friend\" Larry, saying: \"I think he's going to run CBS really well, and I think he's making a good deal to buy it. I think he's great.\"\n\nHe also called David \"a fantastic young man.\"\n\nGiven the president's praise of the Ellises, outspoken Trump critics Colbert and Stewart could be on the chopping block if the takeover goes through. \n\nStewart recently called out the merger mess during an appearance on Bill Simmons' podcast, saying: \"What you’re seeing now is all must pay tribute to the kin.\"The Daily Show host also addressed his future with Paramount, saying: \"I’m in a spot where I can do (The Daily Show) on Monday until the company is bought out by people that don’t want anything to do with The Daily Show.\"\n\nDavid's merger has been in the works since 2023, when former Paramount CEO Bob Bakish was shopping potential mergers with the likes of Warner Bros. Discovery before catching Skydance’s attention. \n\nBut Shari Redstone, who serves as the controlling shareholder of the network, was apprehensive about the merger from the start. \n\nSkydance initially offered $2billion in cash and stock, which was laughed at, and Bakish was ousted in April 2024 over his disagreement with Redstone. Months later, in July, an agreement with Skydance was reached that would effectively end the Redstone family’s longstanding control over Paramount. \n\nThe tech billionaire’s son has laid out a plan to increase AI-assisted production at the network, as well as refine their streaming service Paramount+.","summary":"The second extension of the Skydance Media merger follows Paramount’s $16million settlement with Donald Trump.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-david-ellis-paramount-skydance-merger/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/8BPGjV8fF/0x0/jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbertas-jobs-at-risk-amid-paramount-merger-1752105387080.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:30:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.207},{"id":340035908,"title":"It’s crazy to be reminded of how seismic Caitlin Clark’s impact on sports is — both the good and the incredibly ugly","text":"On the night of April 19, 2024, I argued with one of my childhood guy friends. It was a few days after Caitlin Clark had been drafted first overall by the Indiana Fever.\n\nHe predicted her star would wane after entering the WNBA. Or more specifically he said: “no one will give a f—k about Clark in a year.”\n\nI told him he had rocks in his head, as another friend watching made a note in his calendar.\n\nOn April 19, that other friend sent us both a reminder to check in on our debate, a year on. I smugly proclaimed victory.\n\nEveryone still gave a f—k about Caitlin Clark: her legions of fans, the city of Indianapolis, where Clarkmania brought in an estimated $36 million, and especially her haters. Even Shane Gillis recently told Flagrant podcast that he was “starstruck” when Clark came to his show in Indiana.\n\nA year on, the basketball world is still spinning on her axis and she’s transformed the landscape of women’s athletics — the way Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods did in their respective sports.\n\nAll the proof is in Christine Brennan’s new book, “On Her Game” which chronicles the rise of Clark from an Iowa-grown phenom to WNBA megastar.\n\nThe veteran sportswriter was drawn to the project because Clark continuously grabbed national headlines, even more than her male peers. In fact, she notes that the women’s 2024 NCAA final pitting Iowa against South Carolina drew four million more viewers than the men’s Final the next night.\n\n“That’s a sentence I never thought I would write. Women’s college basketball being more popular than men’s college basketball? In 21st-century America? How was that possible?” wrote Brennen. “The answer was Clark.”\n\nShe added that there was “so much to tell.” Indeed, it is a whiplash inducing book.\n\nIt’s pretty insane to recap just how much happened to Clark in the span of a year. But also, how much Clark happened to us.\n\nHer impact was immediate. When she arrived in May, the league, which had previously flown commercial, were now given charter flights and many teams moved their Fever match ups to bigger arenas to accommodate the demand when Clark came to town.\n\nBrennan’s book underscores just how uniquely equipped this confident 22-year-old was for this moment. \n\nThe WNBA, however, was not.\n\nBrennan noted that the media covering the league was insular and protective of its status quo, which was majority black, LBGT and hyper focused on social justice.\n\n“When a league is small and often ignored, as the WNBA has been, there can be inclination among some members of the media to want to fight for it and even reluctance to let outsiders in.\n\n“Into this landed Caitlin Clark, a white, straight 22-year-old woman” who hadn’t played a single possession, but was already the face of the league, wrote Brennan.\n\n“To say people were conflicted about it would be an understatement.”\n\nVeteran Diana Taurasi famously told Scott Van Pelt in March of 2024, “reality is coming” for Clark. (By September, Van Pelt noted that Taurasi was wrong and that Clark, who would win rookie of the year and led her team to the playoffs, “was the reality”).\n\nClark faced many inhospitable veterans. In June, Chicago Sky’s Chennedy Carter hip checked Clark in an outrageous foul that was far from a basketball play.\n\nOn Threads, Carter wrote of Clark, “beside three-point shooting what does she bring to the table man?”\n\nClark took the high road, saying Carter didn’t owe her a public apology. “No, basketball is competitive. I get it.”\n\nThen came her Olympic snub last summer, which Brennan saw as malpractice.\n\n“How did all those skilled basketball minds on the committee miss how good Clark already was — and how well she would be playing by the Olympic break? The answer was becoming clearer by the day: because they wanted to.”\n\nBut she was also expected to answer for society’s ills and maybe some nasty things fans of her said on social media — despite loads of ugly race-based insults thrown her way.\n\nIn mid-June, Clark was asked by a reporter about people using her name to push agendas.\n\n“People can talk about what they want to talk about… I’m just here to play basketball,” she said, adding she could not control others.\n\nConnecticut Sun’s Dijonai Carrington tweeted, “Dawg. How one can not be bothered by their name being used to justify racism, bigotry, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia & the intersectionality of them all is nuts.”\n\nClark handled a follow up deftly, but a pile on ensued. It showed that the league could be unserious, making hoops an afterthought.\n\nThen in September, Clark caused another uproar by simply liking Taylor Swift’s Instagram endorsement of Kamala Harris.\n\nIn December, she was named Time Athlete of the Year. The next month, a man was arrested for stalking her.\n\nThe book isn’t full of bombshells, but Brennan is unsparing in her criticism of the league being caught flat-footed by Clark.\n\nShe called out WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert who during a “60 Minutes” piece on Clark and the league, refused to give the star sole credit for its insane growth.\n\nReporter Jon Wertheim pointed out that when she is asked about Clark, she “brings up other rookies as well.”\n\n“No league is ever about one player,” she responded.\n\nBrennan wrote, “By practically any measure, Clark was that one person.”","summary":" Clark has transformed the landscape of women’s athletics — the way Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods did in their respective sports.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/opinion/new-book-how-seismic-caitlin-clarks-impact-on-sports-is/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-p9p3twrm9-1752104453810.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752090074&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/x98fgzzJ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-09 23:41:17","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.197},{"id":340032364,"title":"Revealed: The Surprising Truth Behind the Amusing Exchange Between Trump and Obama at Jimmy Carter’s Funeral","text":"THE truth behind President Donald Trump and rival Barack Obama’s cheery conversation at Jimmy Carter’s funeral has been unveiled in a new book.\n\nLeading journalists have unveiled what had Obama chuckling in the church pews, following interviews with over 350 individuals connected to the intense 2024 presidential election.\n\nOn January 9, after Trump decisively overcame opponent Kamala Harris, all leaders except Michelle Obama set aside political differences to participate in Carter’s funeral.\n\nAmericans were captivated by images from the event showing Obama sharing a broad smile while talking with Trump, who was on the verge of being inaugurated.\n\nThe pair was seated beside each other for the proceedings while stone-faced Harris sat coldly behind them.\n\nIt was far different from 2018, when Melania Trump sat in between the two rivals for George H. W. Bush’s funeral after the reality TV star had defeated Hillary Clinton.\n\nNow, in the book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, sources have revealed that Trump broke a smile out of his rival by inviting him to play golf at one of his elite clubs.\n\nTrump had Obama in stiches as he was “enticing him with descriptions of Trump’s courses around the world,” the passage reads, according to Axios.\n\nAnd this wasn’t the only time that the president spoke about his favorite sport with his political rivals, according to authors Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf.\n\nThe three journalists, who covered the campaign together for the Washington Post, spoke with hundreds of sources who gave a behind-the-scenes look at how Harris and Biden conceded to Trump.\n\nThey wrote that Trump also had a friendly chat with Biden when the incumbant congratulated his arch nemesis on his win and invited him to visit the White House.\n\n“In another life, we would be friends and go golfing,” Trump said, according to the reporters.\n\nHARRIS’ STEP DOWN\n\nMeanwhile, Harris and Trump had a much icier conversation filled with technical difficulties when she admitted defeat.\n\nThe vice president’s aides had a lot of difficulty merging their calls, and resulted to holding two phones on speaker close together so everyone could speak.\n\nIn the midst of the fumbling, Trump joked “Phone service isn’t what it used to be,” according to the book.\n\nThe Republican leader called Harris a “tough cookie” and complimented her husband Douglas Emhoff.\n\nHe failed to compliement her campaign and only said, “she’d given him a run for his money.”\n\nThe book says, “Even her aides described him as gracious.”\n\nMeanwhile, Harris was described as “professional but not warm” and told her rival that the “country was too divided” and that “she hoped he would be a president for all Americans.”\n\nBIDEN OPENS UP ON TRUMP WIN\n\nTwo months after Biden stepped down from the White House, Pager gave him a call and the two had a brief chat.\n\nThe reporter was asking him to sit down for an interview for the book when the former president said he had a “very negative” view of Trump’s second term.\n\n“I don’t see anything he’s done as productive,” Biden said, according to the authors.\n\nWhen quizzed on whether he regretted not stepping down earlier, Biden said, “No, not now.

Tim Walz as her running mate, a decision widely panned by pundits in retrospect.\n\n“2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,” released Tuesday by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, described a vetting process that came down to three finalists: Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nAll three candidates did a final interview with Harris at her residence, the book explains, adding that when asked what they wanted to drink, Shapiro and Kelly chose water while Walz chose Diet Mountain Dew.\n\nAppeal with rural voters was a top priority for the Harris ticket and the book states that Harris’s advisors felt that Walz was the best candidate to do that.\n\n“Pelosi privately pushed for him too, because she’d worked with him in Congress,” the book said about the former House speaker. “The pitch for Walz was straightforward: He could appeal to white voters across the Blue Wall states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) and hopefully help Harris with male voters. He’d never lost election.”\n\nWhile most political experts felt Shapiro, governor of a key swing state, was the most logical choice, the book states that the interview with Harris and Shapiro “revealed the two were not a perfect match.”\n\n“He came across as overly ambitious, pushing Harris to define what his role would be. He also conceded it would not be natural for him to serve as someone’s number two, leaving Harris with a bad impression,” the book states.\n\nConversely, the authors explain that Walz was “deferential” while “showing no interest in himself” and “flatly denied any interest in running for president.”\n\n“He went so far as to proactively volunteer reasons why she might not want to pick him,” the book says. “In his interview that Friday, he said he had never used a teleprompter before. On Sunday, he told Harris, ‘I would understand if you went with someone else because I’m really nervous about the debate, and I don’t think I’ll do well.’ Still, the vetting team did not fully appreciate his tendency to misspeak, his folksiness sometimes tipping into factual imprecision.”\n\nWalz would ultimately draw intense scrutiny on the campaign trail for his “folksiness” with a series of blunders, including his characterization of his military service and a claim he was present at the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nThe book says Harris “struggled” deciding between Shapiro and Walz, believing that she had a better “rapport” with Walz but understood the importance of Pennsylvania. Harris’ team, according to the book, told her that polling did not offer a clear answer as to which of the two candidates would help the ticket more.\n\n“There was no empirical evidence that Shapiro would deliver Pennsylvania and with it the White House,” the book said.\n\nAs Shapiro was being considered, many pundits speculated that his staunch support of Israel could be an issue given the progressive wing of the Democratic Party being vocally pro-Palestinian, resulting in protests, sometimes violent, across the country after Oct. 7.\n\nThe book said the Harris campaign was aware of that issue.\n\n“Much of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party declared war on Shapiro, largely because of his support of Israel,” the book said. “Some Shapiro allies saw the criticism as deeply unfair and borderline antisemitic, since the governor was an observant Jew, but his positions on the Palestinian conflict broadly aligned with the Biden administration and the other vice presidential contenders. The lawyers vetting Shapiro did flag some comments they viewed as more incendiary, particularly as it related to pro- Palestinian protests on college campuses after the October 7 attacks.”\n\n“One that caught their attention was his commentary on CNN from April: ‘We have to query whether or not we would tolerate this, if this were people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia, making comments about people who are African American in our communities.’”\n\nUltimately, the book says Harris “went with her gut” and chose Walz believing he was the “better fit” in a decision her staff was “unanimously behind.”\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Walz’s office and Shapiro’s office declined to comment.\n\nAfter losing every battleground state and ultimately the presidency to Donald Trump, critics were quick to judge the Walz pick as a misstep by Harris.\n\n“The choice of Walz was only one of many disastrous mistakes but symptomatic of one larger problem – the Democratic Party leadership is too scared to say no to the hard-left progressive wing of the party,” Julian Epstein, longtime Democratic operative and former chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital shortly after the election.\n\nRob Bluey, president and executive editor of The Daily Signal, told Fox News Digital in November that Harris picking Walz “proved to be a disastrous decision that doomed Kamala Harris from the moment she made it.”\n\n“Not only was Walz ill-prepared for the national spotlight and media scrutiny, but Harris passed over several better options,” Bluey said. “Given how little Americans knew about Harris or her policy positions, they were right to question her judgment on this big decision.”","summary":"The new book says that former Speaker Pelosi 'privately pushed' for Walz.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/media/harris-went-with-her-gut-on-decision-to-pick-walz-as-her-running-mate-over-shapiro-book/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-njlb91chi-1752099789496.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752085452&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 22:25:50","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":340032668,"title":"Will Zohran Mamdani Become the Democrat Party’s Trump?","text":"Americans’ trust in the corporate media has cratered. And with good reason: After decades of deception and distortion—considering its uncritical coverage of the wars in the Middle East, its peddling of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative, its inconsistent reporting on COVID-19, its selective ignorance during the 2020 election, and its efforts to conceal President Biden’s cognitive decline—the corporate press has earned every ounce of the public’s suspicion.\n\nNow, Americans are tuning out the noise and tuning in to new voices to stay informed. UnHerd Washington Correspondent Emily Jashinsky has emerged as one of those voices. She joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss her new show with Megyn Kelly’s MK Media, “After Party with Emily Jashinsky,” the fallout from President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” and whether or not Zohran Mamdani represents the future of the national Democrat Party.\n\n“I’m very weirdly optimistic,” Jashinsky said of the alternative media’s rise. “I feel so strange about this because one of the reasons I got into media is because I’ve always been obsessed with media and I’ve always been so pessimistic. But the last, I don’t know, year or two, I’ve started to feel optimistic about media, not because there aren’t still very powerful bad actors, not because some of the new actors aren’t also bad, but because the demand for transparency from the audience, I think, is pushing us in at least a better direction.”\n\nJashinsky told The Daily Signal that the age of new media will be dominated by journalists who are able to “establish trust with [their] audience and to best establish transparency.” Jashinsky cited how “60 Minutes” selectively edited the interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee. “People were demanding the transcript, and I think that’s the way people like us, our age and younger, want to consume news.”\n\n“They really don’t want it to look or feel edited,” Jashinsky added. “There’s probably always going to be some editing, but they want stuff that’s live. We want stuff that’s transparent.”\n\nThe same can be said of alternative media’s class of commentators like Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson. “I think we’re in the golden age of reported commentary,” Jashinsky said. On digital shows and podcasts, “you’re able to do reported commentary on the fly in a way that, I think, is even more authentic and in a way that really resonates.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s ability to tap into the independent media ecosystem and the public’s craving for authenticity helped build a political coalition that propelled him back to the White House. \n\nThe breadth of that coalition, however, is both a blessing and a curse as the variety of interests within Trump’s camp compete for the president’s ear as he tries to act on his campaign promises. On July 4, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill, the massive budget reconciliation package that delivered on many of those promises, into law. \n\n”When you have very narrow margins in the House and a very narrow margin in the Senate, you end up absolutely having to keep a coalition together that includes Chip Roy and either Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins,” Jashinsky said. That is no easy task. “What they need to do is get Chip Roy to a place where he is sufficiently satisfied, and they need to get Lisa Murkowski to a place where she’s sufficiently satisfied,” she explained. “In order to do that, both of those things are necessarily going to mean swallowing a very bitter pill, and it was always going to be the case.\n\n“I think that’s why Trump started, from the very beginning of the process, by branding this as the one big beautiful bill because he knew that tax cuts expire at the end of the year,” the journalist added. “Republicans were facing the choice of either do a ugly reconciliation bill or let taxes go up. Obviously, they’re going to decide with an ugly reconciliation bill.”\n\n“That’s something I think Elon Musk missed,” Jashinsky said of the feud between Trump and Musk that started during the budget reconciliation negotiations. “I think Elon Musk has been shockingly naive throughout this process, and I do really think that it’s naive thinking that you can just kind of come into Washington and convince the Republican Party that has these narrow margins that they have to do some type of generational action to take on government spending when the only way to pass legislation and get it to the president’s desk is, again, to please either a Murkowski or Collins and the moderates while also pleasing the Chip Roys and the Freedom Caucus guys.”\n\n“It was never gonna happen,” Jashinksy said.\n\nNevertheless, Trump was able to accomplish much more of his agenda in this budget reconciliation package than budget reconciliation packages from his first term. The One Big Beautiful Bill not only extended and made permanent tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act but also procured billions to secure the border, deport millions of illegal migrants, and revitalize the military.\n\nSome Democrats, however, are plotting the party’s comeback—New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani among them. Mamdani is officially infamous, constantly drawing ire from the long-time New Yorker who now lives in D.C. at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and courting support from some of the nation’s top Democrats. Will Democrats remake the party in Mamdani’s image?\n\nPotentially, Jashinsky said, but Mamdani’s coalition in New York might be much more fragile than it seems, and his victory in the Democrat primary for mayor might have more to do with New Yorker’s hatred for his opponent, disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. To maintain his coalition, Mamdani needs to thread the needle. \n\n“You have to bring the progressives in with the cultural libertarians, and then you need to bring them in with the … upwardly mobile, affluent, educated, higher income people,” Jashinsky explained. The catch? To earn the support of New York’s cocktail party class, “you do have to do some of the cultural signaling, which is very interesting. And that’s what puts off the [cultural libertarians].”\n\n“I think the likeliest case scenario is that Mamdani has a somewhat embarrassing defeat at the hands of Eric Adams, another terrible candidate, and that sort of chills the fever for him nationwide, but who knows,” Jashinsky told The Daily Signal. Certainly, stranger things have happened.","summary":"Americans’ trust in the corporate media has cratered.

And when she first tweeted it out, Tafoya used it as an opportunity to promote her podcast, which supposed flight attendant had praised as “wonderful.”\n\n“While on a flight to NYC to appear on @Gutfeldfox I was handed this note by a flight attendant. I won’t reveal the person’s name, but this made my day, to say the very least!!!!! Maybe this will inspire you to SUBSCRIBE,” Tafoya noted in May 2023, making sure to highlight her appearance on Fox News host Greg Gutfeld’s panel show.\n\nAs soon as it was revealed that Tafoya had reused the exact same note in an effort to juice social media engagement – her post on X now contains a Community Note linking back to the original photo – the mockery over the MAGA commentator’s stunt came flooding right in.\n\nIt also led many critics to express doubt that the letter was ever written by a star-struck flight attendant in the first place.\n\n“You should at least delete the old one before you tell the same totally real story again. At least you used a slightly different photo,” attorney Damin Toell quipped, acknowledging that Tafoya had posted an image of the letter from another angle.\n\n“Michelle, you lying **** of a stunt queen. At least get a new letter!” film critic John Rocha tweeted. “Sure feels like you wrote it yourself if you could produce the exact same letter and handwriting in 2023 AND 2025. Pulling a William Hurt in Broadcast News with your manufactured emotion here.”\n\n“This did not happen when you posted it in 2023 and it did not happen today. No one wants to subscribe to your dumb s***,” internet personality Tony Posnanski snarked.\n\nAmid the onslaught of online ridicule over her clout-chasing reposting of the fawning in-flight letter, Tafoya has done what many others before her have tried when they’ve become the main character on social media – tweet through it.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, she posted a short clip captioned “Why Communism Fails Every Time,” only to find that the majority of respondents were still poking fun at her for using a recycled photo. One social media user also flagged one of Tafoya’s tweets from last year in which she blasted Kamala Harris’ campaign for posting a clip of a four-year-old JD Vance interview.\n\n“They are lying and they don't care that they are lying,” she noted at the time.\n\nAs of publication, Tafoya has yet to publicly address or acknowledge the repeated posting of the note. The Independent has reached out to Tafoya’s representatives for comment.","summary":"‘You should at least delete the old one before you tell the same totally real story again,’ one critic snarked in response to her tweet.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/michele-tafoya-letter-lie-ex-nfl-reporter-b2786007.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/09/20/56/Screenshot-Capture-2025-07-09-15-53-44.png?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 21:35:05","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":340010440,"title":"Alyssa Farah Griffin reveals she’s broken down in tears multiple times from stress as lone conservative on ‘The View’","text":"“The View” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin revealed on Wednesday that she has cried over stress and anxiety during her time on the show multiple times as the lone conservative panelist. \n\n“I cry at work, but I hide it, my bosses will never know,” Griffin said as fellow co-host Sunny Hostin appeared surprised.\n\nThe co-hosts discussed anxiety and stress levels among Gen Z and a Vice article that said they were dealing with it by spending time in the restroom, which the article calls “bathroom camping.”\n\n“I have cried at this job at least half a dozen times,” Griffin continued.\n\nCo-host Joy Behar asked what Griffin cried about, demanding an example. \n\n“This is a very hard job to do, and I oftentimes have the only opinion that’s different at a table of five people,” Griffin said, laughing. \n\nThe conservative host previously worked in President Donald Trump’s White House towards the end of his first term but exited the administration and ultimately became a fierce critic of her former employer, replacing Meghan McCain as the token conservative chair. \n\nGriffin has been far less likely to have the on-air spats that marked McCain’s time, however. \n\nShe joined her five co-hosts in voting for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. \n\nOne of the fellow hosts was Ana Navarro, who is a Republican that now almost soley supports Democrats.\n\n“I would like to state, for the record, this is a great job and every time I’ve cried, Brian gives great hugs,” Griffin added, referring to the show’s producer, Brian Teta.\n\nWhile Griffin and the co-hosts clash frequently on the show, the conservative co-host also often agrees with her liberal counterparts.\n\n“The thing that shocks me, for me, is there is nothing that people should be able to do to you to make you cry,” co-host Whoopi Goldberg said.\n\n“Let us support you, because nobody should be crying at this job.

The African-American vote is his newest vote, and that’s probably going to be the first to go,” Scott Tranter, the director of data science for Decision Desk, told The Hill. \n\nThe findings are in contrast to the president’s surprising gains with voters of color during the 2024 race, where Trump won 15 percent of Black voters, up from 8 percent in 2020, and drew nearly even with Kamala Harris among Hispanic voters.\n\nThe decline in support from Black voters could have a variety of causes.\n\nMany 2024 voters were inspired to cast their choice based on economic conditions and the record inflation under the Biden administration. \n\nSo far, the Trump presidency has been marked with a sense of economic uncertainty and numerous revised and suspended deadlines for global tariffs.\n\nTrump’s recently signed Big, Beautiful Bill spending package could be a mixed bag economically for Black voters, cutting taxes for the wealthy and likely causing millions to be ineligible for Medicaid, a low-income government health plan that disproportionately serves Black people.\n\nThe Trump administration has also sought to end diversity and inclusion programs and funding across the federal government, ended race-conscious affirmative action at the US Naval Academy, scrubbed government websites and libraries of materials mentioning prominent Black figures in history, and renamed military bases for Confederate soldiers who fought to defend slavery in the U.S. Civil War, defending the move as “important for morale.”","summary":"Despite brief post-election bounce, Trump has struggled throughout term to get majority approval from Black voters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-black-voter-approval-rating-b2785963.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/09/01/Trump_US_Israel_56391.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/utMXM5v2-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-09 20:51:01","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":339995020,"title":"Trump denies he was unaware of Ukraine weapons pause day after admitting he didn’t know who ordered it","text":"Associated Press VideosTrump won't say who ordered the pause in weapons deliveries to Ukraine last weekPresident Donald Trump's decision to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine reversed a pause in weapons deliveries announced by Pentagon officials last week.

Mamdani wrote 32 articles for the Bowdoin Orient during his four years studying at Maine’s presitigous Bowdoin College from 2010 to 2014, including an article his senior year promoting an academic boycott of Israel. \"This academic and cultural boycott aims to bring under scrutiny the actions of the Israeli government and to put pressure on Israeli institutions to end the oppressive occupation and racist policies within both Israel and occupied Palestine,\" wrote Mamdani, who co-founded his college’s Students for Justice in Palestine organization. Students for Justice in Palestine has become one of the biggest drivers of anti-Israel protests on college campuses since the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, with some going so far as to celebrate the attack. THE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO BLOCK FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NEW YORK Mamdani was taking issue in his article with Bowdoin College’s president, Barry Mills, opposing the boycott. \"Lastly, Mills regrettably makes no mention of Palestinians or Palestine,\" Mamdani wrote. \"The call for the boycott comes in response to more than 60 years of Israeli colonial occupation of Palestine. When Mills speaks of the ‘free exchange of knowledge, ideas, and research, and open discourse’ in academia, he does so while privileging partnerships with Israeli institutions over basic freedoms for Palestinians, including the rights to food, water, shelter and education, which many Palestinians are denied under Israeli rule.\" In a 2013 op-ed, Mamdani responded to a White student who took issue with criticism of the school’s editorial page being too White by accusing him of holding \"white privilege.\" \"White males are privileged in their near-to-exclusive featuring as figures of authority in print, on television and around us in our daily realities,\" Mamdani wrote. \"We, the consumers of these media, internalize this and so believe in the innate authority of a white male’s argument and the need for its publication. So, white privilege is both a structural and an individual phenomenon, the former propelling the latter. Therefore, even when the individual is silent, the structures continue to exist and frame our society through their existence.\" MAMDANI CAMP SILENT WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CALLS TO 'RADICALIZE' HIGH SCHOOLERS, 'DISMANTLE' US Mamdani said the \"pervasive male whiteness\" of the school’s opinion pages \"builds on the sadly still-present white male monopolization of both discourse and understanding.\" Mamdani explained, \"While whiteness is not homogenous, white privilege is. This privilege is clear in not having to face institutional racism in access to housing subsidies, college grants, financial institutions, or civil rights. It allows a white person to universalize his own experiences. It restricts society’s ability to understand its flaws, and projects a false image of meritocracy upon a nation built on institutional racism.\" In another post, titled \"Bearded in Cairo,\" Mamdani discussed his time studying abroad in Egypt as the Muslim Brotherhood was violently toppling President Morsi’s regime. He explained that before arriving he had grown a beard \"mostly as a symbolic middle finger\" to the stereotype that \"pervades America\" that brown individuals with beards are a \"terrorist.\" Mamdani discussed privilege again, saying that he had \"arrived in a society where privilege was a different color.\" \"Gone was the image of the white Christian male that I had grown accustomed to, and in its place was a darker, more familiar picture – ---one that, for the first time, I fit: brown skin, black hair, and a Muslim name,\" Mamdani wrote. \"With the right clothing, some took me for an Egyptian and most thought I was Syrian – either identity allowed me unrestricted access to exploring Cairo.\" In a 2014 article titled \"On the 50th anniversary of MLK’s visit to campus, let's acknowledge what we still need to achieve,\" Mamdani lamented that his school, which doubled its diversity student population over the previous 13 years, was still behind where it should be. He wrote that the school had prematurely achieved a \"satisfaction with the level of diversity.\" \"I have been forced to personally grapple with these inconsistencies during my time here,\" Mamdani wrote. RESURFACED MAMDANI PHOTO SPARKS SOCIAL MEDIA FIRESTORM, OUTRAGE FROM KEY VOTING BLOC: 'SHAMEFUL' \"I sit in class not knowing whether to correct everyone’s mispronunciation of an Indian woman’s name. I usually do, but today I’m tired. I’m tired of being one of a few non-white students in a classroom, if not the only one. I bring up race in discussions only to see the thought flicker in my peers eyes and on their tongues. They sigh without a sound. I’ve brought up race again. I’ve sidetracked the discussion. I’ve chosen to make an issue out of it.\" In the same post, Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to Indian parents, outlined his struggles feeling uncomfortable being a non-white student. \"I grow a beard only to be called a terrorist,\" Mamdani wrote. \"I pronounce the ‘h’ in my name only to hear muffled laughs. Clothing becomes exotic once it clads my body. Cotton shirts are called dashikis and sandals ethnic.\" Mamdani continued, \"While I am now comfortable in my own skin, I can remember wishing for whiteness my first year when I thought certain types of girls were impossible to talk to due to my skin being more kiwi than peach. Months later, I remember thinking that attraction might only be possible when a girl had ‘a thing for brown guys.’\" Mamdani explained that he has found \"solidarity\" with some students on campus but that \"still, too few people acknowledge that race is an issue on our campus, or that it has ever been one.\" \"But if people say they are color blind, do they even see me?\" Mamdani wrote. Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mamdani burst onto the national political scene last month when he won a surprising victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary despite facing criticism for his far-left policies, which included city-run grocery stores, defunding police, safe injection sites and raising the minimum wage to $30. Mamdani's victory has sparked a civil war of sorts within the Democratic Party between those pushing to moderate since VP Kamala Harris's defeat in November and those embracing a progressive shift toward the mold of Rep. Alexandria-Cortez, D-N.Y., who endorsed Mamdani. Mamdani, thanks to his primary victory, is the clear frontrunner in the general election in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin.

Said Sharbini left, citing ‘the polarized and contentious climate in the state House.’ Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis said the job was emotionally and physically tough when she recently split. But these spoiled kids can have anything they want. They’re not squabbling with Republicans. Republicans aren’t even in the equation. Republicans are hiding in the janitor’s closet hoping not to be found and slapped around. These Democrats are backbiting fellow Democrats. The ‘sensationalistic and vitriolic’ unhealthy environment is amongst themselves. The polarization and emotional toll isn’t coming from the feckless Republicans. Team Left is beginning to eat their own. More than 20% of our legislators were never voted into office in the first place. They were appointed to fill vacancies of those who wanted to get out.”\n\nAbsolute Democrat control in the state that used to swing back and forth regularly between Democrat and Republican majorities developed two decades ago. That was when, according to a report from American Majority, that the “Gang of Four” billionaires and lowly multi-millionaires essentially bought the state government.\n\nRutt Bridges, now-Gov. Jared Polis, Tim Gill and Pat Stryker, all pushing the extremes of the leftist agenda, conspired to use their wealth to organize a new Democrat party, “from policy generation to leadership recruiting, coalition building to grassroots activation.”\n\nStryker is a billionaire heiress to a medical tech fortune, and she donated $1.5 million in support of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 campaign; Gill started Quark, Bridges once said he had “more money than I could spend,” and Polis took advantage of early dot-com miscalculations, selling online rights to his parents Blue Mountain Arts greeting card slogans to another company for hundreds of millions of dollars, which then collapsed, and he bought them back at a fraction of the original price.\n\nHe spent $1 million to his political start, a seat on the Colorado Board of Education which is an unpaid, part-time time. His GOP opponent raised $10,000, and, reports said, had offered to drop out if Polis has split the difference and given him $500,000.\n\nThe report noted what the “Gang” did was flood races with money that no local Republican candidate could hope to compete with, using “dozens” of 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4) and 527 organizations that they personally funded.\n\nThe result? “The Democrat Party didn’t win Colorado: the progressive left did. They simply used the Democrat Party as a vehicle by which to achieve their political ends.”\n\nSince then, there’s been a long list of Democrat governors. The state House and Senate have near veto-proof Democrat majorities. The state’s top officials are all Democrats.\n\nThe agenda has been made clear by their goals and actions.\n\nAn all-Democrat state Supreme Court tried to remove President Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot, only to be reprimanded by the U.S. Supreme Court. The state repeatedly has launched attacks on Christianity, demanding its own messaging and disregarding constitutional rights. In one case it got scolded by the Supreme Court for its hostility to Christianity, but it immediately launched the same allegations against another defendant, to be struck down again.\n\nIt tried this year to force a Christian children’s camp to allow boys in the girls cabins, and showers.\n\nIt right now is arguing before the Supreme Court that it has the right to control the speech of Christian counselors who want to help patients to come to them with unwanted same-sex feelings.\n\nThe state essentially says, in that case, that counselors are allowed to promote the LGBT ideology, but are not allowed even to mention anything negative about the lifestyle.\n\nPolis, of course, the openly homosexual governor who pundits already have mentioned as a possible future Democrat nominee for president, has been part and parcel of the agenda, apparently from its beginning.\n\nIt is, in fact, the leftist CPR which has confirmed, “There will be at least 21 members of the Colorado General Assembly this year who at some point were appointed to the House or Senate by or through a vacancy committee made up of a small number of party insiders, according to a Colorado Sun analysis. That includes 12 state representatives and nine senators. All but three are Democrats:”\n\nIt continued, “The number — which represents about a fifth of the 100-member General Assembly — is down from last year, when 29 legislators had at some point landed a job in the General Assembly thanks to a vacancy committee.”\n\nCaldara explained, Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen “in any other state” would be “looking to run for governor.” Instead, he’s fleeing.\n\n“So that Paul doesn’t feel alone in his escape from the asylum — I’m sorry, the ‘unsupervised mental health facility’ — the equally sane House Minority Whip Ryan Armagost is bolting out of the state for an undisclosed ‘fantastic professional opportunity’ in Arizona,” Caldara wrote.\n\nBut the majority fleeing are Democrats.\n\n“Recall, Democrats have near veto-proof majorities in both houses, all statewide offices, including governor and attorney general, and judges almost completely appointed by progressive Democrat governors. Like your sibling whom your parents love more than you, Democrats get whatever they want. Your wallet is their oyster,” Caldara wrote.\n\nIn fact, lawmakers, faced with a constitutional requirement for voter approval for tax increases beyond the rate of inflation and increased population, have resorted to imposing new taxes and then calling them “fees.”\n\nFor example, vehicle owners are required to pay a “fee” for roads and a “fee” for bridges. Likely they sometimes use them. But out-of-state travelers use those same public facilities, with no fee.\n\nCaldara noted that first, there needs to be reform of how vacancies are filled.\n\n“The bigger question is, what are the Democrats doing to make the place so unlivable?”","summary":"'The bigger question is, what are the Democrats doing to make the place so unlivable?'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/07/why-democrat-lawmakers-who-run-colorado-are-fleeing/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/exit-sign-leaving-exodus-running-right-arrow-doorway-pathway-way-out-unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 18:43:25","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":339989816,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Jasmine Crockett Holds Healthy Lead In Hypothetical 2026 Senate Race, Shock Poll Shows","text":"Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett is the preferred candidate among Texas Democratic voters to run for Senate in 2026, according to recent polling.\n\nCrockett leads a hypothetical primary field with 35% of likely Democratic voters, followed by former Democratic Texas Rep. Colin Allred at 20%, former Presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke and Rep. Joaquin Castro tied at 13%. Just 18% of voters said they were undecided about their preferred nominee to challenge Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who is seeking his fifth Senate term. (RELATED: Wealthy White Liberals Reportedly Urge Democrats To ‘Be Willing To Get Shot’ Opposing Trump)\n\nThe poll was conducted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senate Republicans’ campaign arm. The NRSC is supporting Cornyn’s campaign against Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nThe multimodal survey of 566 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted between July 4 and 7. Though Crockett is leading the field well outside the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 3.03%, the liberal firebrand has not signaled that she is considering a run for the upper chamber.\n\nCrockett has emerged as one of the leading voices in the party as Democrats fight over the best approach back to power. She frequently draws controversy through her inflammatory remarks and has referred to Trump supporters as mentally ill.\n\nAllred, who previously blew through tens of millions of dollars in a failed run against Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz last November, is the only well-known candidate in the race thus far. He trails Crockett by fifteen percentage points in a hypothetical matchup.\n\nSpokespersons for Crockett and Allred did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nCastro and perennial candidate O’Rourke, who came up short in previous runs for Senate in 2018 and the governorship 2022, are both reportedly mulling runs. The deadline to enter the primary contest is the first week of December.\n\nThe polling is part of a broader survey the Republican group conducted in five battleground states — Texas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Maine — that are likely to determine whether Senate Republicans can defend and expand their 53-seat majority during the midterms.\n\nThe group did not survey a hypothetical Democratic primary contest in Georgia, which Republicans view as a top pick-up opportunity due to the state’s red leanings and voters rejecting former Vice President Kamala Harris last November by more than 100,000 votes. The incumbent, Democratic Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, has no well-known Democratic challengers and is likely to cruise to the general election contest.\n\nThough most of the primary field in the five states is not settled, the most far-left or vocally anti-Trump candidate is leading or within striking distance of supplanting the frontrunner in the majority of the states surveyed, according to the NRSC polling memo.\n\nEarly support for left-wing candidates in key states comes as the left appears to be emboldened with socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani’s shock win in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary in June. The Democratic party’s base is also urging lawmakers to aggressively resist the Trump administration with some reportedly calling on Democrats to be “willing to get shot” to thwart the president’s agenda and defy the rule of law.\n\nNearly a quarter of likely Democratic primary voters in the five states believe the Constitution should be “replaced or fundamentally changed,” according to the survey.\n\nFar-left Michigan Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who has voiced support for Mamdani, is trailing Democratic Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens within the poll’s margin of error. The crowded primary field is laying the groundwork to be a bitter intraparty fight for the nomination and could bruise the candidate that advances to the general election.\n\nDemocratic Michigan state legislator Mallory McMorrow notches just 11% of Democratic primary voters, but the liberal candidate has never run statewide before nor spent significant resources on paid media.\n\nThe most left-wing candidate in Minnesota’s contested Democratic Senate primary also maintains a comfortable lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, who has embraced far-left positions on transgender issues and abortion, leads Democratic Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig 30% to 24%. Nearly half of likely Democratic primary voters are undecided.\n\nA significant number of Democratic primary voters are also undecided about their preferred candidates in Senate races in Maine and North Carolina. The seats in both states are currently held by Republicans and are viewed by Democrats as potential flip opportunities.\n\nThough Democratic Maine Governor Janet Mills tops former congressional staffer Jordan Wood by 14 percentage points, 51% of likely Democratic primary voters are undecided. Mills has not closed the door on a run and is likely to come under scrutiny for her views on transgender athletes in women’s sports and alleged former cocaine use if she jumps into the race.\n\nRepublican Maine Sen. Susan Collins decisively won reelection in 2020 despite Trump losing the state by nine percentage points.\n\nIn North Carolina, former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper is the preferred candidate for 39% of likely Democratic voters — the most support for any individual candidate measured across the five states. However, a greater number of Democratic voters in the state are undecided.\n\nCooper is reportedly leaning toward jumping into the Democratic primary. He is likely to face criticism for vetoing a state ban on child sex-change procedures in 2023 if he makes a bid for the open seat vacated by Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nThe NRSC poll also found that the top concern of Democratic voters in the five states were government entitlement programs, with 44% of those saying it was their most-important issue. The economy was second, with 23% of voters pointing to it as their main concern.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
