Aftyn Behn, who is running against Republican Matt Van Epps in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District special election, also worked as a regional organizing director for the nonprofit activist group Indivisible prior to becoming a state legislator. The radical left-wing entity was also a frequent advocate for stripping funding from police departments, calling it \"critical,\" during the height of the defund movement. \"Where's the proposal that dissolves @MNPDNashville,\" Behn questioned on an old social media account, which has since been deleted, in response to a separate social media post from a Nashville City Council member indicating local officials had submitted a \"substitute budget proposal\" aiming to strip Nashville police of $2.6 million in funding. \"If it's been difficult for all of you to imagine a world without police … we can do it and there is a world,\" Behn subsequently said during an interview with a local Nashville advocacy group. Behn's comments largely came during the height of the \"defund the police\" movement in 2020 and 2021 following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Amid violent protests that often devolved into dangerous rioting and looting following Floyd's death, Behn also downplayed the violence that was occurring and ridiculed white people for criticizing the looting, stating it was simply how minority communities were expressing their grief over Floyd's death. KAMALA HARRIS RETURNS TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN TRUMP COUNTRY TO BACK ‘AOC OF TENNESSEE’ \"Looks like Aftyn is getting a visit from the Ghost of Wokeness Past,\" quipped Republican strategist Matt Gorman. \"Democrats over and over have been haunted by their past positions they thought they could hide from. Ask Kamala Harris about her advocacy of taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for illegal immigrant convicts on how that goes.\" Behn did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. However, Democrat strategist Eric Koch argued that attacks on Behn have been surging because \"Republicans are getting worried in a district that Trump won by over 20 points,\" adding that Democrats making this race competitive shows they are in good shape to take back the House in the midterms next year. Behn's special election is slated to take place on Dec. 2. While popular in the immediate aftermath following Floyd's death, the push to \"defund the police\" has become a political liability for many Democrats running in recent elections. New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani faced criticism in the lead up to his victory for his past anti-police rhetoric, which Mamdani ultimately went on Fox News to apologize for. Earlier this month, a progressive candidate for U.S. Senate in Michigan, was reported to have quietly deleted old social media posts he made in support of defunding the police. DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL VOWS TO HELP WORKING CLASS DESPITE RECORD OF HIKING TAXES \"I’m currently involved in a transformative justice seminar, and so it’s how to imagine a world without police and what that looks like and what community mechanisms look like. How people cannot police themselves,\" Behn said during an interview with Nashville Musicians For Change in July 2020. \"If it’s been difficult for all of you to imagine a world without police, please tune in to, maybe not this episode, but the next one. Because I’ll talk about things I’m learning and growing as an organizer. Because I think, especially for those of us that are young, and talking to our parents about what police abolition looks like, that we can do it and there is a world.\" Behn's comments came amidst her work with the left-wing nonprofit Indivisible, which itself also has a record of pushing to defund the police, calling the effort \"critical\" in order to \"keep everyone safe,\" in a Facebook post in 2020. The same year, the group called on people to phone their local, state and federal lawmakers to demand for policies and budgets that steer money away from police departments and toward \"Black communities.\" \"Good morning, especially to the 54% of Americans that believe burning down a police station is justified,\" Behn said in another post she made, which came in response to polling about who saw the destruction of a Minneapolis police precinct as justified, versus not. The precinct was ultimately razed to the ground and police were forced to abandon the precinct as it burned down. Amid the chaos spurred by the death of Floyd that resulted in billions of dollars in damage and multiple lives lost, Behn was also co-hosting a podcast at the time. During one of the episodes, titled \"Black Lives Matter,\" Behn argued that it \"is not for us to decide as privileged white people how marginalized communities express their suffering and their pain and their grieving,\" referring to the looting and the rioting that was taking place. Behn called it \"a trope\" for white people to say the looting was bad. \"I would really challenge all of you when you see these stories of looting and you revert to this law and order type of response, I really challenge you to step back from that and think about what's driving that,\" Behn added about the rioting. \"You should not condemn it because you don’t know the first thing about being where they come from and what their generational trauma that has been inflicted upon them by the police, by institutional racism.\" SCOOP: TRUMP-ALIGNED MAGA INC. JUMPS INTO HIGH STAKES BALLOT BOX CONGRESSIONAL SHOWDOWN During the same podcast episode, Behn suggested the police don't actually serve to guard and protect Americans. \"You think calling the cops is going to save you?\" Behn asked her listeners. \"Black men are being killed when white women call cops.\" Behn also came under fire this week for other comments on her podcast, during which she said she hated her city of Nashville and all the southern-style elements that come with it, like country music. Meanwhile, in addition to Behn's remarks in interviews and on podcasts, the Democrat House hopeful also repeatedly espoused defund the police rhetoric on a now-deleted X account, which was formerly Twitter at the time. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP For example, Behn responded to a post, claiming \"the Los Angeles teachers union\" was demanding a commitment to \"defund the police\" before they would commit to returning to in-person learning for students, with a response that called on teachers in her state to do the same. The post Behn was responding to also called for more similar demands across the country. \"Let's go Tennessee teachers! We have your back!!!!,\" Behn wrote in response to the post. \"Your individual positive experiences with cops do not outweigh the fact that the entire criminal justice system was built on institutionalized racism,\" another post Behn shared on her now-deleted Twitter account stated.","summary":"Aftyn Behn, Dem candidate for Tennessee&apos;s upcoming special election, has a history of calling to &apos;abolish&apos; and &apos;defund&apos; the police in now-deleted social media posts","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-house-hopeful-exposed-far-left-activist-pushing-abolish-police-weeks-before-special-election","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/aftyn-behn-tennesse-congressional-primary-election-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 23:43:42","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":381401590,"title":"Donald Trump’s pursuit of celebrity validation dragged Brittany Mahomes into an unexpected political storm","text":"Long before the 2024 election cycle intensified, one of the more unexpected political dust-ups involved former president Donald Trump and Kansas City Chiefs WAG Brittany Mahomes. The story resurfaced months later, partly because it revealed just how intensely Trump courted and weaponized celebrity approval. At the time, fans noticed Brittany had quietly interacted with posts tied to Trump’s 2024 platform, a move that immediately clashed with her public friendship with Taylor Swift, who had endorsed Kamala Harris and urged voters to choose “calm and not chaos.” What followed was a spectacle fueled less by policy and more by Trump’s fixation on star power, turning a small digital interaction into a headline-making moment.Donald Trump’s hunger for star endorsements put Brittany Mahomes and Sydney Sweeney in the spotlightOnce fans detected Brittany Mahomes’ likes on Trump-aligned posts, including one supporting “Trump-Vance 2024”, online speculation erupted. Many wondered whether political differences would threaten the high-profile camaraderie between Mahomes and Swift. Trump, however, didn’t wait for the conversation to unfold naturally.He rushed to Truth Social, triumphantly posting, “I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country.”He doubled down during a Fox News appearance, adding, “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better… She’s a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan.” The moment underscored something observers had long noted: Trump saw celebrity backing as political currency.That same instinct emerged again when he learned actress Sydney Sweeney was a registered Republican amid backlash surrounding her American Eagle campaign. Caught off guard yet thrilled, he said, “She’s a registered Republican? Oh, now I love her ad… If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”Predictably, he took the celebration back to Truth Social, calling her spot the “HOTTEST” and urging fans to buy the jeans.In hindsight, these episodes illustrated how Trump’s need for cultural relevance often overshadowed the political moment itself. Brittany Mahomes’ casual social-media engagement wasn’t a policy endorsement, but Trump’s amplification turned it into a firestorm, pulling a sports celebrity into a political narrative she never publicly claimed.Also Read: “Not be able to walk”: Patrick Mahomes’ mom Randi shares emotional health confession after completing challenging Colorado hikeGet an chance to win ₹5000 Amazon Voucher by taking part in India's Biggest Habit Index!

Even though you are on Fox News. You went out of your way to say hi and Happy Birthday to him. Politics aside, and let’s just be normal people,\" one fan gushed, but the majority of the comments from MAGA supporters claimed the photo was \"scripted.\"'All A Staged Photo Op'\"You realize that this was all a staged photo op, right? No way he decided all on his own to just ride the train.... On his birthday. And people there to take pics and gush over it,\" a second person sneered. \n\n\"Totally not scripted at all.

Or Biden is lost and doesn't know where he is,\" a fourth person wrote, while a fifth joked, \"That is a nurse checking for a pulse.\"Train LoverBiden is well-known for his love of train travel, commuting from Delaware to Washington, D.C. via Amtrak for the 36 years he spent as a U.S. Senator. \n\nHowever, as President, Biden made the trip aboard Marine One when he went to and from his Delaware home and hadn't been seen on the train in years, making some people skeptical about why he would be on it on his birthday amid a major health crisis.\n\nBiden revealed in May that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had already metastasized to his bones. \n\nThe condition sparked widespread conspiracies, since the former Commander-in-Chief would have had regular medical exams before leaving the White House in January that should have detected the disease well before it spread.\n\nSome also thought Biden accidentally let it slip that he had cancer back in 2022 when he said, \"That's why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer and why for the longest time Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation.\" However, it was chalked up to one of his many verbal gaffes at the time.Downhill SlideBiden riding the train without an apparent companion also set off alarm bells among some, as his cognitive decline was rapid and noticeable throughout his presidency.\n\nHis inability to coherently answer questions and frequent loss of train of thought during a June 2024 debate against then-Republican presidential candidate Trump led Biden to withdraw weeks later from a second-term bid. It came amid mounting pressure from powerful members of the Democratic Party, and he was replaced on the ticket by then-Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nCNN's Jake Tapper co-authored a book about Biden's cognitive decline titled Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\n\nIn it, he claimed Biden was so mentally gone that he didn't recognize longtime supporter George Clooney at a May 2024 fundraiser, and that his aides kept the president squirreled away so the true nature of his decline wouldn't be as evident.","summary":"Joe Biden's photo with Fox News' Brooke Singman has been accused of being 'scripted.'","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/joe-biden-staged-train-photo-fox-news-brooke-singman-maga/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/_O1vBUJin/0x0/joe-biden-train-photo-mocked-staged-1763754650275.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 22:30:00","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":381395448,"title":"He built a nursing home empire despite California state investigations. Now, lawsuits are piling up","text":"In February 2024, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $2.34 million to an 84-year-old nursing home resident named Betsy Jentz, finding that the facility had violated her rights on 132 occasions, at times leading to serious injuries.\n\nSix months later, an Alameda County jury found another facility had violated the rights of 71-year-old James Doherty, Sr. more than 1,400 times. That included seven instances in which staff failed to transport him, causing him to miss chemotherapy treatments, court documents said. Doherty died following the development of a large pressure sore. His family was awarded $7.6 million.\n\nIn February, a jury in Shasta County is scheduled to hear a case against a nursing home accused of negligence in the 2020 COVID-19 deaths of 24 patients. \n\nAnd next spring, trial is scheduled to begin in the case of a 79-year-old dementia patient, referred to as Cheryl Doe, who was allegedly raped twice in another Alameda County facility; a second case against the same facility alleges that excessive sedation of 64-year-old Alando Williams led to his death.\n\nAll of these facilities have one thing in common: state records list Shlomo Rechnitz as an owner.\n\nCourt documents show Rechnitz and his companies have denied all allegations in all of the cases. Mark Johnson, an attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities and one of his main companies, Brius LLC, said in an email that facilities cannot comment on active litigation. \n\n“It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care,” he said. \n\nJohnson sought to distance his clients from the cases, saying that Rechnitz and his wife, Tamar, “are passive owners of the facilities” and have “absolutely no role in operations or management.” Johnson said “the licensees” contract with a company to manage the facilities, adding that “each facility has all the necessary resources for patients and staff.”\n\nRechnitz has been on the state’s radar for years. In 2014, then-Attorney General Kamala Harris attempted to prevent him from purchasing new homes. In 2018, the State Auditor’s Office found his companies had significantly higher rates of federal deficiencies and complaints than the rest of the state’s care facilities.\n\nIn 2021, a CalMatters investigation documented that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status for seven years after he acquired the homes. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses to them. \n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.\n\nNow elder care advocates say he is Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health are failing some of California’s most vulnerable citizens. They say the state could push for greater accountability, including withholding licenses from owners they deem to be bad actors.\n\nWendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”\n\nYork brought the lawsuit in 2021 alleging that one of Rechnitz’ companies’ facilities, Windsor Redding Care Center, was responsible for the COVID-related deaths of some 24 elderly and dependent residents. Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, previously said the company “vehemently” disagrees with the allegations in the case, which is headed to trial early next year.\n\nThere are “government agencies who are responsible for their oversight,” York said, but “at the end of the day, it feels like we’re the ones who are doing the enforcement.”\n\nJohnson called it “crucial to note that California is one of the only states in the country to provide zero liability protection for healthcare providers during the unprecedented pandemic.”\n\n“This is particularly noteworthy since nursing homes were the front line in trying to protect our frail and elderly,” he said.\n\nAt least one of the cases against Rechnitz’ facilities includes allegations about his own conduct. A man suing Rechnitz and his companies over a relative’s injuries wrote in a sworn declaration filed in court that Rechnitz attempted to intimidate and bribe him with Lakers tickets during an unexpected phone call on the eve of his scheduled testimony in Los Angeles County Superior Court. \n\nJohnson, the attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities, called allegations about threats “completely false and defamatory.” A judge ruled the conversation could not be introduced as evidence.\n\nIn another case, Rechnitz and his wife Tamar in discovery disclosed their net worth: $786 million. \n\nTony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said that dollar figure hasn’t been divulged publicly before.\n\n “At least in some of these chains, the money that was meant to go for patient care is being stripped away and sent up top to the ownership,” he said.\n\nJohnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, did not comment on the disclosure of the family’s wealth when CalMatters asked him.\n\n‘Heightened monitoring’ for two years\n\nThe Department of Public Health has for years refused CalMatters’ requests for an interview about licensing issues related to Rechnitz’ companies’ homes. They again declined requests for an interview for this story. They did not provide a reason. \n\nInstead, spokesman Mark Smith, said in an emailed statement that the department “remains committed to transparency and accountability for all providers, and to the health and safety of all nursing home residents in California.” In response to CalMatters’ questions about facilities in which Rechnitz is listed as an owner, Smith noted that the department had “negotiated for and obtained heightened monitoring authority and additional enforcement powers, beyond those applicable to other skilled nursing facilities, for a period of two years at 24 of this provider’s locations.” \n\nThat period has ended.\n\n“This does not mean our department will avoid holding this provider or their facilities accountable,” he said. “We will continue to monitor these locations as appropriate, enforce and cite for regulatory violations if needed, and take further corrective action if necessary.”\n\nA CalMatters analysis of data from both the state health department and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found 78 California facilities in which Shlomo Rechnitz or his wife, Tamar, were listed as having an ownership stake. On average the facilities fared poorly on several key quality metrics compared to the state overall. \n\n1. In the past three years, the 78 nursing homes received an average of 12.4 citations for facility-reported incidents, compared with 6.1 for all nursing homes statewide.2. A higher proportion of these facilities has received a federal fine in the last three years than the state’s overall rate. Two-thirds of the facilities received at least one federal fine in the last three years, compared to half of all facilities across the state.3. The facilities have been fined an average of $47,897 during the last three years, compared to an average of $29,573 for all California facilities.4. The facilities had comparably low federal quality ratings: Almost 58% of these facilities had recent ratings of one or two stars (out of five), compared with slightly over 37% of facilities statewide.\n\nJohnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, noted in his email that a large percentage of these facilities are located in Los Angeles County, which he said issues deficiencies at a higher rate than any county in California, many of which are overturned on appeal.\n\nHe also said that “Mr. Rechnitz’ facilities self-report at a significantly higher rate than other comparable facilities,” which, in turn, could lead them to have a higher number of deficiencies.\n\nKamala Harris’ intervention\n\nBack in 2014, Rechnitz bid on 18 Country Villa nursing homes in federal bankruptcy court. Then Attorney General Harris was so concerned with his track record that she filed an emergency motion to prevent him from purchasing or managing the homes, describing him as “ a serial violator of rules within the skilled nursing industry.” At the time, Rechnitz’ attorney characterized the remarks as “ defamatory ” and “ outrageous.” \n\nThe purchase went through. \n\nRechnitz then submitted change-of-ownership applications seeking licenses to run those homes. Rather than approving or denying them, CalMatters found that the state Department of Public Health simply left his applications in “pending” status for years. Despite that, his companies were allowed to continue operating the homes.\n\nIn 2015, he applied for licenses for five Windsor nursing homes. The next year, the department denied the change of ownership applications, but again allowed Rechnitz’ companies to operate them. \n\nIn her scathing 2018 report, the state auditor Elaine Howle criticized the California Department of Public Health, saying weak oversight and licensing lapses increased risk to nursing home residents. \n\nIn an effort to address these issues, the Legislature passed a law in 2022 to close a loophole that had allowed nursing home operators to run facilities without first receiving licenses. The law required the Department of Public Health to look at an applicant’s track record over several years before granting a license.\n\nBut before that law took effect the following year, the Department of Public Health suddenly granted Rechnitz and his companies many of the licenses it had previously left pending or outright denied. The group includes nursing homes that were the focus of recent lawsuits, such as Country Villa Wilshire, the Los Angeles-area facility where a jury awarded $2.34 million after a woman allegedly fell repeatedly due to understaffing; Windsor Redding, where the 24 patients died during a COVID outbreak; and Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland, where complaints filed in Alameda County Superior Court allege a woman was sexually assaulted twice and a man died after being given too much medication.\n\nEd Dudensing, a Sacramento-based attorney who specializes in elder abuse in nursing homes, is bringing the case in Alameda County Superior Court alleging that neglect and poor staffing allowed a fellow patient to rape 79-year-old Cheryl Doe on multiple occasions while she stayed at Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland. He is also representing the family of 64-year-old Alando Williams in the lawsuit against the same facility alleging overmedication and wrongful death.\n\nDudensing has three other active cases against facilities affiliated with Rechnitz and his web of companies alleging neglect, abuse and wrongful death. \n\nIn one of them, 78-year-old Barbara Pendley allegedly died after suffering severe dehydration at North Point Healthcare & Wellness Centre in Fresno. \n\nNorth Point was another facility that the state opted to grant Rechnitz and his companies the license for under the 2023 settlement agreement. \n\nRechnitz and his companies have filed legal responses denying allegations in all of these cases, several of which are scheduled to go to trial in the coming year. \n\n“We’ve just got to keep fighting,” Dudensing said.\n\n“There was a time when there was a lot of scrutiny and that’s obviously well-documented,” he said. “But he managed to slip through.”\n\nCassie Dunham, the previous deputy director of the Center for Health Care Quality for the California Department of Public Health, last year became chief executive and president of the California Association of Health Facilities, the industry’s lobbying group. Through a spokesperson, Dunham declined an interview for this story citing her involvement with the development of departmental policy during the time that the state granted Rechnitz the licenses.\n\nCorey Egel, a spokesman for the industry group and himself a former spokesman for the Department of Public Health, said in a statement that the association “supports strong, transparent oversight but believes the system would benefit from clearer timelines, more consistent application of standards, and more efficient resolution of pending cases — so that regulatory goals and resident care priorities can both be met.”\n\nPatient lawsuit at newly licensed nursing home\n\nAmong the facilities that Rechnitz’ companies received a state license to run in 2023 was Country Villa Wilshire, an 81-bed Los Angeles nursing home. \n\nAccording to a lawsuit against the facility, 84-year-old Betsy Jentz landed there in November 2020 after she fell and fractured her ribs and hip. Prior to her injuries, the complaint stated that Jentz had been in excellent health; her attorneys said she had run 27 marathons.\n\nBut during the next year, according to a plaintiff’s brief, Jentz fell at least 10 times. On some of these occasions, she hit her head, suffered a fractured and dislocated shoulder and a fractured pelvis. The complaint also described malnutrition and severe pressure ulcers. It attributed those injuries to neglect. In court filings, Rechnitz and his companies have denied all responsibility.\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 28, 2024, Jentz’ great nephew Derek Skylar Aud was preparing to testify in court the next morning. Then, according to court documents, he received an unexpected phone call.\n\nThe man on the other end of the line introduced himself as Shlomo Rechnitz, Aud later wrote in a declaration filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. \n\nOver the course of more than an hour, Rechnitz allegedly told Aud that “things would get very nasty” for him and Jentz if Aud testified, the declaration said. Rechnitz allegedly said he would prolong the case for years and bring to light damaging information his private investigators had collected about Jentz. \n\nHe also said his private investigators had learned that Jentz loved basketball, and said she could receive courtside Lakers tickets “right next to LeBron James” if she agreed to a side deal, Aud told the court.\n\nRechnitz did not directly respond to these allegations in court, and the judge ultimately did not allow the jury to consider the phone call to Aud in making its decision. \n\nAttorneys from Lanzone Morgan, a Long Beach law firm that specializes in nursing home abuse, represented Jentz and Aud in their case against Country Villa Wilshire. They said that the judge accepted defense attorneys’ argument that the call constituted “confidential settlement discussions” and did not allow the jury to hear testimony about it. Gittler & Berg and Ekpebe Law Group, the law firms that represented Rechnitz and his companies in the case, did not respond to CalMatters’ requests for comment. The jury’s $2.34 million verdict is now being appealed.\n\nLanzone Morgan also brought the case against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness that ended in the $7.6 million judgment in August. The case is in a post-trial phase in which the judge is determining how to apportion the liability among defendants.\n\nRockport Healthcare Services, the administrative services company for many of the homes, is also named in some of the lawsuits, including the one against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness. Rockport is owned by Steven Stroll, who has also served as Rechnitz’ accountant. Rockport has filed responses in court denying responsibility for the allegations. \n\nElizabeth Kim, an attorney with Lanzone Morgan, said she wants to see the Department of Public Health stop issuing licenses to Rechnitz and “other bad actors.”\n\n“It’s shocking to me that he’s able to get licenses after he pretty much runs many of his facilities into the ground,” she said. She referred to an Aug. 22 trial in which Rechnitz acknowledged owning a private plane and having recently sold a home in Los Angeles for $23 million. \n\nHer client, Aud, whose great aunt Jentz died in January 2025 a few months after the jury made its decision, wrote in his declaration to the court:\n\n“I continue to feel uneasy about the calls and threats and I carry the fear of retaliation with me daily…I do live in fear that Mr. Rechnitz is now even more furious and that he will make good on his threats.”\n\nCalMatters Data Reporter Erica Yee contributed to this story.\n\nThis story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/mark-smith-general-news-nursing-homes-california-courts-56efffa2fd9da5dc3af765886a7b2819","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3a1cb52/2147483647/strip/false/crop/700x450+0+0/resize/700x450!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F29%2F4e3c1cc7446089a9101a7bdff4c8%2Fdefaultshareimage-copy.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 22:09:39","author":"Jocelyn Wiener/calmatters","authors":["Jocelyn Wiener/calmatters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":381390794,"title":"Trump lands another legal victory as lawsuit against Iowa pollster, Des Moines Register remains in state court","text":"FIRST ON FOX — President Donald Trump scored yet another legal victory Friday when the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit shut down Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer’s appeal, reinforcing that the president’s \"election interference\" lawsuit will now land in Iowa State Court. Trump’s legal team has accused Selzer and The Des Moines Register of \"brazen election interference\" with their final 2024 Iowa presidential poll that showed him trailing Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump originally requested the case be moved to Iowa State Court in May after the defendants \"removed\" the case to federal court. A federal judge denied the request at the time, but the Obama-appointed judge was overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. TRUMP SCORES LEGAL WIN, GETTING LAWSUIT AGAINST IOWA POLLSTER, DES MOINES REGISTER MOVED TO STATE COURT Trump last month notched a key victory when the 8th Circuit granted Trump’s petition for a writ of mandamus — a rare judicial order used to correct clear legal errors — and directed a district judge to treat the case as dismissed \"without prejudice,\" allowing Trump to refile the case. As a result, the case would be litigated in Iowa State Court. The defendants petitioned the 8th Circuit for relief but were shut down. \"The petition for rehearing en banc is denied. The petition for rehearing by the panel is denied,\" Clerk of Court Susan Bindler ruled.

FORMER POLLSTER ANN SELZER HITS BACK AT CRITICISMS OVER IOWA POLL: 'THEY ARE ACCUSING ME OF A CRIME' A spokesman for Trump's legal team told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in deception and fake news to account. The Des Moines Register and Gannett knowingly ran a phony poll from the now disgraced Democrat pollster Ann Selzer in an underhanded attempt to interfere in the election and defraud the country into believing Kamala Harris was winning the state of Iowa and nationwide, mere hours before she lost Iowa and the overall election by an overwhelming margin to President Trump. \"This scam was designed to damage President Trump’s dominant campaign in the final days of the race. Such fraud cannot be allowed to stand, and President Trump is committed to seeing this case through to a just, winning conclusion.\" Lark-Marie Antón, a spokesperson for The Des Moines Register's parent company, Gannett, previously said the case belongs in federal court. \"We are assessing the court’s decision. Given the nature of the case and that it involves the president of the United States as a plaintiff, we continue to believe the federal courts are the most appropriate forum for this lawsuit. In the event the suit is heard by the state courts of Iowa, we have confidence the matter will be adjudicated fairly,\" Antón told Fox News Digital last month. Gannett did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. TRUMP’S LAWSUIT MOVES TO IOWA STATE COURT: WHAT’S NEXT IN HIS CASE AGAINST POLLSTER, DES MOINES REGISTER Selzer released her final Des Moines Register-sponsored poll showing Harris leading Trump by three points in Iowa just three days before the election. That shock poll showed a seven-point shift from Trump to Harris from September, when he had a four-point lead over the vice president in the same poll. Selzer’s poll was hyped up by the media in the days leading up to the election as her polling predictions had been historically accurate. Many suggested it implied a monumental shift in Midwest support for Harris in a red state, but the poll turned out to be way off. Trump thumped Harris in Iowa by more than 13 percentage points, the third straight time he'd won the state and the first time any candidate had won there by double digits since 1980. Shortly after the election, Selzer announced she was done with election polling and moving on to \"other ventures.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Lindsay Kornick and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.","summary":"President Trump has accused Selzer and The Des Moines Register of &quot;brazen election interference&quot; with their final 2024 Iowa presidential poll that showed him trailing Democrat Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-lands-another-legal-victory-lawsuit-against-iowa-pollster-des-moines-register-remains-state-court","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/trump-iowa-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:39:17","author":"Brian Flood","authors":["Brian Flood"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":381407280,"title":"At Dick Cheney’s Funeral, Talk of “Spontaneous Combustion,” Unlikely Democratic Reverence, and No Mention of Iraq","text":"That’s because Cheney’s family had pointedly not invited Donald J. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance. Not that they would have come; Trump hasn’t even mentioned Cheney since his death two weeks ago at the age of 84, and federal flags were quietly lowered to half-staff. But given the scrambled, kaleidoscopic nature of this moment in American politics, Trump and his VP weren’t the only major no-shows. Former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were also conspicuously absent. It wasn’t immediately clear why, though a Clinton spokesperson told USA Today that he had a scheduling conflict. But for many, evidently the wounds of Cheney’s controversial vice presidency have yet to heal.\nStrange bedfellows were everywhere. As the ceremony began, Cheney’s old boss George W. Bush chatted amiably with Joe Biden, who, despite his recent bout with aggressive prostate cancer, looked fitter than he has in years. Nearby sat three vice presidents who, in different and dramatic ways, had seen their presidential hopes immolate: Clinton’s Al Gore, Trump’s Mike Pence, and Biden’s Kamala Harris.\nDick Cheney was possibly the most disliked vice president of all. He was the co-architect of the Iraq war and an unabashed defender of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques after the attacks of 9/11. Cheney, along with his partner Bush, helped pave the way for the populist revolution of Trump and his MAGA movement. Yet at the time Cheney wore his dismal approval rating like a badge of honor and relished being caricatured as Darth Vader.\nBut there was another Cheney—a kinder, gentler one, recalled in eulogies by his cardiologist Dr. Jonathan Reiner and notably by George W. Bush. In remarks that never mentioned 9/11, Iraq, or the 2008 financial meltdown, Bush praised Cheney’s judgment, reticence, loyalty, and humor. In a touching tribute, Cheney’s granddaughter Grace Perry spoke movingly of how much Grandpa loved driving her to rodeos across Wyoming in his pickup truck (without using GPS).\nIn multiple interviews for documentaries and books over the years, I got to know this Cheney. As President Gerald Ford’s 34-year-old chief, he’d been the toast of Washington, DC—known for his wry sense of humor, humility, and uncanny ability to forge consensus. For reasons no one knows for certain, as vice president, Cheney’s worldview became bleaker, his disposition darker. It became almost a parlor game among his old friends and colleagues: What in the world happened to Cheney?\nWhen her turn came to speak, Liz Cheney barely mentioned her father’s accomplishments as vice president. Instead, she dwelled on his belief in freedom and democracy, his conviction that “a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.” It was a direct shot at Trump, though she didn’t name him. And she spoke of the cherished time she spent with her father in his final years. By then Dick Cheney had morphed from Darth Vader to “Rodeo Grandpa,” as his granddaughter titled him. But to many of the assembled mourners, he’d also become a kind of dark knight of the Trump resistance, standing shoulder to shoulder with his daughter to oppose what they regarded as Trump’s assault on the Constitution and the rule of law.\nOn the eve of Trump’s first election, in the fall of 2016, I called Cheney, who was accompanying Liz as she campaigned for her Wyoming congressional seat. After two rings, he picked up. “Mr. Vice President, where are you?” I asked. He replied: “Right now, I’m having coffee at a McDonald’s in Laramie, Wyoming.” He paused for a beat. “I used to run things. Now I’m the chauffeur.” I could tell he was right where he wanted to be.\nA week later, the age of Trump began.\nRiding back to my hotel in an Uber from Dick Cheney’s funeral service, I saw a forlorn-looking figure standing by himself on a street corner in Georgetown. It was John Brennan, looking over his shoulder.","summary":"Washington’s old guard turned out to pay respects, with Biden, Harris, Pence, and Bush in attendance, and Trump and Vance conspicuously absent.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/dick-cheneys-funeral-talk-of-spontaneous-combustion","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69209bd75e76db09cca67df9/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf1125-cheney-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:31:59","author":"Chris Whipple","authors":["Chris Whipple"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.049},{"id":381383076,"title":"Arizona attorney general asks state supreme court to revive case against Trump’s 2020 allies","text":"An appeals court upheld that order, and Mayes had until Friday to ask the state’s high court, consider seeking a new indictment or dropping the case altogether. Mayes’ bid to resuscitate the long-stalled case ensures it will be a live issue for months, including as she seeks reelection in 2026.\n\nThe indictment described Trump himself as the unindicted mastermind of a plot to subvert the 2020 election, pressuring state officials to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the state, enlisting allies to sign false paperwork claiming to be legitimate presidential electors and using their signatures to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to use his unique role in the process to stop Biden’s victory.\n\nAmong those facing charges are former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn and Christina Bobb and a group of 11 “false electors” — including former state GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward. One of those electors who signed the false Electoral College paperwork has already pleaded guilty for her role.\n\nThe grand jury that indicted Trump’s allies initially considered indicting Trump himself but was urged against doing so by prosecutors. But the unusually aggressive grand jury delved deeply into the allegations against Trump and his inner circle ahead of its indictment.\n\nThe case’s original judge, Bruce Cohen, recused last year after defendants discovered he had emailed colleagues on the court urging them to reject attacks against Kamala Harris rooted in race and gender. His successor, Sam Myers, threw out the case in May, saying prosecutors failed to show grand jurors the text of the Electoral Count Act, the law that governs the presidential transfer of power.\n\nIt’s the third time in recent days that local courts or prosecutors breathed new life into criminal cases stemming from Trump’s 2020 election effort. Nevada’s Supreme Court earlier this month revived a case against six Republicans “false electors” that had been stalled over questions about the proper venue. And in Georgia, a supervisory prosecutor agreed to take over a criminal case in which Trump himself is a defendant after the previous lead prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Wilis, was disqualified over a conflict of interest.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/21/arizona-attorney-general-case-trump-00665665","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/26e3a26/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F9d%2F92%2F806b101d464494be3882631fefd5%2Farizona-execution-13709.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:27:00","author":"Kyle Cheney","authors":["Kyle Cheney"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":381382290,"title":"Larry Summers forced out of consulting gig at ‘woke’ hedge fund DE Shaw after Jeffrey Epstein scandal","text":"Larry Summers has been forced out of his lucrative consulting gig at ‘woke’ hedge fund DE Shaw — effectively ending the former Treasury Secretary’s career on Wall Street following a scandal over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, The Post has learned.\n\nTwo insiders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 70-year-old Summers — who had sought dating advice from the dead pedophile in a trove of embarrassing emails that surfaced last week — had still been listed as an adviser on the hedge fund’s internal directory as recently as Friday morning.\n\n“They just terminated him,” a source told The Post after an email to the Summers’ DE Shaw address requesting comment bounced back.\n\n“Larry Summers is no longer a consultant to the firm,” a DE Shaw spokesperson said of the former chief economist of the World Bank, who was once described by the New York Times as the company’s “marquee hire” to drum up clients all over the world.\n\nThe spokesperson declined to provide further details about Summers’ departure from DE Shaw, which has more than $70 billion of assets under management. Summers did not return further calls or emails from The Post seeking comment.\n\nSummers had been a consultant on macroeconomics to the secretive financial giant since 2011. It is the latest blow for Summers after he was put on leave from his teaching gig at Harvard University this week. \n\nThe Obama and Clinton administration alum worked for the wildly lucrative investment firm “off-site” from Boston, a stone’s throw from Harvard’s Cambridge campus, and reported to one of the firm’s managing directors, Max Stone, the insiders said.\n\nHis first stint with the New York-based powerhouse began in 2006 when he joined as a managing director, bringing with him his long-time trusted adviser, Michael O’Mary, who joined the following year, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe one-time Harvard president left in late 2008 to become President Barack Obama’s top economics guru before returning as a consultant after Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary quit government for the second time.\n\nDE Shaw saw its algorithm-driven trades make it the most profitable hedge fund in 2024, raking in $11.1 billion for investors, according to Institutional Investor magazine.\n\nThe firm was founded by major Democratic donor David E. Shaw, who helped bankroll the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe company’s top brass have been some of the most vocal champions of DEI on Wall Street while effectively slapping gag orders on former employees, as The Post has previously reported.\n\nThe one-time president of the top college has also stepped back as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nIt comes amid revelations that Summers flew to Saint James on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express” with his wife, Elisa F. New, shortly after their Dec. 11, 2005, wedding in Cambridge.\n\nThey were accompanied by the disgraced financier’s infamous British madam, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted on sex trafficking charges, the Harvard Crimson reported Thursday.\n\nThe island getaway came six months after Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein for the rape of a 14-year-old girl, with a search warrant later executed on his mansion in October 2005.\n\nFlight logs show Summers flew to the 72-acre Caribbean island on Dec. 21, 2005 — and took Epstein’s jet, allegedly used to ferry victims and accomplices in his sex-trafficking rings, three other times.\n\nEmails released by a Dem-led congressional oversight panel also show the two men appeared to have had a close relationship right up to Epstein’s arrest in July six years ago.\n\nThe pervy pair often discussed women, politics and Harvard-related business in hundreds of emails exchanged between 2013 and 2019, according to the treasure trove of messages.\n\nIn one missive, Summers joked that women were less intelligent than men.\n\n“I observed that half the IQ in world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population,” Summers wrote Epstein in October 2017, without providing further context.\n\nIn another online back-and-forth in March 2019, Summers asked Epstein for romantic advice.\n\n“I dint [sic] want to be in a gift-giving competition while being the friend without benefits,” Summers told Epstein while discussing his pursuit of a woman, adding that “she must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.”\n\nSummers — who helmed the elite university between 2001 and 2006 and was a tenured economics professor there since 1983 — resigned from the board of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, on Wednesday amid a firestorm over his ties to the infamous predator.","summary":"Sources said Summers was still listed as an adviser on the company's internal directory as recently as this morning.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/21/business/larry-summers-forced-out-of-consulting-gig-at-woke-hedge-fund-de-shaw-after-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/115973873.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/skQfoq0v-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:24:49","author":"James Franey","authors":["James Franey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":381384344,"title":"The Real Reason Eric Swalwell Is Running for Governor","text":"Swalwell, who represents California’s solidly blue 14th district, entered the already crowded Democratic primary, which suggests that his campaign is more about positioning than governing. Think about it, do you think it’s a coincidence he’s jumping in just as Katie Porter’s support keeps slipping and Sen. Alex Padilla declared he’s not running? He seems primed to jump in and become the frontrunner. But I don’t buy for a second that he wants to be governor.\n\nHis messaging gives the game away. “I'm running for Governor because prices are too high and people are scared. California's next governor has two jobs,” his campaign website says. “One, keep the worst president in history out of our homes, out of our streets, and out of our lives.’\n\nHe’s not talking about Barack Obama or Joe Biden.\n\nI will be California's fighter and protector. Our state is under attack. The President has militarized our streets, canceled cancer research, zeroed out clean energy climate projects, and is chasing our immigrant friends and neighbors through their workplaces, kids' schools, and houses of worship. A lot of candidates talk about taking on Trump. I'm taking him on in real time. My January 6 lawsuit is one of the only lawsuits against the President that survived his new presidency. Speaker Pelosi selected me to help lead his impeachment, and today, I'm leading the Democrats' effort in the House to investigate January 6.\n\nDoes this sound like a guy who’s running for governor of California, or is he hoping to position himself as the face of the anti-Trump resistance in California with the ultimate goal of setting up another presidential run?\n\nI think we all know the answer.\n\nSwalwell holds a locked-down blue district with no term limits, so he doesn’t face pressure to give up his seat. An open Senate seat in California could take years to materialize. The governor’s race gives him a real shot to establish himself as a key figure of the Trump resistance.\n\nThe political landscape also lines up in his favor.\n\nA successful bid for governor would give him a whole year to posture as California’s Trump-Resister-in-Chief. At the same time, former Governor Gavin Newsom has to spend the entire time clinging to relevance without any actual power to wield.\n\nOf course, Swalwell’s run isn’t without baggage. The cloud of a scandal involving an affair with a Chinese spy while he was on the House Intelligence Committee hangs over him like a guillotine. That, combined with his public image issues, will offer easy ammunition for rival candidates eager to derail his ambitions.\n\nRecommended: Bill and Hillary Clinton Ordered to Testify on Jeffrey Epstein\n\nHis original presidential run was underwhelming at best, and this latest gambit seems calculated to create a fresh narrative as the evergreen Trump adversary. Holding California’s top office would give Swalwell a platform, visibility, and a storyline to re-enter the national spotlight with a vengeance. It’s less about governing and more about positioning for what he really wants: the Oval Office.\n\nDo you remember Swalwell’s 2020 presidential campaign? I can’t blame you if you don’t, because it barely got off the ground. It was like a loud fart that vanished quickly. He entered the Democratic primary with a pitch built on youth and energy, aiming to set himself apart from Biden and the other older contenders. \n\nVoters never bought it. His fundraising stalled, his polling stayed flat. By midsummer, his campaign ran out of gas due to a lack of money and momentum. He bowed out in July 2019 after only three months as a candidate. Even Kamala Harris held on longer. In the end, Democrats chose the old white guy instead of the young white guy. \n\nSwalwell is clearly taking a page from Gavin Newsom’s playbook. He’s watched the governor turn Sacramento into a launching pad for a 2028 presidential run, and now he wants his own spotlight. By making a play for the governorship, Swalwell isn’t just aiming for a promotion; he’s positioning himself to leapfrog Newsom and grab the Democratic nomination for himself.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/11/21/the-real-reason-eric-swalwell-is-running-for-governor-n4946269","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/230/df668b79-adcf-4d32-90b4-b97fe6838d3e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:16:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.214},{"id":381386708,"title":"NYT, Politico: Say, Why Is the DNC Taking Out a $15M Loan?","text":"Good question. Maybe the inflation of the Biden Regency has impacted the prices of political campaigns? \n\nOf course, Republicans don't seem to have the same issues with donors as Democrats. Nor do they have the same leftover bills that Kamala Harris left the DNC, either.\n\nDNC chair Ken Martin paints the move to tap credit as a sign of investment, but the New York Times doesn't quite buy it:\n\nThe Democratic National Committee took out a $15 million loan last month to replenish its shrunken coffers before elections in Virginia and New Jersey and to keep operations fully funded entering 2026, according to party officials and documents reviewed by The New York Times.Tapping a line of credit outside the crucible of a midterm or presidential election year is unusual for a major party committee, and it is the latest sign of financial distress for the official arm of the Democratic Party.The D.N.C. entered November with $18.3 million on hand — $15 million of which came from the loan.By contrast, the Republican National Committee entered November with $91.2 million in the bank and no debts.\n\nI put this in the Final Word last night, but it's worth a deeper look. Had it not been for this loan, it appears that the DNC would have been entirely tapped out a week before the elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City. The money struggles have continued all year, as Breitbart noted at the time that Martin attempted to reverse the drain:\n\nDemocrat National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin is trying to rally the troops after his party’s major losses in 2024 while grappling with the fact the committee is strapped for cash.Turmoil and pressure have been growing as some influential leaders within the group have stepped down, the Hill reported on Sunday.Founder and Executive Director of Defend the Vote Brian Lemek, who is also a Democrat strategist, said, “Ken Martin is stepping into a really difficult situation right now, and I would say he was elected and they handed him a mop and a bucket.”The news also comes amid reports of infighting within the Democrat Party as it lacks clear leadership. It is also important to note the DNC recently voted to remove gun control activist David Hogg as vice chair, per Breitbart News.\n\nIf anything, matters have grown worse. One reason for this is that the DNC is still paying down Harris' campaign debt from last year, as I wrote about last month. Martin and the DNC had paid $20 million already as of the end of September. Separately, the DNC claimed they had finished September with $15.2 million cash-on-hand. That means the DNC burned a net $12 million in October, and nearly tapped out. Three months earlier, Martin had claimed that the DNC was \"breaking grassroots fundraising records,\" but if that's the case, why would the DNC need a loan?\n\nPolitico asked Martin to explain, but the answer was less than specific:\n\n“We can’t win elections or fight back against Trump if the D.N.C. downsizes operations like it often does after a presidential cycle,” Martin said in a statement. “I made a bet that investing early would build power, rack up wins and rally supporters back to the table. That bet is paying off.” ...The DNC also spent $16.9 million in October, the most it has spent in any single month this year. Driving that total was election-related spending: The national party spent over $6 million in New Jersey and Virginia to boost Democratic gubernatorial candidates, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Pennsylvania to help retain control of the state’s Supreme Court.Democrats won all those races.\n\nTrue. However, all those races took place in blue jurisdictions too, with the arguable exception of Pennsylvania, which is purple at best these days in statewide races. These also took place in an off-year cycle, an environment which usually rewards better-organized campaigns. Martin's spending in October helped boost that organizing, but the problem Democrats will face is that the spending and the lack of donor success in 2025 will likely mean fewer organizing resources in 2026, especially if the Mamdani movement delivers on its threats to primary dozens of Democrat incumbents in the House and Senate. \n\nMartin has a few months to fix the income issue for the DNC before this becomes a critical problem for the midterms. If they're taking out loans now, though, perhaps the problem may already have hit the critical stage. And given that Martin had to take out the loan during their Schumer Shutdown Fundraiser just to avoid overdrawing their accounts, I suspect that Martin's fundraising woes will only get worse from here. \n\nEditor’s Note: After more than 40 days of screwing Americans, a few Dems have finally caved.

We’ve always had tough times.” \n\n Calling himself “very hopeful” and “optimistic,” Leno added, “Stuff that used to be the law is now against the law, and that’s great.”\n\n However, he has a unique philosophy when it comes to addressing political change. \n\n “Ultimately, it’s a bit like a donkey, sometimes you’ve gotta hit in the head with a 2 x 4 to get its attention, but eventually it’ll listen,” he quipped. \n\n This isn’t the first time Leno has spoken about foregoing politics in his comedy. \n\n “Why shoot for just half an audience all the time?” Leno asked during a July interview with Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute President & CEO David Trulio. “I like to bring people into the big picture… I don’t understand why you would alienate one particular group.” \n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In recent months, late-night hosts have come under fire from President Donald Trump’s administration. Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show announced it was coming to an end in May 2026 against the host’s wishes.\n\n The show’s network, CBS, cited financial reasons, but the decision came after its parent company, Paramount settled with President Trump for $16 million after he alleged that CBS News' 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount was also in the midst of a merger with entertainment company Skydance at the time — a deal that needed approval from the Trump administration.\n\n Then in September, Jimmy Kimmel’s ABC show Jimmy Kimmel Live! was temporarily taken off the air amid backlash surrounding his comments about the death of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk. Trump has since called for Kimmel’s firing and the show’s cancellation multiple times. \n\n The Trump administration has also called out the Tonight Show’s current host, Jimmy Fallon, and Late Night host Seth Meyers, whom Trump recently suggested NBC “fire immediately.\"","summary":"The former 'Tonight Show' host said he doesn't want to alienate his audience","url":"https://people.com/jay-leno-ticket-sales-went-up-30-percent-when-stopped-talking-politics-11854772","image":"https://people.com/thmb/HwBQ9Im6R3i_2dF1myfXYljzarQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(722x455:724x457)/Jay-Leno-Orpheum-Theatre-Kansas-112125-tout-4bc391af9586490b905f1aca96662c2e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:36:14","author":"Rachel McRady","authors":["Rachel McRady"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.035},{"id":381375668,"title":"A crowded field of Democrats is filling up the California governor’s race","text":"With California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) term-limited and ineligible to run again, a massive group of contenders is lining up to take his job running the Golden State. Given the state’s strong liberal lean, most headlines have been focused on the Democratic candidates, many of whom have served or are currently serving major roles in government. But now they are looking to secure a seat in Sacramento come November 2026.\n\nOver a dozen Democratic candidates\n\nThe numerous Democrats who have declared their candidacy include “former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and activist billionaire Tom Steyer,” said NBC News. Rep. Eric Swalwell, one of the most high-profile California congressmen, has also joined the race.\n\nSwalwell “gained prominence during President Donald Trump’s first term in office when he was heavily involved in both impeachment proceedings,” said NBC News, and he has previously run for president. His opponents are “emblematic of the current state of the California gubernatorial race: A wide-open contest, shaping up to be one of the most expensive political battles of 2026,” said Bloomberg.\n\nSteyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, is “pitching himself as a Democratic anti-corporate crusader who would spur housing production,” said Bloomberg. Porter was originally seen as a frontrunner, but her “bid was tarnished after she angrily confronted a television reporter and a video of her shouting at a staffer surfaced.” However, she “still leads Democratic contenders with 11% of support.” Villaraigosa “says he has the experience his rivals lack, but has so far steered clear of specific proposals.”\n\nAs former President Joe Biden’s HHS secretary, Becerra has some name recognition from his time at the White House. But he has also become embroiled in a scandal “involving his closest aides siphoning money from one of his campaign accounts,” said Politico. There is also a major name notably not running: former Vice President Kamala Harris, who ruled out a run for governor earlier this year. California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was also considered a potential contender, but like Harris, he has declined a bid.\n\n‘Lack of a blockbuster candidate’\n\nDespite the number of candidates, the gubernatorial contest remains a “sleepy race filled with candidates looking for ways to catch fire in the 2026 election,” said the Los Angeles Times. Interest in the race among voters “remains relatively moribund” due to the influx of people running. However, the “lack of a blockbuster candidate in the race” has prompted others, such as Steyer, to throw their name into the ring.\n\nEven as the candidate pool narrows down, it will be an uphill battle, as “getting elected governor of California is a difficult task, requiring the creation of a large apparatus to plan and execute a campaign strategy and raising tens of millions of dollars to pay for it,” said CalMatters. The “uncertainty underscores not only the daunting logistics of a California campaign, but perhaps some hesitancy” about running the state itself.","summary":"Over a dozen Democrats have declared their candidacy","url":"https://theweek.com/politics/crowded-field-democrats-california-governor","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQboib8a8yXWtJCpJsTqPP-2000-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:35:30","author":"Justin Klawans","authors":["Justin Klawans"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.082},{"id":381375926,"title":"Hakeem Jeffries Totally Melts Down on CNBC When Host Obliterates His Talking Points","text":"There’s a reason why Rep.

They can't buy houses. They can't educate anybody. There was the CEO of Ford saying there's 5,000 auto mechanic jobs that they have that they can't fill. \"I think that this country made two bad bets,\" Carville added, \"And they both seemed like good bets at the time.

Then I Saw An Old Photo — And What I Discovered Next Left Me Shaken.","text":"Part of that victory can be seen in a viral photograph from last year that is now forgotten because the news cycle has moved on. It’s a snapshot of Kamala Harris taken last summer during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It was shot from the point of view of a brown biracial girl in a pink pantsuit and pigtails, transfixed as she gazes upward at Harris from the front row at the United Center in Chicago. The girl is Amara, Harris’ great-niece, age 8.\n\nIt’s easy to see why the photo went viral. It was a sneak preview of a Brown New America. The U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority country (the majority of citizens will be non-white) by 2044. The number of people who identify as multiracial increased by 276% over the past decade. Advertisements today routinely depict interracial couples, straight and gay, along with their children. And some of our most prominent public figures — Obama, Harris, film director Jordan Peele and NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes — are biracial.\n\nThe acceptance of interracial marriage cuts across racial and partisan lines. Harris and Doug Emhoff, her Jewish husband, were the first interracial couple to reach the highest levels of the executive branch, but they were immediately followed by another interracial couple, GOP Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, the daughter of Indian immigrants. Some white supremacists objected to Usha Vance’s race but even within the MAGA universe there is widespread acceptance of the Vances’ interracial marriage.\n\nSomeday, perhaps soon, an interracial couple will occupy the White House.\n\nIt’s easy to miss, but Usha Vance’s ascension and Harris’ groundbreaking run for the White House represents one of the greatest victories of the Civil Rights Movement: the normalization of interracial marriage and biracial people throughout America. When Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 2022, few if any news stories dwelled on the fact that her husband is white.\n\nThe casual acceptance of interracial couples at even the highest echelon of American life demonstrates something that’s so important to remember today: how quickly people’s attitudes on seemingly intractable issues can shift. When a Gallup poll asked Americans about their views on marriage between Black and white people in 1958, only 4% approved. Gallup asked the same question in 2021, and 94% approved — an all-time high. Public opinion about one of the most entrenched racial taboos in American history went from near-universal disapproval to virtual universal approval within a lifetime. \n\nHow did this happen? The quick answer is that in June 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down “anti-miscegenation” laws in the Loving v. Virginia case. But something else also made it happen. It was a choice that certain people made and a type of courage they all displayed. One of them was my mom.\n\nI only saw my mom as this fragile flower, but my brother, Patrick, was the first to notice another side to her. One morning, he took her to a hair salon that served women in a group home where our mom lived. She had been transferred to the home with other women with severe mental illnesses after Crownsville was shut down, in part, for mistreating patients. While they were waiting, our mom watched a hairdresser berate and throw hair products at a woman sitting in her chair.\n\n“She’s a bitch,” my mom said, her eyes narrowed on the hairdresser. \n\nPatrick had never heard our mother speak in such an indignant tone before. He suppressed a smile.\n\n“Mom, do you know you just said a bad word?”\n\n“I’m sorry, Pat.” Our mom briefly paused, then added, “But she is a bitch.”\n\nAs I dug deeper into old family stories, I discovered that my mom had long been infuriated by any display of injustice. She glared back at white people who stared at her while she walked in public with my father in the early 1960s. Sometimes she’d say, “You act like you ain’t never seen people before.” She and my father trashed a bar when the bartender refused to serve them. Once, I heard my mom say she had been arrested as a young woman. For what, I inquired. “For opening my big fat mouth,” she said with a wide grin.\n\nEven her illness couldn’t erase her spirit of defiance. I hated visiting her group homes. Some were run by good people who treated my mom with compassion, but many seemed designed to crush whatever humanity was left of those consigned there. Unscrupulous caretakers stole from or bullied people in their care. Some confined them to squalid, roach-infested rooms. When I came in to greet my mom, I’d often see heavily medicated residents sitting on couches, staring zombie-like at soap operas on television. Most of them hadn’t received a visitor in years. There were few smiles or genuine laughter in these environments. But my mom could somehow bring light into the most desolate places.\n\nPatrick sneaked into a group home to surprise our mom one morning, only to be shocked by what he saw: our mother bopping and weaving down a “Soul Train” dance line as the group home staff and residents cheered her on. Any gifts we sent her quickly disappeared because, we discovered, she gave most of them away to other group home members who she said needed them more. And when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, her caretaker had to buy a separate living room chair for my mom to enforce social distancing rules. All of the group home members wanted to sit near her.","summary":"\"My father... didn’t think I could handle [the truth] until I became a young man.”\n\nView Entire Post &rsaquo;","url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnblake/schizophrenia-mental-health-stigma-broken-family-essay-sc","image":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2025-06/23/18/thumb/VDzUrFByy.jpg?crop=2542:1695;229,152&resize=1250:830&resize=1200:*","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:21:02","author":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,John Blake","authors":["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about","John Blake"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.089},{"id":381370202,"title":"Alarm in Georgia—Qcells cuts salaries and suspends production due to solar components being held up at the","text":"The economy continues to hit Americans hard. Qcells, the US solar manufacturing subsidiary of the South Korean Hanwha Group, announced the temporary suspension of 1,000 employees at its Georgia factories. The main reason is that shipments of essential components from abroad are being routinely held up by US customs officials.\n\nThe company stated that delays have limited its ability to maintain production lines at full capacity\n\nThe news is clear: solar energy company Qcells will temporarily reduce the pay and working hours of approximately one-third of its employees in this area of ​​northwest Georgia. The company stated that delays have limited its ability to maintain production lines at full capacity. Qcells has committed to investing $2.5 billion to build a complete solar panel supply chain in the United States to compete with China. The reduced hours are expected to affect about 1,000 employees at Qcells plants in Dalton and Cartersville, where U.S. customs authorities have detained imported components used in the manufacture of solar panels.\n\n“It’s creating a sort of vacuum effect at the beginning, so people can’t get the supplies they need”\n\nRegarding this, Carl Gabrini, interim assistant dean of the Wright School of Business at Dalton State College, said, “It’s creating a sort of vacuum effect at the beginning, so people can’t get the supplies they need.” Qcells manufactures solar cells in Malaysia and South Korea, which are then imported for assembly into panels. In addition to temporary layoffs, the company confirmed plans to lay off approximately 300 employees.\n\nIn 2023, Qcells, a leading solar module manufacturer, announced a $2.5 billion investment to expand its operations in Georgia\n\nThis announcement comes months after the company reported that some of its solar cell shipments had been detained at U.S. ports under a 2021 law banning imports from China’s Xinjiang region due to concerns about forced labor. Later, in 2023, Qcells, a leading solar module manufacturer, announced a $2.5 billion investment to expand its operations in Georgia. “Qcells expects to resume full production in the coming weeks and months. Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains strong,” Qcells spokeswoman Marta Stoepker said in a statement.\n\nBack in 2023, following Qcells’ investment, Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Dalton plant and called it “the largest community solar investment in our nation’s history.” Now, Qcells has implemented temporary reduced hours and furloughs for approximately half of its manufacturing employees at its Cartersville and Dalton, Georgia, plants. Jesse Lee, senior advisor to the clean energy organization Climate Power, stated that the decision represents a setback for the community and the clean energy sector as a whole. Meanwhile, Marta Stoepker has also said, “We will soon be back up and running with our full team in Georgia, delivering American-made energy to communities across the country.”\n\n“It’s a real shame they’ve had their support withdrawn in this way”\n\n“They were laying the groundwork for the United States to become competitive in the clean energy and solar power sector,” Lee stated. Qcells is currently finalizing a $2.3 billion plant in Cartersville to manufacture ingots, wafers, and solar cells—the building blocks of finished solar modules. However, Lee made it clear that “it’s a real shame they’ve had their support withdrawn in this way.”\n\nFinally, as mentioned in previous paragraphs, a company spokesperson confirmed that while most of the delayed shipments are now clearing customs, the significant delays necessitated reducing production capacity and implementing workforce actions to improve operational efficiency. Stoepker added that shipments that had been held are now being released by customs authorities, but the delays have forced the company to reduce production. Regarding the temporary layoffs, affected workers will retain all benefits, and the company expects to resume full production and bring back the suspended staff “in the coming weeks and months.”","url":"https://eladelantado.com/en/qcells-cuts-salaries-suspends-production/","image":"https://eladelantado.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/qcells-georgia-employe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:00:22","author":"Diana Elizabeth Orozco","authors":["Diana Elizabeth Orozco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"es","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":381358366,"title":"Karine Jean-Pierre's party registration revealed ... as her book touted her 'independence'","text":"Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declared herself an 'independent' and wrote an entire book about it.\n\nBut she forgot one important step in leaving the Democratic Party. \n\nDespite having misgivings about her party since last July, she didn't change her voter registration until just before the book was coming out - and there's currently no record of that change on file. \n\nIn a voter profile report obtained from the Maryland State Board of Elections by the Daily Mail, Jean-Pierre's registration is listed as 'active' and her party is listed as 'Democratic.' \n\nThe report, compiled on October 27, 2025, said that Jean-Pierre last voted with a provisional ballot in the general election last year. \n\nA source familiar told the Daily Mail that the former press secretary changed her registration by mail, so she could properly indicate she wanted no party affiliation, and did so in late September or early October of this year.\n\nHer book was released on October 21.\n\nThe source also pointed out that there were no important elections in Maryland this year.\n\nJean-Pierre first registered in the state in 2014 and has been an active voter since.\n\nShe even took the time to vote in Maryland's May 2024 Democratic primary, when her boss, President Joe Biden, was a shoo-in, as Representative Dean Phillips, who appeared on the Maryland ballot, had already dropped out, and the president was only running against self-help guru Marianne Williamson. \n\nJean-Pierre wrote in Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines that she started thinking about leaving the Democratic Party on the heels of Biden dropping out of the presidential race in July 2024. \n\n'You know what?

It’s the greatest country in the world,” Swalwell told the comedian. “But that’s why it pisses me off to see Californians running through the fields where they work from [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents or troops in our streets. It’s horrifying.”\n\nAfter announcing his bid on the controversial late-night show, Swalwell posted a video on X early Friday morning that focuses on his efforts to oppose Trump.\n\nThe next governor of California will have only “two jobs,” according to Swalwell. The first is to “keep the worst president in our history out of our homes, out of our streets, and out our lives.”\n\nThe ad shows scenes from “No Kings” protests as Swalwell claims, “No one will keep Californians safer. No one.”\n\n“Californians will never bend the knee,” the California congressman adds.\n\nSwalwell also touted his efforts to impeach Trump in the president’s first term. “Nancy Pelosi selected me for the Intelligence Committee and to help lead the impeachment of a corrupt president,” Swalwell boasts.\n\nThe congressman and now-Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., were both removed from their roles on that Intelligence Committee at the start of the 118th Congress in 2023. Swalwell was also an impeachment manager for the second failed impeachment effort.\n\nThe second job of the next governor is to “bring us a new California.”\n\nSwalwell has served as a congressman since 2013.

Gavin Newsom in a statement to The Daily Signal. “Eric Swalwell lacks the integrity and judgment that will be critical to restore California after 8 years of Gavin Newsom’s disastrous leadership. The latest public polling has shown that Californians are rallying to Sheriff Bianco’s campaign because they know they need a sheriff as their next Governor,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to the Swalwell campaign, the Porter campaign, and the Hilton campaign, but did not receive comment upon publication.","summary":"Rep.

The former representative Katie Porter led early surveys, but has struggled to shake off concerns about her temperament after she threatened to walk out of a local television interview and after footage surfaced of her berating a staff member. Porter has since apologized for her behavior but reports suggest Democratic strategists are searching for an alternative.\n\nOther Democrats include the former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the former state attorney general and US representative Xavier Becerra and the former state controller Betty Yee.

The party’s fundraising numbers have improved slightly in recent months, and it raised $7.5 million from donors in October, not far off from the same month in 2021.\n\nAdding to the DNC's woes, the party spent the earlier part of 2025 cleaning up the mess left behind by Kamala Harris's billion-dollar boondoggle 2024 presidential campaign. The committee paid off $18 million in leftover campaign expenses, money that could have been used to build infrastructure for the coming cycle instead of settling old bills.\n\nRecommended: Biden’s Weaponization of the DOJ Against GOP Lawmakers Was Worse Than We Thought \n\nI think much of the Democrats’ fundraising problems are because of Kamala.

President Trump suggested the bonus idea, along with docked pay for those who skipped shifts, but there are no plans to dock pay at this time. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association reports that only 311 of its members will receive the bonus, meaning some managers must be included in the total figure.\nFlying with dignity: “Let’s bring civility and manners back,” urges Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a new ad bemoaning the unruly state of air travel in America. The ad begins with images of air travel in a bygone era, when travelers wore suits, shook hands, and greeted one another with a smile. It then takes a sharp turn, showing the fistfights, arguments over reclining seats, and pajama-clad travelers that have become all too common today. Duffy asks travelers if they’re helping pregnant women with their luggage, dressing with respect, keeping control of their children, or saying “please” and “thank you.” “It’s not your imagination,” Duffy remarked on X, “traveling has become more uncivilized!” Indeed, the FAA has reported a 400% increase in outbursts on airplanes since 2019. Let’s hope Secretary Duffy can jumpstart a new “golden age” of air travel with polite, well-dressed passengers.\n\nThe CDC’s vaccine-autism amendment: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has rescinded its language on childhood vaccines and autism. Prior to Wednesday, the CDC’s statement on the subject read: “Studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.” That language has been replaced with the following: “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.” It further adds key points, stating, “Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities. HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.” This is quite the reversal for the CDC, which will likely fuel more claims of politicization and public distrust of the agency.\nArctic Frost update: The investigation into Jack Smith’s Arctic Frost probe continues to heat up. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan revealed yesterday that his phone records from January 2020 through April 2022 were improperly subpoenaed. Verizon claims to have uncovered its own compliance with the subpoena as part of its investigation and handed it over to Jordan at the first opportunity. Verizon’s explanation may not survive scrutiny, as the company has already taken flak for simply complying with the subpoena without even attempting to push back as AT&T did.\nIran nukes IAEA deal: Iran announced that it has ended an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency it signed in September that would have allowed the nuclear watchdog to relaunch inspections of the nation’s nuclear facilities. Tehran said that it distrusts the IAEA’s “credibility and independence.” Iran took this action in response to the IAEA’s request that Tehran provide it with accurate data on its nuclear materials and facilities “without delay.” Since President Trump green-lighted the bombing of Iran’s nuclear development facilities in June, Iran has rebuffed outside efforts to assess the state of its nuclear development efforts. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran was interested in making a “fair and balanced” deal and was ready for negotiations. Trump acknowledged this sentiment this week, claiming that Iran “very badly wants to make a deal,” which he would be open to considering.\nPollaganda predicts a blue-wave midterm: Polls are very often propaganda, e.g., the 2024 Des Moines Register poll that showed Kamala Harris ahead in Iowa by three points. However, polls can be useful measures of the electorate when carefully examined. An NPR poll released this week shows Democrats securing 55% of the vote in a generic congressional race. It’s the largest lead Democrats have seen in a poll since 2017. However, other results in the poll seemingly contradict that lead — Democrats take the majority of the blame for the government shutdown, for instance. President Trump’s approval rating is at its lowest point this term, which political pundit Ben Shapiro attributes to two factors: affordability and the Epstein files. Epstein seems unlikely to be a swing issue a year from now, but affordability fits strategist James Carville’s famous maxim, “It’s the economy, stupid!” Republicans should focus on affordability if they want to win in 2026.\nGlobal warming sets COP30 ablaze: On Thursday, a blaze broke out at the UN’s annual climate conference being held in Belém, Brazil. The fire engulfed the pavilion roof of a section of the COP30 conference facilities known as the “Blue Zone.” Firefighters quickly contained it, and no injuries were reported. The incident is being investigated. According to reports, UN officials had instructed Brazilian authorities to address several concerns at the conference facility, including the unbearable heat and an insufficient number of security personnel. COP30’s “Blue Zone” was described as an area “for official negotiations, the Leaders’ Summit, and national pavilions.” Apparently, all that focused talk of global warming was enough to ignite an actual fire.\n\n“Quiet. Quiet, piggy”: After President Trump’s first election in 2017, we pleaded with him to adopt our editorial policy when dealing with obnoxious people: “Don’t swap spit with a jackass.” We hoped he would curb his penchant for petulant insults, which become distractions from his agenda. Now, some insults are earned and clever, but most back then were just juvenile. But since taking office in 2025, a very different Trump has emerged, and the petulant insults have almost disappeared. Almost. Last Friday, in a noisy Air Force One exchange with Bloomberg’s Catherine Lucey, amid serious questions about serious matters, she rudely pressed Trump on a 2019 Jeffrey Epstein email that the Left claims implies Trump “knew about the girls.” What Trump knew was that Epstein was trying to recruit women from Mar-a-Lago, and Trump expelled Epstein from the club in 2007, describing him as “creepy.” The two hated each other from then on. Responding to Lucey’s question, Trump said, “Quiet. Quiet, piggy.” The Leftmedia have now elevated “Piggy” to front-page news. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded, “He calls out fake news when he sees it. He gets frustrated with reporters when you lie about him, when you spread fake news about him and his administration.” Another White House official said, “This reporter behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way towards her colleagues on the plane.” Of the insult, Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar concluded as do many: “President Trump is a very picturesque and difficult and different type of politician. But I always say that I look at his policies and not at his personality.” Bottom line: The appropriate response to Lucey, as Trump says to other leftist reporters, is “Fake news!”\nDéjà vu: Chicago woman set on fire by career criminal In another preventable attack, a 26-year-old woman riding a Chicago train got into an argument with a 50-year-old man who then proceeded to pour liquid on her and set her on fire. The man was caught on video saying, “Burn alive, b***h!” The perpetrator, who was taken into custody, has a lengthy arrest history and was previously freed by a judge after he assaulted a social worker. “The person of interest,” according to Fox News, “has 22 prior arrests since 2016 and 53 criminal cases in Cook County dating back to 1993, including nine felonies that led to guilty pleas — though only two resulted in jail time, CWB Chicago reported.” The woman is in critical condition with severe burns. This follows Gov. JB Pritzker’s claims that Chicago is “safe” and “doesn’t need the National Guard.” These horrific crimes will continue until the judges who release criminals back onto the streets are held accountable for the violations that are perpetrated on law-abiding citizens.\nCatholic schools in Nigeria raided by suspected Muslim terrorists: The Christian Association of Nigeria and the Catholic Diocese of Kontagora condemned an early Friday morning attack on two Catholic schools where armed men kidnapped children, teachers, and a security guard. This comes after Nigeria has been officially labeled as a Country of Particular Concern due to Christian persecution, as well as after President Trump threatened to pull aid from the country if it didn’t start protecting its citizens from the multiple Muslim attacks and killings that have been plaguing the country. It’s time to stop threatening and act before more lives are destroyed and lost.\n\nUkraine agrees to enter negotiations on U.S.-backed plan to end war with Russia (Daily Signal)\nEric Swalwell running for California governor (CBS News)\nFormer GOP aide allegedly stages Jussie Smollet-style hoax (Not the Bee)\nHouse Ethics Committee investigating Cory Mills (Daily Signal)\nU.S. banks shelve $20 billion bailout plan for Argentina (WSJ)\nJudge Boasberg rules Meta does not have monopoly power in social media (Breitbart)\nScientists okay HHS report that found almost nothing to support “gender-affirming care” for kids (NY Post)\nFederal judge separates male inmates from female prison population (National Review)\nHumor: Do you have what it takes to be a professional journalist?

Land of 10,000 lakes, land of 10 trillion mosquitoes, land of 3M and Spam and those great Duluth Trading Company ads, home of the Vikings and the Mall of America and the not-so-great Walter Mondale, right?\n\nMinnesota, though, is also a stubbornly and mystifyingly blue state, which explains why it’s also home to one of the most generous welfare programs in the country. Minnesota Nice, right? But giving away free stuff has its flip side, and it’s for this reason, this generosity, that it’s also home to a section of Minneapolis called “Little Mogadishu” and to a large and ever-growing Somali community that’s literally changing the look of the state.\n\nWhat began in Somalia in the early ‘90s with famine, civil war, and societal collapse evolved into Blackhawk Down in 1993, followed by an ostensibly well-intentioned federal effort to resettle desperate Somalis in Minnesota in the mid-'90s. Chain migration, er, family reunification followed, and now the state’s largest city, Minneapolis, resoundingly calls its Muslims to prayer five times a day and is represented in Congress by a Jew-hating Muslim leftist who may have married her brother to skirt our nation’s immigration laws.\n\nIf I can mix my metaphors: No good deed on the well-paved Road to Hell goes unpunished. But I wonder: Did Minnesotans ever vote on this?\n\nMy guess is no, they never voted on this. Didn’t vote on their taxpayer funds going to free stuff for immigrants. Didn’t vote for the chain migration that allowed a tiny Somali community to blow up and take over their biggest city in a relative heartbeat.\n\nNor did Minnesotans vote on the sorry state of their financial affairs. As Ryan Thorpe and Chris Rufo write in City Journal: “Minnesota is drowning in fraud. Billions in taxpayer dollars have been stolen during the administration of Governor Tim Walz alone. Democratic state officials, overseeing one of the most generous welfare regimes in the country, are asleep at the switch. And the media, duty-bound by progressive pieties, refuse to connect the dots.”\n\nIf Minnesota were merely debt-ridden and fraud-fraught, it’d be largely indistinguishable from a lot of other blue states. But what makes Minnesota special is the type of fraud it’s fostering. I’ll let Thorpe and Rufo explain:\n\nIf you were to design a welfare program to facilitate fraud, it would probably look a lot like Minnesota’s Medicaid Housing Stabilization Services program. The HSS program, the first of its kind in the country, was launched with a noble goal: to help seniors, addicts, the disabled, and the mentally ill secure housing. It was designed with “low barriers to entry” and “minimal requirements for reimbursement.” Nonetheless, before the program went live in 2020, officials pegged its annual estimated price tag at $2.6 million. …\n\nOn September 18, [Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph] Thompson announced criminal indictments for HSS fraud against Moktar Hassan Aden, Mustafa Dayib Ali, Khalid Ahmed Dayib, Abdifitah Mohamud Mohamed, Christopher Adesoji Falade, Emmanuel Oluwademilade Falade, Asad Ahmed Adow, and Anwar Ahmed Adow — six of whom, according a U.S. Attorney’s Office spokesperson, are members of Minnesota’s Somali community. Thompson made clear that this is just the first round of charges for HSS fraud that his office will be prosecuting.\n\nGot that? It’s only the beginning. But here’s the “best” part: “According to multiple law-enforcement sources, Minnesota’s Somali community has sent untold millions through a network of … informal clan-based money-traders that have wound up in the coffers of Al-Shabaab,” which is an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist organization.\n\nHow, exactly, are they doing it? By fraudulently diagnosing their kids with autism, then taking that taxpayer-funded Medicaid money and sending some of it to terrorists. Nice.\n\nI can hear you saying, good reader, that I’m getting a bit carried away here with a tiny criminal minority of Minnesota’s glorious Somali diaspora. And perhaps I am. I mean, diversity is our strength, right? And immigrants make our country stronger and more prosperous, right?\n\nOr do they? I mean, if that were really the case, why wouldn’t they have simply stayed put and made their own country stronger and more prosperous? Same with all those Mexicans and Guatemalans and Venezuelans and Dearbornistanians, right? For some reason, no one ever seems to ask this question of the open-borders Democrats.\n\nOn the one hand, Minnesotans did elect an incompetent commie-symp, jazz-handsy, valor-stealing deployment-dodging beta male as their governor. But the Somali-immigrant horse had left the barn long before Tim Walz took office.\n\nStill, as De Maistre put it centuries ago, every people gets the government they deserve. And Minnesotans are now getting it good and hard.\n\nComment | Share\n\nMORE ANALYSIS\n\nThomas Gallatin: Artificial Intelligence Threatens White-Collar Jobs — Economists and developers are warning of a rapidly approaching jobs crisis, as AI is poised to eliminate thousands of entry-level white-collar jobs.\nEmmy Griffin: A Dystopian AI Grandmother Isn’t Progress — Modern-day spiritualism looks a lot like a creepy AI-generated avatar of your dead grandmother talking to your kids.\nBrian Mark Weber: Getting the GOP Back on Track — What voters see right now is Republicans acting more like the minority party and sleeping on the job.

She'd left a voice message on Whatsapp for her neighbors, imploring them to vote against Nicolás Maduro during the presidential election last July. We now reportedly have audio of the message that got her arrested. This is what she said (translated from Spanish): \n\nI don't know. I don't know how long we're going to have to keep enduring this Maduro dictatorship that's starving all Venezuelans to death, my God!

Please, someone do something.\n\nI know most of you don't speak Spanish, but I'm going to embed the recording anyway because you can hear the desperation in her voice.

Dr. Orozco is correct. There is not enough food. There is not enough medicine. That's why 8 million-ish Venezuelans have fled their country. And the most recent numbers suggest that the humanitarian crisis is worse than anyone knew. Entire generations are growing up starving.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 25 report from Caritas Venezuela, a non-profit organization and one of the few that isn't oppressed by the Maduro regime, \"child malnutrition has returned to levels equivalent to the worst years of the collapse,\" the \"collapse\" being what happened to the country's economy beginning in the 2010s, specifically around 2013-2014, when Hugo Chávez died and Nicolás Maduro took over. \n\nToday, 9.1% of the children in the country are moderately or severely malnourished, and another 29.5% are either malnourished or on the verge. Nearly half of those cases — 42% — are children under the age of two. Of those, 17.6% are infants under six months old. \n\nThe report also studied pregnant and lactating women in the country. Twenty-three percent of pregnancies are in adolescents, and 23% of those girls are at nutritional risk. Overall, 18% of all pregnant or lactating women are at nutritional risk. \n\nRelated: Maduro’s Backup Plan? Jesus, Apparently\n\nWhen it comes to families overall, 54% have had to ask for financial help with food, 59% have suffered food deprivation, and 32% depend on soup kitchens or other handouts to merely have a meal. And a whopping 90% of households lack access to potable water. \n\nBut those are just numbers. Let's put a face to them. Back in August, the Associated Press spoke with Alnilys Chirino, a 51-year-old mother of four. She said the only food in her house was \"a handful of peppers and wilting herbs, a kilo of rice, half that of beans, a bit of canned meat, some flour.\" She said she used to worry about the food spoiling too quickly in the heat, but these days, her food doesn't last long enough to go bad. \n\nChirino gets a government stipend of $4 a month. She also sells linens and accessories, which can earn her up to $70 a month. Every cent goes to food. Most of it is purchased from corner stores where she's able to keep a credit account. Unfortunately, the price of a basic basket of food is $500 in Venezuela. For what it's worth, the AP says that many of the economists who reported this information about the food were detained by the Maduro regime.\n\nHer children became malnourished a decade ago when Venezuela's economy collapsed, and now they're facing the same issue. They wake up with headaches and rarely have protein. Their mother says the last time she was able to purchase fresh meat was in May, and that was just two servings of ground beef. They often skip school because they don't feel well without eating. Chirino's daughter told her that one child at her school fainted recently due to the lack of food. On Sundays, the family attends Mass at their church, which also offers a soup kitchen afterward. Sometimes, her children are too weak to make it. Chirino herself doesn't eat until all of the children at the church, on some days around 70, have had something to eat. \n\nAccording to the AP, \"Maduro’s government typically supplies schools with frozen whole chickens and some combination of arepa flour, rice, pasta, beans, sardines, canned lunch meat, milk powder, lentils, salt and cooking oil. But teachers, cooks and administrators say what they receive is inconsistent and insufficient.\" Administrators and teachers often ask children to stay home when there is no food. When there is, the children beg for something extra to take home with them. \n\nAnd it's not just the children. Elderly pensioners must rely on an app called Sistema Patria to receive their monthly stipends, food, and medicine. It also tracks their social and political movements, rewarding loyalty to the regime. You didn't vote for Maduro? You might not get food or your pension that month. \n\nThat's pretty sad for the country that was once one of the wealthiest and best-educated democracies in the world, pre-Chávez and Maduro. Over the last decade, under Maduro's rule, the country has undergone several periods of decline. The first was in the mid-2010s due to the major economic, political, and social collapse that I mentioned. That one was bad, and the report suggests that current humanitarian conditions are just as bad as they were then. The pandemic caused another wave of decline, and in more recent years, hyperinflation, a crackdown on humanitarian aid, and a lack of jobs have contributed to the crisis. \n\nBut the fact is that none of this will change as long as the country is under the \"leadership\" of the narco-terrorist socialist Maduro. Here's more from La Gran Aldea: \n\nTherefore, any path to reversing this suffering requires addressing the root of the crisis. As long as a regime persists in Venezuela that destroyed the country's economic foundations, stole public funds during the years of greatest oil prosperity, and operates through mechanisms of violence and control, recovery will be impossible. Humanitarian aid, yes; urgent attention, indispensable. But a sustainable solution will only be viable when the country recovers its institutions, the rule of law, and a minimum of civic freedom—conditions incompatible with the continued existence of the regime that led Venezuela to this tragedy.\n\nOf course, not everyone in Venezuela is starving. The dictator, who earlier this week declared that he has a special relationship with and direct line to Jesus that would stop the United States from taking him down, also debuted his $1,085 Loro Piana shoes during his state TV program. Meanwhile, the average monthly salary in Venezuela is about $237 USD, with many public workers, like nurses, police officers, and teachers, earning much less — around $70 to $100 per month, which is paid via cash and vouchers. Eighty percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, though I've seen reports that suggest that number is even higher. The minimum wage is $3 USD per month. \n\nRather than report on this, the media largely ignores it in favor of crying over how Donald Trump is blowing up the narcos that leave the country. The Joe Biden/Kamala Harris administration's answer was to ease sanctions and attempt years of diplomacy with Maduro that achieved nothing but allowing him to stay in power and continue this tyranny. \n\nOn Thursday, opposition leader María Corina Machado re-posted the info from the report on X and promised that it would be the \"absolute priority from day one\" after Maduro falls and the rightfully elected president Edmundo González takes his place. For the people of Venezuela, that can't come fast enough.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/sarah-anderson/2025/11/21/the-children-starve-while-the-emperor-wears-1000-shoes-n4946230","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/201/45fefe59-15a6-4ed6-9273-8d8f19568177.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 16:29:00","author":"Sarah Anderson","authors":["Sarah Anderson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":381300222,"title":"The Editors: Friday Executive News Summary","text":"The CDC’s vaccine-autism amendment: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has rescinded its language on childhood vaccines and autism.

Verizon’s explanation may not survive scrutiny, as the company has already taken flak for simply complying with the subpoena without even attempting to push back as AT&T did.\n\nIran nukes IAEA deal: Iran announced that it has ended an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency it signed in September that would have allowed the nuclear watchdog to relaunch inspections of the nation’s nuclear facilities. Tehran said that it distrusts the IAEA’s “credibility and independence.” Iran took this action in response to the IAEA’s request that Tehran provide it with accurate data on its nuclear materials and facilities “without delay.” Since President Trump green-lighted the bombing of Iran’s nuclear development facilities in June, Iran has rebuffed outside efforts to assess the state of its nuclear development efforts. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran was interested in making a “fair and balanced” deal and was ready for negotiations. Trump acknowledged this sentiment this week, claiming that Iran “very badly wants to make a deal,” which he would be open to considering.\n\nPollaganda predicts a blue-wave midterm: Polls are very often propaganda, e.g., the 2024 Des Moines Register poll that showed Kamala Harris ahead in Iowa by three points. However, polls can be useful measures of the electorate when carefully examined. An NPR poll released this week shows Democrats securing 55% of the vote in a generic congressional race. It’s the largest lead Democrats have seen in a poll since 2017. However, other results in the poll seemingly contradict that lead — Democrats take the majority of the blame for the government shutdown, for instance. President Trump’s approval rating is at its lowest point this term, which political pundit Ben Shapiro attributes to two factors: affordability and the Epstein files. Epstein seems unlikely to be a swing issue a year from now, but affordability fits strategist James Carville’s famous maxim, “It’s the economy, stupid!” Republicans should focus on affordability if they want to win in 2026.\n\nGlobal warming sets COP30 ablaze: On Thursday, a blaze broke out at the UN’s annual climate conference being held in Belém, Brazil. The fire engulfed the pavilion roof of a section of the COP30 conference facilities known as the “Blue Zone.” Firefighters quickly contained it, and no injuries were reported. The incident is being investigated. According to reports, UN officials had instructed Brazilian authorities to address several concerns at the conference facility, including the unbearable heat and an insufficient number of security personnel. COP30’s “Blue Zone” was described as an area “for official negotiations, the Leaders’ Summit, and national pavilions.” Apparently, all that focused talk of global warming was enough to ignite an actual fire.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/122856-friday-executive-news-summary-2025-11-21","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01K5VEH3YVKJS6RJFZFAFGQJ98.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 16:16:47","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.653},{"id":381392438,"title":"Outside spending ramps up in special election for deep-red Tennessee seat","text":"A top Democratic super PAC is making a major investment into an upcoming Tennessee special election, seeking to make a statement ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nHouse Majority PAC, which has ties to House Democratic leadership, announced on Friday a $1 million investment across television and digital platforms to boost Democrat Aftyn Behn in the Dec. 2 election for Tennessee’s deep-red 7th District. \n\nBehn, a state representative, faces Republican Army veteran Matt Van Epps in the race to complete the unfinished term of GOP former Rep. Mark E. Green, who resigned earlier this year.\n\n“As Democrats have racked up wins by running on affordability and lowering costs — our momentum continues to build,” House Majority PAC spokesperson CJ Warnke said in a statement. “No Republican-held seat is safe, and HMP will do whatever it takes to win the House in 2026.”\n\nRepublican groups, led by President Donald Trump’s political operation, have made significant investments of their own in support of Van Epps, who previously served in Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s cabinet. \n\nBut Democrats are coming off strong performances in Virginia, New Jersey and other states in this month’s off-year elections, and have since turned their sights to the 7th District contest, set to be the final federal election of the year. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin visited the district earlier this month, and former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared Tuesday at an event for Behn in Nashville. \n\nVan Epps is favored to hold the largely rural Middle Tennessee seat, which includes parts of Nashville and was drawn by state Republicans to be safely red when they split up the Democratic-leaning city in the state’s most recent redistricting round. Trump carried the 7th District by 22 points last year, according to calculations by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. \n\nDemocrats, though, are hopeful the election could mark the latest in a string of overperformances for the party in special elections this year. \n\n“The special election nature of it allows us to really work around the gerrymandering in a productive way,” Behn said in a September interview. \n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are pulling all the stops to oppose Behn, a former organizer with the progressive group Indivisible, and blunt Democrats’ political momentum. MAGA Inc., a super PAC supporting Trump, has spent over $1 million on the race, while the political arm of the conservative Club for Growth has spent $328,000. Conservatives for American Excellence Inc., which has ties to GOP megadonors Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, had spent $672,000 as of Friday. \n\nVan Epps has also drawn on the support of party leaders, with Trump holding a telerally on his behalf last week. \n\nVan Epps and Behn each won competitive primaries in October to claim their party nominations. Boosted by a late Trump endorsement, Van Epps bested a crowded primary field with a majority of the vote. Behn narrowly prevailed over three opponents on the Democratic side. \n\nAccording to pre-general election fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission, Behn went into the final stretch of the campaign with a slight fundraising advantage. She raised $1.2 million through Nov. 12, including $1 million since Oct. 1. She ended the period with $522,000 on hand. Van Epps raised $993,000 through Nov. 12 and had $231,000 available heading into the campaign’s final weeks. \n\nInside Elections shifted its race rating Thursday from Solid Republican to Lean Republican.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/11/21/tennessee-special-election-democrats-republicans/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/21TNSPECIAL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 16:00:32","author":"Posted November 21, 2025 At 4:00pm","authors":["Posted November 21, 2025 At 4:00pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.121},{"id":381319546,"title":"Kamala’s emotion tour","text":"Harris uses such events to go through her own emotions about the election. In Nashville — at the city’s fabled Ryman Auditorium, for you country music fans — she recounted the pain of election night and the realization that she had lost: “I couldn’t, I was so inarticulate,” Harris said, “I couldn’t say anything except ‘my God, my God, my God, my God,’ when I learned the results.” Even with a year to contemplate events, she seemed no more articulate in Nashville than she had been during the campaign.\n\nLater, it was time for more emotion, this time in the form of the moderator’s anger at President Joe Biden for not handing the race over to Harris earlier or allowing her to be more independent of him: “I’m just back to those emotions I mentioned earlier,” Miller said to Harris. “Here’s the anger part that’s coming up in me. And I just have to do this. I just have to ask this part because to me, this is where I get frustrated with former President Biden, who I have nothing but respect for. But this was so consequential of an election, and the stakes were so high… and I appreciate that you wanted to have loyalty, I really do, but like, that’s a two-way street, right? And I feel like it was incumbent upon him to say to you — what did he call you? Kid? Kamala? Veep? — whatever he called you, to say to you, you go do what you need to do. If you need to throw me under the bus on a few things, you go do that, because we’ve got to beat this motherf*****. And instead, he did the opposite of that.” At the mention of the m-word — thought to be one of Harris’s favorites — there was more wild applause. And of course, no one had to ask who “this motherf*****” was.\n\nThe m-word popped up again from time to time. Miller wanted to know whether Harris was really a nanosecond away from calling Trump a “motherf*****” at their only debate. Harris wouldn’t say, but left the clear impression that the answer was yes. Of course, the crowd loved it; you really can’t call President Trump a “motherf*****” enough at a Harris event.\n\nSo what is going on? Obviously, some Harris supporters are still quite emotional about the events of 2024. Harris and her supporting cast are giving them a comforting experience. But in Nashville, as she has in other locations, Harris also politicked for local Democratic candidates. She expressed great love for the “Tennessee Three,” the state lawmakers who used a bullhorn and an angry crowd to take over the state House floor in 2023. Among Democrats, they are heroes for staging what others might call a mini-insurrection.\n\nIs this Harris’s 2028 campaign? Look at it this way: If she were running in 2028, this would be the kind of thing she would be doing. That doesn’t mean she’s definitely running, but it certainly doesn’t rule it out, either.\n\nPolls show Harris in second place in the nascent 2028 Democratic race, five points behind California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the RealClearPolitics average. That’s not a great place for a candidate who was Vice President of the United States and the party’s presidential standard-bearer in the last election. But it’s not out of the game, either. And if Harris’s book tour is any evidence, the former VP has a hard core of emotional support, especially among women voters who saw her as the last thing standing between themselves and what they believed would be the horror of a second Trump administration.","summary":"KAMALA’S EMOTION TOUR.&#160;Did you know that former Vice President Kamala Harris’s book tour is still going on?

(AP) — For weeks, a Tennessee special election was flying under the radar in a heavily Republican congressional district. But now funding from President Donald Trump’s allies and an appearance by former Vice President Kamala Harris have turned the Dec. 2 contest into a marquee political battle with potential consequences for next year’s midterms. \n\nThe race is the first for federal office since the Nov. 4 elections, when Democrats cruised to victories that were framed as a referendum on Trump. Now Republicans want to change the storyline, sinking money into the campaign and inviting Trump to visit the state after holding a virtual rally last week. \n\nFailing to run up the score — or worse, losing the seat — would be a sign of weakness, emboldening Democrats as they try to take back control of the U.S. House. If places like Tennessee’s 7th congressional district seem within reach, the party could expand its list of targets next year. \n\nMAGA Inc., a Trump-supporting super PAC, has reported more than $1 million in spending so far to support Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate and former Army helicopter pilot who served in combat tours overseas. It’s the first time that the organization has participated in a campaign since last year’s presidential race.\n\nWith the election taking place just days after Thanksgiving, “I’m very concerned that we could be caught with our pants down,” said Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican. \n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about the request for Trump to campaign for Van Epps, which was disclosed by two people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. \n\nState Rep. Aftyn Behn, the Democratic candidate and progressive community organizer, is getting national support of her own, including a recent visit by party chair Ken Martin and $1 million in television and digital advertising from the House Majority PAC reported on Friday.\n\nThe Tennessee Democratic Party hosted Harris for a canvassing kickoff on Tuesday while she was in Nashville on her book tour. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it hadn’t invited the former vice president, who didn’t appear with Behn even though they spoke at different times at the same event.\n\nLibby Schneider, deputy executive director at the Democratic National Committee, said a strong showing by Behn — even if she doesn’t win — will boost the party as it tries to take back control of the U.S. House next year. \n\n“We continue to overperform in places where we have no business overperforming,” Schneider said. \n\nIn four previous special House elections that were completed this year, the Democratic candidate exceeded Harris’ vote share by an average of 9 percentage points.\n\nA surprise retirement, then a race for the seat\n\nTennessee organized a special election after Republican Rep. Mark Green, first elected in 2018, retired earlier this year.\n\nGreen won the district by 21 percentage points in 2024, and Trump scored a similar margin. It was one of three seats redrawn in redistricting in 2022 that attempted to erode the influence of Nashville, the state’s largest city and a Democratic bastion. \n\nVan Epps, a former state general services commissioner, has closely aligned himself with Trump, whose endorsement helped him win a crowded primary.\n\n“I will have your back 100%,” he told the president during the virtual rally. He pledged to focus on lowering costs and helping veterans, plus supporting Trump’s immigration enforcement and rules preventing transgender women from playing on women’s sports teams. \n\nBehn, who describes herself as a “pissed off social worker,” narrowly won Democrats’ four-way primary. She supported Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential primary, and she was removed from the Tennessee House gallery in 2019 for shouting in protest of the former speaker.\n\nLike Democrats who emerged victorious in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere earlier this month, Behn has been hammering away at concerns about affordability. She’s emphasized her proposal to eliminate a state tax on groceries.\n\n“We have been building the coalition of the disenchanted,” Behn said at a recent Nashville rally. “If you are upset about the cost of living and the chaos of Washington, we are your campaign.”\n\nBehn has condemned Trump’s tax and spending legislation known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and his tariffs, both of which Van Epps supports. She also has criticized Republicans’ reluctance to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a sex offender who became infamous for his connections to the rich and powerful. \n\nVan Epps originally opposed a House vote to force the Justice Department to disclose more documents, but changed his stance to mirror Trump after the president backed the measure this week. \n\nHigh stakes brings big money\n\nDemocratic allies hope to undermine Van Epps by promoting Jon Thorp, a conservative independent candidate in the race. Your Community PAC, which has spent more than $16 million supporting Democratic candidates across the country since last year, is sending out mailers that encourage Republicans to vote for Thorp by describing Van Epps as a “hedge fund billionaire-backed RINO.”\n\nThe bulk of the PAC’s funding has come from North Fund, a nonprofit umbrella group for left-of-center advocacy organizations. \n\nConservatives for American Excellence, backed by megadonor Ken Griffin, is spending over $600,000 in advertisements opposing Behn, according to a campaign finance report filed this week.\n\nAnd Club for Growth, a pro-school voucher group heavily involved during the primary, is targeting Behn over past remarks where she described herself as “radical.” The group has spent $300,000 on advertising so far. \n\nChip Saltsman, a Tennessee political strategist not involved in the race, said the slew of spending does not change his expectation that Van Epps will win. But he could fall short of previous margins.\n\nHe suggested that Republicans take “a extra couple swigs of Pepto Bismol on election night.”\n\nThe situation could “cause a little heartburn, but they’re doing everything they need to do.”\n\nAskarinam and Cappelletti reported from Washington.

And on Friday, the main champion of the \"affordability\" platform in the 2025 election cycle, socialist New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, will travel to the White House for his first meeting with Trump. The socialist candidate, who was relatively unknown until his primary defeat against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, hammered home during his campaign that his policies would ease New Yorkers' notoriously high housing prices, cut food costs and bring down the cost of living overall — including by hiking taxes on the wealthy and corporations to bridge the financial gap. LIZ PEEK: WHY EVERY 'AFFORDABLE' PROMISE FROM DEMOCRATS ENDS UP COSTING YOU MORE \"I know that for tens of thousands of New Yorkers, this meeting is between two very different candidates who they voted for, for the same reason,\" Mamdani said Thursday about his meeting with Trump. \"They wanted a leader who would take on the cost-of-living crisis. That makes it impossible for working people to afford living in this city.\" A winning economic strategy is nothing new to the president, however, considering his first administration and 2024 election platform focused on pulling the U.S. out of an economic hole. And Trump is making moves to lay claim over the word \"affordability\" while taking shots at the Biden administration's record on prices. \"The word is affordable and affordable. It should be our word, not theirs,\" Trump said Monday evening during McDonald’s Impact Summit 2025 in Washington. \"Because the Democrats got up in affordability, the front of it. And they don't say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history. Everything was the worst. What? The great ad is lying. They say affordability. This stuff was all much more expensive.\" The White House told Fox News Digital Tuesday that Democrats don't have \"a leg to stand on\" with the economy following the Biden administration, which saw inflation spike to the highest levels in nearly 40 years, while arguing Trump has focused on real-life deals that translate to American jobs and lower costs since his first day back in office. To the White House, Fox Digital learned, Democrats touting the word \"affordability\" is simultaneously an act of \"desperation\" following their 2024 losses, as well as \"meaningless\" as there's a \"difference between talking about a problem and then actually doing something about it.\" Fox News Digital took a look back at how \"affordability\" grew in prominence as a top campaign platform in 2025 among Democrats, and Trump's history of employing variations of the word \"affordable\" in his political efforts. ‘Make America Affordable Again’ \"Make America Affordable Again\" was touted at points by the 2024 Trump campaign, while the president signed an executive order under his first administration related to \"affordable housing,\" and the White House celebrating in 2020 that Trump was improving \"the affordability and accessibility of life-saving prescription drugs.\" \"We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,\" Trump said from the campaign trail in North Carolina in 2024, The New York Times reported. The president, however, has largely steered clear of the word \"affordability\" in his public remarks and social media posts, instead focusing his language around tariffs and paying off the national debt, increasing the U.S. job market, onshoring companies that moved overseas, and hitting back at the inflation woes that spiraled under the Biden administration and continue to loom over the Trump economy. The White House pointed to a bevy of deals Trump has made since his return to the Oval Office that underscore his focus on affordability for the American people: cutting regulations to unleash American energy to lower fuel and other costs, multiple deals to lower drug prices, and attracting business to set up shop on U.S. soil to promote American jobs. The White House said that it is in the midst of \"cleaning up\" the woes left behind by the Biden administration, with an official telling Fox News Digital: \"They got us in this mess in the first place.\" Voters casting ballots for Democrats in the name of affordability \"is like hiring the arsonists to put out the fire,\" former Republican Kentucky Congressman and 2026 Senate candidate Andy Barr remarked to Fox News Digital. \"Complete Democrat control of Washington brought us the highest inflation in decades,\" he said. \"President Trump and Republicans already delivered the lowest gas prices in years, the largest tax cut in history, and will keep fighting to Make America Great Again.\" Just on Tuesday, the White House hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where he announced that Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investment into the U.S. economy to nearly $1 trillion, up from $600 billion in May. The deal translates to Americans directly benefiting, with the White House pointing to GE Vernova, an energy equipment manufacturing company, as it celebrates the investment and its impact on American jobs. SETTING THE STAGE: WHAT THE 2025 ELECTIONS SIGNAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM SHOWDOWNS David Broomwell, who oversees three GE Vernova factories, said during the Oval Office meeting Tuesday, \"If you look at the landscape for GE Vernova investment, over $750 million in the U.S. focused on true manufacture, bring jobs here stateside. We're looking at tripling the output of our Greenville, South Carolina facility where we make the gas turbines that are supporting U.S. needs as well as the Saudi Arabia needs. So real jobs, $300 million in gas investment, resulting in over 500 pieces of new equipment being installed in the Greenville, South Carolina facility. That translates into roughly 1,800 jobs across the board for GE Vernova.\" IT’S NOT JUST THE ECONOMY — THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATS BEAT THE GOP ACROSS THE COUNTRY Winning strategy Just more than a year ago, economic anxiety under the Biden administration came to a vigorous boil and the election was thrown into a tailspin as the president dropped out of running for re-election and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris' campaign was viewed as carrying out a series of missteps that led to her loss, with the economy seen as one of the top areas of concern by both pundits and voters. Voters during the 2024 federal election pointed to the economy as far and away their top issue. Americans flooded the polls a year ago with their wallets at the top of their minds, backing Trump on the ballot as the majority of voters reported they were concerned they could not afford food, healthcare, housing and gas for their car, previous Fox News Voter Analysis data showed. Liberal political pundits lamented that the Democratic Party was weak on the economy, with even MSNBC's Joe Scarbourgh unleashing shortly after the election that voters \"were looking at what groceries cost, what gas costs, what rent costs\" while Democrats focused their campaign on deriding Trump for what they viewed as rhetoric that threatened democracy. Then, a year later, Democrats pivoted to what would prove to be a winning strategy: affordability. Each of the Democrats in the three high-profile elections — Virginia's gubernatorial election, New Jersey's gubernatorial election and New York City's mayoral election — prominently listed affordability as their top campaign issue. In fact, each campaign website boasts \"affordable\" or \"affordability\" on its homepage. \"New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier,\" Mamdani's campaign website boasts, with an entire \"affordability\" platform dedicated to explaining his plan on city-run grocery stores to lower costs, eliminating bus fares and \"fighting corporate exploitation.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's team for comment ahead of his meeting with Trump but did not immediately receive a reply. ELECTION REFLECTION: 'DEMOCRATS FLIPPED THE SCRIPT' ON AFFORDABILITY IN BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWNS A former Trump White House official and candidate for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, Morgan Murphy, told Fox News Digital that \"listening to Democrats on the economy makes as much sense as asking your drunk uncle for stock tips at Thanksgiving.\" \"These are the same people who jacked inflation to 9%, tried to tank the U.S. economy by shutting down the government for 43 days, and just elected a full-blown communist to lead New York,\" Murphy said. \"They talk affordability but end up fleecing the American people. Americans are struggling economically from a hangover because of Bidenomics. It is important to grow the economy, re-shore manufacturing, grow our energy sector, and increase opportunity, which will decrease prices and make life more affordable.\" Earlier in November, Trump remarked that the Democrats had leaned into the \"new word\" while admonishing Republicans for not promoting similar platforms enough. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"They have this new word called affordability and (Republicans) don't talk about it enough,\" Trump said during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier following the elections. \"The Democrats make it up because we took over a mess. Think of energy. Energy was so expensive, and now I have it down to half what it was.\" Mamdani and Trump are expected to have a fiery relationship upon the upcoming mayor's inauguration in January, with the White House's top spox Karoline Leavitt describing Mamdani as a \"communist\" who ascended to the top of the increasingly left-wing Democratic Party, while adding Trump's door is open to any U.S. leader.","summary":"Democrats pivot to affordability messaging in 2025 campaigns while Trump attacks their economic record and promotes his own cost-cutting initiatives.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-flips-dems-affordability-script-turning-buzzword-maga-material-mamdani-visit-looms","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/donald-trump-zohram-mamdani.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 15:39:37","author":"Emma Colton","authors":["Emma Colton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":381301800,"title":"Hollywood powerhouse says he received 'blowback' after voting for Trump","text":"During an interview with Variety on Thursday, film producer Brian Grazer revealed that he received \"blowback\" from his peers in Hollywood after it became known that he voted for President Donald Trump in 2024.

To devise a plan for the Democratic Party’s resurgence once Donald Trump exits the presidency.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 44th President met with nearly three dozen newly-elected House Democrats at a gathering organized by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This meeting aimed to strategize on navigating a Republican-majority Congress and reclaiming the White House.\n\nObama’s role at the event was to help chart the Democratic Party’s future course in a post-Obama era, as reported by Politico.\n\nDuring the private event, Obama acknowledged the challenges faced by the Democrats. “There are times I feel discouraged,” he admitted to the assembled lawmakers. “I feel exhausted, overwhelmed, and under siege. But in our second term, my chief of staff, Denis McDonough, used to distribute stickers inspired by a conversation we had, emphasizing that ‘we do not succumb to cynicism — cynicism is our enemy.’ It’s rampant in this town.”\n\n“And that, I believe, is our most critical fight,” Obama continued. “If we resist that, we’ll be able to tackle the challenges ahead.”\n\n‘And that, I think, is our most important battle, right?’ Obama added. ‘We don’t give into that, and then we’re going to be able to figure out the same stuff.’\n\nObama then reminded the young Democrats that he was in their situation two decades ago when John Kerry lost to George Bush in 2004 and Republicans ruled Congress.\n\nThe former president went on to describe a similar level of despair and chaos that overtook the party in 2024 after Trump defeated Kamala Harris in all seven battleground states.\n\nBut, Obama noted, everything turned out well for Democrats back in 2004 only a few years later.\n\n‘And two years later, Nancy Pelosi was the first woman speaker of the House of Representatives. And four years later, somehow, I ended up being president. The reason I tell you that is not for you to, you know, feel complacent,’ he said.\n\n‘It’s to indicate that the work that you are doing right now, the investment you’re making, the focus that you’re applying, the issues that you are developing, the interactions that you’re having with your constituencies.’\n\n‘All that is creating the momentum and the opportunity for change.’\n\nObama’s surge into the White House in ’08 came amid an economic recession for the country and widespread hatred for Bush’s foreign wars in the Middle East.\n\nThe former president now hopes that a coalition of Democratic young voices can help lead themselves back to the Congressional majority and White House in the coming years.\n\nRep. Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender Congressional lawmaker, who attended the gathering described the former president’s speech as ‘classic Barack Obama — updated for a 2025, political environment.’\n\nThe Delaware lawmaker was spotted talking privately with Obama during the event as the ex-president praised McBride for her high-profile media appearances and messaging. \n\nMcBride told Politico that Obama’s plan to guide Democrats out of their leaderless wilderness is not by relying one singular political figure.\n\n‘He recognizes that in this moment, it’s not going to be any single voice that saves us. It’s not going to be a former political leader or any single current political leader,’ the lawmaker said.\n\n‘It’s going to be all of us, including a broad bench of younger Democratic elected officials who can take the baton and carry it forward.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEarlier this week, Barack Obama made a discreet visit to Washington, D.C.,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Obama Holds Private Strategy Session with Democrats on Future Political Moves first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/obama-holds-private-strategy-session-with-democrats-on-future-political-moves/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Obama-convenes-secret-meeting-with-Democrats-to-plot-return-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 14:56:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":381299710,"title":"Women on strike and a tattooed gang member: photos of the day – Friday","text":"Lviv, Ukraine A woman attends a ceremony commemorating activists killed during the Euromaidan protests on Day of Dignity and Freedom – which honours the 2004 Orange revolution and the 2013 revolution of dignity – at the Heavenly Hundred Heroes memorialPhotograph: Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP/GettyShare\n\nHuwara, Israeli-occupied West Bank Mohammad Dalal looks at scorched cars in his scrapyard near Nablus that was allegedly set on fire by Israeli settlersPhotograph: Nasser Nasser/APShare\n\nDecatur, US Demonstrators protesting against the construction of a data centre wait to enter the DeKalb County board of commissioners’ meeting in GeorgiaPhotograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAShare\n\nAltadena, US Motorists queue to receive free groceries after the federal government shutdown that caused delays to Snap/CalFresh food benefits in CaliforniaPhotograph: Mario Tama/GettyShare\n\nJohannesburg, South Africa Protesters lie on the ground during the Women’s Nationwide Shutdown at Constitution Hill before the G20 leaders’ summit.

Email: tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CAROLINE PEACOCK, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:13:34 GMT, 21 November 2025 |Updated:14:27 GMT, 21 November 2025 \n\nKate Beckinsale has unveiled a sweet tattoo tribute to her late mother Judy Loe following her death aged 78.\nThe actress, 52, took to Instagram earlier this summer to share that her mother had died in her arms on July 15 after 'immeasurable suffering' and admitted she is 'paralysed' with grief.\nJudy's cause of death wasn't confirmed; however, Kate previously revealed her mother had been battling stage four cancer for the last two years.\nTaking to Instagram on Friday, Kate revealed her new tattoo of her mother on her arm, which featured a sketch of the actress in 1971.\nShe got the tattoo below an inking that read 'Fatherless sc*m' in tribute to her late father and stepfather - a reference to David Bowie's 1979 song Fantastic Voyage.\nAlongside the post, she penned: 'It everyone would stop dying I wouldn't have so many tattoos.\n\nKate Beckinsale has unveiled a sweet tattoo tribute to her late mother Judy following her death aged 78 on Instagram on Friday\n\nKate revealed her new tattoo of her mother on her arm, which featured a sketch of the actress in 1971\n'Thank you @_dr_woo_ for this beautiful one of my mama ( and @endrystymest for Peepo and 'fatherless sc*m').'\nLast month Kate shared poignant snaps from her beloved mother Judy's funeral.\nShe reflected on the day as she shared a selection of images from the ceremony which took place at Chiswick House. \nShe was joined by her daughter Lily, 26, who she shares with her ex Michael Sheen - who also attended to support her. \nLily and Michael were seen sweetly hugging in one of the snaps Kate shared. Kate and Michael were a couple from the mid-1990s to 2003.\nIn the caption Kate said she still felt 'blindsided and devastated' by her death and heartbreakingly admitted she often still goes to call her before realising that no one will answer. \nKate also shared that her mother hadn't wanted people to wear black at her funeral and that she wished for a 'celebration of her life'.\nIn her lengthy and emotional caption Kate said: 'Dearest Mama. The fact that you have had to have a funeral at all is wrong and ludicrous. You are the biggest lover of life, the most energetic, the most vital, the most joyous.\n\nThe actress, 52, took to Instagram earlier this summer to share that she had died in her arms on July 15 after 'immeasurable suffering' and admitted she is 'paralysed' with grief \n\nIn the caption Kate said she still felt 'blindsided and devastated' by her death and heartbreakingly admitted she still goes to call her before realising that no one will answer\n'The only mandate you gave me over the years was that you wanted a celebration of your life and that no one was to wear black so no one did.\n'What I did not anticipate, particularly the night before the funeral where I got two hours sleep on a hard sofa and very much considered not being able to attend because I was afraid I couldn't handle it, was that someone would be able to have a funeral that was so full of love and happiness and joy, which is all because of you and who you are and what you brought. \n'You are a bridge builder, a hoarder of love, an archiver of precious history ,of respect for years of friendship and my God that showed..\n'I think the hardest thing I have ever had to do was say goodbye to you and I haven't managed it yet, I still reach for my phone in the early hours of the morning to text you and then realise that I won't get a response. \n'The funeral and the party which I will not call a wake afterwards, and which I very much feel you attended in some vaporous way blew the f***ing roof off Chiswick House. \n'Everybody danced - from the age of 3 to their mid 80s. Your school friends attended, my school friends attended, Lily's school friends attended. The love you inspired, quietly and generously was awe-inspiring and still is.\n'I will never get over the lump of cement in my stomach that I have instead of you. Hopefully, I will learn to carry it better than I am currently carrying it which is clumsily and not well. \n\nShe was joined by her daughter Lily, 26, who she shares with her ex Michael Sheen - who also attended to support her (Kate and Michael seen in 2010) \n'But what you left me was a coterie of extraordinarily brilliant people who, if and when I am ever up to it, I know will provide me a soft place to land. \n'At the moment I am so blindsided and devastated that it is safer for me to be on my own but I know from your funeral that the relationships you nurtured so carefully over the years are there for me too and that is another part of your generosity that will live on. \n'I love you, Mama. You are in my blood. You are in my bones, you are in my heart, broken or not you are there. I love you so much.'\nHer death came 18 months after the death of Judy's second husband and Kate's stepfather Roy, who died in January 2024. \nHe was hospitalised in Los Angeles in December 2023 after suffering 'a massive stroke' while battling two forms of cancer, which he was diagnosed with in the summer prior.\nTragically this wasn't the first time Judy was widowed after the shock death of her first husband Richard Beckinsale in 1979, when Kate was just five-years-old.\nThe actor, famed for his roles in popular shows Rising Damp and Porridge, suddenly passed away on March 19, 1979 at the age of just 31, leaving behind his devastated wife Judy and Kate and her sister Samantha. \nSharing the news of her mother's death back in July, Kate posted a compilation of snaps as she penned: 'I don't want to post this. I am only posting this because I have had to register my mother's death certificate and it will soon become public record. \n\nJudy's death came 18 months after the death of her second husband, and Kate's stepfather Roy (pictured), who died in January 2024 \n'She died the night of July 15th in my arms after immeasurable suffering. I have not picked all the best photos, nor the best videos, because I cannot bear to go through my camera roll yet. \n'I deeply apologise to any of her friends who are finding out this way or through the press, but I cannot go through her phone.\n'I am paralysed. Jude was the compass of my life, the love of my life, my dearest friend. The vastness and huge heart of this tiny woman has touched so many people who love her dearly.\n'She has been brave in so many ways, forgiving sometimes too much, believing in the ultimate good in people and the world is so dim without her that it is nearly impossible to bear.'\nShe finished: 'Mama, I love you so much. This has been my greatest fear since finding my father dead at five and I am here. Oh my Mama.. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.'\n\nKate didn't confirm the cause of death at the time however her mum was known to have been battling stage four cancer for the last two years\n\nKate's post announcing her mother's death is pictured \nFans and friends rushed to send their condolences in the comments as they penned: 'I'm so sorry. What a beautiful lady';\n'Sending you and Lily so much love'; 'I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss! Y'all had such an incredible bond that not a lot of mothers and daughters do';\n'Sending love. Not enough. Because NOTHING can replace your mother.'; 'Oh no. May angels lead her in'.\nJess Wright added: 'Omg I am so deeply sorry'. \nBack in March Kate shared a tearful Mother's Day tribute to Judy amid her cancer battle. \nShe reassured her mother that 'any journey you are on, I'm on it with you,' in an Instagram post dedicated to her, revealing just how much she idolises her mum.\nDescribing Judy as her 'partner in crime,' Kate posted a carousel of photos from throughout her mum's cancer treatment, as well as memories that hold a special place in her heart.\nKate - who revealed that her mum was sick last year - admitted they had been 'through some s**t together' and that her mum has her heart.\nThe Fool's Paradise star further offered her advice to others who are grieving.\nShe said: 'My heart is with you,' on a day that is 'joyful for so many and painful for so many.'\nKate also asked for good wishes to be sent to her 'extraordinary' mother who she called a 'warrior' in her post. \nKate penned in the caption of the post about her mother: 'I wasn't going to come back to Instagram but anyone who has a spare prayer or magic or miracle or sunbeam please send it to my mama, my most extraordinary, warrior, generous, humble, loving, unique, irreplaceable Mama.\n'Thank you - Lord, keep her safe this night, secure from all her fears, may angels guard her while she sleeps till morning light appears, amen.'\nKate's father Richard died when she was just five-years-old after he suffered a shock heart attack in his sleep brought on by undiagnosed coronary artery disease. \nAt the time was in fact Judy who was the family's focus then, as she was in hospital recovering from an operation to unblock her fallopian tubes, so she could have more children.\n\n Kate Beckinsale announces her mother Judy Loe has passed away aged 78 after 'immeasurable suffering' as she admits she is 'paralysed' with grief \nWhen she emerged, she learned her operation had been a success, but that her husband had died.\nThe day before his death, Richard had taken Kate - who was just five-years-old at the time - to visit her mother in hospital and had no physical complaints, simply saying he felt tired.\nThat evening, Richard attended a party for The Two Ronnies before returning to the family home in Sunningdale, Berks.\nThe last anyone heard from the rising comedy star was in a phone call he made to friends before going to bed, in which he noted he had pains in his arms and chest but made light of it. Tragically, Richard never woke up.\nKate, who had been looked after by a family friend who came to babysit her at home, has said she still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder 'from discovering my very young father's almost-dead body as a very young child alone in the night.'\nIt was a trauma which was 'reactivated' by losing Roy all these years later as she revealed a year after his passing that she'll forever be 'haunted' after seeing Roy die.\nRoy, the director of TV greats including Inspector Morse, Cracker and A Touch Of Frost, came into Kate's life three years after her father died. \nAlongside a beaming snap of Roy, Kate penned: 'Finding my father's dead body alone in the middle of the night at the age of five shaped my entire life. Seeing my beloved stepfather die a year ago today will haunt me forever. \n\nShe said in her post about the funeral: 'I love you, Mama. You are in my blood. You are in my bones, you are in my heart, broken or not you are there. I love you so much' \n'It does seem terribly careless to have managed to be present for both deaths and unable to prevent either, the second time trying with every single thing I had. It was not enough.\n'In the process of losing my beloved Roy I lost family, friendships, at some points my own health, and all the money I had due to how disgusting the American healthcare system is for those who are not insured. I would do it again. No question.\n'I cannot help feeling that I dreadfully failed -but I am trying to console myself today with all the preparation that he did in the last years of his life, how deeply he studied and practised as a Jungian and how thin the veil is between the energy of this life and whatever is next, that some part of him was at peace with it. \n'It does feel like a lie I am telling myself to try and feel better, however. Perhaps I am just unfortunately not enlightened enough to sell that to myself over my sense of loss, guilt and failure.'\nKate BeckinsaleInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKate Beckinsale unveils sweet tattoo tribute to her late mother Judy Loe following her death aged 78\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

That’s because the pop star is betting she can extend that run with a forthcoming film conceived by and starring her. A teaser trailer has dropped for “The Moment,” an A24 movie which Vanity Fair described as “a revisionist history focused on the aftermath of ‘Brat’s’ release in which she stars with Alexander Skarsgård.” It’s wild and chaotic — and shows off the singer’s comedic chops, as well as a blink and you miss it glimpse of Kylie Jenner, who makes an appearance. Charlie XCX told Vanity Fair it’s a “2024 period piece.” “It’s not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way, but the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make one,” the singer said. “It’s fiction, but it’s the realest depiction of the music industry that I’ve ever seen.” Written by Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes and directed by Zamari, it all began in 2024 when Charlie XCX was in the middle of co-headlining the “Sweat” tour with fellow singer Troye Sivan and right before she launched her “Brat” tour. She sent a note to Zamari, who had directed her “Guess” and “360” videos, which he described as “word vomit.” “It almost felt like a diary entry of, ‘This is how I feel right now,’” Zamiri said. “This feeling of having just almost got everything she could have wanted, and what that felt like on kind of a human level.” Thus the script was born. “Brat” became a cultural phenomena, spurring not only a color obsession, but also being designated the word of the year for 2024 by Collins Dictionarym which defined it as a person who is “characterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.” “Brat Summer” was even embraced by then presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris, which nearly killed the meme and the vibes. The film’s cast also includes Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Trew Mullen, Isaac Cole Powell, Rachel Sennott, and Rish Shah. “The Moment” hits theaters January 26, 2026.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/21/entertainment/charli-xcx-brat-movie","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2241649677.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 14:26:16","author":"Lisa Respers France","authors":["Lisa Respers France"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":381273192,"title":"Dick Cheney Funeral Kickstarts US Presidents' Reunion, Trump 'Uninvited'","text":"The funeral of former US vice-president Dick Cheney created a rare reunion of American presidents and political leaders, yet the absence of Donald Trump stood out as the clearest sign of his widening distance from Washington's past power structure.The event at Washington National Cathedral brought together figures from both parties, offering a portrait of political history gathered to honour one of the most influential and divisive officials of the modern era. The full account of the guest list and ceremony appears in reporting on the Cheney funeral service.A Gathering of Political HeavyweightsJoe Biden attended the service alongside former vice-presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and chief justice John Roberts also sat in the front pews. Their presence reflected Cheney's long reach across decades of political change.George W Bush delivered the eulogy and praised Cheney for his loyalty and discipline during their years in office. Bush said Cheney embodied what a president should expect from a second in command and avoided any reference to the known tensions that once defined parts of their partnership.Notable absences included Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Clinton's spokesperson described his absence as the result of a scheduling conflict. The gathering still represented one of the largest bipartisan assemblies in recent memory, with former rivals and colleagues seated together in recognition of the late vice-president's legacy.Trump and Vance Excluded From Guest ListDonald Trump and vice-president JD Vance did not receive invitations. Their exclusion reflected a deeper fracture in the Republican Party and underlined ongoing hostility between the Cheney family and the current leadership. The decision was confirmed by a White House official familiar with the arrangements, and additional reporting in coverage of Trump being snubbed detailed the political backdrop.Tensions between Trump and the Cheneys reached a breaking point during the 6 January investigation. Liz Cheney served as vice-chair of the House committee and pressed forward with the inquiry despite pressure from her party. Trump endorsed her primary challenger in 2022 and repeatedly attacked her efforts to scrutinise his role in the Capitol riot. Both Liz and her father endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, marking a striking break from their party's candidate. Trump's absence from the funeral therefore aligned with years of public conflict rather than logistical oversight.Liz Cheney Reflects on Her Father's LegacyLiz Cheney delivered a tribute that focused on the values her father taught her about duty, public service and the Constitution. She said he believed that political identity must never outweigh loyalty to the republic. She also described how he inspired her decision to hold Trump accountable during the January 6 investigation. Her remarks avoided direct criticism yet made clear that her work on the committee aligned with lessons drawn from her father's career.She noted that her father entered public service after being inspired by John F Kennedy. Cheney built his career steadily, beginning as a young adviser in the Nixon administration before becoming the youngest White House chief of staff.He later served as defence secretary under George HW Bush and guided US military strategy during the Gulf war. His selection as George W Bush's running mate in 2000 cemented his status as a central figure in national security policy. During his vice-presidency, he shaped the US response to the 9/11 attacks, pushed for expanded surveillance powers and led the effort to invade Iraq and Afghanistan.A Symbolic Reunion Without One Former PresidentCheney's funeral provided a moment of reflection for Washington figures who shaped US policy over five decades. Their presence signalled a shared recognition of Cheney's controversial but undeniably significant influence.Trump's absence highlighted the degree to which he stands apart from that lineage. The event demonstrated how shifting alliances and unresolved political battles continue to define America's leadership landscape. It also underscored how Cheney's legacy remains intertwined with the values his family continues to promote, even as the country navigates deep divisions.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/dick-cheney-funeral-kickstarts-us-presidents-reunion-trump-uninvited-1756880","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1765972/dick-cheney.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5cd8d559ff29e0fab36abf43f368c239","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 14:11:26","author":"Jomar Teves","authors":["Jomar Teves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.371},{"id":381269450,"title":"Donald Trump&#039;s Approval Rating on Economy Hits All-Time Low in Key State","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump‘s approval rating on the economy has hit an all-time low in New Hampshire, according to a new poll.\n\nAccording to a survey by the University of New Hampshire (UNH), Trump’s net approval rating over the policy area is -14 percentage points, the lowest it has been in both of his terms, according to the pollster.\n\nAndrew Smith, director of the UNH Survey Center told Newsweek: “Approval of Trump’s handling of the economy is at its lowest in New Hampshire in either his first or second term. While it’s a long time until the election, perceptions of the economy have a significant impact on how the president’s party performs in midterms. \n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House to comment on this story outside of normal business hours.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe economy is very important to American voters, with a Gallup poll showing that they overwhelmingly cited economic pressures as the key reason they voted for Trump in the November 2024 presidential election. The president pledged to bring down inflation on the campaign trail.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the McDonald’s Impact Summit, Monday, November 17, 2025, in Washington.\n\nApproval ratings are useful in gauging the public’s response to Trump’s policies and Trump’s approval rating will affect how voters behave in the November 2026 midterm elections. Republicans have a narrow majority of 219 to 214 in the House of Representatives, so if they lose a handful of seats it could have a huge impact on the last two years of Trump’s term.\n\nFormer vice president Kamala Harris won New Hampshire for the Democratic Party with 50.7 percent of the vote in the 2024 presidential election but, by gaining 47.9 percent of the vote, Trump increased his share of the vote from 2020, when he received 45.4 percent of the vote share.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe poll found that 57 percent of people in the Granite State disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy while 42 percent approve.\n\nOf those who disapprove, 38 percent cited the president’s tariffs policy as the most reason why while—in distant second place—9 percent blamed the price of goods.\n\nMeanwhile, the poll found that overall, 54 percent of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Trump while 45 percent approve, leaving him with a net approval rating of -9 percentage points.\n\nThe survey polled 1,402 New Hampshire residents between November 13 and November 17. It had a margin of error of +/- 2.6 percentage points.\n\nIt comes amid other broader negative polling about the president. A recent poll by The Economist/YouGov found Trump’s approval rating at its lowest level since he returned to office in January, 39 percent of people approving of the job he is doing, and 58 percent disapproving, a net approval rating of -19 points.\n\nMeanwhile, a Fox News poll found this week that 76 percent of voters view the economy negatively. This makes Trump less popular on the economy than former President Joe Biden. At the end of his presidency in 2024, Fox News polling showed that 70 percent of people viewed the economy negatively.\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and the director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, said: “New Hampshire has always had an independent streak among its voters, so it may not be the most representative place from which to gauge national sentiment on Trump’s economic stewardship. Still, it’s hard to ignore when Trump’s tariffs continue to bite and inflation remains above target. For an issue that helped get Trump elected in 2024, the economy looks more like a liability for Republicans heading into the 2026 midterms.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social earlier this month: “So many Fake Polls are being shown by the Radical Left Media, all slanted heavily toward Democrats and Far Left Wingers…Fake News will never change, they are evil and corrupt but, as I look around my beautiful surroundings, I say to myself, ‘Oh, look, I’m sitting in the Oval Office!'”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrumps’ popularity across all states will continue to fluctuate as his presidency continues.","summary":"In New Hampshire, Trump&#039;s net approval rating over the economy is -14 percentage points.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-economy-all-time-low-new-hampshire-11085962","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25321849535309.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 13:24:01","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":381247318,"title":"The 'insane' moment OJ Simpson 'pretended to kill' Ruby Wax in 1998 BBC interview after she recalled the bizarre ordeal on I'm A Celebrity","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Nov 21st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBBC loses £1.1billion as millions of homes refuse to pay the licence fee amid 'bias' storm\n\n'Heartbroken' lawyer wins restraining order against former 'soulmate' ex-boyfriend, 50, after he 'repeatedly fat-shamed her' during their relationship and placed a tracker on her car\n\nStrictly Come Dancing's La Voix breaks silence on conspiracy theory about why she REALLY dropped out of show and shares injury update on It Takes Two\n\nRevealed: The cheap supplement that turbo-charges how well Mounjaro and Wegovy work, keeps you losing weight if it's slowing - and experts say ALL patients coming off weight-loss jabs should take to avoid piling the pounds back on\n\nThe middle-aged mums making eye-watering sums selling on TikTok shop.

'I think it was his idea of a joke.'\nIn a video clip, Simpson pretends to stab Wax with a banana while making a screeching noise as he grinned at the camera. \nSimpson's questionable joke came as she opened her hotel door to him, but the comedian claimed that he was initially looking for a knife.\nThe morbid video re-surfaced on Thursday, as the world found out that the ex-football star and murder suspect had died after a short battle with prostate cancer. \nWax described their 1998 interview over 20 years later as a 'psychological midfield' and said the strange stabbing joke came after the interview. 'Afterwards, I did a piece to camera saying \"I've been fixed up and I don't know who my date is going to be\" and I'd open to door and it would be him.\n'But when he was out there, all the trays were out there and he was looking for a knife, to fool me when the door was open but there was no knife so he grabbed a banana.'\nWax had met with Simpson after he was famously acquitted in 1994 of the murder of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. \nThe now 70-year-old television personality alleges that Simpson phoned her up on April 1st and said: 'I killed her, April Fools!' \n\nThe TV star spoke about the eerie moment OJ pretended to stab the presenter with a banana after the interview\n\nRuby, called the ex-NFL star, who was found liable for stabbing to death his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman in civil court, 'the most complicated character on earth'\n\nIn a video clip, Simpson pretends to stab Wax with a banana while making a screeching noise as he grinned at the camer\nShe recalled their first meeting, claiming he told her his favourite poem was one about Lizzie Borden, an American woman tried and acquitted of the axe murders of her father and stepmother in 1892.\n'The first night we went out, we went out with his sister, and all these women came to the table and said \"Can we meet afterwards\". They came every night and they want to sleep with a criminal.\nWax said she thought she'd be able to get Simpson to admit to the fatal stabbings in 1995 - and even suggested he might want her to bust him for the crime. \n'I think he wanted me to bust him, he said out of nowhere \"Want to know what my favorite poem is\" and and he went into \"Lizzie Borden took an axe, And gave her mother forty whacks; When she saw what she had done, She gave her father forty-one.\"\n'I thought I could bust him', said Ruby. '[I thought] he'd say on air \"Yes he did it\", and I'd get him in jail. So I was being public defender.'\nThe notorious double murder suspect passed away surrounded by his family at his home in Las Vegas on Wednesday night.\nSimpson became one of the most infamous figures in America after he was charged with the 1994 murders.\nAn X post shared on his official account by his family said: 'On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer. \n\nRuby met OJ in 1998, after he was acquitted in 1994 of the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman\n'He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren. During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace. - The Simpson Family.'\nShe told Alex Scott and Shona McGarty: 'That was insane. He tried to kill me with a banana. He said \"I did it\" and then said \"April Fool's\". Because he wanted to get caught, he couldn't live with the guilt. He was teasing the whole time.'\nAlex said in the Bush Telegraph: 'I loved watching Ruby Wax Meets. I grew up watching all her documentaries. Shows like this bring people together that I thought I'd never meet in my life'.\nAfter hearing her stories, fans called Ruby an 'icon' and urged bosses to consider bringing the BBC show back. They wrote on X: 'ITV need to recommission Ruby Max Meets...';\n'Great to see how many people are now on board with the Ruby love. I said from the start once you get to see her you will. Been a massive fan of hers for years'; \n'Ruby Wax is an icon, she better not get voted out early' and 'Ruby Wax trying to bring back her chat show back via this show'. \nElsewhere on the show, Ruby recalled when she interview Trump in 1999 and laughed in his face at his revelation he wanted to become president.\nDuring the chat, Ruby also spoke about interviewing President Trump. \nShe said: 'I did Trump. I know what his brain is like. Total insanity and anger and arrogant. Bill Crosby was insane too.' \nIn what she previously claimed was 'the worst interview I’ve ever done', she told Kelly Brook: 'Donald Trump said he wanted to be president of the United States and I started laughing because I thought it was a joke. \n'He was looking at me like: 'what an a*****e. Hatred. \n\nAlex said in the Bush Telegraph: 'I loved watching Ruby Wax Meets. I grew up watching all her documentaries.

They wrote on X: 'ITV need to recommission Ruby Max Meets...'\n'And I said who would you date if you were in the Whitehouse?' And he said: \"That's enough, you're the most obnoxious person I've ever met.\" \nRuby revealed he quickly ended the interview, which ended up only being five minutes long. \nRuby previously alleged in an interview with Good Morning Britain that after she had finished filming the documentary in 1998 with OJ, that he phoned her up on April 1st and said: 'It's OJ, I did it. April Fools!'\n'After we finished filming, Simpson said to me that he has a surprise for me - and I genuinely was surprised,' Ruby said. 'I think it was his idea of a joke.'\n\n How I'm A Celeb's Ruby Wax made a career out of goading stars like Donald Trump and Madonna \nOJ's questionable joke came as she opened her hotel door to him, but the comedian claimed that he was initially looking for a knife. \nShe said previously: 'Afterwards, I did a piece to camera saying \"I've been fixed up and I don't know who my date is going to be\" and I'd open to door and it would be him.\n'But when he was out there, all the trays were out there and he was looking for a knife, to fool me when the door was open but there was no knife so he grabbed a banana.'\nShe recalled their first meeting, claiming he told her his favorite poem was one about Lizzie Borden, an American woman tried and acquitted of the axe murders of her father and stepmother in 1892.\nRuby said she thought she'd be able to get Simpson to admit to the fatal stabbings in 1995 - and even suggested he might want her to bust him for the crime. \n'I think he wanted me to bust him, he said out of nowhere \"Want to know what my favorite poem is\" and and he went into \"Lizzie Borden took an axe, And gave her mother forty whacks; When she saw what she had done, She gave her father forty-one.\"\nOJ died aged 76 last year after a short battle with prostate cancer.\nBBCRuby WaxOJ Simpson\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe 'insane' moment OJ Simpson 'pretended to kill' Ruby Wax in 1998 BBC interview after she recalled the bizarre ordeal on I'm A Celebrity\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Phil Murphy on Friday set the special election to complete his successor Mikie Sherrill’s unexpired House term for April 16, giving candidates a little over a week to gather signatures to appear on the primary ballot.\n\nThe primary for voters to pick party nominees in New Jersey’s 11th District is scheduled for Feb. 5. To make the primary ballot, candidates need to file by Dec. 1 – just over a week away and right after the Thanksgiving holiday – and submit 500 valid signatures. \n\nSherrill, whose resignation took effect at midnight, was elected New Jersey governor earlier this month. She defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 14 points. \n\nSeveral candidates have already announced campaigns for the North Jersey district, where Sherrill won a fourth term last fall by 15 points. District voters also backed Kamala Harris by 9 points, according to calculations by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, leaving Democrats in a favored position for the special election.\n\nSherrill has not weighed in on the race for her successor, but Murphy has backed Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, his former campaign manager. New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim endorsed former Rep. Tom Malinowski, who represented the neighboring 7th District for two terms and, like Kim and Sherrill, was first elected to Congress in 2018.\n\nOther Democrats running include Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; former Army paratrooper Zach Beecher; former Capitol Hill aide Marc Chaaban; former White House aide Cammie Croft; Maplewood Township Committee Person Dean Dafis; Morris Township Deputy Mayor Jeff Grayzel; Chatham Borough Council Member Justin Strickland; and political newcomer Anna Lee Williams. Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way is also expected to launch a campaign, the New Jersey Globe reported. \n\nRepublicans on Friday pushed back on Murphy’s quick timeline. Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway is the only GOP candidate to announce a campaign so far. \n\n“Governor Murphy’s special election timeline is blatant political corruption designed to protect Democratic insiders and silence voters,” Maureen O’Toole, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement. “By setting a ballot deadline to just after the Thanksgiving holiday, he’s denying access for anyone outside the political machine to qualify and give voters a real choice at the ballot box.”\n\nInside Elections rates the race for New Jersey’s 11th District Solid Democratic.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/11/21/new-jersey-special-election-mikie-sherrill/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/sherrill_148_0612251.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 12:55:17","author":"Posted November 21, 2025 At 12:55pm","authors":["Posted November 21, 2025 At 12:55pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":381237498,"title":"Rachel Maddow attending Dick Cheney's funeral sparks social media frenzy","text":"Liberal MS NOW host Rachel Maddow went viral Thursday after she was spotted at the funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

Eric Swalwell enters crowded California governor's race","text":"Rep. Eric Swalwell announced Thursday that he will run for California governor, the latest Democrat to join the crowded race to succeed outgoing Gov. Gavin Newsom. Swalwell, who has served in Congress since 2013, will face a list of high-profile Democrats that includes former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and activist billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race to lead the deep-blue state Wednesday. Swalwell announced his gubernatorial run on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" On his new campaign website, the California Democrat focused on the need to tackle high costs and affordability as the reason he's running for statewide office. \"I’m running for Governor because prices are too high and people are scared. California’s next governor has two jobs. One, keep the worst president in history out of our homes, out of our streets, and out of our lives,\" he said. He continued, \"A lot of candidates talk about taking on Trump. I’m taking him on in real time. My January 6 lawsuit is one of the only lawsuits against the President that survived his new presidency. Speaker Pelosi selected me to help lead his impeachment, and today, I’m leading the Democrats’ effort in the House to investigate January 6.\" Swalwell, 45, gained prominence during President Donald Trump’s first term in office when he was heavily involved in both impeachment proceedings. That included a stint as a House manager for Trump’s second impeachment trial. He also ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, but never polled above the low single digits and ended his bid after just a few months. Swalwell has remained a fervent critic of Trump, which has made him a target of the president and his allies. In 2021, Trump and his allies claimed Swalwell had ties to a suspected Chinese spy and had been compromised by a foreign intelligence agency. Swalwell denied those claims and a House Ethics Committee probe ended in 2023 with no finding of wrongdoing. And earlier this month, a top housing official in the Trump administration referred Swalwell to the Justice Department for a potential federal criminal probe over allegations of mortgage and tax fraud. NBC News has reported that the allegations are related to a Washington, D.C., home. Swalwell is the fourth Democratic official to face mortgage fraud allegations in recent months. Swalwell has also been on the receiving end of threatening messages from people objecting to his political stance. In two cases this year, U.S. attorneys have declined to bring charges against people who threatened to kill him, a staff member in Swalwell’s office told NBC News in October. Swalwell had been widely expected to enter the California race for governor, which lacks a clear obvious front-runner. In California, candidates from all parties appear on the same primary ballot, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election. In addition to Swalwell, Becerra, Porter, Steyer and Villaraigosa, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former state Controller Betty Yee have also launched bids. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., have both said they will not run.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/democratic-rep-eric-swalwell-enters-crowded-california-governors-race-rcna244464","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251113-eric-swalwell-es-c8ab59.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 12:40:01","author":"Adam Edelman","authors":["Adam Edelman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":381237502,"title":"Unearthed FEC records expose Katie Porter's hypocrisy after she fumes at 'new billionaire' joining race","text":"After billionaire activist Tom Steyer entered the California gubernatorial race Wednesday, former Congresswoman Katie Porter, who is also running for governor, blasted him despite previously taking thousands of dollars from him when she was in Congress.

Steyer, who once financed his own unsuccessful presidential bid in 2020, announced plans to enter the California gubernatorial race this week. The billionaire anti-Trump activist pledged to make life more affordable for working-class Americans and take on corporate interests in an announcement advertisement alerting people of his candidacy. Steyer specifically said he would take on the oil and tobacco industries in particular, which he touted a record of doing in the past as well. \"A new billionaire in our race claims he'll fight the very industries he got rich helping grow — fossil fuel companies, tobacco, and private immigration detention facilities — at great cost to Californians,\" Porter posted on X after Steyer announced his run. \"I call bullsh--.\" Attached to Porter's post was also a screenshot of a news headline from The Sacramento Bee that reads: \"Tom Steyer, starring in TV ads for tobacco tax hike, invested in tobacco companies.\" People commenting on Porter's post highlighted her financial support she has received from Steyer in the past. Between 2018 and 2023, Porter received at least $16,100 from him, a Fox News Digital review found. CALIFORNIA PARENTS CONVICTED OF STABBING, DECAPITATING 2 CHILDREN AND FORCING OTHER KIDS TO SEE BODIES For Steyer, his wealth will likely be a target for his opponents. \"Tom Steyer tried to buy the presidency — and he failed,\" Betty Yee, a former state controller who is running in the Democratic Primary for governor, said following Steyer's announcement. \"The California governorship is not going to be his consolation prize.\" Porter, meanwhile, has faced criticism on the campaign trail for her attitude towards staffers and the media. She faced criticism last month after abruptly walking away from a CBS interview after lashing out at the reporter interviewing her. \"What do you say to the 40% of CA voters who you'll need in order to win, who voted for Trump?\" Porter was asked by CBS California's Julie Watts during a segment on the controversial redistricting effort launched by Democrats in the state. \"How would I need them in order to win, ma'am?\" Porter responded. DID CALIFORNIA MISMANAGE THE DEADLY PALISADES FIRE? \"Well, unless you think you're going to get 60% of the vote,\" the reporter, asking about the voter breakdown of Democrats and Republicans in the state, said before Porter started laughing. Porter then went back and forth with the reporter, arguing about whether she needs to court and win over Trump voters, particularly if she's running head-to-head against another Democrat. \"So you don't need them to win,\" Watts asked Porter. \"I feel like this is unnecessarily argumentative,\" Porter said, prompting the reporter to point out that she had asked the same question to the other candidates in the race and they answered it. \"I don't want to keep doing this, I'm going to call it,\" Porter said. When Watts reminded Porter that every candidate had answered the question, Porter said, \"I don't care.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Porter has also faced repeated criticism about how she allegedly treats staffers. In just a span of a single week, three videos went viral of Porter berating her staff. The race for California governor is a crowded one, with big names like former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was reportedly planning on getting involved but ultimately backed away. Lesser known candidates include state schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond, former Controller Betty Yee and former Assemblyman Ian Calderon.","summary":"Katie Porter’s jab at billionaire Tom Steyer after he entered California&apos;s gubernatorial race backfired after records showed she took more than $10k from him.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unearthed-fec-records-expose-katie-porters-hypocrisy-after-she-fumes-new-billionaire-joining-race","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/katie-porter-in-los-angeles.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 12:30:35","author":"Alec Schemmel,Cameron Cawthorne","authors":["Alec Schemmel","Cameron Cawthorne"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":381240146,"title":"Gary Bauer: They're Back!","text":"Former President George W. Bush emerged from his self-imposed political “exile” yesterday to deliver a eulogy at the funeral of his vice president, Dick Cheney. And it may not be the last that we see of Mr. Bush.\n\nThere are reports that members of the Bush family and other GOP establishment hacks are putting together a serious effort to “retake” the Republican Party when Donald Trump’s administration ends. You would have thought they had learned their lesson after Jeb! crashed and burned in the 2016 primaries.\n\nThey want to take the GOP back to what it has always been: The party that can’t find a war it doesn’t want to fight, that wants to cut your mother’s Social Security checks, that wants mass migration into the country, that bows before the Chamber of Commerce, and kowtows to communist China in the name of “free trade.”\n\nFormer RNC Chairman Michael Steele is reportedly part of this group. That’s telling. Steele is essentially a Democrat now. He’s a commentator on MSDNC. He worked with Never Trumpers to defeat Republicans in 2020. He voted for Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd he’s going to remake the GOP? Give me a break!\n\nThere are also reports that Steele and other disgruntled “Republicans” are angry that George W. Bush has not spoken out publicly against “the scourge of Trumpism.”\n\nWell, guess what? The conservative base of the GOP is mad at Bush for not uttering one word of support for Donald Trump.\n\nNot when the FBI raided his house and rummaged through his wife’s underwear.\n\nNot when partisan prosecutors tried to throw him in jail on trumped-up charges.\n\nNot when Joe Biden or others smeared Trump and MAGA supporters as “fascists.”\n\nNot when partisan Democrats tried to kick Trump off the ballot.\n\nNot when radical Democrats called on members of the military to disobey orders of the commander-in-chief.\n\nNothing has moved George W. Bush to speak one word of support for the most popular and successful Republican president in modern times.\n\nKamala’s Revenge?\n\nThis item is really important. Read it, read it again, and save it.\n\nKamala Harris spoke at an event Wednesday hosted by haters in the Never Trump movement and was asked about the Epstein files. She accused President Trump of “gaslighting the American people,” and then shouted, “Release the files!” The left-wing crowd roared in approval.\n\nDoes anyone remember what Harris’s job was nine months ago? She was the vice president of the United States for four years.\n\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris had total control of the Epstein files. They never talked about them. They never tried to release them. They were totally uninterested in them. But now, Harris is screaming for them to be released.\n\nIsn’t that odd?\n\nWhy did the Democrats—Biden, Harris, Schumer, and Jeffries—say nothing and do nothing about the Epstein files during the last four years? It’s logical to assume there was something in them that they didn’t want the public to see. But now, they are over-the-top in demanding they be released. Why?\n\nIf there was anything that implicated Donald Trump in those files, I have no doubt they would have released them when they had the chance and when they were trying to destroy Donald Trump. But they didn’t, and it is logical to assume there wasn’t anything they could use against Trump in those files.\n\nConsider this: We know that the CIA, the NSA, and other intelligence agencies are skilled in spreading lies and misinformation to hurt America’s foreign enemies. They are experts at doing this. It is all part of the propaganda war.\n\nBut in the last decade, we have seen them use those skills of deception to hurt conservatives in the United States. Under Biden/Harris, these agencies had plenty of time to doctor the Epstein files to incriminate Trump.\n\nIf that sounds outlandish, think again.\n\nIt’s exactly what Hillary Clinton and the Deep State did to Donald Trump the first time he won. They “doctored” intelligence about Russian collusion after Hillary’s unexpected defeat in 2016. And Joe Biden was in on it from the very beginning! (Here, here, and here.)\n\nNational Amnesia\n\nDo we have amnesia about what the last four years were like? Here’s a brief reminder: \n\nFifteen million people walked into our country, and we had virtually no idea who they were. In a matter of weeks, Donald Trump brought illegal border crossings down to virtually zero. \n\nThe inflation rate during the Biden/Harris years hit 9%. Trump has it down to 3%, and wages are growing faster than that. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act had nothing to do with reducing inflation. In fact, it made inflation worse! Americans lost $3,000 in wages under Biden. This year, under Donald Trump, American workers will see $1,000 in wage increases. \n\nGas hit $5.00 a gallon under Biden. It’s roughly $3.00 now—down forty percent. \n\nEgg prices under Biden peaked at nearly $5.00 a dozen. Now, they’re down to roughly $2.00. \n\nThe cost of a Thanksgiving dinner hit a record high under Biden at $64. This year, it’s down to $55. \n\nThe 15 million people Biden let into the country weren’t all living in New York City hotels. Many were living in apartments, driving up rent prices. As they started earning some money, they bought starter houses, driving up housing prices and pricing young Americans out of the market. \n\nHigher interest rates, driven by Biden’s obscene spending, and higher housing prices, driven by Biden’s open borders, have resulted in native-born or naturalized U.S. citizens being unable to afford the American Dream. \n\nOur military was demoralized under Biden and couldn’t meet recruiting quotas. Under Donald Trump, so many young men and women rushed to enlist that the military met its yearly recruitment quotas in months. \n\nUnder Biden, foreign countries were dumping their products into our country and keeping our goods out of theirs. Donald Trump stopped that. \n\nThe inflation/affordability issue shows the power of the fake news media. When inflation exploded under Biden, he famously blamed Vladimir Putin. It worked. Polling found that the public blamed Putin more than they blamed Biden, at least initially. Eventually, Biden got the blame.\n\nBut if recent polls are accurate, in just nine months the public has gone from blaming Biden to blaming Trump for the “affordability crisis” Biden and Harris caused.\n\nIf that results in voters giving the House and Senate back to the Democrats a year from now, it will effectively end Trump’s presidency. We will deserve whatever happens to us. It will be like committing national suicide.\n\nJob growth in September, going into the government shutdown, was much stronger than anticipated. (The Schumer Shutdown is why we’re just now getting the September numbers.) Economists expected 50,000 new jobs would be created that month. Instead, 119,000 new jobs were created.\n\nThe 119,000 figure is particularly impressive at a time when AI technology is resulting in significant layoffs.\n\nNow, because the economy was growing, more people entered the workforce looking for jobs. So, the unemployment rate ticked up slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%. How does the unemployment rate go up when job growth is up? More than 119,000 people realized the economy was growing and decided to look for a job.\n\nA White House report notes that one major trend of the last four years under Biden has reversed: All job gains are now going to native-born Americans. “Over the past year, more than 2.5 million native-born Americans gained employment, while 670,000 foreign-born workers lost employment.”\n\nLet me be precise about what that means: 670,000 previously employed illegal aliens have either self-deported or been removed from the country under President Trump, opening up jobs for American citizens.\n\nEven the fake news media couldn’t deny the good news. Here are some reactions to the jobs report:\n\n“Hiring Defied Expectations in September, With 119,000 New Jobs” – The Wall Street Journal\n\n“Jobs report blows past expectations, defying hiring slowdown” – ABC News\n\n“Employers added 119,000 jobs in September, blowing past expectations” – CBS News\n\n“Delayed September report shows U.S. added 119,000 jobs, more than expected” –CNBC\n\nThe Battle For America\n\nI’ve written before about a group called “By Any Means Necessary” (BAMN). It’s a far-left group of Marxist revolutionaries, and the name tells you everything you need to know. BAMN’s latest crusade is attacking Turning Point USA chapters on college and high school campuses.\n\nAnd I mean literally attacking them. Think about that.\n\nWhat does Turning Point USA’s name stand for? It means the country has reached a turning point, a change of direction back to the values of Faith, Family, and Freedom. Back to reliable standards of right and wrong, renewed patriotism, and understanding that our liberty comes from God.\n\nAnd what is the Left’s reaction? Some leftists so hate those values, they will do anything to stop them—by any means necessary. Well, as we saw on September 10th, those same forces killed Charlie Kirk.\n\nViolence, and even murder, is how real fascists, real Nazis, and real Marxists win arguments.\n\nNot So Special\n\nFormer Special Counsel Jack Smith has repeatedly proven that there is nothing “special” about him other than his eagerness to persecute conservatives. Like the Deep State, Smith grossly abused his power in his jihad against Donald Trump, which went beyond Trump.\n\nSmith attempted to collect information on the phone records of multiple Republican members of Congress in an effort to take down the entire Republican Party. Sadly, the phone companies cooperated with him, just like Big Tech cooperated with the Biden administration to censor opinions online.\n\nAs soon as the GOP took over the House of Representatives after the 2022 election, Smith demanded the phone records of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. AT&T originally said it refused to provide the information. But AT&T has now conceded that it did in fact surrender McCarthy’s phone records.\n\nEvery media outlet, except for Fox News, is ignoring these serious allegations. They are engaging in self-censorship to serve the interests of the Deep State, which has been abusing the power of the federal government to target conservatives, Christians, pro-life activists, and parents.\n\nThere is more work to do to rein in the Deep State!\n\nDistorting The Gospel\n\nChristians must be in the public square, offering biblical insight on issues including parental rights, racial reconciliation, economic justice, and ending corruption. But what if some Christian leaders who do get involved throw the Bible away and instead side with some of the most radical forces in America?\n\nRead more in my latest public policy update for the James Dobson Family Institute.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/122935-theyre-back-2025-11-21","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 12:25:39","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.474},{"id":381251434,"title":"Why didn't Barack and Michelle Obama attend Dick Cheney's funeral? Here's the reason","text":"APWhy didn't Barack and Michelle Obama attend Dick Cheney's funeral? Here's the reason\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama are once again making headlines for their absence from a major political event. This time, the former first couple did not attend Dick Cheney’s funeral, marking Michelle’s latest step away from long-standing political norms. Their decision comes during a year when Michelle has been visibly selective about public appearances, as per a report by People.Their absence adds them to a growing list of prominent figures who are choosing, or in some cases are expected, to skip the service.ALSO READ: Co-Founder fires employees over affair; the move sparks integrity debate in the workplaceDick Cheney, who served as vice president under George W. Bush and remained one of the most influential Republican figures of his generation, died on Nov. 3 at age 84. While former presidents and first ladies typically attend the funerals of former vice presidents, the expectations around this tradition aren’t always strict. A source familiar with the situation confirmed that Barack and Michelle Obama are not expected to attend, as per a report by People.Why are the Obamas missing major political events?Live EventsThe reason behind their absence hasn’t been made public. However, this isn’t the first time the Obamas have stepped away from an event that other past presidents and first ladies attended. They also missed the funeral of Democratic Vice President Walter Mondale in 2022, suggesting that absence from such services isn’t unprecedented for them.ALSO READ: What does 67 mean, who made the 67 meme and why is it so popular?Earlier this year, Michelle missed two major events that typically draw attendance from former first couples: the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter and Donald Trump’s second inauguration. Barack attended both events alone. Throughout the year, Michelle has been vocal about keeping distance from political obligations and prioritizing personal choice over tradition. She has described this shift as practicing the “art of saying no,” a message she has repeated publicly while discussing her decisions, as per a report by People.Who else skipped Cheney’s funeral?While the Obamas’ absence is notable, they are hardly alone. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance were reportedly not invited to Cheney’s funeral, according to Axios. That detail represents a more striking break from typical protocol, but is less surprising given Cheney’s decision to break party lines and endorse the Democratic presidential ticket in 2024, as per a report by People.ALSO READ: New poll delivers big blow to Trump as approval rating takes sharp diveCheney was accorded complete military honors during the exclusive memorial service in Washington's National Cathedral. Former Presidents Joe Biden and George W. Bush, along with former First Ladies Jill Biden and Laura Bush, were there, as were former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore, and Dan Quayle, as quoted in a report by CNN. The memorial service was also attended by several Supreme Court Justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and Justice Elena Kagan. A significant contingent of former and current Cabinet ministers from both Republican and Democratic administrations, together with congressional leaders from both parties, were anticipated. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi attended alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former leader Mitch McConnell, as per a report by CNN.On Nov. 5, following the announcement of Cheney’s death, Barack Obama shared a message honoring Cheney’s public service. He wrote, “Although Dick Cheney and I represented very different political traditions, I respected his life-long devotion to public service and his deep love of country. Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to his family,\" as per a report by People.How does this absence fit into Michelle Obama’s shift away from protocol?Michelle’s absences throughout the year have drawn attention, particularly her decision not to attend Carter’s funeral in January. Carter died on Dec. 29, 2024, at age 100. Michelle’s spokesperson at the time said she was still on vacation in Hawaii and cited a scheduling conflict. “Former First Lady Michelle Obama is not in attendance at President Carter’s National Funeral Service,” her spokesperson shared. “Mrs. Obama sends her thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from the remarkable former President.”Her absence stood out, as all five living presidents and all other first ladies attended—Bill and Hillary Clinton, George and Laura Bush, Donald and Melania Trump, and Joe and Jill Biden. Barack arrived alone, and Michelle would have been seated near Trump, who has a long history of making disparaging comments about the Obama family, as per a report by People.ALSO READ: Trump got a priceless gold clock from the Rolex CEO, and then he cut Switzerland's tariffs to 15%Less than a week later, her spokesperson confirmed that Michelle would also not attend Trump’s second inauguration. A source close to her told PEOPLE that following protocol simply wasn’t enough reason for her to appear. \"There's no overstating her feelings about [Trump]. She's not one to plaster on a pleasant face and pretend for protocol's sake,” the source said. “Michelle doesn't do anything because it's expected or it's protocol or it's tradition.”Michelle later addressed both absences on her IMO podcast. She said, “It took everything in my power to not do the thing that was perceived as right, but do the things that was right for me, that was a hard thing for me to do.” She added that making choices aligned with her personal boundaries is part of what she described as practicing the “art of saying no.”“It’s a muscle that you have to build,” she explained in April. “And I think we suffered, because it's almost like we started training late in life to build that muscle, right? I am just now starting to build it.”As the Obamas sit out Cheney’s funeral, their decision adds another reminder that Michelle, in particular, is redefining what post-White House life looks like for a former first lady—one choice, and one “no,” at a time.FAQsWhy did the Obamas not attend Dick Cheney’s funeral?No clear reason has been given, though it follows Michelle’s trend of stepping back from traditional political expectations.Who else wasn’t at the Dick Cheney funeral?Donald Trump, JD Vance and Bill Clinton are also not expected to attend.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onObamas didn't attend Dick Cheney's funeralwhen did dick cheney diecheney's funeralWhy didn't Obamas attend Dick Cheney's funeral?Barack and Michelle Obama Dick Cheney's funeraldick cheney funeraldick cheney deathcheneywhere will dick cheney be buriedMichelle Obama\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)
