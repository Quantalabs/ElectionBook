Smith has weighed in on politics once again. This time he’s urging his fellow Americans to give Elon Musk a chance. \n\nMusk has divided Americans with his roving role in President Donald Trump’s administration. \n\nThe South Africa native’s DOGE cuts in particular have proved polarizing, with his government agency-wide email asking employees to list five tasks they’d completed at work sparking outrage among employees. \n\nHowever, Smith, whose own presidential ambitions have made headlines in recent months, offered a different take. \n\n‘Elon Musk, he’s not born here. They’re making this argument he’s not an elected official, he hasn’t been confirmed by the senate and all of this,’ Smith began during a guest appearance on Fox News’ Hannity.\n\n‘Let me explain something: I get the discomfort. What they’re missing is that you messed things up so badly over the last several years. Give the man a chance to see what he does!’ \n\nThe ESPN analyst didn’t offer an entirely glowing report of Trump’s second term in office but he did insist he would reserve his criticism until seeing the results of the president’s initiatives. \n\n‘I’m looking at Donald Trump, I’m not comfortable with everything that I’m seeing,’ Smith confessed. ‘I’m not comfortable with everything that he’s doing like you are. But the flip side to it is that you are willing to see the results before I engage in condemnation.\n\n‘See, that’s the problem. The partisanship, they’re already showing it. And they’re echoing exactly what they were doing about the campaign, which means that they’re not going to resonate and they’re going to ensure that the Republicans probably win the midterms and then get four more years come 2028 because the same song and dance with the same argument is not going to cut the mustard.’ \n\nThe controversial take is just the latest in a series of bold political opinions Smith has divulged since November’s election. \n\nIn recent weeks, Smith shocked Bill Maher’s audience with his blunt verdict on why Trump won a second term in the White House – and admitted why he feels like a ‘damn fool’ for supporting Harris. \n\nAs a result of his hot takes, which have gone viral, Smith has generated a lot of support for a potential presidential bid. \n\nSmith, who previously spoke exclusively to DailyMail.com about a possible foray into the world of politics, has repeatedly hinted at running on the Democratic ticket in 2028 since Kamala Harris’ defeat to Trump at the ballot box in November. \n\nDespite his insistence that he has no desire to be president, the 57-year-old claimed that he would beat any candidate the Democratic party put forward.\n\n‘If they told me I had a legitimate, bonafide shot to win the presidency of the United States of America, I would entertain it,’ Smith told DailyMail.com in the buildup to this month’s Super Bowl. \n\n‘Because the part that I’m not joking about is I believe I could beat every candidate on that poll. Every candidate that they mentioned, from Kamala Harris right on down to (Pete) Buttigieg and to Tim Walz. I’d beat all of them. I do believe that. I really do.’\n\nIn a shock new gambling market first reported by Front Office Sports last week, he was listed as one of the favorites to be the Democrats’ nominee for 2028, only trailing Gavin Newsom Josh Shapiro and Wes Moore.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, a $100 bet on Stephen. A to win the race would win you $1,241, and his odds of winning the nomination are now reportedly 7.26%.\n\nIncredibly, Smith is currently tied with the likes of Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the betting on prediction market Kalshi, while he sits above Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, Mark Cuban, John Fetterman and J.B. Pritzker.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nStephen A. Smith has weighed in on politics once again. This time&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Stephen A.

The Academy Awards are upon us, and antisemites are trying to take over a beloved evening.\n\nOn the very day of the release of the Bibas family members — who were murdered by Hamas in cold blood in Gaza — Artists4Ceasefire sent a letter encouraging attendees to wear a pin featuring a bloody hand to the Oscars.\n\nWhat is happening here?\n\nThe pin is a slap in the face to Jews, and other terror victims, across the globe.\n\nIt symbolizes the violence of the Second Intifada, in which Palestinian terrorists murdered Jews in the West Bank with their bare hands.\n\nDuring that time, one of the terrorists looked out a window and held his bloodied hands up high in front of a cheering crowd after brutally murdering two Israelis.\n\nThe Hollywood A-Listers’ claim the hand’s “red background [is] to symbolize the urgency of the call to save lives. The orange hand conveys the beautiful community of people from all backgrounds that have come together in support of centering our shared humanity. The heart being cradled in the center of the hand is an invitation for us to lead with our hearts, always, to lead with love.”\n\nSure. It’s all about “love” and “shared humanity.”\n\nHow utterly perverse: Either they’re shockingly ignorant (particularly for people who pretend to be enlightened) or they’re intentionally closing their eyes to the figure’s actual savage origins.\n\nAfter all, there are plenty of other symbols this movement could use to express their desire for love, peace and harmony (a dove? a simple heart?).\n\nBut their choice of the bloody hand effectively endorses Arab terror and barbarism against Jews.\n\nRemember, this is the same group of people who claim they want a permanent cease-fire and hostage release but are radio silent about the fact that the Bibas boys’ mother — our beloved Shiri — did not come back with her murdered children.\n\nThey stayed mum as Hamas returned a different, unknown body, and took its sweet time returning her back to Israel.\n\nNor do they see any moral differences between those who perpetrate unprovoked acts of savagery (who strangles babies with their bare hands?) and those who act to defend themselves while taking pains to protect their enemy’s civilians.\n\nThis week, all of Israel, and the entire Jewish world, came together to honor the memories of the slaughtered Bibas boys and their mom during their funerals.\n\nThree funerals at once.\n\nAn entire family murdered in captivity, with no chance to say goodbye.\n\nYet, as we learned from the 2024 presidential election, so many in Hollywood are simply clueless.\n\nThey think their celebrity status as performers somehow makes them smarter and more important.\n\nThe truth? Their mindless endorsements of former Vice President Kamala Harris were ignored by a solid majority; most Americans, it turns out, can think for themselves and see with their own eyes.\n\nNor will their hate-filled political stunts silence our proud Jewish voices.\n\nThis week, the Jewish community of Hollywood came together — more than 700 of us — to denounce these terror-backers, who clearly don’t care about Jews and Jewish suffering.\n\nWhen they wore the pins to the Oscars last year, I and so many others were shocked that stars like Mark Ruffalo and Billie Eilish could be so morally obtuse.\n\nBut in the intervening year, there’s been even more evidence (as if Oct. 7, 2023, wasn’t enough) that they are on the wrong side of morality: Day after day, former hostages and Oct. 7 survivors have shared their traumatic experiences.\n\nYet the celebs still side with Islamist terror and against Israel and Jews.\n\nTheir moral depravity is hugely disappointing to anyone who understands the issues, the history — and what these hate symbols actually represent.\n\nBut this year, let’s not give them a platform.\n\nIf any other racist group was invited to a major awards ceremony, the invitation would be rescinded immediately.\n\nI plead with my fellow Hollywood voices to press the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to lay down the law: Ban these pins from the Oscars.\n\nIf anyone wears them, kick them out.\n\nPublic support for violence against Jews must not be the new norm — in Hollywood or anywhere else.\n\nYuval David is an Emmy Award-winning actor and filmmaker.","summary":"The Academy Awards are upon us, and antisemites are trying to take over a beloved evening.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/opinion/dont-give-a-listers-an-oscars-platform-to-promote-terror-against-jews/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/oscar-logos-pictured-red-carpet-99369454.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 22:52:19","author":"Yuval David","authors":["Yuval David"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.14},{"id":295453254,"title":"Republicans troubled by Zelensky-Trump meeting as Democrats decry ‘planned ambush’","text":"“As someone who fundamentally believes that Russia, China and Iran are not our friends or allies and continues to believe it is important to support Ukraine, it was extremely short-sighted to engage in that type of exchange in front of the US and international press as you work towards an agreement,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) wrote on X. “Sadly, the only winner of today is Vladimir Putin.” \n\nOther swing-state and swing-district Republicans have broken from Trump on the Ukraine-Russia war over the years. Several have opposed Trump calling Zelensky a dictator and hoped the meeting on Friday between the two leaders would cement a continuing partnership between the United States and Ukraine.\n\nHowever, a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelensky, and Vice President JD Vance caused Zelensky to leave the White House and cancel most of his planned events in Washington.\n\n“Some want to whitewash the truth, but we cannot ignore the truth,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) said in a post to X. “Russia is at fault for this war.”\n\nBacon, who is one of three Republicans in a district won by former Vice President Kamala Harris, called the meeting “a bad day for America’s foreign policy” in a statement to multiple outlets.\n\n“Ukraine wants independence, free markets, and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West. Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom,” Bacon added.\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), who previously said the mineral resource deal that was to be signed on Friday between the U.S. and Ukraine was akin to “victim extortion,” said it was “heartbreaking” to witness the meeting between the leaders.\n\n“It is time to put understandable emotions aside and come back to the negotiation table,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “This can and will be fixed. A strong, sovereign Ukraine is essential for global stability in the face of Putin’s ongoing aggression. Lasting peace can only be achieved through unwavering strength.”\n\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine, which marked three years earlier this week, has been one of the most contentious domestic policy matters to split the Republican conference, leading to many controversial votes when it came to funding the war and providing supplies. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stood firm with Ukraine, which often became a point of tension between himself and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in the last Congress. \n\nThe vice president and president “were caught off guard by Zelenksy’s antics,” and they did not plan to have an acrimonious meeting ahead of time, a source familiar with the White House meeting told the Washington Examiner. The White House also released a list of congressional Republicans and other GOP officials and noted, “Support pours in for President Trump, VP Vance’s America First Strength.”\n\nUkrainian-American Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) did not join her fellow GOP colleagues in condemning what happened in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon. \n\nInstead, she slammed Zelensky, saying he did Ukrainians a “disservice” and that this is “not a theater act but a real war!”\n\nMost Republicans praised Trump and Vance’s actions as a show of strength. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) applauded Trump for “standing up for America’s best interests.”\n\n“Gone are the days of President Biden’s weak appeasement policies and global handouts. America is the greatest country in the world – no one gets to lecture our President in the Oval Office and disrespect America’s generosity,” he said in a statement on Friday afternoon. \n\n“President Trump is making it clear the international community must do their fair share instead of solely relying on American taxpayers to foot the bill,” Scott added. \n\nPro-Ukraine Republicans change their tune on Zelensky\n\nThe meeting has led pro-Ukrainian Republicans to distance themselves from Zelensky. Earlier, a bipartisan group of senators met with Zelensky. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, posted a photo of himself on X shaking the Ukrainian president’s hand, writing the delegation met to “discuss Ukraine’s future and the mineral deal brokered by President Trump.” \n\nThe Mississippi senator has since deleted that post. \n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a strong advocate of Ukraine, called the White House meeting “a complete, utter disaster” and said he hoped that the minerals deal would have transformed the relationship between the White House and Zelensky. \n\n“Somebody asked me, am I embarrassed about Trump? I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country,” Graham told reporters at the White House following the meeting. “What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again.”\n\nThe South Carolina senator added he is uncertain if the relationship between Zelensky and the White House can be repaired.\n\n“He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change,” Graham said to the Washington Examiner. \n\nThe meeting is already being used to tee up primary competition ahead of several Senate Republicans’ reelections in 2026.\n\n“Don’t forget that two weeks ago, John Cornyn flew to Munich to be the star of a Zelensky propaganda video aimed at getting tens of billions more of our tax dollars sent to Ukraine,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said about his home state senator, quoting a video of several senators from both sides of the aisle meeting with Zelensky. “It’s truly unbelievable to watch.”\n\nNate Morris, a Kentucky Republican who is eyeing McConnell’s open Senate seat, took a shot at the longtime senator in a post to X.\n\n“We don’t need more RINOs in DC like Mitch McConnell who bow to Zelenskyy as some sort of false idol,” Morris said. “What President Trump and VP Vance did today was give a middle finger to the globalists who desperately want a blank check for Ukraine so they can keep this war going on forever.”\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to McConnell for comment.\n\nDemocrats blast ‘planned ambush’ and accuse Trump of bowing to Putin\n\nCongressional Democrats pointed their fingers at Trump and Vance for their actions that led to the meeting becoming explosive. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said the meeting was a “planned ambush.”\n\n“Trump has become Putin’s lapdog, and America’s global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy. What an embarrassment,” Murphy said.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) called the meeting unprofessional, saying, “We don’t gain anything by acting like bullies.”\n\n“It seemed to me it was just, you know, JD Vance saying, ‘Hey look what I can do, Dad,’ and it doesn’t help the situation,” Kelly said during a Friday appearance on MSNBC. “This negotiation should have been done behind closed doors.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) took a shot at Republicans who praised Trump for his strength and argued a better show of strength would be for Trump to “engage with him in a dignified way.”\n\n“But you would never know that after President Trump’s shameful display. Putin must be overjoyed with today’s theatrics,” Pelosi said. “Following the U.S. vote in alignment with Russia at the United Nations last week, a disturbing pattern has emerged that is contrary to America’s longstanding support of democracy around the world.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) echoed Pelosi and accused Trump and Vance of “doing Putin’s dirty work.”\n\n“Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy,” Schumer wrote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) blasted Trump and the administration for continuing to “embarrass America on the world stage.”\n\n“Today’s White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator,” Jeffries said in a statement following the meeting. “The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin.”\n\nMarisa Schultz contributed to this report.","summary":"Vulnerable Republicans are expressing disappointment with the breakdown in talks between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and argued that the volatile White House meeting only benefited Russia. “As someone who fundamentally believes that Russia, China and Iran are not our friends or allies and continues to believe it is important to support [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3333945/republicans-issue-warnings-zelensky-trump-meeting-white-house/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MixCollage-28-Feb-2025-04-09-PM-6078.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 22:20:09","author":"Rachel Schilke","authors":["Rachel Schilke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":295462072,"title":"Did Trump 'Kick' Zelenskyy Out, Feed Lunch To Staffers?

Those concerns came to a head during Biden's debate against now-President Donald Trump in June, when Biden sounded hoarse and appeared to stumble through several answers.Despite growing concerns from Democrats and worsening poll numbers, Biden declined to withdraw from the race for nearly a month.Democrats, for months, have been debating the reasons for their defeats. While many point to ideological or policy reasons, others say the debacle cost the party trust among voters and was a key factor in why Harris could not win back voters against Trump.What To KnowMichael LaRosa, who served as former first lady Jill Biden's press secretary, slammed the party's approach to handling concerns about the former president's age during a Wednesday panel discussion at American University's Sine Institute of Policy and Politics.\"I will use the term 'gaslight' because that's what they were doing, the campaign, former colleagues,\" he said. \"The message to everybody was to make sure that you tell people 'It's too early. It's too early. These polls don't mean anything.\"He said that the message continued for about a year and a half, and the numbers didn't move as the election inched closer.\"By denying the data that was out there publicly. By denying the really insightful journalism that, they were actually demeaning a lot of the people. It was the data denial that really bothered me,\" he said.He said it became clear to him quickly that Biden planned to run for reelection, despite many believing he would pass the torch to a new generation of leaders.\"Ultimately, the problem with deciding to run for reelection again was a misread of our mandate,\" he said.What People Are SayingFormer White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, during a Institute of Politics at Harvard University discussion on Wednesday: \"It was a firing squad, and I had never seen anything like it before.

And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII,'' wrote Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Medvedev on X.\n\nAnd Russian state media followed.\n\nAleksandr Kareyevsky, a TV host on the Rossiya 24 channel, said the meeting 'looks more like a public flagellation for Zelensky' and something that 'no one expected from the U.S. president.' \n\nRussian strikes continue across Ukraine. And Russian President Vladimir Putin benefits from any delay in a peace deal. Putin has long wanted to see a split between Ukraine and the United States, which has provided billions in foreign aid to the war torn country.\n\nFriday proved an extraordinary day at the White House where two world leaders got into a shouting match - the likes of which have never been seen in public. \n\nTrump threatened to abandon Ukraine completely if Zelensky did not agree to his peace terms. He also accused Zelensky of not being grateful.\n\nZelensky held his own, even showing Trump photos he brought of the devastation to his country, and arguing he had thanked the American people.\n\nThe showdown played out on TV screens across the world. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., seated to the side in the Oval Office, buried her face in her hands. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, seated on a couch next to Vice President JD Vance, slouched and looked extremely uncomfortable. Vance couldn't stop grinning. \n\nZelensky later posted a series of thank yous to Trump, Congress and the United States but it's unclear if the gesture will be enough to win back American support. But he didn't directly address his meeting with Trump and Vance.\n\nTrump has long made it clear he doesn't think American dollars should go to Kyiv. \n\nThe two leaders were supposed to sign a deal to give the U.S. rights to some of Ukraine's rare earth minerals. That signing, along with a press conference, was canceled. \n\nRussia salivated over the situation. \n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was a miracle that Trump and Vance had restrained themselves from hitting Zelensky.\n\nLongtime Russian lawmaker Andrei Klishas called Zelensky a 'clown' in the post on the messaging app Telegram and said he 'played his role of a `president´ poorly in the White House and was thrown out for bad behavior and disrespect towards the U.S.'\n\nKonstantin Kosachyov, deputy chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament, said the event showed Zelensky's true color.\n\n'Zelensky lost this round with a deafening rattle. And he will have to crawl to the next one on his knees,' Kosachyov wrote on Telegram.\n\n'When for several years you get away with any lie, and the applause drowns out any doubts, there is an illusion that everything is allowed and that this will always be the case.\n\nBut other European leaders backed Zelensky.\n\n'The only obstacle to peace is the decision by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to continue his war of aggression,' Sweden's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a statement. 'If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine.'\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X: 'Dear Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.'\n\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his support for Ukraine. \n\nThe next moves are unclear as is the fate of Ukraine.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: 'It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved.\n\n'Because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.'\n\nThe day started off pleasant enough with Trump greeting Zelensky at the West Wing door. He even joked the Ukrainian president 'dressed up' for the occasion.\n\nBut their Oval Office meeting divulged at the 40-minute mark after Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of not being grateful.\n\nThat set off Trump. Both men demanded Zelensky say 'thank you.'\n\nTrump was repeatedly shouting over Zelensky as he tried to defend his position.\n\nAnd Vance accused Zelensky of bringing in dignitaries to his country on 'a propaganda tour.'\n\n'Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?' Vance berated him.\n\nZelensky tried to respond, but that only got Trump's ire up.\n\n'Don't tell us what we're going to feel, because you're in no position to dictate,' he said.\n\n'You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,' Trump told Zelensky, after last week calling him a 'dictator' and blaming Ukraine for starting the war. \n\nYelling with his face getting red, Trump intoned: 'You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now … You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.'\n\n'You're gambling with World War Three. You're gambling with World War Three, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country – this country that's backed to you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\n\n'Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting,' Vance said next in the tag team pile-on.\n\n'You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October,' Vance, said, characterizing Zelensky's trip to an ammunition factory which did not feature Kamala Harris, Trump's opposition.\n\n'Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,' he demanded.\n\n'You think that, if you will speak very loudly,' Zelensky tried to counter in his accented English.\n\n'He's not speaking loudly,' Trump said. 'Your country is in big trouble.'\n\n'I know,' Zelensky responded. 'You're not winning. You're not winning this,' Trump told him.\n\nZelensky got a moment to try to counter, saying 'in our country, staying strong, from the very beginning of the war, we've been alone, and we are thankful.' \n\nToward the end Trump gave remarks indicating the blow-up was serving a purpose for him.\n\n'I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful you don't have the cards. You're buried there. You people are dying. You're running low on soldiers,' Trump said.\n\n'You're running low on soldiers. Listen, you're running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing. Then you tell us, 'I don't want a cease fire. I don't want a cease fire,' Trump said, delivering a mocking impression of his counterpart. 'I want to go, and I want this – look, you could get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.'\n\n'Of course I want to stop the war. What I said to you – with guarantees,' Zelensky said. He has been pushing for security guarantees from the U.S.\n\nShortly after the argument, Trump ended the public part of the meeting. \n\n'This is going to be great television, I will say that,' he said. \n\nAs press was being ushered out, President Trump reached over and patted Zelensky's shoulder.\n\nAs this all went on, one White House staffer whispered to another: 'This is going to be big.","summary":"Russia cheered on President Donald Trump in his Oval Office showdown Volodymyr Zelensky that resulted in the Ukrainian president being kicked out of the White House and peace talks put on hold.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14448775/russia-happy-trump-zelensky-oval-office-showdown.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/28/21/95705691-0-image-a-52_1740778096404.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/28/7007544814547483693/1024x576_MP4_7007544814547483693.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-28 21:51:19","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":295453250,"title":"Under Biden, ‘Green’ was the color of money","text":"The biggest recipient, the Climate United Fund, which hauled in $7 billion, is headed by a Democratic operative. One related grant went to a brand-new, Democratic-run nonprofit group connected to liberal media favorite Stacey Abrams. These groups now control billions in taxpayer dollars, and they claim the EPA no longer controls this money.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Joe Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, landed a spot on the board of an energy company that Granholm had earlier awarded a $600 million grant to.\n\nThe lesson of these incidents is not that the Biden administration was uniquely corrupt. All of these shenanigans happened in previous administrations of both parties. The lesson is about the nature of renewable energy and environmental policy.\n\nBecause much of green-energy policy is about making unprofitable technologies turn a profit, it necessarily stands at the intersection of the private sector and the government. The key drivers of such policy will not mostly be what is good for the planet but what profits those who are politically connected.\n\nGreen, in short, is the color of money.\n\nGreen banks\n\nThe unprecedented and massive EPA grants in the final months of the Biden administration were an attempt to “Trump-proof” green-energy spending. In short, Democrats were creating a slush fund.\n\nOf course, they didn’t call it a slush fund but a “Green Bank.” The Green Bank was not a new idea in the Biden era. Obama-era Democrats pushed for a Green Bank, and around that time, international institutions set up their own versions.\n\nCongress had already earmarked billions for solar and wind energy and a dizzying array of subsidies for plug-in cars, electric buses, and the like. So why would they need a special Green Bank?\n\nThe purpose of the Green Bank was to insulate their green spending from democratic accountability. The greenies didn’t want their money to dry up if voters decided it wasn’t a good use of taxpayer dollars.\n\n“Once established, funded, and furnished with a Board of Directors,” explained one Green Bank called the Coalition for Green Capital, “its investment decisions would be made by experts rather than by elected officials. It would be insulated from politics and would receive no further taxpayer funding after its initial capitalization, instead drawing in private capital to co-invest in its projects.” \n\nRead those words again: “Its investment decisions would be made by experts rather than by elected officials. It would be insulated from politics.”\n\nThat means insiders would control many billions in taxpayer dollars, while the taxpayers, the voters, would have little or no ability to control or audit the spending.\n\n(CGC is run by Reed Hundt, a law school friend of former President Bill Clinton and former Clinton appointee.)\n\nDemocrats were explicit about this. In the summer of 2024, they did everything they could to “Trump-proof” their green-energy spending. Politico reported, “Congress commanded that the money go out quickly, setting a strict Sept. 30 deadline that would prevent a future Trump administration from clawing it back.”\n\nGetting the money out of government coffers and into the hands of friendly nonprofit groups was necessary because “if it was a government-run program, they could take the money away if Trump won,” as one EPA Biden appointee put it after the election. “It was an insurance policy against Trump winning.”\n\n“Throwing gold bars off the edge” of the Titanic was how the Biden EPA official famously put it.\n\nLee Zeldin, President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator, highlighted the “gold bars” video when he announced he would try to claw back the money.\n\nMuch of the news media attacked Zeldin’s efforts and defended the massive grants as sacrosanct. What’s notable is how little coverage these initial grants and their politically connected grantees received.\n\nIf you search the archives of Politico or, say, the Washington Post, you will not find a single mention of the Climate United Fund until after Zeldin announced his plan to rescind the money.\n\n(The Washington Examiner reported on the grant awards to the Climate United Fund when they were first announced in April 2024.)\n\nOne of these climate funds to receive $2 billion was a brand-new nonprofit coalition called “Power Forward Communities.” The leader of this coalition is a Democratic-connected nonprofit group called “Rewiring America.” Free Beacon reporter Thomas Catenacci has reported extensively on the group’s political ties, including a revolving door with former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign and Abrams’s seat on the board.\n\nAbrams is not merely a failed Democratic politician who refused to concede her election loss. She is renowned as one of the best recruiters of Democratic voters in the country. So, the Green Bank serves, in part, to subsidize the Democratic Party.\n\nThis is why many Republicans oppose all green-energy spending and nearly all new federal spending programs: These programs exist in large part to fund the organs of the Left and to slush money around in Democratic coffers.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act that funded these Green Banks could largely be understood as the “Elect Democrats in 2028 Act.”\n\nThe Revolving Door\n\nThe revolving door, whereby politicians, staffers, and appointees get rich by passing between government and the private sector, is not limited to green energy, but it thrives there.\n\nThat’s why nobody was surprised when Biden’s energy secretary exited the administration to take a board spot at Edison International, a massive holding company of U.S. utilities.\n\nGranholm, as secretary, awarded a $600 million grant to a consortium including some of the utilities held by Edison.\n\nGreen-energy lobbyists are at the heart of the Democratic Party. The Democratic National Committee chairman under Biden was Jaime Harrison, a former lobbyist whose clients included the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.\n\nThese green-energy businesses getting federal subsidies aren’t tiny environmental nonprofit groups trying to save the world. Typically, they are very large businesses.\n\nGreen-energy companies spend as much on lobbying as fossil-fuel companies do, Scientific American found in an Obama-era study. One of Biden’s environmental plans included subsidies for private jets.\n\nAnd, of course, the Hunter Biden scandals include green-energy lobbying. Biden donor Karen Tramontano, who used Hunter Biden’s name to get a consulting contract with Ukrainian energy giant Burisma, later parlayed that Ukrainian access into a green-energy lobbying gig in Ukraine.\n\nSkepticism warranted\n\nWhen you recall that one of the longest-running green-energy subsidies, the ethanol mandate, has likely been bad for the planet and that the Biden electric-car-charger initiative failed to install chargers, it’s natural to be cynical about what’s going on in the green-energy push.\n\nThen, when you consider that the whole undertaking amounts to funneling billions of dollars into Democratic-connected nonprofit groups while enriching Democratic political operatives, the cynicism seems more than warranted.\n\nThe Biden administration was praised as the greenest ever. For Biden’s inner circle, that was certainly true.","summary":"In the summer of 2024, the lame-duck Biden administration handed out the four largest grants ever given to private entities, adding up to $14 billion from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sprecher and his wife, newly appointed administrator of the Small Business Administration Kelly Loeffler. \n\nAmong its prominent speakers were Republican Senator Tim Scott and Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, who at one point genuinely referred to Senator Scott as “my brother.”\n\nIf not quite the Illuminati, all this star power felt at least like a gathering of today’s “Talented Tenth.” This was an effort to engage in meaningful dialogue with a bipartisan group of businesspeople and policymakers — which is important because a lot of people just engage solely on the left or on the right. But these were men and women who say, “Look, we want to engage with both parties to talk about how we want, as a Black business community, to be a part of this expanding economy.”\n\nOne of the hosts, Walter Davis, a Charlotte business leader, set the tone of the event right from the start: “This is all about engagement. You know, there’s a lot swirling right now. Someone recently said to me that Black women are disengaging because they don’t want to support people who don’t support us – so we’ll just focus on us. But we don’t have a choice but to engage. Frederick Douglass didn’t disengage. Martin Luther King didn’t disengage. If you want change, you have to engage.”\n\nOr, in the words of Senator Tim Scott in addressing the conference: “Our relatives have paid too high of a price for us not to see discomfort as a motivating factor for our success. I can be a victim, or I can be victorious. But I couldn’t be both. What matters is our ability to persevere. We come from people who are victorious through perseverance.”\n\nLoren Douglass, from the Harvey C. Russell, Jr., Institute for International Business and Strategic Coalitions, offered an even more direct, practical take: “We now know that affirmative action and DEI are things of the past — so we’re going to harness the power of the markets to make affirmative action and DEI irrelevant.” He also pointed out that the American economy has historically grown at a 1.5% clip, while the average return on capital has been 45%. What this means is that you’ve got to own to accumulate wealth. This is a “capitalist” economy and not one powered by wages.\n\nNot that this is anything easy. In particular, Senator Warnock framed the reality for Black individuals: “We all know that this is a system we’ve always been a part of, although that system has not always recognized our contributions, has not, for that matter, always recognized our humanity. And in many ways, we find ourselves in that fight again, but we’re not new to this fight, and we’re ready.”\n\nIndeed, there’s no value to be found in sitting out these four years. In fact, there are tremendous economic opportunities that promise to present themselves if we stay engaged.\n\n“It’s incredibly important for us to figure out how to unlock capital for disadvantaged communities,” said Senator Scott. “My goal is to set the kind of parameters that allows for $1 trillion of capital to be set free in disadvantaged communities in the next 10 years. I believe we can get even to $2 trillion…. What does that take? It takes us creating a little more flexibility on the resources that we create for affordable housing. It also takes financial inclusion.”\n\nFor those of us disengaged, note that this is a Republican talking – and not simply a Republican but the chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\n“If you’re not about red or blue, but you’re about green,” Scott concluded, “And you’re agnostic about the person bringing the assistance, let us celebrate the people who bring the assistance to you.”","summary":"In the midst of federal job layoffs, and the increasing handwringing by Black female supporters of former presidential candidate Kamala Harris on whether to rest or help others fight during the next four years, an intriguing conference – dubbed The Opportunity Summit - gathered last week in both the U.S. Capitol and…\n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/black-elites-gop-senators-gather-in-d-c-for-surprise-1851766898","image":"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/3b6c7939ec02f6282a46b70862085a5a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 21:44:43","author":"Tatsha Robertson","authors":["Tatsha Robertson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.143},{"id":295453244,"title":"Biden told Trump he blamed Obama and Pelosi for 2024 election loss","text":"During an interview with the Spectator released on Friday, Trump disclosed a conversation he had with Biden at the White House last year, during which Biden allegedly revealed that he held former President Barack Obama and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) responsible for his stunning exit from his 2024 reelection campaign and for former Vice President Kamala Harris’s subsequent loss to Trump.\n\n“I asked him, I said, ‘So who do you blame?’ Because he was very angry,” Trump said. “And he said, ‘I blame Barack.’ … And he said, ‘And I also blame Nancy Pelosi.’”\n\nTrump added that Biden didn’t appear to have any animosity toward former Vice President Kamala Harris, who took the former president’s place at the top of the Democratic ticket last July after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\n“I said, ‘What about the vice president?’ He said, ‘No, I don’t blame her,’ which was interesting. Yeah. He didn’t blame her. He blamed. … He told me he blamed those two people,” Trump said during the interview.\n\nPelosi helped lead a Democratic pressure campaign to convince Biden to step down last July after his disastrous presidential debate with Trump a month earlier spurred deep concerns about Biden’s mental fitness. She also blamed Biden for not stepping aside sooner to let a younger nominee take his place after Harris lost the November election to Trump.\n\nPelosi later revealed she hadn’t spoken with Biden in months after the pressure campaign, and former first lady Jill Biden additionally hinted in an interview last month that her family’s decadeslong relationship with the former House Speaker was in a difficult spot. \n\nObama also reportedly applied pressure through back channels to push Biden to drop his reelection bid last year, including by green-lighting George Clooney’s op-ed in the New York Times urging Biden to step aside. The Obamas subsequently appeared to make subtle digs at Biden during their speeches praising Harris at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\n\nAfter revealing that Obama and Pelosi were in Biden’s doghouse, Trump gave his thoughts on the infamous debate that sparked Biden’s decision to end his own reelection campaign. \n\n“So we go to the debate, and I walk in, and I sort of look, he wasn’t looking good. But then he had a lot of white. Very white, too white,” Trump recalled. “You know, if he did better in the debate, would he have been changed or not? If he was normal in the debate, would it have changed, or was the debate? … He blames the debate for the reason he had to get out.”\n\nTrump touched on several other topics during his interview with the Spectator. The president indicated that he would be willing to go on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) new podcast, announced that he wanted to build “a beautiful, magnificent ballroom at the White House,” and said that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “fired” his finance minister because of a conversation he had with Trudeau.\n\nTrump also touted his new “gold card” proposal, which allows foreign investors to buy a $5 million path to legal citizenship and provides companies such as Apple the opportunity to hire foreign students by purchasing the card. The president wants to use the idea to help pay off the federal debt. \n\n“I think a big sleeper is going to be this gold card. … The budget’s almost going to be balanced. It’s not going to be that far short. It’s going to make $5 trillion,” he said. “I have people all the time begging me to help them get into the country. Some of them are very wealthy people. They’d pay that in two minutes.","summary":"President Donald Trump said in a recent interview that former President Joe Biden blames two of his closest allies for the Democratic Party&#8216;s downfall in 2024.

That's when Vice President JD Vance jumped in instead, offering a statement that steered an already tense discussion into an unexpected, full-blown, high-volume argument for the world to watch. For the next seven minutes, Vance and Trump exchanged increasingly heated words with their visitor. Vance accused Zelenskyy of being disrespectful in the White House, of not being thankful enough for U.S. assistance, and of embarking on a “propaganda tour.” Zelenskyy pointedly questioned Vance’s authority on Ukraine, asking if he’d ever been to the country, prompting Vance to reply that he’d “watched and seen the stories.” Then Trump tagged in, coming to his vice president’s defense by demanding that Zelenskyy be more thankful and asserting that the Ukrainian leader was “gambling with World War III.” It was, in the words of Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and State Department appointee during Trump’s first term, “a horrible day for the peacemakers.” It was also a sign of how Vance, who as a senator was known for his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine, is asserting himself on matters of foreign policy immediately as vice president. Earlier this month, Vance made waves at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that took sharp aim at other world leaders. And on Thursday, the day before tangling with Zelenskyy, Vance also mixed it up in a different Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer — albeit in a much lighter tone. “Look, I said what I said,” Vance responded Thursday when a reporter asked him about his comments in Munich that were critical of alleged free speech violations in the United Kingdom. Starmer replied politely. “In relation to free speech in the U.K., I’m very proud of our history there.” The confrontation Friday with Zelenskyy was far frostier — spurred not by a reporter’s question but, according to those close to the vice president, by Vance’s desire to push back on what he believed was Zelenskyy’s inappropriate behavior in a diplomatic environment. “The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,” Vance said after pre-empting Trump’s attempt to field one last inquiry from the media. “We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States’ words mattered more than the president of the United States’ actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That’s what President Trump is doing.” Zelenskyy then asked for and received permission to address Vance directly, noting that Ukraine had previously made diplomatic agreements with Russia that were then violated. “He killed our people, and he didn’t exchange prisoners,” a visibly agitated Zelenskyy said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been at war with Ukraine for three years. “What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?” Vance shot back that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to \"come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\" Things only got more tense from there. An earlier meeting Friday between Zelenskyy and senators was “very bipartisan and very supportive,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. Asked about the more rancorous tone in the Oval Office, Whitehouse said: “That’s what you get for letting Vance in the room.” A source familiar with the planning for the Trump meeting said there was no predetermined strategy for Vance to confront Zelenskyy the way he did. Vance, the source added, felt compelled to respond after finding Zelenskyy needlessly provocative in his demeanor. “No one expected Zelenskyy to come in there and act entitled,” said this person, who added that the expectation was the Oval Office meeting would go off like a typical bilateral meeting. Another source familiar with Vance’s thinking going into the meeting said: “I don’t think anyone expected [Zelenskyy] to walk in there and act like such a petulant child.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has supported sending aid to Ukraine, called Zelenskyy’s meeting a “complete, utter disaster,” saying “the way he confronted the president was just over the top.” Graham also said he was “very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country.” Vance’s longstanding views on Ukraine aid are well-established, and Zelenskyy in the past has made no effort to hide his disapproval of the vice president, having called him “too radical” in an interview last year with The New Yorker, when Vance was running on Trump's ticket. On Friday, Vance called back to a visit Zelenskyy made ahead of last fall’s election to Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania — a trip that Republicans have characterized as a sign of support for the Democratic ticket. Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton and met with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, at the White House. “You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October,” Vance told Zelenskyy. “Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.” The adversarial tone reminded some observers of Vance's Munich speech. “I’ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from and of course, that’s important,” Vance said there, addressing European leaders. “But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me ... is what exactly you’re defending yourselves for?” Bartlett, who resigned from the first Trump administration on Jan. 6, 2021, over Trump’s response to the attack on the U.S. Capitol, acknowledged that Zelenskyy “may have come in, possibly, with the wrong posture.” “It just shows how personality is critical to policy, and how one bad meeting you know can be so potentially damning in history,” Bartlett said. “There are plenty that will see Vance as being wildly inappropriate, even stepping over the president,” Bartlett added. “And there are plenty that feel as if Vance said what needs to be said for the past three years. \"And it seems, regardless of where anyone comes down, the vice president was very eager to make this point,\" Bartlett continued. \"It was an echo of his speech at Munich, it echoes his online persona, and you saw the personification of it now in a critical, tense foreign policy situation.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump, ready to wrap up his Oval Office meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, asked for one last question from the reporters gathered in the room.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/vance-leans-hard-trumps-foreign-policy-sparks-extraordinary-oval-offic-rcna194256","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250228-Zelenskyy-Trump-Vance-aa-141-45b024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 21:26:25","author":"Henry J.

Trump accused the network of deceptively editing the interview; CBS said Trump's lawsuit was without merit.\n\nBut when the board gathered this month, Redstone was clear: She was in favor of resolving the issue, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAs Paramount executives weighed the best course of action, Redstone said she was in favor of moving forward in a way that would lead to some form of conclusion, including mediation.\n\nIt was the first time that Redstone made her wishes known to the full board. Many at CBS News and \"60 Minutes,\" where Harris' interview aired, strongly opposed a settlement.\n\nFurther complicating the matter: The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing Paramount's pending deal with Skydance. Some executives said that a settlement would smooth the way to closing the merger, even as others worried that a settlement could be interpreted as bribery for the FCC to clear the Skydance deal. Trump, for his part, told reporters Wednesday that the two were not linked.\n\nNational Amusements, Paramount's parent company, declined to comment, and Paramount has said that its legal battle with Trump is unrelated to its deal with Skydance.\n\nRedstone's carefully written statement did not mention Paramount's deal with Skydance, but it did underscore the fact that a pending multibillion-dollar lawsuit from the president made it difficult for Paramount to do business. She also said that she was removing herself from day-to-day discussions about the lawsuit.\n\nThis week, The New York Times reported that Paramount had agreed to bring in a mediator.\n\nAny settlement could be perceived as the latest corporate concession to the White House, including Disney's $15 million settlement in December and Meta's $25 million settlement last month. The possibility of a settlement, which is likely to further embolden Trump's crusade against the media, has been met with a strong backlash within the CBS ranks and outside the company.\n\nThough Redstone didn't mention the Skydance deal in her remarks, people familiar with her thinking believe she's focused on closing the deal.\n\nParamount is also navigating the consequences of doing business under a retributive president. Beyond the Skydance deal, Trump has made clear his willingness to exact revenge when it comes to companies.\n\n\"Corporations -- particularly these days are often in the crosshairs of policymakers -- and they have to navigate that,\" said Jill Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \"And that's not easy.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"(DealBook)","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/shari-redstone-wants-a-resolution-on-trump-lawsuit-before-skydance-deal/article_55a20173-b1b3-5f32-9b79-d89ed3b52222.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 21:23:14","author":"Benjamin Mullin and Lauren Hirsch,Blox Content Management","authors":["Benjamin Mullin and Lauren Hirsch","Blox Content Management"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":295449976,"title":"Zelensky’s ammo factory visit during 2024 presidential campaign explodes at White House meeting","text":"New York, March 1 (SocialNews.XYZ) A trip by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to an artillery shells factory in former US President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton in Pennsylvania during the middle of the US presidential campaign last year exploded in a diplomatic confrontation at the Oval Office.\n\nDescribing him an ingrate, US Vice-President J.D.

Immediately, the media picked up on her as the saviour of the United States against the evil Donald Trump. Her fundraising was very impressive. Her team raised more than $81 million in a 24-hour period after Biden’s resignation.

While the U.S. has been a close ally, delivering Kyiv billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid, President Donald Trump's administration has shifted Washington's policy on the conflict.Before Friday's meeting, Trump accused Zelensky of being a \"dictator,\" calling for new elections. He has also suggested Ukraine may be responsible for the war.What To KnowTrump and Zelensky met in the White House to sign a deal regarding Ukrainian minerals, as well as to continue discussions on reaching an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. But the meeting spiraled into shouting and disagreements, with Vance raising concerns about Zelensky's visit to Pennsylvania last year.\"You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October. Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who is trying to save your country,\" Vance said.His criticism stems from a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a battleground state that narrowly backed Trump in November.\"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia,\" Zelensky wrote in a post to X at the time. \"It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail. Thanks to people like these—in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries—who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.\"Although the visit was not billed as a campaign event, Republicans alleged it amounted to a campaign stop, arguing that it was inappropriate for a foreign leader to attend a political event just weeks before a crucial election. It spurred investigations from House Republicans about whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars.\"The Committee is investigating any coordination or communication among the\nBiden-Harris Administration, Pennsylvania's Office of the Governor, and President Zelensky for use or solicitation of use of government property to politically benefit Vice President Harris's presidential campaign,\" Representative James Comer, Kentucky Republican who leads the House Oversight Committee, wrote in a letter to the White House.Republican Senator Eric Schmitt, of Missouri, wrote on X at the time that Zelensky was \"campaigning for Democrats in battleground Pennsylvania today some 50 days out from our Presidential election.\"Zelensky also faced criticism around that time for describing Vance as \"too radical\" in an interview with The New Yorker.What People Are SayingZelensky, in a statement after the meeting: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit.

A Washington Post spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nBezos’ move to overhaul the opinions section was the subject of a column by Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple, but the piece was killed by editors, according to a report.\n\nThe fallout extended beyond the newsroom, as longtime figures associated with the Post voiced their disapproval.\n\nAssociate editor David Maraniss and former executive editor Marty Baron expressed concerns, with Baron describing the move as “craven.”\n\nIn an interview with Zeteo News, Baron, who had previously praised Bezos in his 2023 memoir, suggested the billionaire was “basically fearful” of President Trump.\n\nThe number of subscription cancellations, first reported by NPR, was provided by a source who requested anonymity due to concerns about professional repercussions.\n\nThe Washington Post Company, citing its status as a privately held business, declined to comment on the figures or the criticism.\n\nBezos told staffers in a memo that he supported a shift toward supporting “personal liberties and free markets.”\n\n“We’ll cover other topics too, of course,” Bezos wrote in a message to staff, which he publicly shared on X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk.\n\n“But viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\n\nHe argued that in the digital age, newspapers no longer need to offer a “broad-based opinion section that [seeks] to cover all views.”\n\nWithin the newsroom, concerns have escalated over potential editorial interference.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray sought to reassure staff, stating that he had received no indication that Bezos intended to alter news coverage. He reiterated this position in a memo to employees, urging them to continue reporting “without fear or favor,” according to NPR.\n\nBezos defended his editorial decisions, particularly the rejection of the Harris endorsement, by asserting that he was seeking to bolster the paper’s credibility among the broader public.\n\n“Most people believe the media is biased,” he wrote in an op-ed.\n\n“Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose.”\n\nHowever, he also acknowledged that his business interests create complexities, as Amazon and Blue Origin have extensive contracts with the federal government.\n\nGiven the Trump administration’s focus on reshaping government and private industry, concerns over conflicts of interest have arisen.\n\n“You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests. Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other,” Bezos wrote in October.\n\nSince then, he has donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund and attended the president’s swearing-in alongside other tech leaders. Trump later revealed that he had dinner with Bezos on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe evolving relationship between Bezos and Trump has unsettled Post employees, with some choosing to voice their objections publicly.\n\nIn January, Shipley rejected a political cartoon by Pulitzer Prize-winning staffer Ann Telnaes, which depicted Bezos and other tech moguls capitulating to Trump.\n\nTelnaes subsequently resigned.

I’m already there and thinking about that stuff a little bit more.\n\n“The success of Brat and the success of the marketing of Brat is also, in ways, a curse.\n\n“I’ll pivot but whatever I do next will be compared. I’m aware that whatever comes next will be the albatross, so to speak.”\n\nOnly child Charli, whose real name is Charlotte Aitchison, grew up in Essex and started making music aged 14, taking her stage name from her display moniker on chat site MSN Messenger.\n\nAt school she was being made fun of, but at home she was figuring out who she would later become.\n\nRecalling her school days, Charli, whose mum is of Gujarati Indian descent, told GQ: “I always felt like a loser. \n\n\"I had friends, but my school was full of blonde white girls and I was this half-Indian girl with frizzy hair and different interests.\n\n“That always made me feel a little bit rejected. I thought if I made music, people would think I was interesting. \n\n\"Deep down, one of my biggest fears was being boring.”\n\nShe said she would also be teased for having a monobrow, but added to Vogue: “Now, everyone is always -complimenting me on my hair and eyebrows.\n\n“So to all the people who made fun of me, the joke’s on you I guess.”\n\nCharli started sharing her lo-fi songs on Myspace. \n\nShe persuaded her mum Shameera, a nurse and flight attendant, and dad, Scottish entrepreneur Jon, to take her to illegal raves in East London to perform.\n\nShe said: “My mum, in particular, was terrified. \n\n\"She grew up in Uganda and never really drank and never smoked a cigarette.\n\n“She came from a Muslim family where the idea of a 14-year-old going to a rave was completely alien.”\n\nWhat followed was a short-lived stint at art school before writing and singing on I Love It for Swedish duo Icona Pop, which went to No1 in 2012.\n\n'TOO OBSCURE' \n\nHer debut album True Romance in 2013 bombed. \n\nBut the following year felt like her big break, topping the charts in the US and reaching No5 here collaborating with Iggy Azalea on Fancy, then getting another global Top Ten hit with Boom Clap, written for the soundtrack of teen movie The Fault In Our Stars.\n\nIn 2015 she released second album Sucker, which peaked at No15 and failed to quite strike the right chord.\n\nFrustrated, Charli turned to the underground and released her noisy, experimental pop EP Vroom Vroom, followed by two mixtapes, Number 1 Angel and Pop 2, which were deemed too obscure by her record label.\n\nRecalling the reaction to 2016’s Vroom Vroom, she said: “My record label was like, ‘What the f*** is this?’ \n\n\"No one got it, apart from a handful of pretty hardcore fans.” \n\nAs a megafan myself, I saw her play tiny venues for years and remember one particularly sweaty and raucous show at East London’s Village Underground in 2018 being one of the best concerts I’ve ever been to.\n\nBut her small-scale success as a niche artist was at odds with her dreams of becoming a major pop star and she eventually went all out with 2022’s Crash, which became her first No1 album.\n\nShe played a major tour and was riding high, but revealed she came away from it realising she had to dig down into what was authentically her — which led to 2024’s Brat.\n\nCharli explained: “I’ve always been caught in this dichotomy of, ‘Am I a left-field underground artist, or am I supposed to be a pop star?’\n\n“Crash was me kind of toying with the idea of, ‘No, I’m going to be a pop star,’ but also putting this protective layer of like, ‘but it’s a concept’.\n\n“After that I really did just feel like, ‘This next one is for me. I’ve done the trying-to-be-commercial thing.’ I’m not doing that any more.”\n\nIt paid off. \n\nHer diary-like album Brat sees her address everything from the death of her friend on So I, to her struggle over whether she should -settle down and start a family on I Think About It All The Time.\n\nThere are also brash, in-your-face pop bangers, themes of drugs and partying, as well as more mellow numbers like the viral TikTok hit Apple about her “sticky” relationship with her parents.\n\nThe album has already won her three Grammys and inspired millions to have a “Brat summer”. \n\nAsked about the aesthetic for that, she said you’d need “a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.”\n\nBrat ended up being named the 2024 Word of the Year by the Collins English Dictionary, which defined it as “characterised by a confident, independent and hedonistic attitude.”\n\nUS Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris changed her social media to Brat green, the colour of the album’s artwork, after Charli tweeted “Kamala IS brat,” which was reshared more than 56,000 times.\n\nCharli then created a darker, clubbier remix album, packed with features from acts such as Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande, called Brat And It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat.\n\nAs well as praise for the music, she has been hailed as a marketing genius for her album cover which just features the word “brat” across a green background.\n\nSpeaking about it, she said: “Where the actual first idea of doing a text cover came from was to save money because I was like, this album is not going to appeal to a lot of people.\n\n“Then everyone was like, ‘That’s the stupidest idea ever.’ Everyone.\n\n“Brandon [Creed] my manager, my creative director Imogene [Strauss], all my friends, everyone, was like, ‘No, not the text cover.’\n\nI’ve always had the power in my relationships, which was great to a point, but I’ve always needed to spar with someoneCharli XCXCharli XCX \n\n“The shade of green, we really honed in on what that should be. \n\n\"We wanted to go for the one that the most people in my core group had the most adverse reaction to.\n\n“Brandon was like, ‘This is really hard to look at’.

Where Zelensky is arrogant and incapable of offering charismatic gratitude, Trump is ignorant of Ukrainian concerns and Russia’s dominant impact on them.\n\nThe meeting was astonishing. Proceedings descended into near chaos when Vance jumped in to criticize Zelensky as being “disrespectful.” The vice president challenged Zelensky for not once having said “thank you” for continued U.S. military aid during the meeting. He also noted, correctly, that Zelensky had acted as a de facto campaign surrogate for the Biden-Harris campaign last fall. Trump then became angry as Zelensky sought to rebuke his claim that the Atlantic Ocean protected America from most Russian threats. Trump added, “You don’t have the cards. You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III.” Zelensky responded that the war isn’t a “game.”\n\nBoth men are to blame for this embarrassment, one that will surely see Russian President Vladimir Putin toasting his Kremlin allies.\n\nZelensky must bear significant blame for his foolish arrogance. He refused to show gratitude to Trump, to offer more calibrated ripostes to Trump’s lectures, and to placate the president’s not-insignificant ego. Whatever his wartime courage as a leader, the Ukrainian president has been repeatedly criticized by many governments for failing to appreciate the financial and other costs associated with their support to Ukraine. A former British defense secretary and ardent Ukraine supporter once referred to these frustrations by stating, “I’m not Amazon.” These criticisms reflect the fact that democratic nations need to justify sending Ukraine financial and military aid to their electorates. When Zelensky shows the arrogant expectation of aid without commensurate gratitude, it poses political difficulties for these governments.\n\nIn a sense, then, even if he shares Winston Churchill’s courage, Zelensky shares none of Churchill’s sense for always identifying the most important person in the room. Churchill’s ego was significant, and his World War Two strategic interest was always centered on countering Nazi Germany. However, following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, Churchill delivered a masterful speech to Congress. Full of humor and grace, his outreach was designed to ensure America’s total support for the defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. It worked. In contrast, Zelensky has publicly condemned some of Ukraine’s closest allies as being Russian puppets when he has had disagreements with them. Zelensky also should obviously have apologized in advance for his campaigning with former Vice President Kamala Harris. He could have said, “I did so because I believed it was the best way to save my country. But I was wrong, and I apologize.” But he didn’t.\n\nThe problem with Zelensky’s arrogance is that it is a poor diplomatic companion for Trump’s ignorance. And it is beyond doubt that the president does not understand the fundamental causes of the war in Ukraine or Putin’s strategic agenda. Trump has offered a false history of the war that blames Ukraine for its start and for its continuation. Trump also appears to believe that he must beg Putin for concessions while being able to demand them from Ukraine. This is both immoral and foolish. In seeking to woo Putin with words full of praise and U.N. votes in Russian favor, Trump misreads the Russian leader’s functional nature.\n\nAs the Washington Examiner wrote on Thursday, Putin “was taught in a very different school of diplomacy. Trump is a businessman who values personal relationships and the exchange of symbolic favors to grease great deals. But Putin is a former KGB officer, a former lieutenant colonel for the feared Soviet intelligence service, trained to understand that great deals are forged by hard-headed unilateral interest and manipulation. He cares as much for symbolic favors as he cares for his political opponents.”\n\nIt would be one thing if Trump were leveraging pressure against Putin in the same way he is with Zelensky. And maybe he soon will. But right now, all the pressure is heading in one direction. It appears to reflect Trump’s belief that Zelensky, rather than Putin, is the key obstacle to a just peace deal. That is not true. Just look at what the Russians are demanding as part of any peace deal: no concessions for Moscow, but total concessions without security guarantees for Kyiv.\n\nOn that point, there was a little-noticed moment on Friday when Trump expressed frustration with the push by Zelensky, the United Kingdom, and France to ensure security guarantees are part of any peace deal. What Trump fails to realize is that security guarantees of the kind offered by the U.K. and France through peacekeeping forces are the absolute instrumental component of any viable deal. The U.K. and France cannot and will not deploy those troops unless they have an American security backstop. It is strange that Trump doesn’t realize this. After all, how can Trump expect very close allies to risk their own people to preserve his agreement if he is unwilling to preserve those same people if Russia breaks any agreement? And without peacekeeping troops, Ukraine will not agree to a deal.\n\nTRUMP UNDERMINES UKRAINE DEAL BY EQUIVOCATING ON BRITISH BACKSTOP\n\nTrump concluded his meeting by stating that “attitudes need to change” if a peace agreement is to be possible. That’s true. But both Zelensky and Trump need to look in the mirror.\n\nOr contemplate that bust of Churchill sitting with them in the Oval Office.","summary":"President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance engaged in a stunning argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday.

Tech company IBM laid off 60,000 people in 1993, and about 25,000 workers (some outside the US) lost their jobs when Lehman Brothers bank went bust in 2008, but this swathe of job losses could outstrip them both, with numbers predicted to hit around 300,000. \n\nOn Friday February 21, Musk sent a “productivity email” to all federal employees demanding that they summarise the work they’d done in the past week. President Donald Trump hailed Musk’s ultimatum as “ingenious” and echoed that failure to comply would mean that employees would be “semi-fired or fired”.\n\nBy the Monday, chaos reigned in Washington. The bedlam left career civil servants unsure of how, or even whether, to reply, marking the latest flashpoint in a tumultuous last month created by Doge and aimed at trimming the federal workforce. Adding insult to injury, Musk later admitted the email was a ruse to test whether federal workers “had a pulse”. A follow-up email is rumoured to be coming this weekend.\n\nOn X, Musk doubled down, posting an image of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants looking at a “Got Done Last Week” list that included: “Cried about Trump, Cried about Elon, Cried about Trump and Elon some more.” Days earlier, at the annual gathering of the US right wing, the Conservative Political Action Conference, Musk brandished a chainsaw and screamed “Chainsaw!” to show the uproarious Maga crowd how he intended to eviscerate the federal bureaucracy.\n\nPolitical payback?\n\nDoge’s proposed job cuts are vast and deep. So far, much of Musk’s ire has been directed at the US Agency for International Development (USAid), where 4,700 employees have already been put on leave – with 1,600 of those positions terminated. \n\nIt’s perhaps no surprise that Doge started with this soft target. Although the US spends only about 1% of federal money on development aid, polls consistently show that Americans, especially Republicans, think Washington overspends on foreign assistance.\n\nThe cuts also come amid rising speculation that these firings could be part of a political retaliation by the White House. Influential adviser Stephen Miller claimed, without showing evidence, that 98% of workers at USAid “either donated to Kamala Harris or another leftwing candidate”. \n\nThe Trump administration has also forced out dozens of officials across the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency charged with investigating attempts at foreign interference in US elections. \n\nYet it’s not just these institutions where federal jobs are under threat. From the Department of Education to the National Parks Service, Musk is revving up his chainsaw. \n\nEven the Pentagon, traditionally a “third rail” for Republican presidents when it comes to spending reductions, is feeling the squeeze. The US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, has promised to slash military spending by 8% over the next five years from its US$850 billion (£674 billion) annual budget. While US service members in uniform are currently exempt from job losses, many expect civilian workers, especially those in their probationary period, to be shown the door soon.\n\nWashington DC, which voted for former vice-president Harris over Trump by a margin of 92.5% to 6.6%, is home to the largest number of government jobs: about 2.2 million civilians. However, federal workers are spread across the US. That includes red states where Trump won in 2024. For example, there are more than 129,000 federal jobs in Texas, more than 94,000 in Florida, and more than 79,000 in Georgia.\n\nFor Trump, this complicates the Doge agenda to make a dent in America’s US$36 trillion (£28.6 trillion) debt through mass job terminations. While many Maga supporters cheered campaign pledges to eliminate government “waste, fraud and abuse”, many now confront the stark reality of job losses in their communities (or even their own jobs). \n\nTrump has promised to get spending by the national government under control, but without addressing reform of essential services – such as Medicare and social security – it’s unclear how he can achieve this goal. \n\nBacklash and legal battles\n\nPublic opinion towards Musk breaks sharply along partisan lines. According to recent polling by YouGov, 42% of Americans have a positive view of Musk (52% unfavourable), including 79% of Republicans but just 10% of Democrats. The same percentage, 42%, think favourably of Doge, with similar partisan divides. But the number of Americans who rate Musk positively has been dropping in the past few weeks, although he is seen as increasingly influential.\n\nContributing to negativity, Musk’s rollout of Doge to oversee cuts to the federal labour force hasn’t come without major flubs. For example, he recently fired (before un-firing) workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration, tasked with overseeing the country’s nuclear weapons stockpiles.\n\nEven some Trump loyalists are pushing back. After Musk’s “document work or resign” email was blasted to the FBI, newly minted director Kash Patel sent his own message telling employees not to respond, declaring: “The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes.”\n\nOn X, Harvard political scientist Maya Sen called the reaction “probably a good development for the rule of law”, adding: “Musk got a head start but separate & distinct interests of new political appointees over their own workforces will clash more and more w/Musk.”\n\nThe Trump administration now faces mounting legal challenges to Doge’s agenda. An amended lawsuit filed by a cadre of unions, including the nation’s largest federation of unions, AFL-CIO, alleged that mass firings of probationary workers is illegal, and that only federal agencies have control over human resources decisions.\n\nBeyond legal chokepoints, Musk confronts increasing scepticism – even within Doge itself. On Tuesday February 25, 21 employees from Doge resigned, saying they would not use their professional skills to “dismantle critical public services”.\n\nEven among some Republican lawmakers, there’s worry about the breakneck speed of firings. Republican representative Jeff Van Drew, for example, said that “we have to be really careful that we’re cutting things that don’t hurt everyday people”. Some have criticised Musk’s flippant attitude toward longstanding public servants. Others think Musk is taking a hatchet to a problem that requires a scalpel. \n\nWhether a hatchet, a scalpel or a chainsaw, Musk’s slash-and-burn approach carries risks. By the 2026 midterms (when 35 of the 100 Senate seats will be up for election), the picture of Musk gleefully slicing government jobs could be less a symbol of efficiency, more a symbol of Trump-era hubris.","summary":"The Musk-led purge of public servants is causing concern among some Republicans as well as Democrats.","url":"https://theconversation.com/elon-musk-is-firing-thousands-of-workers-why-this-could-be-the-biggest-jobs-cut-in-us-history-250854","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/652308/original/file-20250228-32-sjy4cw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=295%2C5%2C3359%2C1677&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 19:53:51","author":"Associate Professor and Director of the Centre on US Politics,Thomas Gift,UCL","authors":["Associate Professor and Director of the Centre on US Politics","Thomas Gift","UCL"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.451},{"id":295422994,"title":"Trump turfs Zelensky out of White House meeting as peace talks collapse","text":"Volodymyr Zelensky has left the White House without a deal following a tense meeting with Donald Trump who accused the Ukrainian president of being \"not ready for peace.\" A planned joint press conference was also abruptly cancelled. The discussions, which were expected to focus on Ukraine’s war effort and potential U.S. support, quickly escalated into a heated exchange, with Trump accusing Zelensky of “gambling with World War III.” In a scathing statement afterward, Trump claimed Zelensky had “disrespected the United States” in the Oval Office, adding: “He can come back when he is ready for peace.” The Ukrainian leader, however, pushed back, warning that Vladimir Putin could not be trusted, the Mirror reports. Trump said: \"We had a very meaningful meeting today. Much was learned that could never be understood without direct conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he believes our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. \"I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace.\" Trump told the Ukrainian leader bluntly: \"You don’t have the cards to win this war without the United States. You either make a deal, or we’re out.\" Zelensky, however, warned Trump that Vladimir Putin’s promises of peace could not be trusted, calling the Russian leader a \"killer and a terrorist.\" He firmly rejected any suggestion of compromising with Moscow, stating: \"There should be no compromises with a killer.\" Zelensky had initially been expected to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine’s mineral resources, but tensions flared when he pressed Trump for security guarantees. The U.S. president bristled at the request, accusing Zelensky of being \"disrespectful.\" In response, Zelensky warned the U.S. would \"feel it in the future\" if it withdrew support. Trump shot back: \"Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. You’re not in a good position. With us, you have the cards. Without us, you don’t.\" When Zelensky insisted he wasn’t \"playing cards\" and was \"a president in a war,\" Trump retorted: \"You’ve got to be more thankful. I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy. I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States. Your people are brave, but you’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. It’s not going to be pretty, but you’ll fight it out.\" Vice President JD Vance also joined in the criticism, accusing Zelensky of being on a \"propaganda tour\" and chastising him for coming to the Oval Office to argue his case in front of the media. He pointedly asked: \"Have you said ‘thank you’ once?\" before reminding Zelensky that he had visited Pennsylvania last October to campaign for Kamala Harris, Trump's political opponent. During the meeting, Zelensky presented Trump with a folder containing photos of civilians killed by Russian forces, attempting to illustrate the brutality of the war. He pleaded: \"Even during war, there are rules. These guys, they don’t have rules.\" Trump denied siding with Putin, responding to a journalist: \"I’m aligned with America, and I’m aligned with the world.\" He added: \"Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\" referring to the controversies surrounding alleged Russian interference in his previous administration. The meeting took an unexpected turn when a reporter from Russia's state-run TASS news agency was mistakenly allowed into the Oval Office. Once discovered, he was promptly escorted out. Trump has repeatedly questioned whether Ukraine bears some responsibility for the war, blaming his predecessor Joe Biden for provoking the Russian invasion by pushing for Ukraine’s NATO membership. While he has previously called Zelensky a \"dictator,\" he partially walked back that claim during their confrontation.","summary":"Trump claimed Zelensky had “disrespected the United States”.","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/trump-turfs-zelensky-out-white-34773592","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article34773679.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-UKRAINE-DIPLOMACY-TRUMP-ZELENSKY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 19:43:19","author":"Gemma Ryder,Mikey Smith","authors":["Gemma Ryder","Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":295419664,"title":"Trump, Zelenskiy press conference cancelled after public argument","text":"President Donald Trump's meeting Friday with Volodymyr Zelenskiy quickly devolved into a fiery exchange when the Ukrainian leader cast doubt on the likelihood US efforts to broker a deal with Russia would yield lasting peace.The reaction by Zelenskiy inspired an angry response from Trump and US Vice President JD Vance, who suggested his criticism \"- delivered in the Oval Office \"- was disrespectful and inhibiting an end to the bloody three-year war. Minutes later Trump posted to social media saying that Zelenskiy could return to the White House when he was ready to make peace.\"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE,\" Trump said in the post. \"He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"Trump's comments indicated plans to sign a deal that would have allowed the US to gain from developing Ukraine's critical minerals as a step toward brokering a ceasefire agreement with Russia are in doubt. Zelenskiy was set to depart the White House without attending a press conference where the two leaders were slated to sign the minerals deal.The cancellation capped a remarkable exchange in the Oval Office that saw the two leaders openly bicker over their approach to resolving the war.\"It's going to be very hard to do business like this,\" Trump said, telling Zelenskiy he was not sure the Ukrainian leader could make a deal. \"You've got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us you don't have any cards.\"\"You're gambling with World War III,\" Trump continued. \"And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country \"- this country \"- that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should,\" he said. \"You're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out. I don't think it is going to be pretty.\"The meeting had been intended as a moment of unity between the leaders, who were set to sign the natural resources agreement, which was designed to satisfy Trump's concerns that US aid would not be repaid. Trump had touted the agreement as a major commitment from the US to Ukraine as he initially welcomed Zelenskiy to the White House for a high-stakes meeting with stark implications for the fight to repel Russia's invasion.\"It's a pathway to peace. It's a pathway to getting something solved,\" Trump said.The deal, however, fails to offer the explicit security guarantees Zelenskiy had wanted, instead focusing on the economic partnership between the US and Ukraine. Zelenskiy told Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly violated previous ceasefire agreements and that Ukraine would never accept a simple ceasefire to conclude the war. He insisted to Trump that the mineral deal was not enough to ensure Ukraine's security.\"Putin will never stop and will go further and further,\" Zelenskiy said, adding that the Russian leader \"hates Ukrainians\" and wanted to destroy the country. \"We can do it, but it's not enough,\" he added of the deal.Public ClashThe underlying tension between the leaders was obvious. Trump had his eyes closed and was tapping his fingers as Zelenskiy stressed his concerns about Putin reneging on an agreement. When Trump downplayed the threat of a future attack, the Ukrainian leader shook his head.\"I'm in the middle. I want to solve this thing. I'm for both,\" Trump insisted. \"It's wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved.\"Then the meeting exploded when Vance, sitting nearby, criticized Zelenskiy's approach.\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that's trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.Trump said Zelenskiy had \"tremendous hatred\" for Putin and suggested that the anger could be inhibiting a deal, while also defending his warm relations with the Russian leader as more likely to yield results.\"I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen. I'd be so tough, but you're never going to get it done that way,\" Trump said.And the leaders sparred after Zelenskiy suggested Trump did not understand the issue because the US was protected by an ocean, and didn't face the looming threat from Russia.\"You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,\" Trump said.\"Have you said thank you once?\" Vance added. The vice president went on to suggest Zelenskiy had campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris with his trip last fall to an ammunition plant in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" Vance admonished.Minerals DealThe fate of the natural resources deal remained in doubt as the meeting broke. The US president originally called the deal an \"exciting moment\" and said funds from the deal could also be used for artificial intelligence and military weapons. He reiterated that he would continue military sales to Ukraine.\"We don't know exactly how much because we're going to be putting some money in a fund that we're going to get from the raw earth that we're going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenues, so it's going to be a lot of money,\" he said.Still, Trump has downplayed calls for more explicit security guarantees, suggesting the economic ties between Ukraine and the US would suffice to deter Putin from further aggression.\"I think once we make the agreement, that's going to be 95% of it, it's not going to go back to fighting,\" Trump said. \"I've spoken with President Putin, and I think, I mean, I feel very strong. I've known him for a long time, and I feel very strongly that they're very serious about it.\"\"I'm not worried about security, I'm worried about getting the deal done,\" the president added.Zelenskiy's visit caps a dramatic week that saw both French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visit Washington to push Trump to offer US support for a European for a \"backstop\" to protect Ukraine from further attacks.France and the UK have discussed deploying a peacekeeping force but any such initiative will require US assistance, but Trump has declined to provide any assurances of US support and cast it as an issue for Europe to deal with. The US president has also pressured allies to contribute more to collective security.","summary":"","url":"https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/trump-zelenskiy-press-conference-cancelled-after-public-argument-1.500049652","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2025-02-28/xddho7uo/trump.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 18:56:59","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ae","sentiment":-0.48},{"id":295403908,"title":"Zelensky turfed out as Donald Trump says 'disrespectful' leader 'not ready for peace'","text":"President Zelensky was turfed out of the White House without a deal being reached, and a planned joint press conference was cancelled - as Trump claimed Zelensky was \"not ready for peace\".\n\nThe US President said in a statement: \"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today.

Trump Reveals Surprising Scapegoat","text":"President Donald Trump told The Spectator that former President Joe Biden blamed former President Barack Obama and Representative Nancy Pelosi for the Democrats' election loss last year.Newsweek reached out to spokespeople for Biden, Obama, Pelosi, and the Democratic National Committee via email for comment.Why It MattersDemocrats have spent months debating who is to blame for former Vice President Kamala Harris' defeat in last November's presidential race. While the debate certainly has ideological divides, others say her loss has more to do with issues like inflation or Biden's unpopularity before his exit from the race after a troubling debate performance against Trump.Biden has said he believes he could have beaten Trump had he stayed in the race, though many Democrats disagree.The debate over the Democrats' losses last year will have key implications for how they shape their messaging and policy and choose their messengers and politicians, moving forward into the 2026 midterms, when they hope to retake control of Congress.What To KnowTrump told The Spectator that during a private conversation in the White House after the election, he asked Biden who he blamed for the election results.\"And I asked him, I said, 'So who do you blame?' Because he was very angry, you know, he was a very angry guy, actually. And he said, 'I blame Barack.' And I never think of him as 'Barack.' You know, you always hear 'Obama.' You say you have to think about that for a second. And he said, 'and I also blame Nancy Pelosi,'\" Trump told the publication.Trump said he also asked Biden if he blamed Harris for her loss, but that Biden allegedly said he didn't believe it was Harris' fault.\"He said, 'No, I don't blame her,' which was interesting. Yeah. He didn't blame her. He blamed...he told me he blamed those two people,\" Trump told The Spectator.Biden has not confirmed Trump's account of this conversation. However, there have been other reports about a divide between Biden, Obama, and Pelosi.In July, The New York Times reported that Biden was \"irritated\" that Obama may have been involved in talks about removing him from the presidential ticket after the debate, during which he sounded hoarse and appeared to struggle with answers at several points.Pelosi has been more publicly critical of Biden, saying after the election that candidates other than Harris could have been considered to lead the ticket had he left the race earlier.Many Democrats viewed Pelosi declining to say Biden should stay in the race as a pivotal moment that ultimately led to his withdrawal.Trump 'Surprised' By Relationship With Keir StarmerTrump also said in the Spectator interview that he was \"surprised\" by his relationship with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the liberal-leaning Labor Party.\"I know where he comes from, from a political standpoint,\" Trump said. \"I was surprised we got along very well. I mean, we had a lunch that ended up being longer than we thought. That's always a good sign, you know, longer in the sense that we got along.\"Trump Discusses Dinner with Jeff BezosTrump said in the interview that he had dinner with former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and addressed whether he trusts Bezos and other billionaires.\"Who do I trust? I mean, who do you trust? Do you trust anybody? These are very smart guys. And I always say to them, we have dinners together, usually started by them. I'm so busy with all of this. Between China, Russia, Ukraine, I've got more things happening,\" Trump told the publication.He added that he asks many people he meets with whether they would have met him if he lost, but they \"never answer that question.\"What People Are SayingFormer first lady Jill Biden told The Washington Post in January when asked about Representative Nancy Pelosi: \"We were friends for 50 years. It was disappointing.\"Alexandra Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's daughter, to Politico, on Jill Biden: \"If I was Lady McBiden, I'd put on my big girl pants, play the long game, and think about my husband's legacy.

Compared to 2020, the number of Black voters supporting him has dramatically doubled this time. So, where are the members of his Black fan club now from his first term? From Stacey Dash to Herman Cain, here is a look at some recognizable faces who stanned the 47th president of the United States just a few years back.\n\nStacey Dash\n\nStacey Dash, known for starring in the film Clueless, gained fame in the last few years for her Fox News contribution. She has been an ardent supporter of Trump and advocated for everything he stood for. From denouncing Black causes like voter suppression to criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement, Dash faced the fury of her own community for being on the wrong side of race-related issues. However, things went well for her until she got fired from Fox News in 2017. While contributors like Hannity and Ingraham stuck around despite attempting to overthrow the then government, Stacey was fired for cursing while talking about Barack Obama on air.\n\nFollowing the incident, the actress hit rock bottom, especially with her arrest in 2019 over domestic assault charges for attacking her fourth husband. Just a year prior, she also had a failed attempt to run for Congress, which she quit after only a month.\nStacey Dash is currently trying to turn over a new leaf, cutting down her claimed drug habit, which used to cost her over $10,000 a month. She also somewhat apologized for her past statements while trying to get back her ‘Black card.” “There are things that I am sorry for. Things that I did say, that I should not have said the way I said them. They were very arrogant, prideful, and angry. And that’s who Stacey was, but that’s not who Stacey is now. Stacey’s someone who has compassion and empathy,” Dash was last seen talking about her new avatar in the third person.\n\nHerman Cain\n\nMaybe one of Trump’s biggest supporters during his 2016 campaign. Herman Cain claimed that the president wasn’t a racist and rather attacked his predecessor Barack Obama’s policies. Following Donald Trump’s win, Cain found himself the perfect spot among the right-wing dinner table. His ardent support for the president cost him big.\n\nHerman Cain died today after a long fight with coronavirus.\nBelow is a photo of Cain in a crowd of people without a mask at Trump’s Oklahoma rally last month. pic.twitter.com/5mDe9mznID\n— Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) July 30, 2020 \n\nDuring the peak of COVID-19, Herman answered a call to join a rally in Tulsa. It was mostly a huge maskless crowd, and like many of his fellow attendees, the businessman was also diagnosed with the disease before passing away a few days later. Although we’d never know whether Cain would still stand by Trump, his devotion till death was remarkable. Perhaps his advocacy for anti-vaccine and anti-mask is what made him pay an unnecessary price. It is said that aside from his political views, Herman was a friendly person who could talk to anyone.\n\nDarrell C. Scott\n\nPastor Darrell C. Scott is known as the co-founder of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. He was one of the main men who helped Donald Trump look like he had more Black supporters than he actually did. He claimed to have led a group of 100 African-American Pastors who met with the current president. His intention was to show as if the group was endorsing Trump, which they didn’t. Scott also started his radio network and went from one right-wing media to another, supporting Mr. Trump. He was trying to translate everything to his prosperity, which ultimately backfired. The status of his other group, the Urban Revitalization Coalition, was revoked by the IRS for failing to file forms required for non-profits. A closer look revealed that the group didn’t engage in any “urban revitalization.” In fact, the Pasto was accused of engaging in bait-and-switch, which led to the cancellation of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day giveaway event at Virginia Union University, a historically black school.\n\nIn his personal life, Scott also began facing multiple issues, especially after being evicted from his wife for failing to pay $50,000 in rent. In the following years, his life only got more difficult. While driving a 9-year-old car, Scott finally got ahold of his conscience. In 2022, he finally spoke against the right wing for failing to condemn a mass shooting in a Black grocery store. As of now, Darrell C. Scott continues to host SmackDown, a Saturday radio show on America’s Voice App.\n\nThrowback: Backstge with then candidate Trump at the very first rally, in College Park, Georgia, in December, 2015.

However, his life changed (for worse) after he started to support Donald Trump. Despite having no qualifications, he earned a seat as Donald Trump’s sole Black Cabinet Member. Soon, he swapped his recognition for nepotism and over-spending. The Detroit School Board was so ashamed of his downfall that they took his name off the Benjamin School.

Trump's comments came after Domenech asked about Biden's apparent warm attitude toward Trump following the November 2024 election. He explained that Biden invited Trump to the White House following his electoral win over former Vice President Kamala Harris and asked him whom he \"blamed\" for the loss. \"I asked him, I said, ‘So who do you blame?’ Because he was very angry, you know, he was a very angry guy, actually,\" Trump said. \"And he said, ‘I blame Barack.’ And I never think of him as ‘Barack.’ You know, you always hear 'Obama.' You say, you have to think about that for a second. And he said, ‘and I also blame Nancy Pelosi.’\" DEM PARTY BLAME GAME: ACCUSATIONS FLY AS TO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HARRIS' MASSIVE LOSS TO TRUMP Biden noted in his conversation that he did not blame Harris for the disarray in the Democratic Party during the election year, Trump said. \"I said, ‘What about the vice president?' He said, \"No, I don’t blame her,' which was interesting,\" Trump said. \"He didn’t blame her. He blamed … he told me he blamed those two people.\" 5 MISTAKES THAT DOOMED KAMALA HARRIS' CAMPAIGN AGAINST TRUMP The year 2024 kicked off with Biden in the driver’s seat of the Democratic Party as he keyed up a re-election effort in what was shaping up to be a second match-up against Trump. In February 2024, however, Biden’s 81 years of age and mental acuity fell under public scrutiny after years of conservatives questioning the commander in chief’s mental fitness. Special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" NANCY PELOSI FIRES BACK AT BERNIE SANDERS FOR COMMENTS ON DEMS' SWEEPING ELECTION LOSS: NO 'RESPECT' The report renewed scrutiny over Biden’s mental acuity, which rose to a fever pitch in June 2024 after the president’s first and only presidential debate against Trump. Biden faced backlash for a handful of gaffes and miscues in the days leading up to his ill-fated debate against Trump, including Obama taking Biden’s wrist and appearing to lead him off a stage during a swank fundraiser, and also abroad when Italian Prime Minister Giogia Meloni guided Biden back to a group of world leaders when he appeared to wander off to give a thumbs-up to a parachutist during the G-7 summit. THE 'SQUAD,' WARREN AND SANDERS AMONG PROMINENT POLITICAL FIGURES WHO CRUISED TO RE-ELECTION VICTORIES When the big debate day arrived, Biden missed his marks repeatedly, tripping over his responses and appearing to lose his train of thought as he squared up against Trump. The disastrous debate performance led to an outpouring from both conservatives and traditional Democrat allies calling on the president to bow out of the race in favor of a younger generation. On July 21, 2024, Biden issued a post announcing he would bow out of the race. He endorsed Harris to take the reins of the election in a follow-up post. Pelosi's relationship with Biden hit the rocks amid the speculation and the ultimate decision to bow out of the race, with Pelosi revealing on MSNBC earlier in February that she still has not spoken to Biden or former first lady Jill Biden in months but hopes to patch up their yearslong friendship. 'ABANDON HARRIS' MOVEMENT FLIPPED DEARBORN TO TRUMP ON ELECTION DAY Some Democrats and insiders have pointed to Obama for the 2024 loss, after Obama reportedly worked in the background in summer 2024 to encourage Biden’s ouster from the race. A handful of Obama's allies and former advisers helped lead the charge in calling on Biden to drop out of the race earlier in the summer of 2024, including former Obama adviser David Axelrod saying that Biden was \"not winning this race;\" longtime Obama friend George Clooney calling on the president to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed; and Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also calling on Biden to drop out of the race ahead of his eventual departure.

Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., has described DOGE as “the Elon Musk chainsaw massacre.”\n\nAs DOGE moves through the federal government, workers have lost their jobs, federal contracts have been thrown into confusion, and it seems Washington, D.C., is in chaos. This sends the message that America is not stable or reliable.\n\nOn the contrary, DOGE is far overdue, and it represents an effort to restrain a bloated federal bureaucracy and restore it under the rightful authority of the elected president. Here are three reasons why the creative destruction that DOGE is bringing is just what Washington needs.\n\n1. The Unaccountable Bureaucracy\n\nMost Americans are familiar with the three branches of government: Congress—or the legislative branch—that makes laws; the president who oversees the executive branch that enforces the laws; and the Supreme Court that oversees the judicial branch that handles resolving legal disputes.\n\nFewer know about the effective fourth branch of government: the 438 agencies in the executive branch that technically report to the president but enjoy various perks and protections that insulate them from the president’s effective control.\n\nEach year, this vast bureaucracy issues far more rules—dubbed “regulations”—than Congress passes laws. In 2023, for example, agencies issued 3,018 rules—which took up an astonishing 89,368 pages—while Congress enacted 68 laws. Those rules generally have the force of law.\n\nMeanwhile, in the name of protecting the “civil service,” the government has special systems protecting federal bureaucrats. Federal employees receive pensions, many days off, health care, life insurance, child care subsidies, and many other benefits. After two years of service, they gain protections under the Merit Systems Protection Board, which adjudicates any claims they may have.\n\nPrivate sector employers also provide many benefits and perks, but federal employees have a notorious reputation for doing little work and being extremely difficult to fire.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s first term and the COVID-19 pandemic also revealed that many bureaucrats have an entitlement mentality—they see themselves as intellectually and morally superior to the general public. Even though Americans elected Trump, many bureaucrats worked to undermine him from within. During COVID-19, the government’s medical establishment openly lied to the American people and urged Big Tech companies to censor opposition to its official narrative.\n\nThis mentality helps explain why 64% of Washington, D.C.-based federal workers who voted for Kamala Harris in the last election say they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy. Bureaucrats planning a “deep state” effort against the president represent a threat to his rightful authority and the job the American people elected him to do.\n\nDOGE represents a step toward holding these bureaucrats accountable and restoring the president’s authority over them.\n\nSo, why do these bureaucrats have such a great deal? Part of the answer is public sector unions.\n\n2. The Infrastructure Gumming Up Reform\n\nWhen Americans think of labor unions, we often conjure up the idea of factory workers banding together to lobby for improved work conditions—men and women who labor with their hands demanding a commonsense break to go to church on Sunday or asking for a raise to honor their hard work and keep up with inflation.\n\nToday, labor unions represent a massive superstructure that sends workers’ union dues to bankroll political and ideological causes. America’s largest unions aren’t just left-leaning, they directly contribute funds to Democrats—and they funnel cash to the left-wing activist groups that staffed and advised the Biden administration (the influence campaign I describe in my book “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government”). The labor movement has struggled in the private sector, but government workers flock to unions in the public sector.\n\nEven President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the godfather of America’s administrative state, opposed the idea of public sector unions.\n\n“The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations,” Roosevelt wrote in a 1937 letter. “The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress.”\n\nAny negotiation with a public employee union would constitute a loss of the people’s authority, the founder of the New Deal said.\n\nRoosevelt considered public union strikes “unthinkable and intolerable” because they cause “the paralysis of government by those who have sworn to support it.”\n\nYet today, the American Federation of Government Employees represents 600,000 federal workers in the U.S. and overseas. This union has filed multiple lawsuits to block Trump’s reforms.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees and other unions see DOGE as a threat because Trump wants to cut bureaucratic bloat, and the unions stand to benefit from larger and larger government.\n\nDOGE is a step toward reining in the federal bureaucracy and undermining the public sector unions that even FDR opposed.\n\n3. DOGE Is Restoring the Constitution\n\nAccording to the Constitution, “The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.”\n\nIf a president cannot fire the bureaucrats who work in the executive branch, does executive power truly lie with him? \n\nTrump has promised to root out the divisive ideologies of “diversity, equity, and inclusion;” gender ideology; and climate alarmism from the federal government, and these ideologies are deeply entrenched in the federal bureaucracy. Since the people elected Trump, efforts by bureaucrats to prevent his promise to return the government to sanity represent a threat to a “small-d” democratic transition of power.\n\nAs Trump attempts to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, unions like the American Federation of Government Employees have been filing lawsuits to block him, and federal judges have issued injunctions preventing him from exercising his constitutional authority. Ultimately, many of these lawsuits may end up in the lap of the Supreme Court for it to decide.\n\nThe reforms Trump is pursuing through DOGE have revealed just how entrenched the federal bureaucracy is and how necessary it is for the Supreme Court to restore the president’s authority over the executive branch.\n\nResponse to Objections\n\nChainsaws, like any human tool, can be used for good or evil. Elon Musk was not celebrating the idea of slicing up bureaucrats with a chainsaw, but taking a chainsaw to a bloated—and arguably often unconstitutional—administrative state. \n\nGrowing up in bone-dry Colorado, I used chainsaws to trim extra branches from trees, to protect my mountain home from wildfires. Sometimes a little trimming will protect your home from a worse calamity in the future.\n\nTrump has moved very quickly with DOGE, closing the offices of the U.S. Agency for International Development and freezing foreign aid for a time in order to examine where it goes. These moves have created some uncertainty, and some hardworking federal employees may fear for their jobs. \n\nThat said, private sector employees experience downsizing all the time, and a little creative destruction is long overdue in the federal government. \n\nConservatives should not celebrate when dedicated employees lose their jobs, but bureaucrats should consider how good they had it before complaining overmuch when they finally face the sort of job churn private sector employees experience on a regular basis.\n\nThis op-ed on DOGE is written in the style of Thomas Aquinas’ “Summa Theologica,” presenting arguments against the main point, making the main point, and then addressing the objections.","summary":"It seems that the Department of Government Efficiency is evil and bad for America.

He also brought Ukrainian heavyweight boxer Oleksandr Usyk and his championship belt.\n\nIn response, Trump encouraged Zelensky to consider compromises, telling him his “soldiers have been unbelievably brave.” \n\n“This was supposed to be over quickly, and here we are three years later,” he said. “You have to be very proud, but now we want to get it over with. It’s enough.”\n\nTrump then spoke about his legacy if he could negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n“I hope I’m going to be remembered as a peacemaker,” he said. “I’m doing this to save lives — more than anything else.”\n\nBut even while seated next to Zelensky, Trump was hesitant to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion and defended his own public comments regarding Putin in recent days.\n\n“You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, ‘Hi, Vladimir. How are we doing on the deal?’ It doesn’t work that way,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’m not aligned with anybody. I’m aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world.”\n\nZelensky’s visit comes after a roller coaster in relations between him and Trump.\n\nThe pair’s relationship dates back to 2019 and the phone call that precipitated Trump’s first impeachment. \n\nIn the Oval Office before his meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump acknowledged his relationship with Zelensky has been “testy” at times.\n\nIn recent weeks, the relationship eroded further. Zelensky was resistant to the U.S. terms of a rare earth minerals deal despite the Ukrainian president initially proposing it. The first drafts of an agreement, though, included U.S. demands for $500 billion, more than what the U.S. has provided Ukraine. Trump has said repeatedly that the U.S. has provided Ukraine with $350 billion in aid, but the number is closer to half of that.\n\nTrump has also said Ukraine and former President Joe Biden were responsible for the war, regardless of Russia being the aggressor. Trump’s allegations prompted Zelensky to describe the president as living in a “disinformation” space, with Trump responding that Zelensky is a “dictator” because Ukraine has suspended elections, an emergency power permitted under the country’s constitution.\n\nBut as Zelensky has warmed to the deal, even without traditional security guarantees, so, too, has his relationship with Trump, until Friday’s public lashing.\n\nBeside Starmer in the Oval Office and then in the East Room for the pair’s joint press conference, Trump was pushed to defend his description of Zelensky as a “dictator.”\n\n“Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that,” Trump said.\n\nThen, during the press conference, Trump was asked whether he owed Zelensky an apology for using the descriptor. In reaction, the president adopted a more deferential tone.\n\n“I have a lot of respect for him,” he said. “We’ve given them a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely, no matter how you figure it.”","summary":"President Donald Trump&#8216;s working visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly became heated, endangering the Trump administration&#8217;s progress on negotiating a precursory rare earth minerals agreement and an end to the war in Ukraine.

He had vainly sought to persuade Bezos to drop the plans, according to a person with direct knowledge. Shipley did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBezos' decision also prompted an outcry from longtime Post figures, including Associate Editor David Maraniss and former Executive Editor Marty Baron. Baron called the move \"craven\" and told Zeteo News that Bezos, whom he praised extensively in his 2023 memoir, was \"basically fearful\" of President Trump.\n\nThe number of cancellations comes from a person who asked for anonymity because of the fear of repercussions at the Post. The Washington Post Co. declined to comment on the figures, first reported here by NPR, citing its status as a privately held company. Nor did it comment on the criticism.\n\nA net loss of hundreds of thousands\n\nThe rapid-fire cancellations since Wednesday represent a historic level of reader fury over the changes. Yet they are only the most recent wave in a series of mass cancellations that began in late October. That was when Bezos killed a planned endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Between then and Election Day, more than 300,000 subscribers canceled the Post, as NPR first reported last month. That was more than 12% of digital subscribers, which make up the vast majority of the paper's paid circulation. \n\nThe Post has aggressively wooed new subscribers to replace them, boosting circulation by 400,000, often at highly discounted rates, according to a Post executive. (The executive spoke on condition of anonymity because the Post does not release circulation figures.)\n\nEven so, there is broad consensus inside the Post that without Bezos' decisions, the paper would be up hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers from where it was before the election. Instead, the numbers NPR has been able to obtain indicate a net loss of a couple hundred thousand subscribers.\n\nIn support of \"personal liberties and free markets\"\n\nDuring Trump's first term, under Bezos's ownership and Baron's editorial leadership, the paper adopted the motto, \"Democracy Dies in Darkness,\" an alliterative promise to deliver hard-hitting accountability journalism. The editorial page, which operates separately from the news section, laid out an argument in 2020 titled, \"A second Trump term might injure the democratic experiment beyond recovery.\"\n\nNo such emphasis was found in Bezos' memo on Wednesday setting out his new philosophy, which promised a reorientation of the opinion section in support of \"personal liberties and free markets\".\n\n\"We'll cover other topics too of course,\" Bezos wrote in a note to staffers that he posted publicly on Elon Musk's social media site X, \"but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\"\n\nIn this age of the Internet, he said, a newspaper no longer must provide a \"broad-based opinion section that [seeks] to cover all views.\"\n\nThe Post newsroom has covered the return of Trump aggressively. Wednesday's announcement alarmed senior news editors severely enough that Executive Editor Matt Murray assured them that morning that he had heard nothing to suggest that Bezos wanted to interfere with news coverage, which is separate from the opinion section. Murray sent a memo to the full newsroom to say they should continue to report \"without fear or favor,\" in the memorable journalistic aphorism.\n\nA stated desire to regain public trust\n\nBezos said his decision not to publish the planned Harris endorsement just days before the election was driven by a desire to shore up the paper's standing among the broader public. \"Most people believe the media is biased,\" he wrote in an opinion piece published by the paper. \"Anyone who doesn't see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose.\"\n\nYet he also admitted that his other business interests made things complicated. Amazon and the space company Blue Origin maintain contracts with the federal government worth billions of dollars annually. Government regulators make decisions daily that can affect their vast fortunes. The Trump administration is moving aggressively to reshape the government and private industry in line with the president's priorities. The media has served as a particular target.\n\n\"You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests. Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other,\" Bezos wrote in October.\n\nDistrust grows in newsroom\n\nSince then, however, he has given $1 million toward Trump's inauguration fund. In January, Bezos sat on the dais with other tech titans as the president was sworn in. And on Wednesday evening, he had dinner with Trump, the president told The Spectator. \n\nMany Post staffers have questioned the motives for Bezos' warmer relations with Trump. Some have been more public than others.\n\nIn early January, Shipley rejected a cartoon by Pulitzer Prize-winning staffer Ann Telnaes, whose proposed sketch showed Bezos alongside other tech and media billionaires abasing themselves before Trump. Telnaes quit, telling NPR, \"Of course these are businesses, and I understand that. But they own a newspaper and they have an obligation, frankly, to protect the free press.\"\n\nAnother spike of subscription cancellations followed in the week after Telnaes quit and Shipley's decision became public — at a volume many thousands above typical levels.\n\nThis story marks the first time that this cancellation wave has been reported publicly. \n\nSince Bezos' announcement Wednesday, some of the Post's competitors have capitalized on the news. The Guardian sent a fundraising pitch to readers, saying its fate will never be dictated by a billionaire owner. The New York Times' opinions editor Kathleen Kingsbury declared, \"our audience is looking to us for insight, discernment and leadership in some of the most chaotic and uncertain moments in the modern era,\" in a note announcing veteran Times journalist David Leonhardt would become editorial director of the section.","summary":"Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos's changes to the opinion pages have led subscribers to cancel in droves.

He told the magazine’s Ben Domenech that it was “just too bad” that former Vice President Kamala Harris replaced him on the ballot.\n\nTrump said that during his White House meeting with Biden after the election, he asked him who he blamed after he stepped down from the Democratic ticket in July. He said that Biden told him he blamed former President Barack Obama and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for being booted from the ticket. \n\n“And I asked him, I said, ‘so who do you blame?’ Because he was very angry, you know, he was a very angry guy, actually. And he said, ‘I blame Barack.’ And I never think of him as ‘Barack.’ You know, you always hear ‘Obama.’ You say, you have to think about that for a second. And he said, ‘and I also blame Nancy Pelosi,’” Trump told Domenech. \n\nHe also claimed that Biden did not blame Harris for replacing him. \n\n“I said, ‘what about the vice president?’ He said, ‘no, I don’t blame her,’ which was interesting. Yeah. He didn’t blame her. He blamed… he told me he blamed those two people,” Trump added. \n\nAfter Biden’s disastrous debate last summer, it was reported that Obama and Pelosi privately expressed concerns about whether Biden could defeat Trump. The two powerful Democrats reportedly urged Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, saying that his involvement may risk Democrats’ chances of taking the House.\n\nHe ultimately dropped out of the race in July and endorsed Harris to be his replacement. Harris’s whirlwind campaign garnered early momentum but failed to clinch overwhelming support on Election Day. \n\nSince the election, Biden’s relationship with Pelosi still appears to be tense. Pelosi criticized Biden after Trump’s victory for not dropping out of the race sooner, while former First Lady Jill Biden suggested that she has not forgiven Pelosi for her involvement in her husband’s departure from the race.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

The Senate preferred to pass two bills, with the first focusing on beefing up spending for the border, energy exploration and the military while the second bill would focus on extending the Trump tax cuts.\n\nDemocrats have zeroed in on the potential cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for people on low incomes, people with disabilities and children. \n\nBut there’s another part that could trip up the Republicans: how to reconcile their plan to extend the Trump tax cuts with Trump’s grab bag of campaign promises to eliminate various taxes. \n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump proposed eliminating taxation on tips – which Kamala Harris later copied in a bid to win over union workers in Nevada – Social Security, and on overtime. \n\nRep. Lauren Boebert was mocked on X when she touted that “No Tax On Tips has passed the House!” when in fact, this was just the outline to begin writing the bill.\n\nOn top of that, Trump suggested a reversal of a key part of the 2017 tax law. That law put in place a cap of $10,000 on how much people could write off their state and local taxes (SALT) as a deduction on their federal taxes. Democrats have used to hammer swing-district Republicans in blue states where state and local income taxes tend to be higher.\n\nThat’s a big ask, which already has some Republicans nervous. \n\n“I still think we'll have to come back and take another bite at the apple, regardless what's done in this big, beautiful bill, I think there'll be pieces left for us to come pick up later,” Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, a major supporter of the president, told The Independent. \n\nSen. Jim Justice of West Virginia defaulted to the classic kind of magic math that Republicans have used to justify sweeping tax cuts for the past few decades: that the tax cuts will unleash economic growth that will make up the difference lost by a decrease in money sent to the federal government. \n\n“I think those are absolutely major impacts to the upside of the economy, and there are multiplier effects that will absolutely fuel the economy and get us really cooking,” he told The Independent. \n\nBut there simply is not enough money in the budget resolution to include all of these promises without exploding the deficit. The House bill ostensibly allows for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts throughout the next decade, while requiring spending cuts across the various jurisidictions of $1.5 trillion. \n\nIn addition, Republicans included a provision which requires that if Republicans fail to find $2 trillion worth of savings, the amount of money for tax cuts reduces by the difference between $2 trillion and the final number of savings, giving them even less wiggle room for tax cuts. \n\nThe House tends to have far more fiscal hawks than the Senate, although it should go without saying that $4.5 trillion worth of tax cuts is far less than $2 trillion worth of savings and would bust the budget even more than Trump did in his first term.\n\nBut that being said, Republicans are keen to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. The Tax Policy Center estimated that extending those tax cuts alone would cost as much as $4 trillion. And the Committee for a Responsible Budget has estimated that extending those tax cuts along with Trump’s proposals on removing taxation on tips, Social Security and overtime as well as removing the SALT cap could cost anywhere from $5 trillion to $11.2 trillion. \n\nIn short, Republicans find themselves in a taxation pickle. \n\n“I don’t know yet,” Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told The Independent about how Republicans fit in all of Trump’s campaign promises. \n\nThis also presents a problem for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who took up the mantle from Mitch McConnell as the top Republican. Thune has to balance between Trump’s demands and what his senators want to include in the bill, which creates a conundrum.\n\n“We want to help the president deliver on his agenda, and we're looking at all of the proposals that are out there that were made by the president and some of our colleagues,” he told The Independent. “We have a lot of our colleagues who've made suggestions about provisions they'd like to have, tax policy that they’d like to have included in there, and, and they're all good ideas.”\n\nBut the math simply isn’t there to include everything. And the job of the majority leader – particularly in the more measured Senate compared to the chaotic House of Representatives – is to prioritize what goes into the bill and tell the president what is possible with only 53 votes in the Senate and an even slimmer majority in the House. \n\nAnd right now, Thune has to deal with two math problems: squeezing as many campaign promises into the tiny fiscal box drawn by the House and getting enough senators to say yes to the parameters.","summary":"ANALYSIS: Trump promised no taxes on tips, Social Security or overtime.

Three people were shot during Lil Baby’s video shoot, Fox 5 Atlanta reported, though all survived, but police said the incident sparked continuous violence between the two gangs. Fox 5 Atlanta, citing arrest warrants, reported two teenagers—13-year-olds Lamon Freeman and JaKody Davis—were shot and killed shortly after 12:30 a.m. on July 2 as a result of gang violence between the two gangs. The arrest warrants reportedly say Davis and his brother, who was shot in the foot, had left their apartment to wish Freeman, who had turned 13 years old minutes before, a happy birthday. At the conference, police announced the arrests of seven men they say were involved in the fatal shooting: Quiyontay Sanders, Richard Hollis, Reginald Thomas, Dekeitheon Mobley, Markus Crawford, Tradon Crawford and Ali Caldwell.\n\nWho Is Lil Baby?\n\nLil Baby, 30, is a rapper who broke through in the United States with his first album, “Harder Than Ever,” in 2018, supported by the top-10 single “Yes Indeed” with Drake. He had the best-selling album of 2020 in the United States, Billboard reported, with “My Turn,” which earned multiple Grammy nominations for the George Floyd-inspired protest song “The Bigger Picture.” He visited the White House on the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s killing in 2021, where he met with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The rapper won his first and only Grammy Award in 2022 for his song “Hurricane” with Kanye West and The Weeknd. He released his fourth album “WHAM” last month and is scheduled to launch a world tour in June.\n\nKey Background\n\nLil Baby was previously arrested on a cannabis possession charge in France in 2021, but was released the following morning and fined. He was arrested in 2024 in Las Vegas for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, but his charge was later dropped.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nArrest warrant confirms Atlanta rapper Lil Baby's connection to boys' murders (Fox 5 Atlanta)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Every politician, everybody, every human being tries to cover up age. We were always, from day one, cognizant that age was an issue,” he said.\n\n“There are some things that are true, I mean, like the gaslighting. There was a lot of denial of the polling. And I will use the term gaslighting because that’s what they were doing, the campaign, former colleagues. \n\n“The message to everybody was to make sure that you tell people it’s too early. It’s too early. These polls don’t mean anything. Well, it became too early. And these polls don’t mean anything for about a year and a half. The polls, the numbers – never moved.”\n\nLaRosa also admitted that the campaign denied “really insightful journalism” of outlets including the The New York Times, and they were “scared to death” of letting Biden do interviews with the media.\n\n“The president’s team was scared to death of impromptu, unscripted, unrehearsed, unpracticed, un-choreographed, anything, they couldn’t compete for the attention economy. They just couldn’t do it,” he said.\n\n“They didn’t have any idea, and they didn’t have the vessel either in Biden, by the way, who would have done anything. He loves TV. He loves doing stuff.

However, despite several criminal charges against him, Trump somehow managed to defeat Harris, and with the Supreme Court and a bunch of billionaires in his pocket, he came to power.\n\nSince he has been back, Trump has been entirely dedicated to destroying the DEI policies that were gradually getting their deserved attention. Teaming up with Elon Musk, the American President openly condemned those policies and signed executive orders asking to end the DEI programs at federal offices on his first day in office.\n\nHe gradually became more autocratic with these orders as federal employees were officially asked not to mention any kind of pronouns in their email signatures. Trump has also been pushing forward his agenda of the establishment of only two genders, which greatly affects the existence of trans people, who are already still fighting for their rights.\n\nBesides Trump, Musk’s becoming an integral part of the government has made things worse for the general American population. With a separate department for himself in the government, Musk aims to significantly reduce the workforce at various federal agencies, as he believes that those departments are only wasting taxpayers’ money.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nWhile things seem extremely bleak now, and resistance against Donald Trump is already rising in America, a history lesson from Germany might help the Americans keep their faith and put things into perspective. As with the rise of any fascist leader, things get very bad before eventually they get better, and a big reason behind that remains the collective courage of the people who decide not to put up with the injustice and persist even when every day seems to get even darker.\n\nHitler was at the peak of his dictatorship when his reign ended, and he committed suicide. For a man who orchestrated the Holocaust, the ending is not something that one would expect. But the German people protested, and that eventually ended the dark Nazi rule.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nSimilarly, the American population needs to remember that no matter how bad things seem now, they will get better if they hold on. The way the Trump administration has been handling the country’s economy, the anger of the general population has been rising. With prices of eggs and gas on a record high and Donald Trump spending most of his time out golfing, the resistance against the President has enough fuel to go on.\n\nMoreover, with Musk’s overt involvement in the government and his rampant firing of federal employees, things are getting even worse for the public. Trump publicly referred to Musk as President Musk, and there are rife speculations about Musk actually behind all the major decisions that come from the White House.\n\nIt now remains to be seen whether the American population can hold its own and emerge victorious against Donald Trump’s presidency that appears to turn more fascist with every passing day.","summary":"Americans protesting against Trump can take a lesson or two from people of Germany who protested against Hitler.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/the-anti-trump-resistance-needs-a-strategy-heres-what-they-can-learn-from-the-german-nazis","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Americans-have-been-protesting-against-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 15:15:06","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":295342230,"title":"Trump reveals whom Biden blamed for Dems’ 2024 election defeat — and it’s not Kamala Harris","text":"Former President Joe Biden told President Trump that he blamed fellow former President Barack Obama for the Democrats’ knockout loss in the 2024 election, the commander in chief revealed in a new interview.\n\nTrump told The Spectator World he had visited the White House to meet with an “angry” Biden shortly after he defeated Biden’s Vice President, Kamala Harris — who took Biden’s place on the Democratic ticket after he was forced out of running due to concerns over his age and abilities.\n\n“I asked him, I said, ‘so who do you blame?’ Because he was very angry, you know, he was a very angry guy, actually.

An innovation, also served as an Ambassador of Hungary to the United Kingdom between 2011 2014. At the event, he was going to be in conversation about innovation with Devika Chopra, Senior News Editor, NewsX.\nWhen asked what does a Minister of Innovation really do, Janos Csak replied, \"My ministry was called Culture and Innovation Ministry, but in fact I had many more functions. For example. Family policies belonged to the ministry. University systems, research institutions belong there. And even vocational training. And I tell you why. Because in Hungary, when we talk about culture, we are talking about our way of life. It's not just pictures on the wall or music or art, but culture is passed on to the next generation through the families. Obviously we have the schools, the churches, but predominantly it's the family. So the culture and the and the family should be hand-in-hand.\"\n'The government can provide money to support ideas'\nWhen asked what sort of innovation is being looked at when we talk about a ministry of innovation, to which Janos Csak replied, \"The government can provide money to support ideas, infrastructure or regulation and devise governments, in my opinion, build on the strengths, the existing strengths, what a country has last year, when I was still a minister, Hungary won two Nobel Prizes. Qatar in Korea for the many and sent in scrolls for capturing and picturing the subatomic particles. Well, they've been working on their field for 40 years or so, but it was my time and they got the Nobel Prize, so I take the credit for that.\"\nHe added, \"But anyway, so it means that the health sciences and life sciences and and, physics, chemistry is somehow developed in Hungary in a very strong way. So when first we started to think about how to improve our ecosystem in innovation, we said that we select three focus areas. One is digital transformation. And it starts with Hungary's full of, very smart mathematicians, starts with deep mathematics, which is the heart of AI, quantum, you name it.\"\n#NXTinInnovation | Mr. Janos Csak, Former Hungarian Minister, is sharing his expertise on 'NXT in Innovation' at NXT Conclave 2025.

The research ecosystem is important, but we did that all government money, any penny that is spent on innovation will be spent on, projects that clearly demonstrated that there is a cooperation, an association between the corporate sector, research institutes and universities, because the university students should see corporate guys walking on the, on the, corridors and, and researchers, MIT in Boston was was made based on that idea.\nHe added, \"So this focusing on on fields focusing the money to follow the the policies and I would say, over the years and obviously my predecessors, this is a new ministry, but there was ministry for innovation, the number of patents, publications, grew significantly. So that is a response. We are far away. Just to give you some European numbers.\"\nJanos Csak: 'US is clearly a leader in innovation and research'\nThe former Hungarian Minister at the event said, \"Rather than answering how we do it, this morning we heard the former Canadian prime minister and he talked about China's, rise both in manufacturing and in research and innovation. The two goes hand-in-hand. If you look at, President Trump's speeches. But he says that in in the US, they have to somehow reestablish the American manufacturing base.\"\nHe stated, \"I have my doubts because the skilled work workers are not there, and there are many questions around that. But the US clearly is a leader in innovation and research. But if you don't have, then the application, the manufacturing that that you you won't have a balance. Now in Hungary, we woke up, I would say 15, 20 years ago, and we said that, okay, it's not fancy to have factories and these are very modern factories by the way.\"\nMr Csak also shared, \"It's not fancy, but if you want to support the research and create room for the research, we need, manufacturing. And we started inviting manufacturing. Corporations, they not only, I would say 3 or 4 countries in Europe where the manufacturing as a percentage of the GDP is above 20%. Well, 30 years ago, even in the UK, it was 20 plus percent. Today in the UK it's 7 or 8%. So then you are very much reliant on imports. And think about the, pandemic or any disruption in the in the global value chains. You you are in trouble. So you have to have both sides and, I think each country has this potential. I would say the most important is that the politicians create this manufacturing base in parallel.\"\nJanos Csak says, 'India is in the best position'\nWhen asked, \"What role do you think India would perhaps play as far as innovation is concerned in the coming decade, in your experience or in your understanding of where India stands today?\"\nTo this, Janos Csak stated, \"I think the most important thing is association corporations, research institutes, universities and governments. But now, thanks God, we are not living in a world but where each country is a closed, entity. India is in the best position because you have many people who studied in the UK, Europe. We have many Indian students in Hungary. Us so I think India is uniquely positioned to, to be a, a center of global cooperation. In Singapore, for example, the National University of Singapore, 15 years ago or so, established a new institute called create and that that was an institute which the role was the role is to invite, world class universities to Singapore to work together with Singaporean researchers.\"\nHe continued, \"So Stanford and, Munich Technical Technology University and others are there. And and that's where you can play your role. I visited Bangalore, the Technical University and the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies. You have huge potential and and you have the people who understand the world. Now, the question is whether you can bring projects here, and you can bring people to live here to see for themselves.\n'These tariffs should be somehow settled'\nJanos Csak also spoke about Trump's tariffs saying, \"I think all these tariffs and other things should be somehow settled. I would say by the mid, summer in the US because the tariffs, will hurt American customers, inflation, we will increase. And one of the key reasons why Biden or Kamala Harris lost was the last four years inflation for the for the customers. So therefore some signs of of results should be seen. And next year, the 250th anniversary and the midterm elections. So the the the period is pretty short. And the, you know, credibility is. Hard won. But very easy to lose.
