{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":442,"news":[{"id":292706986,"title":"Paramount Is Starting to Fight Back Against Trump in ’60 Minutes’ Lawsuit","text":"In January, reports that Paramount Global was mulling whether to settle a longshot lawsuit filed by President Trump against its CBS News unit sparked a frenzy over the appearance that the company was capitulating to the administration as it sought regulatory approval for its merger with Skydance Media.\n\n A month later, that settlement hasn’t materialized, with Paramount now signaling that it’s prepared to go on the offensive. Its multipronged legal strategy revolves around arguments that Trump is judge-shopping, choosing to file the lawsuit at a court where a sympathetic judge is likely to oversee the case, and the possibility that those suing the company agreed to arbitration clauses when they used services hosted by the entertainment conglomerate. It’s also leveraging the threat of uncovering information about Trump’s financials, including with respect to his social media company Truth Social and the cryptocurrency he launched, in discovery.\n\n The legal battle has emerged as the most visible example of media’s incentives to stay out of Trump’s crosshairs by settling what many believe to be a frivolous lawsuit. At best, the deal could be understood by the public as admitting fault in its editing of the interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris or, at worst, a bribe.\n\n CBS News isn’t the only outlet that Trump has targeted. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, ABC News agreed to contribute $15 million to his presidential foundation or museum to settle a defamation lawsuit over George Stephanopoulos’ coverage saying he was found “liable for rape” when he was actually found liable for sexual abuse. Since then, Meta and X have also struck deals to resolve lawsuits over their suspension of his social media accounts.\n\n Trump and Paramount have clashing views of the case. In the president’s telling, CBS News aired a “heavily tampered interview” intended to help Harris by editing certain answers in a way that misled consumers. This manipulation of the interview, he’s said, constitutes a violation of Texas’ consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising and the unfair competition prong of the Lanham Act.\n\n As a news organization, CBS has maintained that its editorial judgments are constitutionally protected free speech.\n\n The next major decision in the case will likely be whether the lawsuit should be dismissed and transferred to New York federal court. Earlier this month, Trump revised the complaint to add Republican U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, his former doctor who lives in Texas, to keep the case in federal court in the Northern District of Texas, which has become a hotspot for lawsuits advancing conservative legal causes. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who’s overseeing the litigation and is the only judge in the Amarillo division of the court, was nominated to his position by Trump in 2017 and has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2012. In his five years on the bench, he’s issued rulings against several initiatives implemented by former President Biden, some of which were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n “Representative Jackson is not only a citizen of Texas, but is the Congressman for the 13th Congressional District, which embraces much of the Northern District of Texas and is situated entirely within this judicial District,” wrote Edward Paltzik, a lawyer for Trump, in the filing. “President Trump’s media holdings also derive a substantial amount of their profit from Texas. There is a clear affiliation between Texas and the underlying controversy, as Defendants targeted their deceptive services toward the State and this District as among the leading media markets and population bases in America.”\n\n CBS, which is incorporated in New York, argued in a Tuesday filing that the lawsuit doesn’t belong in Texas because the 60 Minutes segment didn’t target Texans more than residents of other states. It pointed to case law clarifying that it would unfairly burden media outlets whose content is available nationally to be sued in Texas federal court just because it has a large population. Added C. Jason Fenton, a lawyer for Paramount, in the filing, “Venue is improper in this District because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim did not occur in the Northern District of Texas; the interview with Vice President Harris was filmed and edited entirely outside Texas, and Plaintiffs do not even allege that they watched the interview in Texas.”\n\n Paramount has also signaled that it’ll seek to move the case to arbitration depending on what’s revealed in discovery. It said it’ll pursue information over whether Trump and has “purchased goods or services” and whether Jackson “agreed to arbitrate claims relating to CBS’ services.”\n\n This could relate to arbitration clauses users must sign to make an account on Paramount+ or CBS.com. “If you or we have any dispute with or claims against the other arising out of or relating in any way to the services or these terms … you and we each agree to resolve such disputes through an individual binding arbitration or an individual action in small claims court,” states the streaming platform’s terms of use, which says that the scope and enforceability of the agreement must be decided by an arbitrator.\n\n Whether Trump’s claims could be subject to arbitration is unknown. Last year, Disney moved to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit from a doctor who experienced a fatal allergic reaction to food she at a restaurant located within a shopping center owned by Disney by pointing to terms of service her husband agreed to when signing up for Disney+. The court could decide that Trump’s consumer fraud and unfair competition claims are too far removed from the scope of any arbitration clauses he may have signed when purchasing services from Paramount.\n\n Also included in the company’s discovery request is information regarding the financial of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign organizations and Trump Media & Technology Group, as well as the president’s legal relationship, if any, with those two groups. Some of the documents Paramount seeks may be subject to executive privilege.\n\n A jury trial is scheduled to begin in 2026.\n\n Earlier this month, CBS publicly released the full transcripts and videos of the 60 Minutes interview. It said in a statement at the time that the records show that the broadcast “was not doctored or deceitful.” It added, “In reporting the news, journalists regularly edit interviews – for time, space or clarity. In making these edits, 60 Minutes is always guided by the truth and what we believe will be most informative to the viewing public – all while working within the constraints of broadcast television.”","summary":"The CBS News owner's legal strategy has revolved around arguments challenging the President's insistence that it should stay in federal court in Texas, in addition to raising the specter of discovery and arbitration.

Tim Scott (R-SC), Rep. John James (R-MI), U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas nominee Herschel Walker, and Alice Johnson, whom he pardoned in 2020 after calls from reality TV star and prison reform advocate Kim Kardashian.\n\nIn addition to a National Garden of American Heroes, Trump announced Johnson would be his “pardon czar,” promising to consider her recommendations.\n\n“I’m really proud to say that we now have more black Republicans serving in the U.S. House than at any time since 1870,” he added. “That’s a long time.”\n\nOther guests included former ESPN host Sage Steele, former NFL player Jack Brewer, and rap stars Kodak Black, Lil Boosie, and Rod Wave. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was booed when Trump asked him to make some remarks after his work producing the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nAlthough he did not win the demographic, Trump’s black support was pivotal to his undermining of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her 2024 counterpart, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“We received — listen to this — more votes from black Americans than any Republican president ever,” Trump said. “One of the big reasons I’m president today is because of the black vote, and I always appreciate it.”\n\nTrump increased his black support from 8% in 2016 and 2020 to 13% last year, according to CNN exit polls. The same trend was evident among Latino voters, from 28% in 2016 and 32% in 2020 to 45% four years later.\n\n“Should I run again, you tell me?” Trump said to chants of “Four more years.” “There’s your controversy right there.”\n\nTrump issued a proclamation to mark Black History Month on the last day of last month, despite signing his “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing” executive order a week earlier.\n\n“This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age, I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my Administration,” Trump wrote in the proclamation.\n\nThe proclamation also encouraged “public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.”\n\nThe proclamation appeared to conflict with the executive order, which directed the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, with help from the attorney general and director of the Office of Personnel Management, to end all so-called “discriminatory” federal programs.\n\nA day after Trump signed the order, the OPM circulated a memorandum among department and agency heads that instructed them to end their DEI programs and place their DEI staff on paid administrative leave by 5 p.m. the following day.\n\n“These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination,” the memo reads.\n\nOPM officials additionally told the heads to tell employees to report “if they know of any efforts to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language.”\n\nA week later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued guidance to his workforce under the heading “Identity Months Dead at DoD.”\n\nIn his memo, Hegseth underscored how “unity and purpose” are “instrumental” to the Pentagon meeting its warfighting mission.\n\n“Going forward, DoD Components and Military Departments will not use official resources, to include man-hours, to host celebrations or events related to cultural awareness months,” Hegseth wrote.\n\nThe former Fox News TV host specifically named Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Pride Month, and National Hispanic Heritage Month as examples.\n\nPrivate companies, executives of which are seeking to improve their relationships with the new administration, have adopted similar policies, including Google, which removed Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and Pride Month from its calendar.","summary":"President Donald Trump commemorated Black History Month at the White House alongside golfer Tiger Woods weeks after signing an executive order ending diversity programs and the Defense Department declaring that “identity months&#8221; are &#8220;dead.” &#8220;Today we pay tribute to the generations of black legends, champions, and warriors that made sure to help drive our country [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3324922/trump-celebrates-black-history-month-tiger-woods-dei-order/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tiger-Woods-Trump.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 22:32:55","author":"Naomi Lim","authors":["Naomi Lim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.084},{"id":292683240,"title":"Trump brings out 'incredible' Tiger Woods at White House Black History Month celebration","text":"Trump brings out 'incredible' Tiger Woods at White House Black History Month celebration\n\n'Is there anybody like our Tiger,' Trump gushed \n\nPODCAST: Trump and Musk’s bromance and JD Vance’s strong words for Zelensky – on Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy EMILY GOODIN, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT\n\nPublished: 22:12 GMT, 20 February 2025 | Updated: 22:23 GMT, 20 February 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump brought out golfer Tiger Woods to surprise the crowd at a White House Black History month celebration.\n\nThe standing-room only crowd in the East Room screamed with delight, yelling 'Trump' and 'Tiger' repeatedly, going on for so long Trump had to wait for the uproar to die down before he could start his speech.\n\nWoods stood proudly close to him, wearing the Presidential Medal of Freedom that Trump awarded him in his first term along with his suit and sneakers. \n\n'Is there anybody like our Tiger,' Trump gushed, describing the golfer as 'incredible.'\n\nWoods was just as effusive.\n\n'It's an honor to be here.

NASA is working with Musk's SpaceX to try and safely return the astronauts from the International Space Station.Efforts to get the astronauts back on Earth, including proposals to use a SpaceX flight, were in play before Trump was sworn into office.The return journey of Williams and Wilmore was first reported in August 2024, several months before Trump's election victory. Steve Stich, the manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, told NPR that the astronauts were scheduled for a SpaceX flight home, describing it as \"the easiest and the best option.\"Under the Biden administration, NASA outlined plans to bring them home in December 2024, proposing the use of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, which Trump and Musk would later say they would use.Did Trump Save Nearly $2 Billion on Air Force One?Trump said: \"I negotiated the price. It was $5.7 billion, and I got it—I got them down $1.7 billion. Now they're not building the plane fast enough.\"In 2018, officials said that Trump had saved more than $1.4 billion on the cost of two next-generation Air Force One planes, on a fixed-cost contract with Boeing of $3.9 billion.Trump has at various times said that he managed to save $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and now $1.7 billion on the project.Those numbers do not line up with reported costs for the project.In one 2018 Newsweek article, \"Donald Trump's Air Force One Savings Just Don't Add Up\", Newsweek reported that it could not find how the project would have cost $5.4 billion at the outset (based on Trump saying that he saved $1.5 billion), other than erroneously combining project costs by folding in research spending already included within other spending estimates. Newsweek has contacted a White House representative for comment.The figures Trump gave in the Hannity interview are above the cost base and reported savings his officials said his negotiations achieved.The project has reportedly cost Boeing more than the contract to deliver the aircraft, with CNBC reporting that in 2022, Boeing was paid around $4 billion for the work and had lost $1.1 billion in costs related to the deal.A report by the aviation industry magazine Simple Flying wrote that inflationary costs since its announcement would have increased the project price from $3.9 billion to $4.87 billion.Did CBS Change Kamala Harris' Interview Answer?Referring to a Kamala Harris CBS interview in October 2024, Trump said: \"I mean, CBS now—they changed an answer in Kamala. They asked her some questions. She answered them like, you know, a low-IQ person. The opposite of him—the absolute opposite. But she gave a horrible answer. They took the entire answer out, and they put another answer that she gave 20 minutes later into the—in—as the answer.\"This claim is not true.As reported by PolitiFact, CBS released a clip with a shortened answer to a question about U.S.-Israel diplomacy and relations but, as the full transcript showed, this was not an answer to another question. It was a shortened version of a longer answer. Trump's implication that CBS favorably edited that footage for Harris is not true.Was $7 Million Spent on a 'Transgender' Opera?Discussing spending, Trump said there had been a \"lot of fraud\" in government spending, saying that former administrations had been sending money \"for transgender—something having to do with the opera, and they're sending out $7 million.\"Musk laughed at the comment and replied, \"Literally.\"The figure here could be a mix-up of the multitude of comments made about government spending recently, but the U.S. did not spend $7 million on a \"transgender\" opera.In 2022, the U.S. State Department committed $25,000 to a Colombian university \"to raise awareness and increase the transgender representation\" with an opera performance. Although not mentioned here, erroneous claims about this spending have been falsely attached to USAID by members of the Trump administration.Later in the Hannity interview, Trump mentioned the government had spent $4 million \"to assess the dialogue of an audience coming out of a theater.\"Newsweek did not find what $4 million in government spending went to audience dialogue analysis and has asked the White House for comment to clarify.Did Reuters Get $10 Million for a 'Mass Disinformation Campaign'At one point during the interview, as Trump complained about the media, Musk interjected with an inaccurate statement about the news agency Reuters, telling Hannity: \"Well Reuters—this is actually really wild: Reuters got something like $10 million for something that was literally titled 'mass disinformation campaign.' \"This is not true. The claim has been pushed by Musk and Trump over the past week, based on a gross misreading of publicly available government spending data.Trump's characterization is without evidence. Thomson Reuters said last week it was \"inaccurately represented\" by comments that the company played a role in \"large scale social deception.\"Reuters reported that in 2018, under Trump's first term, the U.S. Department of Defense and a division of content and technology company Thomson Reuters Special Services (TRSS) was given a four-year, $9 million award, intended to protect the U.S. government from social engineering, a cybersecurity threat where people are tricked into handing over sensitive data.As stated by Thomson Reuters, TRSS is a separate legal entity with its own board of directors.\"TRSS has provided software and information services to U.S. government agencies across successive administrations for decades, to assist in identifying and preventing fraud, supporting public safety, and advancing justice,\" Steve Rubley, CEO of Thomson Reuters Special Services, said in a statement.Does the US Spend the Most Per Pupil Globally?Hannity later asked about Trump's plans for the Department of Education, an agency the president has said he could close down.In his answer, Trump compared the cost of education per pupil in the U.S. with other nations.Trump said: \"I'll tell you what we're number one in: cost per pupil. We spend more money than any other country by far—it's not even close—per pupil. OK?

You lookin' at De Niro? Eh? The world's most famous method actor is starring in his first major television show - with more than a hint of his Taxi Driver character.\n\nPlaying former U.S. President George Mullen, summoned to quell national hysteria after a cyber attack in Zero Day, he faces down a restless mob on a New York street with his trademark cry of 'Eh, eh, eh!'\n\nThat mannerism will always be associated with Travis Bickle, the paranoid Vietnam vet in Martin Scorcese's 1976 movie. Unlike Travis, a man who could pick a fight with himself in a mirror, Mullen is a charismatic, kindly figure.\n\nBut there's one dark parallel between the two characters, 50 years apart. Like Travis, George fears he is losing his mind.\n\nHis handwritten diaries have descended into gibberish. He doesn't recognise members of his staff. And he sees faces in the crowd who can't possibly be there.\n\nIt's a subtle portrait of encroaching dementia, with the added twist that he might not be senile at all. Is his wife (Joan Allen) part of a plot to convince him he is no longer mentally stable?\n\nThough he has undermined his own reputation with poor performances in payday roles over the years, De Niro at his best is without rival. He famously immerses himself in his portrayals - before Taxi Driver, he qualified for a cabbie's licence and worked 12-hour shifts around Manhattan. \n\nHe's utterly convincing in Zero Day, simultaneously the statesman ready to sacrifice himself for one last service to his country, and a pill-popping septuagenarian who can't remember when he last filled the bird-feeder.\n\nThe disappointment is that the series doesn't always match the standards De Niro sets. It's a conspiracy-by-numbers thriller that sometimes dips into cliche.\n\nNot only is the concept unoriginal, this isn't even the first time this year we've seen a former U.S. President trapped in a retirement where nothing is what it seems - James Marsden plays a similar part in Paradise on Disney+.\n\nAnd Zero Day blunders into the same mistake that wrecked the Claire Danes thriller Homeland: filming the year before a U.S. election, the producers (De Niro among them) assumed that the next President would be a woman.\n\nOn Homeland, Elizabeth Marvel played the Hillary Clinton-type role. In Zero Day, Angela Bassett is clearly meant to be a counterpart to Kamala Harris. Both women, of course, were beaten to the White House by Donald Trump.\n\nWorst of all is the atmospheric music, a cacophony of booming timpani and brassy crescendos that sound like rejected outtakes from Kevin Spacey's presidential drama House Of Cards.\n\nBut this six-part series is well-paced, delivering a welter of surprises that help to rush us past holes in the plot.\n\nAnd it raises a genuinely scary spectre of the West after foreign hackers paralyse every computer. 'Warlords and heads on sticks within 28 days,' warns the CIA boss. Yikes.","summary":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: De Niro is utterly convincing in Zero Day, the statesman ready to sacrifice himself for one last service to his country, and a pill-popping septuagenarian.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tv/article-14418923/christopher-stevens-Zero-Day-Robert-Niro.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/20/20/95422859-0-image-m-40_1740081771504.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 22:05:10","author":"Christopher Stevens,Editor","authors":["Christopher Stevens","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.089},{"id":292679326,"title":"CBS Top Executive Faces Job Loss for Opposing Billionaire Owner","text":"CBS News chief Wendy McMahon is likely set to lose her job as head of the news division, insiders have claimed.\n\nThe news, first reported by Puck, comes ahead of a planned $8billion merger between CBS’s parent Paramount and Larry Ellison-backed Skydance.\n\nShari Redstone, the daughter of media mogul Sumner Redstone, is the architect of the deal, and chairwoman of Paramount Global.\n\nThe 70-year-old is said to be looking to settle a suit filed against Paramount by President Donald Trump, to help the media giant avoid any FCC issues. \n\nThe deal, set to see Redstone reportedly walk away with healthy $1.75billion, is tentatively set to close by September.\n\nMcMahon, 50, angered both current and future leadership by advocating against Redstone’s plans to settle, sources said Thursday – after the lieutenant McMahon had installed to serve under her this past August announced she was leaving the network.\n\nThe network’s president of editorial and news gathering, Adrienne Roark ‘was essentially Wendy’s right hand,’ a source already told DailyMail.com, while indicating the former was forced out after McMahon caught her looking for a job.\n\nThe insider added how neither woman ‘[had] the editorial experience of leading a national news organizations’ – and sources close to the new leadership group at Skydance told Puck how McMahon will ‘almost certainly’ lose her job as a result.\n\nMcMahon’s decision to give Roark, more of a ‘local’ journalist, oversight of the newsroom also saw her come under scrutiny, a source familiar with the matter told DailyMail.com – while several controversies sullied her tenure as well.\n\nA controversial 60 Minutes segment surrounding Gaza that aired last month spawned outrage, after it described Hamas fighters as ‘militants’ and suggested that Israel should seek peace. \n\nThe yet-to-be solidified settlement with Trump over a supposedly bias 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris has also loomed large, as has the recent, ‘confusing’ overhaul of longtime fixture Evening News.\n\nA source told DailyMail.com the new magazine style, which doubled the desk’s trademark one anchor to two, is a ‘failed experiment already’.\n\n‘It’s being critically panned, ratings are down week by week and from this time last tear,’ the insider said.\n\nWhile part of McMahon’s ‘vision’ for the company, longtime 60 Minutes boss Bill Owens has been behind the less headline-driven approach to the program started just weeks ago, after tasked with oversight of Evening News last summer.\n\nSources told DailyMail.com the legendary exec has since been ‘overstretched’ – while also ‘feeling pressure in the fight with the Trump lawsuit.’ Insiders called Owens the network’s ‘true editorial lead’ in comments to Puck.\n\nThe situation – and other scandals like a fiery interview with pro-Palestinian writer Ta-Nehsi Coates that aired on CBS Mornings in October – has ‘frustrated’ execs at Skydance, and perhaps even Redstone as well.\n\n‘I think we made a mistake,’ the heiress who has a majority stake in the company said at an event the following day in New York City.\n\nShe had been referring to how Roark and others reprimanded Mornings’ Tony Dokoupil after his interview, after the former insisted the sit-down ‘did not meet’ CBS’s ‘editorial standards.’ \n\n‘I think we made a bad mistake this week,’ Redstone said.\n\nSources told Puck how the senior – who is set to walk away from the media company following the merger – has been ‘discontent with all of it’.\n\nRoark’s abrupt departure, seemingly at McMahon’s behest, serves as yet another balck mark on the latter’s record, as ratings continue to wane by the week.\n\nMeanwhile, McMahon, reportedly perturbed by Redstone’s willingness to settle Trump’s lawsuit, is joined by her boss in CBS CEO George Cheeks, also co-CEO of Paramount Global.\n\nSources told Puck that Cheeks – historically an advocate for McMahon – has also agreed to stay on at the company, but is not willing to ‘fight’ for his deputy when it comes to firing talks.\n\nInsiders further pointed out how Cheeks asked McMahon ahead of the 60 Minutes Gaza segment whether she thought it would spawn any outrage.\n\nShe told him that she did not, sources told Puck. Almost immediately after, both the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee bashed the network.\n\nIf it comes to fruition, McMahon’s departure would be the latest in a series of high-profile network for the network in recent years. \n\nThe woman who Roark replaced, Ingrid Ciprián-Matthews, meanwhile, abruptly stepped down in August – a move that itself raised eyebrows due to it coming in the midst of an election.\n\nMoreover, the move was made a month after Skydance said it had identified at least $2billion worth of waste to be cut ahead of a prospective merger, seemingly putting the 30 year vet who started at the network in 1993 on the chopping block.\n\nShe was investigated in 2021 over favoritism and discriminatory hiring and management practices, three years after becoming CBS’s executive vice president of strategic professional development.\n\nMcMahon as named CBS’s chief executive in August 2023.

And we proudly celebrate Black History Month,\" Trump said.The president went on and added: “Today, we pay tribute to the generations of Black legends, champions, warriors and patriots who helped drive our country forward to greatness. And you really are great, great people.”RELATED STORY | What federal changes to DEI policies could mean for businessesJoining Trump were Black political figures and activists who have been his vocal supporters. Invited guests, according to a White House official, included Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina; Republican Rep. John James of Michigan; Alveda King, a niece of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.; Herschel Walker, the football legend who is Trump’s choice as U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas; and prison reform advocate Alice Johnson, whom he pardoned in 2020.Johnson had spent more than two decades serving life without parole for a nonviolent drug offense before Trump granted her clemency.On Thursday, Trump called her out by name in his remarks and said he’s going to bring her into his administration.“She’s going to be my pardon czar,” he said.It’s not clear what the role would entail.Other invited guests included figures from sports and entertainment, including former ESPN host Sage Steele; former NFL player Jack Brewer; and rap stars Kodak Black, Lil Boosie and Rod Wave, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.In the wake of his executive order, the Defense Department issued guidance declaring “identity months dead” and said that working hours would no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months such as Black History Month, Women’s History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month.That seemed to clash with a National Black History Month proclamation signed the same day by Trump, which called for “public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.”While the White House has issued its position, agencies of the government have discretion on whether to continue to recognize Black History Month, according to the official.RELATED STORY | Presidential Shift: Trump reverses key Biden administration DEI policiesOn Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that his department “will no longer participate in celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances.” And in a diplomatic cable, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agency’s removal of DEI policies would dovetail with “eliminating our focus on political and cultural causes that are divisive at home and deeply unpopular abroad.”The administration has issued a deadline to schools and universities to eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal money. Major corporations have backtracked on DEI policies in hiring, promotion and workplace culture in recent months, with many citing potential legal challenges from the administration.Black History Month has been recognized by every U.S. president since 1976, including Trump during his first term.“Black History is American history. And similar to the story of our nation, it is a story of strength, resilience, and dogged perseverance,” said CJ Pearson, a national co-chair of the Republican National Committee's youth advisory council. Pearson, who is Black, has been an outspoken defender of Trump against Black civic leaders, civil rights advocates and Democrats who lambast the president as racist.“President Trump’s anti-DEI policies aren’t promoting racism but what they are doing is manifesting the dream of the great Martin Luther King, Jr.: a nation where one isn’t judged by the color of their skin but instead by the content of their character,” said Pearson, who will attend the White House event.Other Black Republicans aren't so sanguine about the administration's current course or what it portends for the GOP's nascent inroads with Black voters or other communities of color.“Trump can build upon the coalition he pulled together in November with Blacks and Asians and Hispanics and young folks,” said Raynard Jackson, a Republican strategist. “But if they leave it the way it stands right now, Trump is going to destroy the very coalition he so marvelously brought to the table in November.”To Jackson, DEI is a catch-all for liberal policies that are “unrecognizable” from the original intent of civil rights laws meant to promote the social and economic progress of Black Americans. But in removing and denigrating the policies, Jackson said, the White House risked being labeled as discriminatory by offering no alternative framework for how disadvantaged communities can get ahead.“How do you have diversity without it being a mandated bean-counting situation?” Jackson asked. \"They’ve done a masterful job at telling me what they’re against. I’m waiting to hear what they’re for.”During the 2024 campaign, Trump tried to reach Black voters through in-person events in Atlanta, Chicago and New York. His campaign courted Black celebrities and media personalities to boost his message. Trump's Black conservative allies, including Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., conducted roundtables at Black barbershops and bus tours through majority-Black cities.But Trump also frequently denigrated Black communities in his pitch and made claims that pitted voters of color against immigrants, who he said were taking “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs.”The efforts to boost support among Black voters seemed to have some success. He won a larger share of Black voters than he did in 2020, particularly among young Black men, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.Overall, about 16% of Black voters supported Trump in November, while about 8 in 10 voted for Democrat Kamala Harris. But that represented an improvement for Trump from 2020, when only 8% of Black voters backed him and about 9 in 10 went for Democrat Joe Biden.","summary":"President Donald Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House at the same time his administration is rolling back DEI initiatives.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/president-trumps-first-100-days/trump-hosts-black-history-month-celebration-amid-dei-rollbacks","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de1740a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1700x893+0+46/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2F5e%2F1219c4a149c5946913c319b4a0a1%2Fscreenshot-2025-02-20-at-2-40","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 21:58:51","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.034},{"id":292679058,"title":"US Senate confirms Kash Patel for a 10-year term to lead the FBI","text":"The United States Senate has voted to confirm former federal prosecutor Kash Patel as the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), continuing a streak of success for President Donald Trump’s government nominees.\n\nBut Thursday’s confirmation came by slim margins. Only 51 senators, all Republican, voted in favour of Patel in the 100-seat Senate.\n\nThere were two notable defections from the Republican Party: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. They joined 47 Democrats in opposing what critics have called a dangerous nomination to lead the FBI.\n\n“ Mr Patel’s record demonstrates that he’s dangerous, inexperienced and dishonest,” Democratic Senator Dirk Durbin of Illinois said. “He should not and cannot serve as an effective FBI director.”\n\nFor his part, in a social media post, Patel thanked Trump and said he was honoured to be confirmed.\n\n“The politicalization of our justice system has eroded public trust — but that ends today,” Patel wrote. “My mission as Director is clear: let good cops be cops — and rebuild trust in the FBI.”\n\nBut in the lead-up to the vote, a parade of Democratic lawmakers, including Durbin, took the Senate floor to warn against confirming Patel, saying he would indeed politicise the FBI.\n\nThey raised questions about his ability to lead the FBI fairly, given past statements that suggested he might use the bureau’s resources to go after Trump’s political rivals and journalists.\n\n“ It is shocking that my Republican colleagues are willing to support him despite the serious threat he poses to our national security,” Durbin said.\n\n“I’m sorry to say, I believe they will quickly come to regret this vote. When I think of giving this man a 10-year tenure as director of the leading criminal investigative agency in the world, I cannot imagine a worse choice.”\n\nA narrow confirmation\n\nThose concerns were reflected in the historically tight margins through which Patel’s confirmation passed. His predecessors at the FBI were approved with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.\n\nFormer FBI director Christopher Wray won confirmation in 2017 with 92 votes. Before him, in 2013, James Comey notched 93 votes in support. And for Robert Mueller in 2001, the vote was unanimous, 98 to zero.\n\nStill, with a solid 53-member Republican majority in the Senate, none of President Trump’s nominees are expected to fall short in a confirmation vote.\n\nEven Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — who has broken ranks with his fellow Republicans over the confirmations of Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F Kennedy Jr — threw his support behind Patel on Thursday.\n\nBut in separate statements, Collins and Murkowski explained they could not vote for Patel for fear he might use the FBI for political gain.\n\n“My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership,” Murkowski wrote. “The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores.”\n\nCollins echoed that sentiment, saying Patel’s “aggressive political activity” cast doubt on his ability to lead a nonpartisan bureau.\n\n“Mr. Patel’s recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI,” Collins explained in her statement.\n\nThis is not the first time that Patel has fractured Republicans under Trump’s leadership.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021, Patel served in a variety of roles, including in the National Security Council and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nBut news reports emerged that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Gina Haspel threatened to resign over the prospect of Trump naming Patel as her deputy.\n\nIn a memoir, Bill Barr, who served as attorney general during Trump’s first term, also recalled shooting down a proposal to make Patel the deputy director of the FBI, saying it would be “over my dead body”.\n\nFacing Senate criticism\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings in January, Patel defended himself against allegations that he would leverage the FBI to do Trump’s bidding. He also denied that he would do anything unlawful if confirmed as FBI director.\n\n“I have no interest, no desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards. There will be no politicisation of the FBI,” Patel told Democratic senators as he faced heated questioning.\n\nPatel also sketched out his plans to increase the FBI’s law enforcement capabilities, including through the distribution of greater resources across the 50 states.\n\n“A third of the workforce for the FBI works in Washington, DC,” Patel replied. “I am fully committed to having that workforce go out into the interior of the country where I live, west of the Mississippi, and work with sheriff’s departments and local officers.”\n\nThe son of Indian immigrants who moved from Uganda to Canada and later the US, Patel denounced the attacks on his character as “false accusations and grotesque mischaracterisations”.\n\nBut he has been repeatedly confronted with his own words, from multiple appearances on podcasts and books he has written.\n\nPatel, for instance, has spread the conspiracy theory that the FBI planned the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a “false flag” operation to corner Trump supporters.\n\nIn a September interview on The Shawn Ryan Show, Patel also threatened to “shut down” the FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, and turn it into a “museum for the deep state”.\n\nAnd speaking to Trump ally Steve Bannon in 2023, Patel pledged to go after the president’s political rivals, which he described as “criminals” and “conspirators”. He also repeated false claims that Trump’s election defeat in 2020 against Joe Biden was fraudulent.\n\n“We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media,” Patel said. “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.”\n\nPatel has even penned a children’s book, The Plot Against the King, that depicted Trump as a monarch besieged by antagonists styled after Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, his Democratic rivals in the 2016 and 2024 presidential races, respectively.\n\nAnd Democrats have slammed him for his association with the “J6 choir”, made up of defendants who were arrested after the 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nDemocrats urge a ‘no’ vote\n\nIn the minutes before the Senate voted to confirm Patel, Democratic Senator Alex Padilla of California characterised Patel as using Trump as his “cash cow” — a tool to book media appearances and publishing deals.\n\nPadilla also questioned whether Patel had the law enforcement or intelligence experience to qualify for the job as FBI director.\n\n“Kash Patel has demonstrated a dangerous lack of judgement, lack of preparation and lack of independence,” Padilla said. “He’s shown that he’s either unwilling or unable of putting politics aside in order to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution, should he be confirmed to lead the FBI.”\n\nSenator Adam Schiff, another California Democrat, echoed his colleague. He expressed concern that the FBI would be gutted under Patel’s leadership, as part of Trump’s slashes to the federal workforce.\n\n“ In a democracy, law enforcement does not serve the president, let alone someone who fashions himself as a king. Law enforcement serves the people,” Schiff said.\n\n“ I’m of the opinion that the people the FBI should be going on manhunts for are actual criminals, not the president’s enemies of the day. The FBI shouldn’t serve as Donald Trump’s army.”","summary":"Two Republicans voted against Patel, citing questions about how his &#039;political activities&#039; may affect his leadership.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/us-senate-confirms-kash-patel-for-a-10-year-term-to-lead-the-fbi?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25044590340058-1740078668.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 21:18:50","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":292677472,"title":"Who is and who isn’t running to replace McConnell in the Senate?","text":"Now, with McConnell announcing his retirement on Thursday, some have already announced their candidacies to replace the seven-term senator. \n\nMCCONNELL ANNOUNCES SENATE RETIREMENT, ENDING DECADESLONG CAREER\n\n“Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,” McConnell said in his remarks announcing his retirement. “Every day in between, I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business right here.

Andy Barr (R-KY) said he is “considering running for Senate because Kentucky deserves a Senator who will fight for President Trump and the America First Agenda.”\n\n“I’ve done that every day in the House and would do so in the Senate,” Barr said. “I’m encouraged by the outpouring of support and my family and I will be making a decision about our future soon.”\n\nHe had previously described McConnell as a mentor but did not mention him in the statement.\n\nBusinessman Nate Morris \n\nKentucky businessman Nate Morris has indicated he will run for either McConnell’s Senate seat or governor of Kentucky in 2027. Following McConnell’s announcement, he released a statement saying he was “seriously considering” a run while also taking time to diss McConnell.\n\n“Mitch McConnell stuck his thumb in the eye of President Trump with the votes against his nominees, and none of the career politicians looking at this race were courageous enough to call him out for his betrayal,” Morris said.\n\n“That’s why I’m seriously considering running for office,” he added. “The last thing Kentucky needs is to elect a puppet of Mitch McConnell to the US Senate.”\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY)\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) told Semafor that he is weighing a run for governor in 2027 but will not run for the Senate seat. He lost the GOP primary in the state’s 2015 gubernatorial race. \n\nComer said he will still run for reelection to the House in 2026. \n\nGov. Andy Beshear (D-KY)\n\nThe state’s Democratic governor said he has ruled out running for the seat. He most recently won reelection in 2023 against Cameron.\n\n“I’m completely and totally ruling out a run for any open Senate seat in 2026. I love this job,” Beshear said. “We’re seeing amazing things happen in the commonwealth. Our economy is just exploding in special ways, and my kids are happy. I’m going to keep doing this job every day for this four-year term I was elected to.”\n\nSome Democrats have also theorized that Beshear has his eyes on a presidential run in 2028 after he was in the running to be former Vice President Kamala Harris’s vice presidential pick in the 2024 election.","summary":"Even before Sen.

When it comes to politics, he don't know his a** from a hole in the ground,' Carville said. \n\n'He's on there running his goddamn mouth about how he may have to run as a Democrat because there's nothing left of the Democratic Party, and they have no talent. Stephen A., are you s****ing me?'\n\nStephen A. Smith's (R) political aspirations were eviscerated by pundit James Carville (L)\n\nThe analyst left the door open for a possible presidency bid while speaking to DailyMail.com\n\n'Before you start running your f***ing mouth off, about politics, a topic of which you really don't know anything about, you ought to sit back and think about it and call some people and run it by them,' Carville continued. \n\n'But don't let your political stupidity stand in the way of your outspoken, and I think insightful views, when it comes to American sports, which I think you are an expert at. \n\n'The last thing they're thinking is, if I decide that I want to take the next step in American politics, I'm going to be facing some brutal, brutal opposition. And they both know that. And they know it deep down, and they know it well. So Stephen A., keep up your s*** on sports. I enjoy it, I like it, but don't make a fool of yourself anymore talking about politics.' \n\nSmith has not shied away from delivering bold political takes in the aftermath of Trump's emphatic victory over Harris in the polls during last year's election. \n\nIn recent weeks, Smith shocked Bill Maher's audience with his blunt verdict on why Trump won a second term in the White House - and admitted why he feels like a 'damn fool' for supporting Harris. \n\nAs a result of his hot takes, which have gone viral, Smith has generated a lot of support for a potential presidential bid. \n\n'If they told me I had a legitimate, bonafide shot to win the presidency of the United States of America, I would entertain it,' Smith told DailyMail.com in the buildup to this month's Super Bowl. \n\n'Because the part that I'm not joking about is I believe I could beat every candidate on that poll. Every candidate that they mentioned, from Kamala Harris right on down to (Pete) Buttigieg and to Tim Walz. I'd beat all of them. I do believe that. I really do.'\n\nCarville worked as a lead strategist on Bill Clinton's (left) winning 1992 campaign\n\nSmith has more support than several big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls, a poll said\n\nVoters were asked who they would vote for if the 2028 Democratic primary was held today\n\nStephen A. Smith sends brutal message to Kamala Harris as he discusses potential 2028 election run\n\nSmith's claims come after John McLaughlin - who was Trump's chief pollster - held a national survey of 1,000 general election voters last month. \n\nAmong the questions he asked was: 'Thinking ahead to the 2028 Democratic primary election for president, if that election were held today among the following candidates, for whom would you vote?'\n\nTwo percent said they would choose ESPN star Smith. That is more than the likes of Beto O'Rourke - who ran for the nomination in 2020 - and JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois (both one percent).\n\nRemarkably, Smith polled only one percentage point behind Tim Walz - Harris' vice-presidential pick - and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nHarris was overwhelmingly the No 1 choice, with a third of voters (33 percent) saying they would vote for the former vice president - despite her defeat by Trump in November.\n\nDonald TrumpSteve Smith\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStephen A.

Smith to shut up about politics and stick to sports","text":"Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville lashed out at ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith for dipping his toes into political punditry, telling the bombastic sports commentator to stop “running your f***ing mouth off about politics” because Smith doesn’t know “his a** from a hole in the ground.”\n\nEarlier this week, Smith — who said in December he regretted voting Democrat in the last election — talked about how weak the Democratic Party has become, which is why his name has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential candidate in some polls. \n\n“If you’re the Democrats, that’s why Stephen A Smith is in the news because y’all don’t have anybody,” Smith blared on his podcast on Monday. “I’m in the news because the Democratic Party is [down] here! Dammit, lower than that! Down to the bottom! They suck right now! Horrible! Because they don’t have a voice! Where the hell is the voice?”\n\nSmith was referring to a survey last month that showed at least two percent of Democratic voters would choose him in the 2028 presidential primary, prompting him to later say he “might entertain” a White House run because the Democrats looked “so pathetic.” The First Take host has also made several appearances on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and Bill Maher’s HBO program in recent weeks to debate about politics.\n\nApparently, Carville has had enough of Smith’s political commentary.\n\n“When it comes to sports, I find him to be really insightful,” Carville said during a recent episode of his Politicon podcast. “When it comes to politics, he don’t know his a** from a hole in the ground.”\n\nReiterating that he is a “big fan” of the outspoken ESPN star, Carville — who has recently offered up his own criticism of Democrats and 2024 nominee Kamala Harris, a candidate he was certain would win — went on to tear into Smith’s opinion about the party and national politics in general.\n\n“He’s on there running his godd*** mouth about how he may have to run as a Democrat because there’s nothing left of the Democratic Party and they have no talent,” he exclaimed. “Stephen A., are you sh*tting me?!”\n\nCarville added: “Before you start running your f***ing mouth off about politics, a topic of which you really don’t know anything about, you ought to sit back and think about it and call some people.”\n\nThe former Bill Clinton adviser also invoked his favorite political mantra: The “one very simple reason” Democrats lost in 2024 “is and always will be the economy, stupid.” Noting that Smith has said he is friends with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Carville touted the two young Democratic state leaders as future faces of the party.\n\n“You say you’re friends with Wes Moore, you say you’re friends with Josh Shapiro… I think they’re really extraordinary talented people,” he added. “I got news for you dude! There’s six or seven other people in the Democratic party that are just that talented.”\n\nCarville wrapped up his tirade by advising Smith to stick to sports and keep his nose out of political commentary.\n\n“Stephen A., keep up your sh*t on sports. I enjoy it. I like it,” he concluded. “But don’t make a fool of yourself anymore and talk about politics.”","summary":"‘When it comes to politics, he don’t know his a** from a hole in the ground,” James Carville declared on his podcast.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephen-smith-politics-democrats-espn-b2701855.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/20/19/09/Screenshot-Capture-2025-02-20-13-39-36.png?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/JzecNbK0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-20 20:10:31","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":292647844,"title":"Kash Patel's Confirmation Tightens Trump's Control of Government","text":"The Senate voted to confirm Kash Patel as FBI director on Thursday, tightening President Donald Trump's control of the federal government.Why It MattersPatel was among a handful of Trump's Cabinet picks who received heavy criticism from Republicans. But pushback and concerns from a few GOP moderates couldn't overcome their 53-47 majority in the Senate—a reflection of Trump's influence on the party.His confirmation tightens Trump's grip on the federal government, placing a staunch loyalist in charge of the federal law enforcement agency of which Trump has been highly critical. While there are still a few Cabinet picks yet to be confirmed, those nominations are less likely to face strong opposition in the Senate.What To KnowOnly two Republicans voted against Patel's nomination—Senators Susan Collins of Maine, who is expected to face a potentially tough reelection race in a state that voted for Vice President Kamala Harris last year, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. All Democrats voted no on Patel.Patel has faced higher scrutiny from Trump critics than most other Cabinet picks. Democrats raised concerns about his list of enemies and whether they could be targeted by the FBI if he were to be confirmed. He has also faced criticism over his alleged ties to Russia, and Senate Democrats accused him of perjuring himself during his confirmation hearing.None of Trump's Cabinet picks brought to a vote have failed so far, despite concerns from even some Republican senators.In the toughest confirmation battle so far, three Republicans—Collins, Murkowski and Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican—voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but Vice President JD Vance served as the tiebreaking vote.Other nominees faced little pushback from Republican senators.Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced only one Republican \"no\" vote, from McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio who raised concerns about Kennedy's position on vaccines. Other Republicans, despite disagreement with his past statements on abortion and vaccines, declined to vote against him.McConnell was also the only Republican to vote against Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's nomination.Patel will now lead the FBI, which became a target of Trump's ire after investigations into him after he left the White House in 2021. Trump has sought to shake up the FBI and Justice Department over the investigations, which focused on the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and whether he mishandled classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago.Trump has demanded the names of FBI agents involved in those investigations so they could potentially be removed, the Associated Press reported in January.Patel may now have the ability to reshape the FBI. He has said he would \"come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections\" in an interview with Steve Bannon and has supported reducing the size of the agency, AP reported.What People Are SayingSenator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, on the Senate floor: \"Today the Senate is on track to confirm Kash Patel as director of the FBI. Think about that statement for a moment. Kash Patel, conspiracy theorist, January 6 denier, MAGA sycophant and political provocateur, will be FBI director. The absurdity of it. The destructive consequences of it. It's worth asking today, how did we get here, to such an extreme point? To this moment when someone so patently unqualified, really disqualified from any position of any position of responsibility, is poised to become director of the nation's preeminent law enforcement agency?\"Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, in a statement: \"While Mr. Patel has had 16 years of dedicated public service, his time over the past four years has been characterized by high profile and aggressive political activity. Mr. Patel has made numerous politically charged statements in his book and elsewhere discrediting the work of the FBI, the very institution he has been nominated to lead.\"Senator John Curtis, a Utah Republican, on X, formerly Twitter: \"Americans expect to see change within the FBI, and I believe Kash Patel can deliver that. My primary concern with his nomination was ensuring he would approach the role without political bias—an essential quality for any FBI Director. After careful consideration, I plan to vote yes on his confirmation.\"What Happens NextOther Trump Cabinet picks are unlikely to face tough confirmation battles. Linda McMahon, tapped to lead the Department of Education, and Representative Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican picked by Trump as United Nations ambassador, are expected to have easy confirmations.Former Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Trump's labor secretary pick, may face backlash from some Republicans like Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who already said he is a \"no\" on her. But her more moderate record may win over a few Democrats who haven't ruled out supporting her.","summary":"Only two Republican senators voted against Patel to lead the FBI on Thursday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kash-patel-confirmation-tightens-trump-control-2033989","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2592476/kash-patel-confirmation.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 19:47:50","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.205},{"id":292647828,"title":"Donald Trump Polling Worse on The Economy Than Any Recent President","text":"Most Americans disapprove of President Trump's handling of the U.S. economy, despite entering the White House on the promise of lowering prices for consumers.According to a recent Gallup poll, Trump's approval rating on the economy stands at 42 percent. This is lower than any president's first-term February reading in recent history, Gallup notes, including those for Joe Biden (54 percent), Barack Obama (59 percent), George W. Bush (53 percent) and Bill Clinton (45 percent).Why It MattersTrump's campaign focused heavily on the state of the U.S. economy, the candidate decrying \"Bidenomics\" as an accelerant of U.S. inflation, painting his opponent's policies as more of the same, and promising to bring down prices \"on day one.\" Alongside American's concerns over immigration, this was credited with securing his victory over Kamala Harris and paving the path to the White House.However, Trump's low economic approval rating indicates that Americans are discouraged by his approach so far, amid anxiety over the domestic impact of tariffs, and recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that America's inflationary struggles are far from over.What To KnowAccording to Gallup, which surveyed 1,004 Americans between February 3 and February 16, Trump's overall approval rating stands at 45 percent, five points ahead of the initial February approval rating in his first term (40 percent). These mark the lowest February approval ratings of any president since 1953, Gallup noted.By party, 93 percent of Republicans and four percent of Democrats are happy about the President's job performance, with the starkest differences of opinion concerning immigration and foreign affairs—both 86 percent splits.Before their administrations fully take shape, presidents typically enjoy their highest approval ratings early in their term and depart with significantly diminished public support. Joe Biden's approval rating fell from 57 percent to 40 between the start and end of his term, Trump's dropped from 45 to 34 percent, and Obama's from 67 percent to 59.Americans' views on specific matters are similar to those on the economy, the president getting approval ratings of 46 percent on immigration, 44 percent on foreign affairs—but 40 percent on both Israel-Palestine and the war in Ukraine—and 42 percent on foreign trade.According to a previous poll—Gallup's Economic Confidence Index—Americans were less pessimistic about the economy than prior to Trump's victory in the 2025 presidential election, the index shifting from minus 26 in late October to minus 19 in early January.However, the latest survey, conducted since Trump's inauguration, comes at a time of heightened concern over the economy and escalating tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners. Earlier in February, Trump announced blanket, 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, followed days later by the announcement of \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from those countries he believes are taking advantage of the U.S. in terms of trade.Last week, the U.S. Consumer Price Index increased quicker than analysts had forecast, indicating steeper price increases across the board in January compared to December.What People Are Saying\"BIDEN INFLATION UP!\" President Trump posted to Truth Social shortly after the inflation reading.Vice President JD Vance said that the president would fulfill his campaign promise to lower prices, but that this would \"take a bit of time.\"In the interview with CBS News' Face the Nation, Vance added: \"More capital investment, more job creation in our economy is one of the things that's going to drive down price for all consumers but also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things they need.\"What Happens Next?According to minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, released on Wednesday, several factors could \"hinder the disinflation process\" including Trump's immigration policies. The Fed also cited concerns from business leaders that companies may push higher prices resulting from tariffs onto consumers.Do you have a story we should be covering?

Virginia Republicans left the 2021 elections with a 52-48 majority in the House of Delegates, but Democrats flipped the chamber back in 2023 and now hold a 51-49 majority. Republicans are also down two seats in the state Senate. There is also a big question mark hanging over the reaction of voters in northern Virginia, where many federal workers live, to President Donald Trump’s and Elon Musk’s massive effort to scale back the federal government, with many job losses.\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) remains popular, with his approval hitting its highest point last August. Since Virginia does not allow governors to run for reelection, the GOP nominee will probably be Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Her opponent is likely to be former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger.\n\nThe Virginia elections will be a test of whether Republicans can sustain their momentum from 2024 to turn Virginia into a true swing state. The election of Youngkin, Earle-Sears, and Attorney General Jason Miyares made waves in 2021 because Virginia was viewed as an increasingly reliable blue state. It had just backed Joe Biden over Trump in 2020 by 10 points. Trump cut that to under 6 points in 2024, a more competitive but still somewhat comfortable win for Democrats.\n\nIn three of the last four polls of the race in the Real Clear Politics polling average, Earle-Sears trails Spanberger by an average of 3 points. (The fourth poll, from Virginia Commonwealth University, had Spanberger with a 10-point lead and the highest margin of error of the set). An Earle-Sears victory would show that 2021 wasn’t a one-off for the Virginia GOP and that Republicans could continue to be on offense in national elections by tipping blue swing states in the opposite direction.\n\nNew Jersey elections\n\nIf Virginia is a test of Republicans’ ability to replicate the magic of 2021, New Jersey is a test to see if the GOP can turn it into Virginia. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by 16 points, the fourth straight election Democrats won the state by double digits. Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) won his first election in 2017 by just over 14 points. Virginia was a swing state that was slipping away from the GOP, but New Jersey was undeniably a blue state on no one’s radar to be competitive.\n\nBut Murphy escaped 2021 by the skin of his teeth, winning reelection by just a 3-point margin. The state followed that in 2024 by backing Vice President Kamala Harris by under 6 points, with the biggest rightward shift of any state other than New York. It was the closest Republicans had come to winning New Jersey in a presidential election since 1992.\n\nVoter registration numbers have shifted toward the GOP in the past four years, with the GOP adding registered Republicans every month of Biden’s presidency faster than Democrats could add to their own tally. Democrats also won’t have an incumbent advantage to lean on, as Murphy can’t run for reelection because of term limits. The Democratic field includes the mayors of the state’s two largest cities and Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill.\n\nThat will make it perhaps the best test of whether New Jersey is still a true blue state. The six top Democratic candidates in the field debated in early February, and their disputes highlighted the problem of immigration. That issue has been overwhelmingly popular for Trump, with CNN’s Harry Enten highlighting that over 55% of people in several polls support deporting all illegal immigrants. Congress capitalized on this by passing the Laken Riley Act, which ordered the Department of Homeland Security to detain illegal immigrants arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.\n\nMost of New Jersey’s Democratic candidates are still treating the state as a blue stronghold. Gottheimer was attacked at the debate by Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop for supporting the bill. They have evidently staked their candidacy on opposing deporting illegal immigrants who commit additional crimes while they are in the country. Sherrill also opposed the bill, and Gottheimer tried to win back his liberal illegal immigration credibility by agreeing that the next New Jersey governor should protect illegal immigrants from deportation.\n\nIf New Jersey Democrats insist on running in the state like it’s 2017, it will be a true test of how potent the GOP’s immigration messaging is under Trump in what is supposed to be reliable Democratic territory.\n\nWisconsin and Pennsylvania Supreme Court elections\n\nThe Supreme Court elections in swing states Wisconsin and Pennsylvania will again test whether Trump’s victory will signal further GOP wins in those states. Wisconsin will be the first test, with an April election to replace a retiring liberal Supreme Court justice. The liberals on the court hold a 4-3 majority, which was maintained when the conservative candidate, Daniel Kelly, lost in both 2020 and 2023.\n\nRepublicans are already off to a better start, with former Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel serving as the conservative candidate (the candidates are technically nonpartisan). That means that, unlike the aforementioned Kelly, the conservative candidate is someone who has won statewide in Wisconsin in the past. Conservative justices face reelection in 2026 and 2027, so a liberal win would empower Democrats for at least three more years.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, three Democratic justices, part of the party’s 5-2 majority, are facing a “yes” or “no” vote for another 10-year term. If Republicans were to win all three seats, they would guarantee themselves a majority until at least 2031. As with Wisconsin, the GOP is hoping to capitalize on the momentum of Trump’s victory in the state. Republicans hold a majority in both chambers in the Wisconsin state legislature and in the Pennsylvania state Senate, with a tie in the state assembly.\n\nDespite those majorities, the state Supreme Court in both states continues to intrude in the legislative process to the benefit of Democrats. The Wisconsin Supreme Court and its liberal majority threw out the state’s legislative map to gift Democrats a more favorable one. The court took up the case through a lawsuit filed right after the liberal candidate who called the maps “rigged” during her campaign won in 2023. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court adopted a map proposed by Democratic voters who sued the state in order to send the case to the court.\n\nIf Republicans can pull off the wins in both states, they wouldn’t just show that Trump’s victory offers a sustainable path forward for Republicans in swing states. Victories in these Supreme Court races could prevent further interference in redistricting fights from liberal justices and allow the GOP to legislate free from the burden of an overbearing liberal court.","summary":"The Republican Party is in a good spot after the 2024 elections, with President Donald Trump enjoying an all-time high in popularity and Republicans holding both chambers of Congress.

They sat behind rows of folding black tables and were handed red folders that contained study materials for one of the most important tests they’d ever take: the American English and civics test, the last requirement to become a U.S. citizen.\n\nMany of them were afraid.\n\nIt was late last April, and in the proceeding weeks, former President Donald Trump had become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in large part due to his pledge to crack down on immigration. His rhetoric was more heated, calling undocumented immigrants “animals” and “not human.”\n\nOne of the instructors was Miriam Guzman, who successfully passed the citizenship test six years ago. Both she and her co-instructor, Theresa Servin, sensed the fear and anxiety among their new pupils.\n\n“We’re teaching them to do the correct thing so they don’t have to be afraid,” Guzman said in a recent interview.\n\nNow in motion, Trump’s plans have put on edge some in the West Texas Hispanic population. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have begun to conduct roundups. Less than 20 miles from that classroom, one sweep led to 10 arrests.\n\n“It’s not easy,” Servin said. “No one wants to take on that responsibility.”\n\nClasses like the one Guzman and Servin teach are filling a vacuum in this part of Texas that has few official resources for migrants who find their way to the oil fields of the Permian Basin. Labor is often in high demand, making Odessa and nearby communities a magnet for immigrants — legal or not. Community leaders have sought to create an official migration resource center but are in early stages.\n\nAbsent official help, Guzman and Servin see it as their responsibility to assist their neighbors, whether undocumented or not.\n\nLeaving Mexico\n\nGuzman began her journey to becoming a U.S. citizen in 2014 when she and her American husband left Mexico.\n\nThey had never planned to relocate to the U.S., but a string of kidnappings in their neighborhood prompted the search for more security.\n\n“It was very fast,” the 44-year-old said. “It was very painful because I’m a family person, but I knew I needed to do it for our daughters. I cried every day.”\n\nGuzman first entered the U.S. with a tourist visa. Most days, she wouldn’t leave the house. She refused to drive even though she had a Mexican driver’s license out of fear of being stopped by an unfriendly police officer. On Sundays, she would get groceries when her husband. She’d walk to her daughter’s school across the street. Guzman, a career graphic designer, used her free time to design the logo for her husband’s electric service company.\n\nIt took her a year and a half to get a permanent resident card, commonly known as a green card. Almost five years after leaving Mexico, she successfully passed her citizenship exam.\n\nIn 2020, she met Servin, who offered business start-up lessons for women. Guzman wanted to open her own skincare business, and two years later, with Servin’s help, she did. Guzman is also an instructor at the beauty school she attended, graduating seven classes.\n\nServin, who grew up in the West Texas town of Kermit, had been a longtime immigration advocate and served as president of the League of United Latin American Citizens’s Odessa chapter, a national organization that advocates for Latinos with local chapters nationwide.\n\nShe asked Guzman, with whom she bonded over a shared inclination for advocacy, to help her with a lesson she had planned. The lesson would teach students how to study for their citizenship. Guzman saw it as a chance to set an example for her two daughters.\n\n“I wanted to teach my daughters that giving back is fulfilling,” she said.\n\nCommunity leaders said they want to help migrants, not expel them\n\nOdessa is the first major city east of El Paso, about 285 miles away. The city’s population is predominantly Hispanic. And the oil fields have long been a magnet for transient and migrant workers. With generous pay, generations of families have settled here in the Permian Basin.\n\nOne report by the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit immigration think tank, suggests that 21,700 immigrants are in Odessa, 13% of its population. About 7,400 are believed to be undocumented.\n\nEconomic development officials and civic leaders say migrants fill crucial job openings in the oil fields and at the businesses that support the energy industry. They want more workers, not less, and are willing to help undocumented Odessans gain legal status.\n\nTom Manskey, director of economic development for the Odessa Chamber of Commerce, said they received a $15,000 grant in August from the Association of Chambers of Commerce Executives, a national group, to assist “new Americans.”\n\nThe chamber is working with the city’s higher education institutions to determine the services the resource center would provide and whether it can offer workforce certification and licensing programs.\n\n“We're not out to recruit people from the border or anything like that,” Manskey said. “We're looking at an existing population that's already here, that are our neighbors, that cannot work legally. How can we fix that?”\n\nA first step was holding a conference last September for employers and workers.\n\nThe event included discussions regarding local law enforcement’s role during migrant encounters, human trafficking and the process of obtaining legal status — information the chamber will use to establish the immigration resource center for the region.\n\nThe chamber is working with Odessa College to draw from its expertise training workers. The college already offers several workforce programs, like nursing, electrical lineman work, welding and manufacturing.\n\n“It's not anything new for us to be reaching out to our community,” said Cheri Dalton, a spokesperson for the college. “That's just the nature of this college.”\n\nNavigating the uncertainty as tensions grow\n\nThe push to help undocumented residents find legal status to remain in Odessa comes as law enforcement efforts to remove those same people intensify, spurring anger from Hispanic residents.\n\nAt a Head Start program in downtown Odessa, staff invited LULAC to tell undocumented parents about the services they could seek to help gain legal status. The program staff also said they had plans should federal immigration enforcement officials, or ICE, knock at their door.\n\nCatriva Webbs, chief executive officer at the Greater Opportunities of the Permian Basin, said the Head Start program doesn’t ask for proof of citizenship. The program has about 842 enrolled children, infants and pregnant women in four West Texas counties.\n\n“We wanted to have a session on immigration because we want to make sure that we are providing what we foresee to be a high need in our community,” Webbs said. “We have a high population, given the nature of our location… of persons still seeking legal citizenship in the country.”\n\nThe night before LULAC spoke to Webb’s families, ICE agents arrested 19 people they said were in the country illegally. It was the first reported series of raids in Midland, a city about 20 miles east of Odessa.\n\nThe raids won’t stop the lessons\n\nGuzman and Servin haven’t hosted another cram session like the one last April.\n\nHowever, Servin started a new business, Tere Resource Center, which helps people navigate the immigration process. She’s had 102 clients so far seeking immigration services. Last fall, Servin voted for Trump. She admires his business acumen, she said. She voted for the candidate she believed would enforce the law.\n\n“He isn’t scared, he’s cleaning up,” she said.\n\nGuzman wasn’t impressed with either Trump or former Vice President Kamala Harris and didn’t vote.\n\nTrump’s early roundups of undocumented immigrants concern them, they said. However, they want to believe that Trump will only deport criminals. That isn’t the case, news reports have found.\n\nTheir next joint class — which is free — will be in March. They will help anyone who shows up.\n\nDisclosure: Odessa College has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

It’s 92% Kamala … I think about that number a lot. That’s basically everyone. And so, if the will of the president is not implemented, and the president is representative of the people, that means the will of the people is not being implemented, and that means we don’t live in a democracy. We live in a bureaucracy.”\n\nMusk made a minor error in the District of Columbia voting numbers. Yes, in the 2020 election, with former President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, 92.1% of district voters chose Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, versus 5.4% for Trump. In 2024, when Harris was the presidential candidate, 90.3% voted for her versus 6.5% for Trump. So, Musk was a couple of points off for 2024.\n\nYou get the idea. The district, home of the federal government, is a single-party jurisdiction, and it has voted 90%-plus for Democrats for president for the last 20 years.\n\nBut, the permanent bureaucracy does not all squeeze into the district. It also lives in several surrounding counties. Montgomery County, Maryland, voted 75% for Harris, while Prince George’s County, Maryland, voted 86% for Harris. In Virginia, Alexandria voted 77% for Harris, Arlington County also voted 77% for Harris, and Fairfax County voted 66% for Harris.\n\nSo yes, the heart of the deep state is overwhelmingly Democratic. You will not be surprised to learn that, of the federal employees who contributed to a presidential candidate in 2024, most gave to Harris. The publication Government Executive reported that federal employees donated “at least $4.2 million” in the 2024 race, and nearly 84% went to Harris.\n\nBreaking things down a bit, Government Executive reported that more than 61% of Trump’s relatively meager donations came from two cabinet agencies, the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security. The rest of the executive branch’s money went to Harris. “The Education Department had the most one-sided donation breakdown,” Government Executive said. “Employees there gave more than $25,000 to Harris and did not make a single donation to Trump, according to FEC records. That was followed by the Environmental Protection Agency, with 99% of donations going to [Harris], the Energy Department at 97%, the Commerce Department at 96%, and the State Department at 94%.”\n\nWhen it comes to federal government workers, political donations go almost entirely in one direction.\n\nFederal workers are also more unionized — another measure of Democratic leanings — than the rest of the nation’s workforce. Private-sector unions have shrunk to almost nothing in the last several decades, while public-sector unions have grown. Today, 30% of federal government employees are union members or are represented by union contracts.\n\nThe largest federal government employees union is the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which reported last week that its dues-paying membership has risen to 321,000 as government workers continue to “join in droves” following Trump’s arrival. The union claims that beyond formal membership, it represents 800,000 federal employees around the country.\n\nGovernment employee unions give to political candidates, of course, and like the personal donations of federal workers, the contributions go just one way. In 2024, AFGE, in its various forms, contributed $2,645,208, virtually all of it to Democrats, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nOne last note about the permanent bureaucracy/deep state. Republican efforts to shrink it always seem to focus on the Washington, D.C., area. But, federal employees are spread all around the country. About 80% of the federal workforce is outside the district/Maryland/Virginia area. “The locations with the largest federal employee populations are Washington DC — 7.3%, Virginia — 6.6%, California — 6.5%, Maryland — 6.4%, Texas — 5.7%, and Florida — 4.2%,” writes the Partnership for Public Service. \n\nAside from the military services, the largest federal employer, by far, is the Department of Veterans Affairs. After that comes the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department civilian workforce, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, and more. The largest occupation is under the broad definition of “medical, hospital, dental, and public health,” and the second-largest occupation is “general administration, clerical, and office service.”\n\nSo far, DOGE’s efforts to shrink federal spending have mostly focused on ridiculous expenditures — the LGBTQ comic book in Peru — that no one can defend. Obviously, that needs to be cut. But, the federal bureaucracy is so large and sprawling that waste can and will be found virtually anywhere, including in government activities that voters need, want, and support. Those need to be examined, too.\n\nIt is much-needed work. But it’s no mystery why it has set off howls of anger from the bureaucracy, which is not only permanent but much of it is politicized as well. Its leaders would rather defend the indefensible to resist Trump and Musk than admit that federal spending is in need of reform. \n\nAnd yes, the president and DOGE should be careful and systematic. But they need to be tough and persistent, too. The permanent bureaucracy has made itself hard to penetrate and change because it really, really doesn’t want to be penetrated and changed. Recently, a group of former Obama aides who appeared on the podcast Pod Save America discussed how hard change can be. “We all know that government is slow,” said former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. “We all know government can be inefficient. We all know that the bureaucracy can be bloated. We all worked in the White House. We tried to reorganize the government. We tried to find efficiency. It’s hard to do.”\n\nAnother former Obama speechwriter, Jon Lovett, addressed what Trump and Musk are doing and said, “Honestly, some of this is pretty annoying because it’s some of the stuff we should have done. We didn’t know you could do some of this.”\n\nNow, the president and DOGE have an opportunity to actually succeed where others failed. They need to be smart. They need to be sensible. But most of all, they need to keep going.","summary":"WHY TRUMP IS SO THREATENING TO THE PERMANENT BUREAUCRACY.

Having established that he would do nearly anything within legal bounds to win, Trump adds that: “Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.”\n\nIt’s an idea which makes a lot of sense when you consider Trump’s record. We saw it time and again on the campaign trail, as he sought to seal the deal with the US public by repeatedly denigrating first Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. Which begs the question, in seeking to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, exactly who he sees as the competition he needs to denigrate: Vladimir Putin or Volodymyr Zelensky? \n\nTrump has certainly gone out of his way to excoriate the Ukrainian president over the past day or two, both in public and on his TruthSocial platform. He has variously blamed Zelensky for starting the war, called him a “dictator without elections” and a “modestly successful comedian … very low in Ukrainian polls” who “has done a terrible job, his country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died”.\n\nPutin, meanwhile, takes a rather different view of how to seal a deal with the US president. Far from denigrating Trump, he has set out to charm the flattery-loving president with a view to driving a wedge between the US and Europe, claiming that EU leaders had “insulted” Trump during his election campaign and insisting that “they are themselves at fault for what is happening”.\n\nSign up to receive our weekly World Affairs Briefing newsletter from The Conversation UK. Every Thursday we’ll bring you expert analysis of the big stories in international relations.\n\nThe Russian president will be well pleased with the events of the past week or so. After three years of increasing isolation under the Biden presidency, he’s now back at the top table with the US president – two powerful men discussing the future of Europe. \n\nFor the man who, in 2005, complained that the collapse of the Soviet Union had been “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century, to be back deciding the fate of nations is a dream come true, writes James Rodgers of City St George’s, University of London. \n\nRodgers, a former BBC Moscow correspondent, observes that Putin has fulfilled this mission having “conceded not an inch of occupied Ukrainian territory to get there. Nor has he even undertaken to give back any of what Russian forces have seized since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.”\n\nNot only that, but Putin also appears to have enlisted US support for one of the key objectives that encouraged him to invade Ukraine in the first place: preventing Ukraine from joining Nato. That much was clear from the US defense secretary Pete Hegseth’s speech to European defence officials last week. The views of Washington’s European allies (and of the Biden administration) – that Ukraine’s membership of Nato is a matter for the alliance members to decide with Ukraine as a sovereign state in control of its own foreign policy – don’t appear to matter to Trump and his team.\n\n Read more:\n Ukraine peace talks: Trump is bringing Russia back in from the cold and ticking off items on Putin's wish list\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s policy volte-face over Ukraine and, more broadly, European security in general has driven a dangerous wedge between the US and its allies in Europe. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, responded by convening a meeting on Monday of the leaders of what the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, described as “the main European countries”. This turned out to include Germany, the UK, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the Nato secretary-general and the presidents of the European Council and European Commission.\n\nPassing over the question of how the leaders of the Baltic states felt about this, given they all share a border with Russia (as does Finland) and presumably are well aware of the vulnerability of their position, the fact is Europe is deeply divided over its response to the situation.\n\nAs Stefan Wolff observes, the Weimar+ group of countries that met in Paris only represent one shade of opinion within the EU. Meanwhile, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, is openly scathing about European efforts to support Ukraine, posting on X: “While President @realDonaldTrump and President Putin negotiate on peace, EU officials issue worthless statements.”\n\nWolff, an expert in international security at the University of Birmingham, notes that disrupting European unity is a stated aim of the Project 2025 initiative which has guided, if not Trump himself, many of his close advisers. The past week, taking into account both Hegseth’s meeting with European defence ministers and the subsequent appearance by the US vice-president, J.D. Vance, at the Munich Security Conference, has gone a fair way down the path towards achieving that disruption.\n\nAt the same time, Vance’s lecture to the conference – during which he was heavily critical of Europe as “the enemy within” which was undermining democracy and threatening free speech – will have united most of those present in anger and dismay at his remarks.\n\n Read more:\n Europe left scrambling in face of wavering US security guarantees\n\nConstitutional matters\n\nTrump has declared that Zelensky is a “dictator” because he cancelled last year’s election in Ukraine. In fact, Ukraine’s constitution provides that elections are prohibited during periods of martial law. And martial law has been in force since the day of the invasion on February 24 2022.\n\nLena Surzhko Harned, a professor of political science at Penn State University, writes that the delegitimisation of Zelensky is a tactic Putin has been striving for from the very start. The Kremlin has pushed the narrative that there is no legitimate authority with which to negotiate a peace deal, and that Zelensky’s government is “illegitimate”.\n\n“What Putin needs for this plan to work is a willing partner to help get the message out that Zelensky and the current Ukraine government are not legitimate representatives of their country,” writes Harned. “And into this gap the new US administration appears to have stepped.”\n\nDespite Zelensky still enjoying relatively strong support in recent opinion polls, an election campaign in the middle of this conflict would be a needlessly divisive exercise. And that’s before you consider the potential for Russian interference, which would be seriously debilitating for a country fighting for its survival.\n\nPutin knows all this – and he also knows by framing the issue in a way that suggests Ukraine is dragging its feet over peace, he will enjoy a propaganda coup. And that’s what he is doing, with the apparent support of the US president. \n\n Read more:\n In pushing for Ukraine elections, Trump is falling into Putin-laid trap to delegitimize Zelenskyy\n\nAnother way Putin hopes to discredit the Ukrainian leadership is by deliberately excluding it from the talks – at least for the present. Zelensky has said, with the support of his European allies, that there can be no deal without Ukrainian participation. \n\nIt’s easy to see why Zelensky and his allies are so adamant that they should be involved, writes Matt Fitzpatrick, a professor of international history at Flinders University. History is littered with examples of large powers getting together to decide the fate of smaller nations that have no agency in the division.\n\nThree such shameful debacles determined the history of much of the 20th century – and not in a good way. The Sykes-Picot agreement divided the Middle East between British and French spheres of influence, and sowed the seed for discord which continues to this day. The Munich conference of 1938, at which the fate of Czechoslovakia was decided without any Czech input, showed Adolf Hitler that naked aggression really does pay. And having failed to learn from either of these, in 1945 the Big Three (Russia, the US and Britain) got together at Yalta to carve up Germany, thereby setting the scene for the cold war.\n\n Read more:\n Ukraine isn't invited to its own peace talks. History is full of such examples – and the results are devastating\n\nDeal or no deal\n\nOne of Trump’s assertions this week has been that Zelensky had his chance to strike a deal and avoid all the bloodshed and much of the territorial loss suffered by Ukraine in the three years of war. Reacting to questions about why Zelensky or any Ukrainian diplomats hadn’t been involved in the talks, he scoffed: “Today I heard: ‘Oh, well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years … You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”\n\nStephen Hall, who specialises in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, recalls the early talks in the spring of 2022. He says that the idea – also floated in the press by several commentators – that Ukraine should have concluded a peace deal in March or April of 2022 after talks in Istanbul is absurd.\n\nWhile there was momentum for peace, particularly on Kyiv’s part, the two sides were a long way apart on issues such as the size of Ukraine’s military and the fate of territories such as Crimea. “Had Ukraine done a deal based on the Istanbul communique, it would have essentially led to the country becoming a virtual province of Russia – led by a pro-Russian government and banned from seeking alliances with western countries,” Hall writes.\n\n Read more:\n Ukraine war: the idea that Kyiv should have signed a peace deal in 2022 is flawed – here's why\n\nAnd in any case, back then there was scant support among Ukraine’s allies in Europe and the Biden White House for appeasing Putin by offering him concessions in return for aggression. But that’s now history. Trump and his team appear to have already granted the Russian president some of his dearest wishes before the negotiations proper have even started.\n\nWorld Affairs Briefing from The Conversation UK is available as a weekly email newsletter.

He’s an attorney and a former United States ambassador to the Czech Republic.\n\n Most importantly, though, “he’s a Democrat operative” who is “buddies with the architects and the lawyers that staged the electioneering of the 2020 presidential election,” says Liz.\n\n “Norm’s group is the one behind the lawsuits which are leading to the nationwide injunctions against President Trump's executive orders.”\n\n To get the scoop on Norm Eisen and his mastermind plotting to thwart the Trump administration, Liz invites legal scholar Dr. John Eastman and journalist and veteran White House correspondent Fred Lucas on “The Liz Wheeler Show.”\n\n According to Dr. Eastman, these nationwide injunctions issued by lower-court judges are illegal.\n\n “The lower courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,” he says. They're limited by both “geography” — that is, districts — and by “the key provision in Article III, the judicial article, of our Constitution,” which says “that they can only address cases or controversies.”\n\n “So they can't decide and impose obligations on people that are not parties to the case before them,” Dr. Eastman explains, adding that what these lower courts are doing right now in regard to President Trump is so outrageous, it’s bound to be addressed by the Supreme Court soon.\n\n This lawfare, Dr. Eastman explains, is designed to “deprive the American people of the results of the election that they just consented to.”\n\n The election results, he says, were “a mandate to President Trump to do exactly the kind of things he's doing.” By blocking Trump’s executive orders, the lower courts are aiming to “stop the American people from exercising their sovereign power.”\n\n “That's essentially what's going on, and it is about as undemocratic a move as one can imagine,” says Dr. Eastman.\n\n And Norm Eisen is behind it.\n\n Fred Lucas says that Eisen “has a large web of dark-money nonprofits that are engaged in lawfare largely targeted at Trump.”\n\n “His coalition is actually part of a larger coalition that's being run by Marc Elias called Civil Service Strong, which is largely focused on defending the deep-state employees,” says Lucas.\n\n A peek into Eisen’s past puts the puzzle pieces in place. Not only was he “part of the team that impeached President Trump in 2019,” but he was also “part of the Obama White House,” where he served first as ethics czar and then ambassador to the Czech Republic. Prior to that, “he was one of the founding members of [Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington] … the same organization that last year tried to get Trump kicked off the ballot in various states,” including Colorado.\n\n To learn more about Norm Eisen’s shady history and his diabolic plan to undermine President Trump’s agenda, watch the episode above.\n\nWant more from Liz Wheeler?\n\nTo enjoy more of Liz’s based commentary, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","summary":"When Donald Trump won the election last November, like many conservatives, Liz Wheeler feared that we’d see political violence in the streets — the same kind of Democrat-funded violence that fueled the Summer of Rage in 2020.\n\n\n\n\tSurprisingly, the streets were quiet following Trump’s victory.\n\n\n\n\tBut it wasn’t because some on the left didn’t want to fund political violence.

FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIST REJECTS INFLATION HAPPY TALK: NOT ‘GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON’ The economist argued that Biden's \"Build Back Better\" agenda failed to address the immediate concerns of the electorate. \"It is possible that just the portion of inflation caused by global shocks would have been enough to doom any incumbent party’s reelection chances. But adding to that inflation with unnecessary spending, minimizing the suffering it caused, and touting an imaginary boom in infrastructure and manufacturing surely did not help Democrats,\" he continued. Furman spoke to Politico about the article and explained why he chose to write it now, as Trump is now the president. \"And I also looked, as the administration ended, and frankly saw a lot of people who I didn’t think were drawing on the right lessons of the last four years. They thought it was just bad luck: global inflation, all incumbents are losing, what he did was actually all great from beginning to end.

It's part of a wider piece of legislation called the Affordable Childcare Act, led by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., on the right and Sharice Davids, D-Kan., and Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., on the left. Both the Republican and Democratic campaigns had called for an expanded child tax credit during the 2024 presidential race, where both sides attempted to make inroads with families struggling to afford care. SCOOP: KEY CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS DRAWS RED LINE ON HOUSE BUDGET PLAN The current child tax credit levels give parents a refund of up to $2,000 for dependents under age 17. Adults with incomes that exceed $200,000 as a single filer or $400,000 for married couples can still be eligible for a partial credit. The bipartisan bill would raise the maximum threshold to $6,000 for one dependent and $12,000 for two or more. It would also double the tax credit for businesses that facilitate childcare for employees, raising the amount to $300,000 per year for qualifying workplaces. BLACK CAUCUS CHAIR ACCUSES TRUMP OF 'PURGE' OF 'MINORITY' FEDERAL WORKERS During the most recent White House campaign, now-Vice President JD Vance and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was running for the top of the ticket, called for a $5,000 and $6,000 child tax credit, respectively. But it's not certain Congress will find an appetite to work together on such a bill now, given bitter divisions over the government funding process and President Donald Trump's crackdown on government spending. Republicans are also working on a larger tax package that they're aiming to pass with only GOP votes via the budget reconciliation process. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which Republicans are hoping to extend with reconciliation, raised the maximum child tax credit from $1,000 at the time to $2,000.

Meanwhile, the Euro Stoxx 50, which is composed of 50 of the highest performing blue-chips in the Eurozone, has gained 6.7 percent since January 17, the last day of trading before the president was sworn in.Across the pond, the S&P 500 has risen by 2.5 percent over this same period, the Nasdaq Composite by 2.2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average, an index comprised 30 companies, 2.6 percent.Why It MattersOver the past few years, U.S. indexes have outpaced their European equivalents, their dominance owing in part to America's superior economic growth, as well as the rise and continued strength of its tech sector, which provided an edge over Europe's more traditional industries. Depending on how long Europe's boom lasts, this could hint at a shift in the status quo.The downturn in the U.S. may also stem from current concerns about how the current administration's policies could affect American industry.What To KnowThe Financial Times noted that Europe's strong performance comes following a historic rally for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite were all propelled to record highs on the back of Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in November, and his campaign promises of corporate tax cuts and widespread deregulation.Wall Street appears to have turned cautious, however, amid fears over the impact of Trump's trade policies.Concerns that president Trump's sweeping tariff plans could backfire and exacerbate the country's inflationary struggles are already beginning to materialize, and retaliatory measures by key trading partners such as China and Canada promise to put an additional squeeze on U.S. industry.As highlighted by the Financial Times in its report, the underperforming Nasdaq is an especially \"tech-heavy\" exchange, hinting at the potential reasons for its muted growth over the past month. The sector was hit by the launch of the Chinese DeepSeek chatbot in late January, which prompted a mass sell-off for companies like Microsoft and chipmaker Nvidia.The paper also noted that Europe's recent underperformance was driven by fears of potential tariffs, and when these did not materialize immediately after the inauguration, a rally followed.What People Are Saying\"For Europe, the trade war bark has so far been worse than the bite,\" Andrew Pease, chief investment strategist at Russell Investments told the Financial Times.Billionaire investor and former hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC in late January: \"I've been doing this for 49 years, and we're probably going from the most antibusiness administration to the opposite. We do a lot of talking to CEOs and companies on the ground. And I'd say CEOs are somewhere between relieved and giddy. So we're a believer in animal spirits.\"Daniel Morris, chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, recently told CNBC: \"I think at least European investors may need to enjoy it while it lasts.\"What Happens Next?According to the minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, released on Wednesday, the central bank believes there are a number of factors that could impact the \"hinder the disinflation process,\" including Trump's immigration policies.\"Business contacts in a number of Districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs,\" the minutes also read.Do you have a story we should be covering?

Comedian and media personality Trevor Noah recently managed to spark up what some might consider to be the hottest take of the year after a conversation on his What Now? Podcast that questioned the validity of integration in America led to a wider social discussion and even a pretty hot take by our own head honcho, D.L. Hughley. RELATED: Kanye West Uses “Koon Baya” Racial Jab Against Trevor Noah It all began after Noah asked his guest, Princeton professor Ruha Benjamin, a simple question: “Do you think that integration was the right move?” Using the secluded-yet-peaceful society of Finland as his prime example, the former Daily Show frontman and his co-host Christiana Mbakwe-Medina took a minute to decipher the question before Professor Benjamin responded in full agreement by stating, “No, I don’t, and I don’t think it’s actually that controversial if you understand that segregation and integration weren’t the only options.” She went on to add, “When you’re being integrated into institutions, into a culture that’s a supremacist culture — a culture that feeds off of hierarchy, that feeds off of insecurity [and] anxiety — why are we being integrated into that?” D.L. joined TMZ Live not too long after the clip went viral on social media to give his own breakdown of the integration v. segregation debate, calling it, in his words, “maybe the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.” More below, via TMZ: “D.L. doubled down that integration was necessary because Black schools were severely underfunded — but once schools did start integrating, white kids left, taking resources with them … basically canceling it out. While D.L. acknowledges racism has improved over time, he points out that policing, banking, housing, and other systems are still flooded with white supremacy — and that some big historic milestones of progress actually happened not that long ago. He says most white people may not agree with supremacist rhetoric, but they do align with the goal — keeping white people in power.” Watch the clip below to see what D.L. Hughley had to say in full about Trevor Noah and his “stupidest” take on segregation vs. integration, and continue scrolling to see who the masses are siding with over on social media: 1. People completely missing the concepts that Trevor Noah is talking about is hilarious. Hes not saying Segregation is the answer, hes saying that INTEGRATION of a group into a system that is racially bias and structured to hold the middle and lower class down is doomed to fail. via @samsonofspite 2. Say what you will about Trevor Noah, he has a gift for making stupid people feel comfortable enough to say idiotic things via @cogdissidence 3. The physical resources were never adequate, but let’s not get it confused – black teachers in all black schools pre-segregation taught the ENTIRE child, not just the curriculum, and black communities were better off because of it. When Trevor Noah asks the question, I go here. via @Sulaiman_ 4. Trevor Noah is not a good person. He is only critical of white South Africans because they don’t treat him like on of their own. Here are his thoughts on Julius Malema, and on the massacre of 34 miners at Marikana by South African police via @NobleQAli 5. Trevor is actually correct to question it. “I fear I have integrated my people into a burning house” -MLK via @Lew_E_Gi 6.

Mainly this was done in my High School Years, busing took longer, but worth it! In 6th grade, had at least dozen different nationalities! via @LifeDelicacy 7. I like Trevor Noah and his book is probably one of the best memoirs I’ve read. But i’m so sick and tired of rich liberal elites trying to be fake Malcom X’s and push this whole “was intergration even worth it” It’s a stupid conversation that shouldn’t be taken seriously. via @_rotimia 8. I think the issue with the Trevor Noah clip is it’s not clear if he’s talking about ethnicity or culture. If it’s the latter, that part is obvious. If it’s the prior then that is indeed racist. via @7th_Helix 9. I’ve seen multiple misconstruing that trevor noah quote out of context and it’s a shame because they’re missing out on a beautiful conversation about how we can imagine ourselves out of the rigid boundaries and boxes we’ve placed ourselves and each other in via @mocutobi 10. why not just say we need to go back to practicing our own cultures and primarily being around members of our own culture.

Kluwe was held in the city jail for around four hours before being released and charged with disrupting an assembly. \n\nThe ex-Minnesota Viking - who describes himself as a 'troublemaker extraordinaire' on Bluesky - has since urged elected officials to join him in his 'peaceful civil disobedience.'\n\nFormer NFL star punter Chris Kluwe was dragged out of California council meeting by police after comparing Donald Trump's MAGA supporters to Nazis\n\nThe 43-year-old has since urged elected officials to copy his 'civil disobedience'\n\n'I want our elected democratic officials to start engaging in civil disobedience,' he said in an interview with the Daily Pilot Wednesday. \n\n'People need to be aware that what's going on with this administration is leading us down a really dark path. Right now, no one is willing to step up and do that. So, if I want to ask them to do it, then I have to be willing to do it too.' \n\nAlthough Kluwe praised the Huntington Beach Police Department for their handling of the situation, he launched another vitriolic attack on the city council, accusing them of being unpatriotic. \n\n'People are speaking out because that's the American thing to do,' he told the outlet. 'You're a public citizen, your voice should be heard. But it's very disheartening when your elected officials are not listening to your voice \n\n'[...] It is profoundly un-American to do what this council is doing, and I think there are a lot of people in this community that get that. At a very visceral level, what we are seeing is not how America is supposed to work.' \n\nWhile Kluwe had no issue with the plaque, which was approved by the council unanimously as he addressed them, he simply could not accept the use of Trump's catchphrase on it.\n\nHe told the council that MAGA stands for everything from 'trying to erase trans people from existence,' 're-segregation and racism,' 'censorship and book bans' to 'firing air traffic controllers while planes are crashing.'\n\nHe also said that they were for firing nuclear arsenal overseers and firing military veterans and cuts to education.\n\nThe former punter played for several teams until retiring in 2013, making a name for himself for championing same sex marriage and being outspoken against religion\n\nThe punter and video game aficionado - who describes himself as a 'troublemaker extraordinaire' on Bluesky - spoke at the Huntington Beach council meeting against a plaque in front of the city library\n\nThe plaque also uses slogans made famous by Barack Obama: 'Through hope and change our nation has built back better to the golden era of Making America Great Again!'\n\nKluwe spouted that the movement was 'corrupt, unmistakably antidemocracy, and, most importantly, MAGA is explicitly a Nazi movement.'\n\nHe finished saying: 'You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that is what it is.'\n\nThe ex-Minnesota Viking then claimed he was to 'engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience' and stepped a few feet forward toward the council.\n\nHe was then quickly arrested and dragged out by multiple police officers, according to the OC Register.\n\nKamala Harris defeated Trump in the 2024 election in the Orange County city by about two points, though victorious Senator Adam Schiff lost the city to former baseball player Steve Garvey.\n\nDuring his NFL days over a decade ago, Kluwe was already making the headlines for his political views.\n\nKluwe has said he is ‘pretty confident’ that he was cut from the team last May for being an out-spoken advocate for same-sex marriage.\n\nKluwe has also accused former Vikings special teams co-ordinator Mike Priefer - who was recently hired to Bill Belichick's University of North Carolina staff - of being a bigot who repeatedly used homophobic language in front him and told him he would ‘wind up burning in hell with the gays.’\n\nThe ex-Minnesota Viking then claimed he was 'engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience' and stepped a few feet forward toward the council. He was then quickly arrested and dragged out by multiple police officers\n\nThe player, whose playing stats were above average, believes his problems began in the fall of 2012 when he started to speak out against the Minnesota Gay Marriage Amendment which attempted to have marriage defined as ‘only a union of one man and one woman.’\n\nAlong with a group called Minnesotans for Marriage Equality, Kluwe helped have the amendment voted down. Same-sex marriage is now legal in Minnesota, but Kluwe says he lost his career because of his beliefs.\n\nHe has written a scathing account of his final months at the Vikings in an article posted to Deadspin entitled I Was An NFL Player Until I Was Fired By Two Cowards And A Bigot. \n\nThe Vikings have previously denied cutting Kluwe for off-field reasons. Last June, Priefer refused to go into specifics about Kluwe’s release, but said he felt 'very strongly' that the Vikings needed to part ways with the punter.\n\n'It was more consistency and productivity,' Priefer said in a response to a question about what factors, statistical or otherwise, contributed to the decision.\n\nAsked if Kluwe could have improved his production, Priefer said simply, 'I just felt like we needed to make a change there.'\n\nKluwe did make the point that team owner Zygi Wilf had voiced his support for Kluwe’s public stance.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nChris Kluwe issues plea to elected officials after being arrested over explosive anti-MAGA rant\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Kluwe, 43, who retired in 2013, was dragged out of the Huntington Beach council meeting Tuesday night following a rant in which he compared Donald Trump 's MAGA supporters to Nazis.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14417449/Chris-Kluwe-nfl-plea-elected-officials-arrested-MAGA-rant.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/20/15/95391821-0-image-m-17_1740064016053.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 15:13:33","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":292577430,"title":"White House will celebrate Black History Month as some government agencies skip after anti-DEI order","text":"By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration will celebrate Black History Month at the White House on Thursday, preserving a tradition at the same time that President Donald Trump’s executive order ending the federal government’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs has disrupted its observance elsewhere.\n\nThe ceremony comes as Trump has called DEI programs “discrimination” and pushed to eradicate diversity programs from the government, directed that DEI workers eventually be laid off and exerted similar pressure on the private sector to shift to an exclusive focus on merit.\n\nThe sweeping effort has sown discord and confusion across federal agencies, which have variously interpreted the order to limit how they can acknowledge race in history and culture or report demographic data on race and gender.\n\nJoining Trump at the East Room event will be Black political figures and activists who have been his vocal supporters. The guests, according to a White House official, include Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina; Republican Rep. John James of Michigan; prison reform advocate Alice Johnson, whom he pardoned in 2020; Alveda King, a niece of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.; and Herschel Walker, the football legend who is Trump’s choice as U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas.\n\nOther guests will include figures from sports and entertainment, including former ESPN host Sage Steele; former NFL player Jack Brewer; and rap stars Kodak Black, Lil Boosie and Rod Wave, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to be held last week but was postponed due to inclement weather.\n\nIn the wake of his executive order, the Defense Department issued guidance declaring “identity months dead” and said that working hours would no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months such as Black History Month, Women’s History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month.\n\nThat seemed to clash with a National Black History Month proclamation signed the same day by Trump, which called for “public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.”\n\nWhile the White House has issued its position, agencies of the government have discretion on whether to continue to recognize Black History Month, according to the official.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that his department “will no longer participate in celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances.” And in a diplomatic cable, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agency’s removal of DEI policies would dovetail with “eliminating our focus on political and cultural causes that are divisive at home and deeply unpopular abroad.”\n\nThe administration has issued a deadline to schools and universities to eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal money. Major corporations have backtracked on DEI policies in hiring, promotion and workplace culture in recent months, with many citing potential legal challenges from the administration.\n\nBlack History Month has been recognized by every U.S. president since 1976, including Trump during his first term.\n\n“Black History is American history. And similar to the story of our nation, it is a story of strength, resilience, and dogged perseverance,” said CJ Pearson, a national co-chair of the Republican National Committee’s youth advisory council. Pearson, who is Black, has been an outspoken defender of Trump against Black civic leaders, civil rights advocates and Democrats who lambast the president as racist.\n\n“President Trump’s anti-DEI policies aren’t promoting racism but what they are doing is manifesting the dream of the great Martin Luther King, Jr.: a nation where one isn’t judged by the color of their skin but instead by the content of their character,” said Pearson, who will attend the White House event.\n\nOther Black Republicans aren’t so sanguine about the administration’s current course or what it portends for the GOP’s nascent inroads with Black voters or other communities of color.\n\n“Trump can build upon the coalition he pulled together in November with Blacks and Asians and Hispanics and young folks,” said Raynard Jackson, a Republican strategist. “But if they leave it the way it stands right now, Trump is going to destroy the very coalition he so marvelously brought to the table in November.”\n\nTo Jackson, DEI is a catch-all for liberal policies that are “unrecognizable” from the original intent of civil rights laws meant to promote the social and economic progress of Black Americans. But in removing and denigrating the policies, Jackson said, the White House risked being labeled as discriminatory by offering no alternative framework for how disadvantaged communities can get ahead.\n\n“How do you have diversity without it being a mandated bean-counting situation?” Jackson asked. “They’ve done a masterful job at telling me what they’re against. I’m waiting to hear what they’re for.”\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump tried to reach Black voters through in-person events in Atlanta, Chicago and New York. His campaign courted Black celebrities and media personalities to boost his message. Trump’s Black conservative allies, including Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., conducted roundtables at Black barbershops and bus tours through majority-Black cities.\n\nBut Trump also frequently denigrated Black communities in his pitch and made claims that pitted voters of color against immigrants, who he said were taking “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs.”\n\nThe efforts to boost support among Black voters seemed to have some success. He won a larger share of Black voters than he did in 2020, particularly among young Black men, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.\n\nOverall, about 16% of Black voters supported Trump in November, while about 8 in 10 voted for Democrat Kamala Harris. But that represented an improvement for Trump from 2020, when only 8% of Black voters backed him and about 9 in 10 went for Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nPrice reported from New York.","summary":"The Trump administration plans to celebrate Black History Month with a reception at the White House.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/02/20/black-history-month-trump/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/APTOPIX_Trump_00604.jpg?w=1024&h=686","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 14:58:26","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.019},{"id":292572522,"title":"Michelle Obama and Kamala Harris Slammed By TV Host For ‘Lying’ To Americans","text":"Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama are getting called out for allegedly ‘lying’ to American voters. The Democrats were both adamant that Donald Trump’s illegalizing abortion across all states would affect IVF access.\n\nA news show host is now calling out the two women after the President signed a law to expand access to IVF. Kamala Harris had previously mocked the Republican for calling himself the “father of IVF.” Harris shared how she found Donald Trump’s statement to be “quite bizarre.”\n\n“He should take responsibility for the fact that 1 in 3 women in America lives in a Trump’s abortion ban state,” she noted. The former Vice-President also asked the Republican to take responsibility for disappointing the couple working “towards growing a family.”\n\nShe pointed out how the Trump administration’s decisions have put IVF treatments “at risk.” Harris also alleged that Trump’s actions have been “very harmful” to American women and families.\n\nMichelle Obama who campaigned for Harris also emphasized getting “the election right.” She appealed to the voters while adding, “Your wife, your daughter, your mother, we as women, will become collateral damage to your rage.”\n\nAnother one of Harris’ campaign news releases noted how Trump’s claims of being the “father of IVF” is an “example of exactly why women don’t trust him.”\n\nGabriella Power, who serves as a host at Sky News, called out Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama for allegedly misleading the voters during the elections. She noted how the two were “lying” and driving “fear” into the people’s hearts.\n\nPower recalled how Michelle Obama had claimed that Trump would “take away” women’s freedom to “become a mother through IVF.” Power quipped at Harris and Obama while adding that the law Trump signed “must come as a shock” to them.\n\nThe news show host’s attacks on the Democrats come after the President signed an executive order aimed at making IVF treatments more accessible. Trump has previously shared that if he were to get elected he would make IVF treatment accessible. He had claimed that he would see to it that either the government or insurance would pay for the treatment.\n\n“How confusing for the women on the left in America who might have noticed by now, their rights have not been taken away,” Gabriella Power added sarcastically as an attack towards the Democrats.

First, no one elected anyone at PBS as they punish any limit on government. Second, an unelected billionaire named Laurene Powell Jobs owns The Atlantic, which completed a friendly takeover of the “Washington Week” show in August 2023.\n\nJobs, one of Kamala Harris’ biggest bankrollers and confidantes, isn’t alone. David Rubenstein has bought himself several chat shows on PBS. As long as you’re a progressive billionaire, no one in “public” broadcasting objects—and nobody inside their bubble cares about conservative taxpayers if and when they object to funding this ideological boondoggle.\n\nMaxwell Tani at Semafor reported Jobs recently hosted a Democrat strategy session at the Washington, D.C., headquarters of her Emerson Collective. He began: “After months of licking their wounds and reflecting on how they lost the internet, Democratic strategists and politically-aligned digital creators are privately planning their next steps.”\n\nHow interesting it is that an unelected billionaire who bought a show on PBS is right at the center of “fixing” Democrat Party messaging. PBS and the Democrats are hand in glove.\n\nTani added, “The summit was also an opportunity to connect several of the party’s prominent financial supporters with some of the liberal media organizations that are positioning themselves as vessels to help liberals regain digital ground they’ve lost to the right in recent years.”\n\nMusk even drew a mention in Tani’s dispatch: “The initial shock of the presidential loss has been heightened by other frustrations among Democrats at their party’s superficially slow and unsatisfying response to Trump and Musk’s shock-and awe-changes to the federal government.”\n\nUnlike the infamous Elon, you can’t really find much mention on PBS for Laurene Powell Jobs in this decade. On the Jan. 19, 2024, “PBS News Hour,” David Brooks mentioned he wrote opinions for wealthy owners of The Atlantic and The New York Times. Jonathan Capehart noted he writes for the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post.\n\nThe leftist take on billionaires came as PBS lamented the Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun were insufficiently liberal. Capehart explained, “What the Post, the Times and The Atlantic have in common is that they are mission-driven. And it seems to me that The Baltimore Sun and The L.A. Times … that the owners are status-driven. And when you have mission-driven owners, they let the journalists do the journalism.”\n\nThat’s odd. If anyone thinks journalists like Capehart aren’t “status-driven,” they haven’t seen them on the Washington, D.C., social scene, energetically circling to get a mention on the Politico Playbook or other gossip columns.\n\nHence, the natural order of things is that billionaires buy media properties and let the unelected left-wing journalists dictate what they want the “news” to be, which is whatever helps Democrats “regain ground” in the opinion battles.\n\nThis is the nature of what they call “the swamp.” If you get along and go along with the progressives, you can be a respectable citizen. Try to reduce the swamp and you’re an ignorant troglodyte pushing “cruelty and death.”\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

From October-December, the economy saw slower-than-expected growth and upticks in consumer spending. The Post held Trump’s tariff threat liable for declining business investment while outlets like Reuters and The Times suggested it was to blame for spikes in household spending, which the outlets characterized as a surge in preemptive purchases to offset the effects of expected tariffs on imports.\n\nThis was despite the fact that Q4 data includes a period before anyone even knew Trump was going to win the 2024 election. \n\nMRC Business consulted with experts to conduct an economic analysis on public polling trends and correlate them with the trajectory of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) to assess whether there was any credence to the media narrative on Trump tariff fears having anything to do with Q4 GDP numbers.\n\nAmericans writ large have generally expressed disinterest in taking preliminary actions against the possibility of tariffs. A December 2024 Ipsos poll found that while a majority of Americans believed that tariffs overall raise prices, only 25 percent stated that they’re “stocking up more on items [they] think will cost more if the U.S. enacts tariffs on imports.” \n\nBasically, whether the media try tying tariff fears to declining business investment or desperate households spending to get ahead of the impending doom of Trump tariffs, the short answer to the question of whether the fears are significantly relevant to Q4 GDP was a resounding “No.” \n\n(Source: RealClearPolitics)\n\nUsing RealClearPolitics data in the above chart, we considered the approval ratings of both then-President Joe Biden and then-candidate Donald Trump between November 2023 and November 2024. \n\nThe historical trend shows that Trump held a narrow lead over then-President Biden between November 5, 2023, and July 21, 2024, when Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nAt that inflection point, Trump’s approval ratings began to sharply diverge with Vice President Kamala Harris after August 4, 2024. Registered voters were convinced between the beginning of August 2024 and the end of the last election, that then-candidate Trump would go on to win the 2024 Presidential election. \n\nThis meant that, if Trump’s threat of tariffs was going to have any effect on the electorate, it would have plausibly happened months before Q4 began in October. PCE increased on average by 0.24 percent per month. What’s even more interesting, is that for the period beginning the month after Biden dropped out, PCE grew by nearly the same amount, 0.25 percent per month.\n\nWhen analyzing Real PCE, there was no noticeable, dramatic incremental change in trajectory in either a positive or negative direction (aside from the steady rise) as a result of shifting polling data pointing toward a Trump victory (See Chart II below).\n\n(Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve)\n\nThe implication was that despite Vice President Kamala Harris’s much-celebrated entrance into the 2024 race by the media, the rate of real personal consumption expenditures remained unchanged. \n\nThis directly contradicts what those in the media would have you believe. Namely, that Trump’s economic policies, such as his tariffs, the possibility of political gridlock in regard to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and continued inflation, would plunge the U.S. into yet another economic downturn and leave American households worse off than before.\n\nThe elevated levels of spending, as previous analyses have shown, was more credibly attributed to record explosions in credit card debt. In November, 2023, CNBC analyzed that the increases in consumer expenditures constituted “doom spending” as a coping mechanism to deal with the increasingly insurmountable high cost of living, even if it is detrimental to them. \n\nThat sentiment carried nearly a year later into November 2024, as Intuit concluded in an October 31, 2024 study released just before the presidential election.\n\nABC News reported on February 13, 2025 that total household debt (credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc.) hit a new all-time high of $18.04 trillion.\n\nIn February 2024, Heritage Foundation economists EJ Antoni and Peter St. Onge reported that “[m]illions of young Americans seem to have given up on their economic future, turning instead to ‘doom spending.’” \n\nRather than save up for a house, to start a family or for retirement, according to the authors, “which [young Americans] view as fruitless—they’re spending more than they earn without a plan to get ahead.” \n\nIn essence, it is more plausible to view the consumer spending increase in Q4 as the continuation of an ongoing trend of self-inflicted debt bombing due to rising costs than a sudden explosion of fear surrounding impending tariffs. \n\nWhile the prevailing media narrative would have readers believe that households increased spending to avoid potentially higher priced goods as a result of a potential second term of Trump, the reality is starkly different.

Following the former VP’s episode last year, the current president accused CBS of “doctoring” it, leading to a $20 billion lawsuit against the network. Now, the lawyers of CBS made it clear that they intend to demand Trump’s personal financials should he proceed with the suit.\n\nThe CBS lawyers filed a joint proposed scheduling order on February 19 in the Northern District of Texas Amarillo Division.\n“Defendants believe discovery is needed into President Trump’s personal financials, as well as the financials of Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign organizations and of Trump Media & Technology Group, including with respect to Truth Social and the $TRUMP meme crypto project.”\n\nTrump and Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson filed the initial lawsuit with this division, suing CBS for Kamala Harris’s 60-minutes interview. In addition to demanding the president’s finances, the network’s legal team also believes that “discovery will be needed into President Trump’s legal relationship.” In the scheduling order, CBS mentioned that his 2024 presidential campaign and Trump Media & Technology group would be looked into if the lawsuit proceeds to the discovery phase.\n\nFor the unversed, the beginning of the Trump vs CBS lawsuit stems from an interview Kamala Harris had with the network back in October 2024. The president was especially unhappy with two clips from the 60-minutes interview, where the former vice president is seen responding to a question about the Israel-Hamas war in the Middle East.\n\nIn his lawsuit, the president and his legal team accused the network of “editing” Harris’ statement in order to make her look “more appealing” to the voters. The suit insists that CBS was seeking some extra profit from “manufactured enthusiasm for Harris.” \n\nIn a new filing related to Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News, lawyers for CBS laid the groundwork to seek a broad range of records in discovery – including those related to Trump’s personal finances and those of Truth Social and his $TRUMP crypto project. pic.twitter.com/Rq4qVFBDGj\n— David Enrich (@davidenrich) February 19, 2025\n\nIn addition, Trump’s suit claims that the interview footage was “doctored” in order to prevent “One of Harris’ most embarrassing weaknesses.”\n\nFurther clarifying, the lawsuit mentioned that she had a “habit of uttering ‘word salads,'” which basically means exceptionally incoherent speech. Trump’s side claims that this trait of hers even drew disapproval from her own democratic peers.\n\nThe president was not happy with Kamala’s 60-minutes interview, and he made it very clear in the suit, calling it “unethical and unlawful.” He insisted that it was an attempt to “sabotage a Republican presidential candidate” while furthering Democrats’ agenda for the 2024 election.\n\nNotably, Trump amended his complaint earlier this month. He claimed “unfair competition” while also naming Rep. Jackson as his co-plaintiff. His legal team said that by editing Kamala’s interview, CBS ultimately violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA).\n\nJudge denies CBS motion to dismiss Trump’s ‘60 Minutes’ lawsuit as he demands $10 Billion more. pic.twitter.com/LHwJfF6o1V\n— Rochellemaryn 🌹🕊️ (@RochelleAz) February 12, 2025\n\nEarlier, the network’s lawyers claimed that the president was just “judge shopping” when choosing Texas, as CBS is based in New York, while he himself lives in Florida. After the channel’s side filed a motion to dismiss his lawsuit, Trump added Jackson as a counter-attack.\nCBS’ side also noted in the motion that his original complaint “over and over admits that it challenges editorial decision-making, not commercial speech or advertising.”\n\n“There can be no serious argument that President Trump’s claim arises out of commercial speech, as required for a viable DTPA claim. For this reason alone, the action fails,” the network’s legal team argued in motion earlier this month.\n\nOn Tuesday, CBS’ lawyers declared that discovery would likely be needed for many issues regarding Donald Trump’s lawsuit and his allegations against the channel.","summary":"CBS' legal team emphasizes that discovery will be needed if Donald Trump decides to proceed with his lawsuit over Kamala Harris' 60-minutes interview.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-lands-in-trouble-after-lawsuit-against-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kamala-Harris-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 13:26:49","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":292549422,"title":"It took Donald Trump less than a decade to turn the US toward Putin’s Russia","text":"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

The US President – today dubbed Putin's poodle – claimed a global conflict would have been sparked had rival Kamala Harris been elected. It comes after the Orange Manbaby tried to re-write history by claiming Ukraine had started the war with Russia rather than Mad Vlad's military invasion in 2022. And while his comments caused outrage around the world, he was praised by Kremlin mouthpieces for U-turning US foreign policy. Addressing a crowd in Miami, Trump said: “Around the world, I’m moving quickly to end wars, settle conflicts and restore the planet to peace. “And take a look at the death in the Middle East, and the death that’s taking place between Russia and Ukraine that’s been going on, and we’re going to end it.

You could have made a deal.\" The former Apprentice host then went on to launch a scathing attack on Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy branding him a \"dictator\" who refuses to have elections. His comments earnt praise from Russia, a country which has not had a free or fair election since Putin become President in 2000. Key Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev said Trump \"is 200 percent right\" and branded Zelenskyy a \"bankrupt clown.\" He wrote on social media: \"If you'd told me just three months ago that these were the words of the US president, I would have laughed out loud.\" Russia's ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin told the BBC: \"For the first time we have noticed that they are not simply saying that this is Russian propaganda and disinformation.

Sciutto approvingly quoted a post by David Frum noting that at least Chamberlain never parroted Nazi propaganda. Sciutto then observed: \"Trump is amplifying the Kremlin propaganda here.\"\n\nSciutto pulled the 9/11 redux alarm in response to a statement by panelist Edward-Isaac Dovere, a CNN reporter, that \"foreign policy is not usually the kind of thing that voters, or Americans, pay deep, deep attention to.\"\n\nResponded Sciutto:\n\n\"Listen: they don't pay attention until it affects their lives, right? You know, I mean, look at 9/11 as an example, right? We don't have to worry about what's happening in that part of the world. Of course, it came to touch, touch Americans' lives, sadly.\"\n\nAsk yourself: What was CNN doing to warn us of 9/11 before it happened? Or the Clinton administration? But by all means, CNN, suggesting your audience are a bunch of rubes. \n\nMolly Ball of the Wall Street Journal, without necessarily subscribing to the notion, reported that some Republicans have explained Trump's statements on Russia and Ukraine as a means of demonstrating that he can be an honest broker in the negotiations, thereby making a successful outcome more likely.\n\nMeanwhile, for the second time during his current run as fill-in host on the show, Sciutto had on Joe Walsh as his supposed \"Republican\" on the panel. Sciutto kicked off the panel's discussion of Ukraine by asking Walsh what Trump's comments on Ukraine mean \"for your party.\"\n\nWalsh is the kind of Republican who attended the 2024 Democrat National Convention as a \"Republican for Kamala Harris.\" In this interview at the convention, a reporter described Walsh's political history:\n\n\"You went from Tea Party congressman to being a firebrand conservative radio host, not unlike the Sean Hannitys or Tucker Carlsons of the world. What happened when you decided to take a stand against Trump? Because you are about as anti-Trump as any Republican--anybody, Republican or not.\"\n\nResponded Walsh: \"It's absolutely crazy. Ten twelve years ago, I'm saying the worst things in the world about Barack Obama. Last night, I'm agreeing with ever single word he said.\"\n\nWalsh also portrayed himself to the reporter as a brave, death-defying hero:\n\n\"When you are an anti-Trump Republican, you put your life in danger.\"\n\nWalsh never served in the military. Even so, perhaps Biden should have awarded him the Medal of Honor.\n\nWalsh is the kind of guy who got thrown out of the Chameleons Club for being too much of a . . . chameleon. For being too much of a disgrace to fellow lizards, the GEICO gecko wouldn't sell Walsh an insurance policy!\n\nHere's the transcript.\n\nCNN This Morning\n\nJIM SCIUTTO: David Frum tweeted a comment about Neville Chamberlain, of course infamous, right, for attempting to make a deal with Hitler, saying that even: \"Neville Chamberlain, to do him justice, never amplified under his own byline Hitler's propaganda against the Czechs.\"\n\nTrump is amplifying the Kremlin propaganda here.\n\nEDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE: This is a bigger question about what kind of world we're going to be coming into, perhaps. And look, there may be withdrawals. Let's see what it looks like if we do have Donald Trump try to withdraw troops from Europe or change what the situation is with the war in Ukraine. So it may be that logistically, and it may just be people confronting the idea that what does it mean when America doesn't stand with its allies anymore? What does it mean when America is saying, okay, if a powerful country invades another country, then the other country is the one that needs to give in, and how people process that. \n\nForeign policy is not usually the kind of thing that voters, or Americans, pay deep, deep attention to.

While she remains supportive of Donald Trump’s agenda, she said she’s wrestling with some of the implications.\n\n“A lot of people might agree or disagree with what he’s doing, but I would say that he’s done a lot of things very quickly,” she said. “I like that, as the president, he’s doing things he promised people, because that’s what people voted for.”\n\nBut she can’t quite square the effect of a lightning-fast change on immigration and tariffs with Trump’s pledge to her to lower prices. She’s still looking for answers there. “I mean, he’s the president now. He can work something out for us,” she said.\n\nTrump visited Zebulon, Georgia, in October to hold a “faith voters’ forum” at Christ church, an expansive local congregation here. “I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country,” he said then. “I really believe that. I think most of the people here do, too.”\n\nFour months later, on an overcast Sunday morning, construction workers Sam Whatley and Jeff Clay were waiting for their clothes to dry at a laundromat down the street from the church and about an hour south of Atlanta, far enough outside of the city’s ring of political moderation where Whatley’s “Let’s Go Brandon” trucker cap remains relevant.\n\nFor Kamala Harris voters, the headlines of the last few weeks reflect unfolding chaos. For Trump voters, it’s just Sunday morning.\n\n“He’s coming at everything just a whirlwind,” Clay said. “You don’t know what he’s going do next. I mean, he’s basically covered about everything he said he was going to do, or he’s trying, and I’m sure there’s more that could be done. He needs to drain the swamp up there at the Capitol.”\n\nWhatley doesn’t expect Trump to accomplish all of his campaign goals – “but he’s taking a sledgehammer to it”, he said. “He’s pretty much exposed things. That’s his main mission, I think. He knows he’s not going to get everything he wants to do, but he’s going to expose it all.”\n\nThe “department of government efficiency” group working for Elon Musk is facing court challenges for violating the law by directing agencies to fire federal employees, and facing questions of illegally accessing computer systems at several government agencies.\n\nIn the view of conservative voters around Zebulon like Whatley, Musk is simply a “good businessman” who should be trusted to do the work Trump has asked him to do.\n\n“They’re saying he’s not an elected official and he shouldn’t be doing what he’s doing,” Whatley said. “But, I mean, the Democrats done it too, but it was OK when the Democrats done it.” He likened Musk’s overarching influence over government policy to that of Anthony Fauci’s broad direction of the response to the pandemic.\n\nUp the street, Justin Raines, his wife Katie and two children were shopping at Freshway Market before the 11am service. His wife finds what’s happening in Washington frightening, he said. She said she doesn’t vote, though. Justin is still measuring.\n\n“Me personally, I don’t get into politics,” he said. “I mean, I just look at the good and the bad for whatever president. I’m kind of in between right now. He had a lot of ideas before the campaign took place. Don’t get me wrong, he still got a lot of good ideas. He just hasn’t put them in place yet. I mean, he’s going to be president for four years. You’ve got to give him a chance.”\n\nThe couple corralled their kids in the dairy isle and pointed out the high prices of milk, meat and eggs. “We’re in a supermarket,” he said. “As far as groceries, gas, cars, homes … I mean, people are struggling to pay for their homes … Lower prices. That was one of his big things that I paid attention to.”\n\nFor conservatives watching the Trump administration violate norms – and perhaps the law – as it fires government employees and folds government programs, the longterm goal of spending reduction is more important than the short-term pain inflicted on people they believe have been gaming the system.\n\n“I think he’s opening up something that shows the American people what needs to be done,” Clay said. He argued that inflation and government spending were connected, and that Musk’s budget slashing and firings – and Trump’s tariffs – would reverse consumer price increases.\n\n“I’d like to see some of the prices – especially food and stuff – come down,” Clay said. “And I think eventually, once he goes through there and gets some of the non-necessary spending that they’ve been doing, I think some of that will come down.”\n\nFrost suggested Trump could lean on food suppliers such as Sysco to lower prices for small businesses, or negotiate deals with other countries to counteract the effect of tariffs on Canada and Mexico. She said she understands that increasing enforcement on immigration may end up driving up prices.\n\nBut Frost is also the child of a legal Mexican immigrant.\n\n“My mom has done it the right way,” Frost said. “She has her paperwork and everything.” She said she wants Trump to create a program for undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for decades and “have done nothing bad”.\n\nThe prospect of this approach, given Trump’s public pledge of mass deportation, seems unlikely.\n\n“I mean, I understand that,” she said. “I understand there’s a process for different things, but it would be, you know, amazing.”","summary":"In Georgia, those who backed the president remain supportive – but they want prices to come down quickly \n\nEstefany Frost still gets calls from people who heard her talk to Donald Trump at a campaign stop in Georgia last year about how difficult running her restaurant had become in an era of inflation.\n\nOne month into the new administration, she and other conservatives here are still absorbing the whirlwind pace of change.

Since his inauguration, he has implemented sweeping change via swathes of executive orders, targeting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), immigration and most recently expanding access to in vitro fertilization.In a new poll by The Economist/YouGov on Wednesday, Trump's approval rating is 50 percent, with a 45 percent disapproval rating. The survey was taken February 16-18, polling over 1,600 U.S. adults, with a 3.3 percent margin of error. The new poll marked an improvement for Trump from the week before, when his approval rating hit 46 percent.According to YouGov, Trump's net approval rating is now higher at this time as compared to his first term.What To KnowTrump's first weeks in office have been filled with Cabinet nominations, domestic tragedies including wildfires in Los Angeles, and aviation disasters. Trump also managed to secure the safe arrival of Americans imprisoned overseas.Trump's Cabinet picks during his second term have faced fierce backlash but none more notable than Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Vice President JD Vance helped Hegseth, and ultimately Trump, by casting the tiebreaking vote in the Senate for Hegseth to secure nomination.President Trump's Cabinet choices during his first term, such as Ben Carson, Mike Pompeo and William Barr, held high positions throughout private and government sectors.The president has also made headlines this month by directing the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the Gulf of America, sparking pushback domestically and from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.The administration's first month in office during Trump's second term is highlighted by billionaire Elon Musk's role heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The department's directive is to cut government waste from the budget, and its wielding of the ax has triggered division with expansive cuts.DOGE announced its intent to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) but still maintain key personnel.During Trump's first term in office, he signed far fewer executive orders and stuck to his key campaign platforms, like pledging to build a wall along the southern border. He also vowed to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act, a landmark piece of legislation passed under former President Barack Obama.Trump's first month in office during his second term is also recently marked by his fierce criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and apparent cooperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During a news conference this week, Trump falsely claimed Ukraine started the war with Russia. Russia annexed parts of Ukraine in 2014 and launched a military invasion against its neighbor on February 24, 2022, nearly three years ago. Trump has also been critical of aid sent to Ukraine under the Biden administration, questioning whether other countries have stepped up.What People Are SayingUniversity of Kentucky political science professor D. Stephen Voss told Newsweek via email: \"Trump has assembled a Cabinet of outsiders this time around, with little regard for political or governmental experience. Yet Senate Republicans have decided to roll the dice on the President's team of novices.\"Voss continued: \"Trump learned from his first presidency how important it is for presidents to hit the ground running. During Trump's first term, he scoffed at the importance of making major policy changes in the first hundred days of an administration, then faced the second half of his term frustrated by congressional Democrats. This time around, Trump clearly realizes the importance of exploiting the honeymoon period to change policy as much as he can. Trump's early executive actions have mandated an unprecedented level of policy change. Even if Trump ends up losing a string a court cases challenging his executive actions, he'll have made deep and lasting alterations in federal policy, because some of the changes Trump is catalyzing will be hard to reverse.\"Political analyst Craig Agranoff told Newsweek via text on Wednesday: \"Trump's first month in office this time around is markedly different from his first term. Four years ago, he entered Washington as an outsider, disrupting the traditional political landscape with a flurry of executive orders and high-profile policy moves. This time, he's returning with experience, a clearer understanding of how the system works, and a more determined approach to advancing his agenda.\"Agranoff added: \"However, he also faces a more polarized political climate, legal challenges, and a Congress that may not always align with his priorities. The key question is whether he can translate his momentum into lasting policy achievements or if external pressures will slow his administration's effectiveness.\"Dillard University professor Robert Collins to Newsweek via text on Wednesday: \"Trump 2.0 is totally different than Trump 1.0. He really didn't understand how Washington worked in his first term so he hired a lot of experienced Washington veterans. Now, Trump feels that he understands how Washington works, so he's avoiding hiring those people.\"Trump 2.0 is all about moving fast and breaking things. He's moving as quickly as he can during the honeymoon period to remake the government in his image, because he understands that once popular opinion begins to move against him, he will start losing Republican members of Congress in swing states, because they will be worried about their midterm elections. So he has a very short period of time to complete his agenda,\" Collins said.What Happens NextTrump's first 100 days in office will continue to unfold.","summary":"President Donald Trump has been in office for a month and the comparisons to his first term are notable, analysts say.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-first-month-office-compared-first-term-2033018","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2591629/donald-trumps-first-month-office.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 12:00:01","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.33},{"id":292510754,"title":"Robert De Niro's love life from two marriages to two sets of twins and fatherhood at 79","text":"Robert De Niro, a celebrated cinema actor for decades, has made a rare move to the small screen with a new Netflix thriller.\n\nIn the six-part limited series Zero Day, the renowned Goodfellas star plays George Mullen, a respected former president investigating cyberterrorism while battling his personal demons.\n\nThe gripping drama also features a stellar cast of A-listers and award-winners, including Jesse Plemons, Lizzy Caplan, Connie Britton, and Matthew Modine.\n\nAs De Niro takes the lead in his first Netflix series, fans are keen to learn more about his off-screen life.\n\nTwo marriages\n\nDe Niro has been married twice in his career, first in 1976 to actress Diahnne Abbott, with whom he had several collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. He adopted her daughter, Drena, from a previous relationship, but they divorced in 1988.\n\nHe later married actress Grace Hightower in 1997. They separated for several years in 1999, but renewed their vows in 2004.\n\n Ten years later, they moved into a 6,000-square-foot apartment in Central Park West, New York. However, after another four years, they separated after 20 years of marriage, reports the Mirror US. \n\nSeven children\n\nThe legendary Taxi Driver actor, Robert De Niro, has embraced fatherhood, first adopting Abbott's daughter Drena and recently becoming one of the oldest new dads in the spotlight at the age of 79.\n\nHe and Abbott also welcomed their son Raphael in 1976.\n\nBetween his two marriages, De Niro had a relationship with model Toukie Smith from 1988 to 1996, during which they had twin boys, Julian and Aaron, through IVF and a surrogate mother in 1995. With his second wife Hightower, he welcomed son Elliott in 1998 and later their daughter Helen via surrogate in 2011.\n\nHis latest addition to the family is baby Gia, born in 2023 to his current partner, martial arts instructor Tiffany Chen.\n\nHealth scare\n\nDe Niro faced a health scare when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2003 at 60 years old. After surgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in December that year, he made a full recovery.\n\nThe American Cancer Society shared that De Niro found the diagnosis \"a little jarring\" but focused on staying strong and making informed decisions, crediting \"regular check-ups\" for catching the disease early.\n\nCriticism of Donald Trump\n\nA vocal Democrat, De Niro has not shied away from political commentary, supporting President Joe Biden's re-election bid in 2024. When Biden stepped aside, De Niro threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign.\n\nHe has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, famously saying \"f*** 'em\" to dissenters in a CNN interview where he stated Trump \"should not be president\" and called him a \"gangster\".\n\nLast year, he labelled Trump a \"jerk\", \"clown\", and \"idiot\" on Who's Talking to Chris Wallace? on Max before his November re-election.\n\nYet, in a recent Guardian interview, De Niro shared that he's \"not despairing\" over Trump's potential second term. \"Because I always look at the bright side,\" he said, \"and hope that things will right themselves and that people will appreciate goodness and empathy and will try to do the right thing.\n\n\"Some people look at [things] differently. They have different values. That's disturbing to me. I don't understand it. But I just have to look at things in an optimistic way.\"\n\nFamily tragedy\n\nFamily tragedy struck De Niro in July 2023 when his grandson Leandro De Niro Rodriguez, only 19, passed away. Leandro was the son of De Niro's adopted daughter, Drena.\n\nHis death was attributed to a lethal mix of fentanyl, cocaine, and other substances. Speaking to PEOPLE, De Niro expressed his shock: \"It's just a shock. [I] never thought it would happen.\n\n\"And I just then started thinking about all the things I could have, should have done maybe with him. I don't know if that would've made a difference. And so that's always playing through my mind.\"\n\nZero Day is available to stream on Netflix.","summary":"As Robert De Niro takes to Netflix for new series Zero Day, we take a look at the Hollywood star's life away from the cameras with seven children and two marriages","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/robert-de-niro-life-children-34715865","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34716278.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Robert-De-Niro-4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 11:59:36","author":"Lucas Hill-Paul","authors":["Lucas Hill-Paul"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.234},{"id":292512278,"title":"When politics seep into schools, learning becomes harder and kids look for comfort","text":"Our youth have become invisible in the eyes of far too many adults. \n\nDo we bother to ask them how they feel about the state of the world, the country and their own personal lives? In the past, there were public service announcements like, “It’s 10:00 p.m. Do you know where your children are?” for parents. “Stay alert and stay safe,” reminded children not to talk to strangers. Smokey the Bear told us, “Only you can prevent forest fires.”\n\nToday, if we asked our youth to create their own PSA, what would they say are the issues that concern them the most? Is it their safety? The uncertainty of wars? Is it the political divide in our country? The pervasive use of drugs, including fentanyl?\n\nWhat we do know is that far too many of them are struggling with mental health challenges. In 2023, more than 5.3 million adolescents aged 12-17 had a current diagnosed mental or behavioral health condition, which includes anxiety, depression or behavior/conduct problems, according to data from the National Library of Medicine. The numbers aren’t getting better: From 2016 to 2023, there was a 35% increase in mental or behavioral health conditions. \n\nRegardless of one’s political views, common concern for our youth should unite us. Just recently, I talked to my staff about deportation. I started my conversation off with the following statement: “It does not matter if you voted for President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. We have to make certain we meet the needs of all of our students.” \n\nEducators and other service providers who work with young people are now in the middle of the politics in our country. They want to make sure they follow the law. Sometimes they are not certain what to say, how to support our children, how to feel and what is appropriate to say. Yet, our youth need educators to reassure them, build up their self-confidence and help make them feel better when dealing with difficult situations.\n\nNo blueprint for kids, teachers\n\nYou only have to be in a classroom for a short while to see the tremendous role that educators play in comforting our youth and providing guidance to those dealing with life-changing events. You may hear, as I have heard, a student mistakenly call their teacher, “mom” or “mama,” further illustrating how influential and important teachers are in developing and nurturing the hearts and minds of our youth.\n\nBecause of our influence, we as educators need to be asking tough questions. I ask those who supported either candidate for president: What is appropriate to say to our youth who ask political questions? How do they stay apolitical during such political times? \n\nClearly, there is no blueprint and no script to help educators anticipate the complex questions that arise from the hearts and minds of our youth. What we do know is that without the proper guidance and feedback, our youth will find unhealthy ways to deal with issues they are struggling with. \n\nI recall talking to a fellow administrator about the number of students she, along with her staff, had to deal with because of vaping in school. She said, “Dr. McNair, they are vaping because they are self-medicating.” In other words, they are finding ways to cope with life. In 2024, 1.63 million students used e-cigarettes, according to data from the Centers for Disease, Control and Prevention. Many of them have probably tried to quit in the past.\n\nSchools are on the front lines of all the acrimony and division in our politics. We can only hope that it gets better. In the meantime, our youth deserve to walk into a school that is nurturing, warm and provides a culture of support — not be overwhelmed and burdened with politics. Simply put, “Let our youth learn.”\n\nPerhaps that statement would be a good public service announcement that could help educators teach, administrators manage and students learn. We must not let politics keep our youth from learning. That will not help our nation compete in the 21st century.\n\nJerald McNair has a doctorate degree in education and a graduate degree in public policy.

The real Silicon Valley, although self-interested as ever, remains liberal to the core, a reality emphatically reinforced by the 2024 November elections. Silicon Valley, the informal region at the south end of the San Francisco Bay, is recognized universally as the preeminent center of technological innovation and profit. The silicon appellation comes from the 1970s rise of silicon-based semiconductor manufacturing, and the \"valley\" — stretching south to Santa Cruz and north to San Francisco — remains the global leader in chip design, social media, internet and digital financial services, smartphones and now, artificial intelligence. Silicon Valley’s tech ecosystem brings together hundreds of thousands of scientists and engineers, startup-backing venture capitalists, attorneys specializing in intellectual property and a host of other services that make it possible for anyone with a good idea, and many with less successful ones, to start a tech company and perhaps strike it rich. Silicon Valley billionaires and CEOs were in attendance at President Trump’s inauguration in person and as million-dollar donors, but the people who make Silicon Valley successful are more diverse and much more progressive. In a New York Times interview this month, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen attempted to portray the tech industry as embracing Donald Trump. The reality couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, Silicon Valley remains progressive on climate change and the environment, immigration, human rights, reproductive rights and social equity, and its residents vote overwhelmingly Democratic. In his interview, Andreessen seems to recognize that young tech professionals — the workhorses of Silicon Valley — reject Trump and the political inclinations of his billionaire supporters. He blames elite universities for “radicalizing” the workforce into “America-hating communists,” when in fact he is just complaining about the valley’s widespread support for thoughtful government regulation and equitable taxation. In seven of the most affluent Silicon Valley cities — Palo Alto, Los Altos Hills, Los Altos, Los Gatos, Portola Valley, Woodside and Atherton — combined, Kamala Harris won 76.2% of the vote, compared with 20.1% for Trump Indeed, Atherton, considered the wealthiest city in the U.S., voted for Harris 71% to Trump 27%. Atherton is where Andreessen listed his mansion in March for $33 million as he deserted Northern California for Malibu. Most elected officials in Silicon Valley are Democrats. The region's congressional delegation includes progressive champions Ro Khanna and Zoe Lofgren, who has pushed to tie CHIPS Act funding to labor and environmental standards. When tech titans Andreessen, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg align themselves with Trump's vision, it reveals at least as much about protecting their fortunes as it does any real political evolution in the Bay Area At a Stanford University conference last fall, Andreessen attacked the regulation of artificial intelligence. AI, the collection of technologies made famous by language models like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude, represents both immense opportunity and risk. Yet here was a billionaire investor, with massive stakes in more than 100 AI companies, smugly declaring that thoughtful oversight would \"kill innovation.” At the same time, as evidenced by union statements, workplace \"trust and safety\" reports and surveys of AI researchers, thousands of valley professionals support the ethical development of AI. Similarly, Andreessen attacked the Biden administration’s half-hearted attempts to regulate cryptocurrency speculation, charging that the Democrats were out to kill a powerful — but often rife with fraud — new industry supported by Trump. At the same time, his firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has more than 150 cryptocurrency-related companies in its portfolio. When he rails against \"debanking\" of crypto founders, isn’t he really complaining about basic consumer protection measures that might affect his portfolio's value? Andreessen looks back fondly to the 1990s and Democratic help in funding of the early development of the internet, from which he benefited personally and substantially. In fact, Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial capitalism would not have been possible without federal research money, product acquisition and antitrust enforcement. The transistor itself, invented at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey and basic to the tech revolution, was only available to Silicon Valley startups because of a 1956 antitrust consent decree between the federal government and AT&T. Now, however, tech oligarchs such as Andreessen expect Trump to free them from federal regulation, oversight and taxes. Andreessen is just one of a handful of tech leaders who have made a show of aligning themselves with Trump. While Elon Musk’s DOGE attempts to control federal agencies are now front and center, he has consistently opposed federal regulations that cost his businesses. For example, in November, after the Wall Street Journal documented regulation-defying pollution from Tesla’s plants in Texas and California, Musk co-authored an op-ed article in the newspaper proposing, among other things, that the government stop enforcing environmental rules. Zuckerberg has often spoken about Facebook's mission to connect people and build community. However, his decision to bow to Trump and replace fact-checking — censorship, Meta’s leaders, now call it — with crowdsourced moderation will likely amplify Facebook’s role in spreading misinformation, hate speech and other divisive content. Most researchers have found that using crowdsourcing to police falsehoods has mixed effects at best. Despite reported opposition from employees, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has also veered his company abruptly to the right in recent weeks by dropping its diversity goals and its 2018 pledge against applying AI technologies to weapons development or to use in surveillance. Tech CEOs and money men cozying up to the Trump administration have no shame about the the 180-degree contortions they have to perform to protect their investments. When Andreessen talks about the far-left \"radicalizing” Silicon Valley’s college-educated employees and blocking startups with safety regulations, he's really talking about his own far-right radicalization, and his resistance to the legitimate desire of tech workers and society at large to ensure that powerful new technologies serve the public good. Democrats have not abandoned Silicon Valley, and the valley hasn't abandoned the Democrats: Tech oligarchs’ Faustian bargain with Trump draws headlines today, but they are likely to learn that Trump has his own agenda.

Now there's a caucus for them","text":"On election day last year, a conversation with family members confirmed Suzette Martinez Valladares' hunch that Latino Republicans were about to shock California. “I swear they were socialists when they were, like, 20,” the Acton-based state senator said of her relatives while we ate lunch at a restaurant in Santa Ana. “But then [one of them] sent me a photo of voting for [Donald] Trump. I was like, ‘What is going on here? I never thought I would see this day.’” To Valladares' right was fellow GOP Latina Kate Sanchez, an Assembly member whose district stretches from Mission Viejo to Temecula. “He can’t afford to buy a house and is frustrated,” Valladares continued about her family member, whom she declined to identify because he's not publicly out as a Trump voter. “And I think a lot of Latino voters felt the same way. So I think it's a huge opening for Republicans in the state, and I think it's the beginning of a shift that I want to make sure we're jumping on.” The two are founders and co-chairs of the new California Hispanic Legislative Caucus, the latest attempt at an official group for Latino Republicans in the statehouse. It formed as a response to the 51-year-old Latino Legislative Caucus, a Sacramento powerhouse that has never admitted GOP members. “When you're not welcome at the table, you learn to build your own,” said Sanchez, 36. She’s quieter than Valladares and reels off political cliches that nevertheless land with conviction. “So I think it was a blessing. When we were reelected [last year], we were like, ‘The timing is now, and we’re doing it.’” Although Kamala Harris handily won the state, some of Trump's biggest gains over his 2020 run were in Latino-heavy counties in the Central Valley and L.A. County cities like Downey and Huntington Park. Valladares, who previously served as an Assembly member, won an open Senate seat. Meanwhile, Jeff Gonzalez and Leticia Castillo scored upsets in their Inland Empire Assembly races against Latino Democrats backed by the area’s long-standing political machine. Those wins pushed the number of Latino GOP legislators in Sacramento to nine, more than doubling the previous high of four, set two years ago. Latinos now make up nearly a third of Sacramento GOP legislators — a once-unthinkable scenario in a state where the party turned off Latino voters for a generation by pursuing a slew of xenophobic measures in the 1990s. It's a legacy that Sanchez and Valladares freely acknowledge that opponents will throw at them. “I think the Republican Party has probably missed a lot of those opportunities” in the past, said Sanchez, as Valladares nodded in agreement. “But we're going to be doing a great job.” “I think we've done a lot of work in the last decade,” added Valladares, 44, who is more plainspoken and sharper-tongued than her co-chair. “And those seeds that we planted have now grown.” The Hispanic GOP caucus is forming at a time when Democrats still hold a supermajority in both of the state’s legislative chambers, while the Republican Party nationally has soured on anything with even a hint of multiculturalism. Nevertheless, the two are confident they're onto something. “Sacramento doesn't know how to read the room,” Valladares said. “My race was supposed to have been super close. I was preparing to win by five votes, not five points.” “I want to say the elephant in the room,” Sanchez added. Trump had been a \"tough issue\" with Latino voters — but \"not so much anymore.\" Of the two, Sanchez had the more conventional conservative upbringing, growing up in Rancho Santa Margarita and Mission Viejo before attending a small Catholic college in Rhode Island. After working at a conservative think tank and as a staffer for Republican U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, Sanchez ran for an Assembly seat in 2022 against then-Temecula Mayor Matt Rahn. He finished first in the primary as the establishment favorite and had a sizeable cash advantage going into the general election. “I didn't quite fit the mold of what the party expected me to be like and look like,” Sanchez, who is of Italian and Mexican descent, said before smiling. “It’s the worst thing to tell a Latina.” She wore out three pairs of walking shoes to win a wealthy district where Latinos make up 22% of the population, calling her victory a “testament to a need, a momentum and openness to have a Hispanic female” in the seat. In the 2024 election, she crushed her Democratic opponent by 23 percentage points. Valladares grew up in Sylmar, “the most conservative” member in a working-class family where her father's Mexican American side leaned to the right while her maternal Puerto Rican relatives were “very progressive.” Morning drives to Sylmar High with an uncle introduced her to Rush Limbaugh. She didn't appreciate when a counselor insisted she should register as a Democrat because she was Latina. “I was represented by Democrats at every level, from city council to county supervisor,” Valladares said. “On Sundays, my park would be closed because of the gangs. I remember a bunch of my friends having kids when I was in 11th grade. So I’m like, ‘If we're represented by Democrats who are in total power, why is my community still suffering?’” In an alternative universe, Valladares nevertheless could have been a part of the fabled San Fernando Valley political machine that has placed Latinos from the region at every level of political office for the past 30 years, from school boards to the U.S. Senate seat occupied by Alex Padilla. Pioneering Valley politician Cindy Montañez helped Valladares with her college entrance essay, starting a friendship that lasted until Montañez's death in 2023. Valladares also volunteered on the unsuccessful 2001 L.A. City Council race of then-Assemblymember Tony Cárdenas, who later won election to the council and went on to represent the Pacoima area in Congress for 12 years. She described Cárdenas as a “great person” and felt the 2001 race was a “sad loss.” But her experience on the Democrat's campaign only solidified her choice to register as a Republican. “I didn't feel like they were addressing the economic issues of small-business owners like my dad,” Valladares said. “I feel like I gave in my younger life the Democrat Party every opportunity to convince me that they were supporting me. And they didn't.” I asked the two what Latino Democratic lawmakers in California don’t get about the political moment for Latinos right now. “There’s a hyper-focus on immigration,” said Sanchez, whose first husband was once undocumented. “Hispanics are so much more of the fabric of California than that one issue. And I think it's a disservice to everybody if all we focus on is that one issue.” Latino Legislative Caucus members would argue that they’ve worked on behalf of all working-class Californians, I pointed out. Valladares again brought up her Trumper relative. Last summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed an Assembly bill that would have made California residents without papers eligible for a state program that allows first-time home buyers to apply for up for $150,000 in no-interest loans. “[The relative] was so infuriated\" with the bill, the senator said. “He so wants to buy a house. Then this? That is probably what got him to vote for Trump.” Sanchez and Valladares support Trump’s call to deport whom the latter described as “the worst of the worst” but not a full-scale deportation of all unauthorized immigrants. They want to see immigration reform but argue it's a federal issue. Besides, they point out, the Latinos they talk to care more about “kitchen table” issues. It's a claim supported by years of polls revealing that immigration is of lower importance to Latinos than Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocacy groups would have the public believe. And enmity against illegal immigration among Latinos in California is higher than it has been in decades. “It's their wedge issue. It's their emotional issue,” Valladares said of Democrats. “And when you don't have voices that look like us giving an alternate perspective or opinion or policy fix, they dominate it.” She let a beat pass. “They're used to owning that space. No more.” “You said it well!” Sanchez said. The Hispanic Legislative Caucus has yet to meet, but the two are already planning. Valladares is inviting Latino GOP pioneers to become emeritus members — people like former Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado and Rod Pacheco, who became the first Latino Republican elected to Sacramento in over a century when he won his Inland Empire Assembly seat in the 1990s. Sanchez is outlining a legislative package focusing on what she describes as the “mandate on affordability, security and good education” that she said Latinos voted for in 2024. The two say they want to allow anyone to join the caucus, regardless of political affiliation. But they also want to help Latino Republicans win local elections and create a bench to ensure that politicians like them remain a presence in Sacramento for years to come, instead of a ridiculed anomaly. “We are going to champion issues that we know that California Hispanics care about,” Sanchez said when I asked for her concluding message to Latino voters. Valladares directed her closing thoughts to their frenemies over at the Latino Legislative Caucus. “Our caucus is here to work on these critical issues on behalf of Californians,” she said. “We're going to do it with or without you.”","summary":"The GOP caucus is forming at a time when Democrats still hold a supermajority in both of the state's legislative chambers, while the Republican Party

A backup dancer for Kendrick Lamar unfurled Palestinian and Sundanese flags during the Super Bowl halftime show; Macklemore released a third installment in his series of withering protest anthems against genocide, oligarchy, the Resnick pistachio empire, and Elon Musk; the Black Keys gave a scathing interview to Rolling Stone on the insidious and destructive nature of corporate consolidation in the industry; and at the Grammy Awards, a visibly terrified Chappell Roan denounced record labels for not providing health insurance to young musicians toiling under record contracts.\n\nAnd yet the impact and relevance of these acts was almost self-evidently nonexistent against the backdrop of Live Nation and Spotify and the entertainment industry merger mania expected to commence under President Trump. The Palestinian flag was cut from the national Super Bowl broadcast, the Black Keys admitted they could not share the details of their split with industry titan Irving Azoff or they’d “never work again,” and Macklemore has pretty clearly been throttled by the algorithms he predicted would suppress him in his first anti-genocide track, “Hind’s Hall.” No one has talked about “payola” scandals in close to 50 years, but the price artists pay when they so much as hint at dissatisfaction with the industry’s power dynamics has surely risen faster than the price of eggs.\n\n“To see how consolidated the industry has gotten and how connected things have become, it’s mind-blowing.”\n\nChappell Roan’s small rebellion, during her acceptance speech for her “Best New Artist” award, was the one act that elicited so much as a response from the music industry. After warning the audience that her enormous golden witch hat was about to fall off her head, drawing laughs as it disappeared behind her, she opened a white notebook and began reading nervously.\n\n“I told myself if I ever won a Grammy and I got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music,” she said, chewing gum in an apparent effort to calm her nerves, “I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially for developing artists. Because I got signed so young—I got signed when I was a minor—and when I got dropped I had zero job experience and like most people I had a difficult job finding a job during the pandemic. It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and so betrayed by the system.”\n\nArtists cheered Roan’s speech, with some like Benson Boone standing up in support almost immediately. But the industry responded through a lacerating op-ed in The Hollywood Reporter by one Jeff Rabhan, a former executive for the label that dropped Roan in 2020, who accused Roan of hypocritically “taking aim at the very machine that got her there” and praised Bill Maher for roasting Roan’s “trendy, performative activism.”\n\n“What would Prince say? Or Tom Petty?” he wrote, inexplicably referencing two artists who would have obviously given Roan’s speech a standing ovation were they not long dead from opioid overdoses they might have avoided with early-career access to comprehensive mental health care. “If labels are responsible for artists’ wages, health care and overall well-being, where does it end and personal responsibility begin? Should Chris Blackwell put a mint on her pillow and tuck her in at night, too?”\n\n“Record labels are businesses, not charities, and the deal is simple: They put up the money, take the risk, and in return, they get a cut of the profits,” he went on. Roan’s label “ran the numbers, assessed potential revenue, and invested hard cash and company bandwidth to build her identity and a sustainable business around her music. That’s how the industry works.”\n\nRabhan exemplifies the type of personality required to succeed in the music industry (though it is unclear how much success he has actually enjoyed). He managed the star Michelle Branch, claimed in court to have “discovered” the boy band Hanson, played a role in the management of Kelly Clarkson and Jermaine Dupri, and now runs something called Bored of Ed LLC (incorporated just last month), a company that describes itself as a “solution that brings artists, audiences, and brands closer together, teaching, inspiring, and building relationships” and apparently envisions a future where traditional college music programs are replaced with trade school–style training for brand partnerships. Until 2021, he chaired the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, a title that won him a wry profile in The New York Observer in which his entertainment executive wife, whom he met on a college trip to Israel, was quoted comparing their children’s preschool admissions odyssey to the Underground Railroad. He tweets frequently in support of Israel and likes to address anti-genocide activists on social media as “JEW HATER,” though he is better known in the music business as a reliable mouthpiece for the common mogul perspective that female pop stars are fundamentally interchangeable and disposable “vessel[s] for the artwork of writer-producers,” as he once described singer-songwriter Kesha’s relationship with the producer she accused of drugging, sexually assaulting, and abusing her.\n\nThe industry expects artists to cultivate a personal brand that aligns with future corporate partnerships at all times.\n\nIt is not clear if his distaste for Roan is rooted in her labor activism, her occasional expressions of support for Palestinian freedom, her frequent expressions of distaste for brand endorsements, or something else. But it is worth noting that Roan’s ascent to pop stardom appears to have been remarkably wholesome and low on profound trauma. The summer after her sophomore year in high school, she attended the prestigious Interlochen Center for the Arts summer camp in Traverse City, Michigan, wrote a song that impressed the faculty, uploaded a video to YouTube, and got a record contract a few months later. The late deep-state child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell were prolific benefactors of Interlochen, which they used as a hunting ground for vulnerable young aspiring artists before Epstein was arrested for the first time in 2006. But by the time Roan came along, the environment at the camp was idyllic, and her experience with Atlantic was arguably better than most. After introducing her to her most indispensable collaborator, Dan Nigro, and management team, the label unceremoniously dropped her in 2020 and somehow allowed her to gain control of her masters before she blew up. She has spoken in many interviews of the uncertainty and self-doubt that plagued her during this time, while always acknowledging that mending fences with her family, honing her inimitable sound and image as an artist, and learning to get by on a barista paycheck all helped her in the end. Like Taylor Swift, Roan’s ability to resonate so deeply with fans stems from the fact that her struggles are normal girl problems and not those of an abused child who has been irretrievably damaged by the predations of the Hollywood machine and the sickos it attracts; unlike Swift, her parents aren’t rich, and “money” topped the list of those normal girl problems.\n\nRoan first came into the crosshairs of Bill Maher when she posted a somewhat rambling TikTok video attributing her unwillingness to “endorse” Kamala Harris to the vice president’s endorsement of Palestinian genocide and the Democratic Party’s unwillingness to support trans people. At a concert last summer, she dressed up as the Statue of Liberty and recited the Emma Lazarus poem: “I am in drag as the biggest queen of all, but in case you had forgotten what’s etched on my pretty little toes: ‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free.’”\n\nTHE MUSIC INDUSTRY OPERATES AS AN OLIGOPOLY. Three labels comprise some 80 percent of the plays on Spotify; one company, Penske Media, controls the Billboard charts along with much of the entertainment media (Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone); and another company, Live Nation, controls nearly every venue at which a working pop artist can expect to perform a concert, which has provided the most reliable source of income for most pop musicians since the collapse of the CD business in the early 2000s. “To see how consolidated the industry has gotten and how connected things have become, it’s mind-blowing,” Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney said in the Rolling Stone interview. “When you control ticketing, promotion, and all this stuff, and then you get into owning the venues and then having shared interests with management, it just becomes harder and harder [for artists] to do business … [For] a capitalist society to function, there has to be competition. And if everything’s connected and all the interests are shared on one side, there’s no way to compete.”\n\nThe upshot of the Black Keys’ odyssey is that their manager, Azoff, did not have their interests at heart. Azoff had booked them to pay certain venues because he made money when they booked the venues, regardless of whether enough fans showed up, then advised them to cancel the tour when some of the dates didn’t sell fast enough, because canceled tours can be almost as profitable for the entities collecting the security deposits as tours that sell out, and so much less work. In Europe in particular, the band’s schedule was repeatedly and inexplicably juggled, with their Manchester show getting rescheduled multiple times due to venue delays.\n\nLast year, the Biden Justice Department sued Live Nation, which Azoff helmed until 2012, along with Azoff’s live events promoter Oak View Group for, inter alia, conspiring to screw over artists and their management teams by agreeing not to bid against one another for acts while giving off the illusion that they were in fact competitors. Oak View owns or controls many of the venues the Black Keys had been scheduled to play, including the loathed ManchesterLive; but Carney gave the impression that the band had not known that until the complaint was filed.\n\nAlas, in December a federal judge denied the DOJ’s request to produce emails between Live Nation, OVG, and a private equity firm with which they were colluding, determining that the emails were privileged due to the companies’ agreement to expand their collusion into the realm of a joint legal defense strategy. But the emails quoted in the original complaint, in which Azoff refers to his company as Live Nation’s “pimp” and “hammer”—roles for which Oak View receives “significant annual incentive payments”—are plenty damning. The judge in that case, who also happens to be presiding over Diddy’s sex trafficking and conspiracy case, is expected to rule soon on Live Nation’s motion to dismiss. Meanwhile, Azoff and Live Nation spent much of last month openly collaborating to plan a benefit concert for Southern California fire relief efforts that ended up raising $100 million.\n\n“People are terrified of upsetting Live Nation and Ticketmaster,” Robert Smith of The Cure told The New York Times in November, recalling his own recent crusade to force the monopoly to make his concerts affordable to his youngest fans. “It’s really bizarre, actually, because the power of the artist, it’s the ultimate power.”\n\nCHAPPELL ROAN ENDED UP WINNING THIS ROUND against Rabhan and the Machine. She donated $25,000 to a nonprofit that facilitates mental health care for music industry professionals. Charli XCX and Noah Kahan pitched in, Halsey wrote a spirited rebuttal of Rabhan’s “boot licker behavior” on Instagram, and Live Nation donated $25,000 as well.\n\nBut the vehemence with which Rabhan, Bill Maher, and their ilk instantly struck back at her brief invocation of a more egalitarian music industry shows how entrenched their worldview has become. By dressing down Chappell, Rabhan is advocating for a world where there is no sunshine between the worker and the brand. The industry expects artists to cultivate a personal brand that aligns with future corporate partnerships at all times.\n\nThe hypocrisy of this system is glaring. Artists are free—encouraged even—to partner with brands promoting alcohol, gambling, pharmaceuticals, or, as the Black Keys were forced to when the canceled tour zeroed out their revenue for the year, crypto. Yet advocating for something as basic as better health care for fellow artists? That’s where the industry draws the line, unless, like Roan, she is satisfied to channel her energies into something harmless and superficial like a 501(c)(3).","summary":"Fans have been pushing pop stars to take courageous political stands, but Chappell Roan’s skirmish with an obnoxious exec shows how hard it is for them to stand up even for themselves.","url":"https://prospect.org/culture/2025-02-20-your-kink-is-health-care-good-luck-babe/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22516/download/Carlson-Tkacik-Music%20industry%20022025.jpg?cb=ae337b3b0c1eca79682110d1d2ca8954&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 10:15:00","author":"Maureen Tkacik,Melanie Carlson","authors":["Maureen Tkacik","Melanie Carlson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":292461990,"title":"Carney won’t win hearts with another elitist climate plan","text":"In the space of a mere few weeks, the Canadian political terrain has shifted dramatically. Between Prime Minister Trudeau’s imminent departure and Trump’s attacks on Canada’s economy and sovereignty, a Conservative majority led by Pierre Poilievre in the coming months no longer seems like a foregone conclusion. In an otherwise bleak global landscape, many in Canada are breathing a sigh of relief that polls are showing a stunning collapse in the Conservatives’ lead, especially when poll respondents are asked to consider a Mark Carney-led Liberal Party.\n\nAnd yet, I remain nervous. While I am among those delighted to see the polls tightening, Carney is not without his vulnerabilities. And let us recall all the excitement when Kamala Harris took over the helm of the U.S. Democrats last summer and the polls caught positive Harris-Walz momentum. But it plateaued too soon. Her message failed to sufficiently excite (and in many cases alienated a progressive base). Trump still won.\n\nCarney’s climate plan, in particular, risks handing fodder to Poilievre while failing to captivate the climate-anxious voter. \n\nCarney’s record indicates that he “gets” climate. He purports to understand the threat. He has served as a U.N. Special Envoy for Climate Action. That’s the good news, and makes for a stark contrast with the Conservative leader. And Carney is clearly better than the other leading Liberal leadership candidate — Chrystia Freeland — when it comes to climate; Freeland has been widely seen within the climate movement as the principal blocker of more ambitious climate policy within Trudeau’s cabinet. (At the time of writing, the third-ranked Liberal leadership hopeful, Karina Gould, has yet to release a climate platform.)\n\nMuch has been made of Carney’s pivot to end the consumer carbon tax. Fine — I never put much stock in the tax as a major reducer of emissions relative to its huge political cost. And Carney is right to refocus on the industrial carbon price. It’s what he's proposing — and not proposing — in place of the consumer carbon price that has me worried.","summary":"Carney’s climate plan, in particular, risks handing fodder to Poilievre while failing to captivate the climate-anxious voter.","url":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/02/20/opinion/carney-election-climate-policy-ndp","image":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/02/19/480431469_122147034830512671_3971341592818003015_n_2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 10:09:05","author":"Pierre Poilievre,Seth Klein","authors":["Pierre Poilievre","Seth Klein"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.201}]}
