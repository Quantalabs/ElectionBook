Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nThe 2026 campaigns for governor, a raft of other statewide offices, 52 congressional seats and 100 slots in the state Legislature officially began last week with the onset of candidate filing. It could be one of the oddest election cycles in California’s 175 years as a state, albeit one that puts the state’s convoluted politics in the national spotlight.\n\nThere are so many Democrats running for governor that it’s theoretically possible for a Republican to win the office, despite the state’s deeply blue political profile, especially with the possibility of even more Democratic hopefuls jumping into the mob — as a herd of kangaroos is dubbed in Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, both incumbent members of Congress and aspirants will be running in districts that have been radically gerrymandered to shrink Republicans’ tiny delegation even more, as Democrats seek to regain control of Congress.\n\nThe possibility of a Republican governor, although very scant, stems from the state’s top-two primary election system. All candidates, regardless of party, will appear on the same June 2 primary election ballot, and the two with the highest percentages of the vote — no matter how small those shares may be — will face each other in the November election.\n\nWith upwards of a dozen Democrats now running and the possibility of others, it’s possible the two Republicans in the mix so far — Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former television commentator Steve Hilton — could theoretically finish one and two with perhaps as few as 10-15% of the votes each.\n\nIt’s not likely if the Democratic cohort shrinks in the next few months as the weakest contenders drop out, lacking enough money or poll support to continue. However, the lack of a natural Democratic frontrunner and the seeming lack of party leadership strong enough to cull the herd bolster the mathematical possibility of a GOP upset.\n\nHad former Vice President Kamala Harris or U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla decided to run, either would have been the immediate frontrunner. But by opting out, they left a vacuum.\n\nAt the moment, former Congresswoman Katie Porter is leading the Democratic pack, albeit with scarcely double-digit support in the polls. She and former Controller Betty Yee are the only two women now running with Harris. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former state Sen. Toni Atkins out . Porter also gained recognition during her unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat last year.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer is currently the most visible contender, spending some of his immense wealth on television and internet ads to depict himself as a populist who rails against “Sacramento politicians” and promises to reduce electric bills — not unlike how Donald Trump achieved success.\n\nBeyond Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Biden cabinet member Xavier Becerra appear to be the strongest Democratic strivers. However, everyone is still waiting to see whether Attorney General Rob Bonta or Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso will opt in.\n\nHaving so much uncertainty this late in the game is very unusual. However, at some point, perhaps around February or March, when the Democratic field finally begins to shrink, it will be possible to sort out the truly viable candidates from the wannabes and do some realistic handicapping.\n\nUntil then, as Willie Brown, the former state Assembly speaker and San Francisco Mayor and one of the state’s most astute politicians, put it to Politico:\n\n“The field is not considered of a quality that you as a Democrat would expect in California. We’re still pretty much carried away with stardom, with individuals who have some impact … We don’t have any candidates like that at the moment.”\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

He remains the Democratic party’s favorite elder statesman from the North.\n\nA poll conducted by JL Partners exclusively for the Daily Mail has revealed that Bernie Sanders is the most favored political figure among Democrats, earning a net favorability rating of 65 points, surpassing all others.\n\nWhile Santa Claus enjoys a net favorability of 59 points, Sanders edges him out, particularly noteworthy during the festive season when Santa’s popularity traditionally peaks.\n\nAlthough former Vice President Kamala Harris is viewed favorably by 78 percent of Democrats, her higher unfavorable ratings result in a net favorability of 62 points, placing her just behind Sanders.\n\nThis JL Partners survey included 383 likely Democratic primary voters for the 2028 presidential primaries, conducted from December 17 to 19, with a margin of error of 5 percent.\n\nAmong other Democrats, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led the pack with a net favorability of +46, followed by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker at +41, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz at +40, and California Governor Gavin Newsom at +37.\n\nFurther down the list, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker registered +23, former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke came in at +20, and Maryland Governor Wes Moore brought up the rear at +14.\n\nJL Partners’ poll this year also revealed a number of fascinating results about how Americans view the holiday season and other Christmastime traditions.\n\nAmericans’ favorite Christmas song this year was revealed to ‘It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,’ chosen by 26 percent of overall respondents, making it a rare point of agreement across party lines as 29 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of Democrats both selected it as their top choice.\n\nThe most irritating Christmas song was widely considered to be ‘Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,’ disliked by 35 percent of respondents, with Republicans and Democrats united in their annoyance.\n\nIn terms of traditions people are ready to leave behind, ugly Christmas sweaters led the way at 22 percent, followed by Elf on the Shelf at 15 percent and matching family pajamas at 14 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-running debate over whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie leans toward ‘no,’ with 47 percent disagreeing compared to 37 percent agreeing.\n\nMen were evenly split on the issue, while women more decisively rejected the idea by a 50 percent to 30 percent margin.\n\nThe current president was seen overall as the worst politician to sit next to at the holiday table, although Republicans, predictably instead name Biden as their least desirable seatmate.\n\nRepublicans said they would most like to sit next to Trump at Christmas dinner, while Democrats preferred Barack Obama and Kamala Harris.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThere&#8217;s one person in America who garners more affection from Democrats than&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Politician Gaining More Favor Among Democrats Than Santa Claus first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/the-politician-gaining-more-favor-among-democrats-than-santa-claus/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The-politician-Democrats-like-even-more-than-Santa-Claus.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 19:39:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.119},{"id":389036100,"title":"Kamala Harris Offers Some Sweet and Cheeky Dating Advice, Depending on 'What Phase You're In'","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is offering a bit of cheeky dating advice.\n\n On Tuesday, Dec. 23, the politician, 61, appeared on the Rich Little Brokegirls podcast to chat about her new book, 107 Days. During her conversation with host Kimberly Bizu, Harris shared advice for single people looking to meet a partner. \n\n “The important piece of this, though, for anyone who is single, who wants to be in a relationship, is to be kind to yourself and choose to be with someone who is kind,” she began. \"That's really important. Choose to be with someone who allows you to laugh at yourself and them.”\n\n As she continued, she emphasized the importance of being with someone you can enjoy all of life's moments with. “Choose to be with someone you like going to the grocery store together, taking a walk together, and doing something fancy together,” she continued.\n\n “There are different phases in your life,” Harris noted. “Depending on what phase you're in, maybe you're going to choose that you want to have that kind of Friday night relationship or you want that Sunday morning relationship,” she said through her own laughter, prompting Bizu to laugh alongside her. \n\n “Sometimes they go together and sometimes...,” Bizu interjected, before Harris added, “And sometimes you can get both, and sometimes it’s oil and water.”\n\n She acknowledged that the differences are still “okay.” She then added, “Be in those phases where you are having fun. Be in those phases where you have a sense of I just want something more.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Harris stressed the importance of people being “honest” with themselves and of figuring out whether the phase and relationship they’re in are what they “actually want.” She said, “But the first step is to be honest about what you’re in. And not try and make it something that it’s not because that usually doesn’t work out so well.”\n\n The advice comes amid Harris' 11-year marriage to her husband, Doug Emhoff. The couple met in 2013, when they were set up on a blind date by Harris' friend, Chrisette Hudlin. The couple tied the knot in August 2014 in Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\n However, Harris revealed in an interview with CBS News' Sunday Morning in January 2020 that the date wasn't technically blind — on her end — since she Googled her future husband before she met him.\n\n Harris recalled in her memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, that Emhoff, 61, was straightforward with her after their first date. \"The morning after our first date, Doug emailed me with a list of his available dates for the next couple of months,\" she wrote.\n\n The email read: \"I'm too old to play games or hide the ball. I really like you, and I want to see if we can make this work.\"\n\n In the years since their first date, they’ve shared how they prioritize their relationship, even as Harris served as vice president. According to Emhoff, the pair starts and ends their days together.\n\n \"We try to approach those moments as husband and wife, not vice president and second gentleman,” Emhoff told PEOPLE in November 2023. \"It’s really our time to be a couple ... time talking about kids, family and very little about the workings of our days.”","summary":"\"Choose to be with someone who allows you to laugh at yourself and them,\" the former vice president said on the 'Rich Little Brokegirls' podcast","url":"https://people.com/kamala-harris-shares-sweet-and-cheeky-dating-advice-11876194","image":"https://people.com/thmb/ctr-T95gSu4wj_p-5R6bjdMW9A0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kamala-Harris-122525-7681e163710c496295e8c13b4d525b5d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 18:37:57","author":"Charna Flam","authors":["Charna Flam"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.357},{"id":389019868,"title":"Gavin Newsom Mocks Trump, Kristi Noem and Kash Patel in Christmas Posts","text":"California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom released a series of Christmas memes on social media aimed at President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel. The posts, shared by Newsom’s press office on X, used satirical wish lists to mock them. Why It Matters Newsom has turned his social media channels into a platform for political counterattacks, leaning on memes, parody captions and capitalized slogans modeled after Trump’s online persona. The approach has drawn heightened attention from political strategists and appears to be paying off, with polls showing Newsom’s profile rising since early 2025. What To Know Each meme features a festive border and stylized “Dear Santa” list. The post targeting Trump includes the line, “More Crypto, Please! (I’ve only grifted an estimated $1.2 billion since becoming President!),” referencing recent reports on the president's fundraising and digital asset ventures. It is signed, “Love, Donald Trump.” The meme targeting Noem presents two “wishes”: “Another Rent-Free House for My Puppy!” and “Another Taxpayer-Funded Private Jet!” The “puppy” reference alludes to Noem’s admission in her memoir that she shot and killed her 14-month-old dog, while the private jet line refers to reports that she used a state-owned house without paying rent and traveled on flights funded by taxpayers. A third meme, attributed to Patel, reads, “Another Fleet of Tax-Payer Funded BMWs! (Gotta look sharp!),” referencing prior travel and expense claims. Each post was captioned with commentary from Newsom’s office, using all-caps and phrases like “Merry Griftmas” to mock the officials. The memes followed an earlier Christmas message from Newsom’s press office that used all caps and nicknames to mock Trump and several Republican officials, including Noem, Vice President JD Vance, Patel and House Speaker Mike Johnson. Styled like Trump’s social media posts, it included all-capped exaggerated insults and was signed “GCN,” mimicking Trump’s use of “DJT.” Newsom ended the year in a strong position, largely due to his direct and aggressive approach to Trump. While most Democrats limited their response to statements, the California governor challenged federal immigration raids in court, opposed diversity rollbacks and positioned himself as one of the party’s most outspoken critics of the president. He also secured one of the few legislative wins for Democrats: a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional map, aimed at helping the party flip up to five House seats in the midterms. What People Are Saying Newsom, at a news conference in August: “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.“ Mike Madrid, political strategist, to Newsweek: “Democrats are looking for a fighter. It’s not about ideology anymore. You can be centrist or progressive — what matters is that you stand up and hit back.“ Doug Gordon, Democratic strategist, to Newsweek: “His aggressive social media speaks to and energizes a small group of people who spend a lot of time online. But social media is not real life, and most voters will never see it.“ What Happens Next A December CNN poll showed Newsom leading among potential Democratic candidates mentioned by voters for the 2028 presidential race. Of the 14 percent who named a Democrat, 6 percent chose Newsom, ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris at 3 percent and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 2 percent.","summary":"The California governor mocked Trump and some of his allies with Christmas postcard memes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-mocks-trump-kristi-noem-and-kash-patel-in-christmas-posts-11270326","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2245710484.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 18:03:33","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":389032440,"title":"Katie Couric rejects 'bothsidesism' in news coverage, says people don't want 'just the facts'","text":"Katie Couric spoke out against \"bothsidesism\" in news coverage and insisted people don't want \"just the facts\" in the current media environment.

Zilch. Nada. Not even the hint of a merry moan.\n\nAnd I'll admit, as a Christmas singleton, I'm feeling horrendously smug about the whole thing.\n\nYou'd think all that enforced togetherness over the holidays would lead to more sex, not less. No work, no deadlines, the children distracted with new gifts.\n\nAnd yet, for many couples, December is the least sexy month of the year.\n\nWhy? Well, Christmas delivers a perfect storm of libido killers.\n\nAnd, dear reader, availability is not the same thing as arousal.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nFirst, there's the stress of Christmas itself.\n\nThe hosting. The cooking. The cleaning. The present buying. The playing peacekeeper between feuding family members. The strategically not seating your Trump-supporting uncle next to your niece who loudly and proudly voted for Kamala Harris. The negotiating which divorced parent gets Christmas lunch and who's stuck with the post food-coma dinner. Add in the long car trips with kids fighting in the back seat and - by the end of it all - most couples want sleep, not sex.\n\nThen there are the more… shall we say, mechanical blockades.\n\nA stomach full of Christmas roast doesn't exactly inspire a round of bedroom gymnastics.\n\nHeavy meals bring bloating and bodies that feel sluggish and anything but seductive. Pile on top poor sleep, and a calendar packed back-to-back with boozy celebration, and suddenly nobody's feeling particularly frisky.\n\nAlcohol, while festive, is a notorious saboteur.\n\nA drink or two might relax you. Nightly overindulgence, however, does men absolutely no favors in the performance department and leaves women exhausted and foggy.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest libido killer of all is the emotional pressure.\n\nChristmas is fabled as romantic. Magical. A time to reconnect, bond and 'make the most of it.'\n\nAs a result, December sex starts to feel a lot like birthday sex. The build-up is enormous. The expectations sky-high. The reality rarely lives up to the hype.\n\nWhen sex becomes something you feel you should be doing, rather than something you genuinely want, it becomes performative.\n\nYou start monitoring when and whether it happens, worrying about why it hasn't, and quietly judging what it all 'means' for your relationship.\n\nAnd so begins the spiral. Oh yes, I know it well.\n\nMeanwhile, you're together constantly. Sat side by side on the couch, scrolling separate phones - before falling into bed late, full, tipsy, overstimulated and vaguely resentful.\n\nIt's not that the attraction has disappeared. There's just no space for it to breathe.\n\nBut here's the good news: January tells the truth.\n\nWelcome to what I like to call the 'holiday horny hangover.'\n\nOnce the decorations come down and normal life resumes, one of two things happens.\n\nFor many couples, desire roars back. The pressure lifts. Routines resume - and so does the intimacy. (Who would have thought routine can be sexy?) Once you stop forcing it, you realize the December drought wasn't a dead bedroom. It was exhaustion.\n\nBut it's not a New Year bonk-a-thon for everyone, I'm afraid.\n\nFor some, January brings sobering realization.\n\nIt wasn't just the lack of sex over Christmas; it was the relationship itself.\n\nExtended time together exposed cracks that had been papered over with busy schedules and separate lives.\n\nIt's no coincidence that January is peak breakup season. Ask any divorce attorney and they'll tell you the same thing. Their phones light up in the first week of the year.\n\nSo how do you stop your sex life being as dry as the turkey?\n\nI'm glad you asked.\n\nFirst, lower the bar. Dramatically.\n\nSex doesn't need lingerie and soft lighting. A deep kiss, a cuddle or lying naked together absolutely counts. Connection comes first.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the much-maligned quickie.\n\nIt's often dismissed as lazy or unromantic, but one of my married friends swears it's what saved her marriage. After her second child, she realized her sex life had gone AWOL. \n\nSo, she and her hubby made it a fun little game to see when and where they could get away with a quickie. Inside while the kids were outside playing. In the shed, when the kids were perched in front of the TV. In the car, when they 'ducked out to pick up groceries.'\n\nSoon enough, these sneaky sessions became something they actively looked forward to.\n\nFull disclosure: I find a quickie ridiculously hot.\n\nMaybe it's the naughtiness. Maybe it's the spontaneity. Probably both.\n\nChanging up the setting of sex also works wonders. A hotel night, a different room, anywhere but the bedroom. New environment, new energy.\n\nAnd who decided sex had to be a nighttime activity?\n\nDaytime intimacy beats late-night exhaustion every time. Studies even suggest morning sex boosts mood for the rest of the day - and I, for one, know what I'd pick over my morning coffee.\n\nThen there's the underrated art of touching without expectation. Massage. Hair stroking. Holding hands.\n\nWhen sex isn't the goal, it often happens naturally.\n\nNow, this next one doesn't sound as fun, but the payoff is worth it: Ease up on the booze.\n\nOne drink can help. Five will scuttle the ship. Gents, I'm looking directly at you.\n\nAnd finally, don't panic if December is quiet.\n\nA dry spell over the holidays doesn't mean your relationship is broken. It might just be bloated, stressed and slightly hungover.\n\nBut if the thought of January together fills you with dread rather than relief, that's information worth listening to. Add another month of no sex, and it may be time to ask the bigger questions.","summary":"Behind all the tinsel and turkey, a surprising number of couples are getting absolutely zero action between the sheets.

The president is now 79. When he made his comeback to the White House in January he became the oldest person to be inaugurated president. Why It Matters Joe Rogan has a massive influence on hundreds of thousands of American voters, especially young men. The comedian boasts 20.6 million subscribers on his YouTube channels, and his podcast ranks number one among the most popular on Spotify. According to last year’s data, a majority of the show’s audience (56 percent) were young adults aged 18 to 34, and 80 percent were men—the same demographics that voted for Trump last year, when Rogan invited him on the show. According to the Center for American Women and Politics, 55 percent of men voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election, while 43 percent voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Joe Rogan on June 7, 2025, in Newark, New Jersey. While his audience is politically diverse, with 32 percent of listeners identifying as Republicans and 27 percent as Democrats, 54 percent of weekly listeners leaned toward Trump in last year’s presidential election in a late October poll cited by EMarketer; only 26 percent favored Harris. Rogan also invited Harris to be a guest on his show in the lead-up to the election last year, but then refused her conditions of a one-hour sit-down interview, whereas he wanted a three-hour long one. What To Know On the eve of the 2024 presidential election, Rogan threw his support behind Trump, saying that he was convinced to do so in one of his interviews with billionaire Elon Musk, then a close Trump ally. Trump swiftly played the endorsement as a win, and much was said about the weight that Rogan’s backing would have had on his listeners, especially young men. At the time, Trump said the podcaster’s support was “great” news. But like the Tesla CEO, Rogan proved to be a bit of a flimsy friend for the president, repeatedly criticizing him and his actions since the beginning of the year. One of the sticking points has been Trump’s aggressive anti-immigration crackdown and his mass deportations in the U.S.—including some who had no criminal records in the country. “I did not ever anticipate seeing that on TV on a regular basis,” Rogan said in a podcast episode in October talking about footage of immigration enforcement officers “ripping parents out of their communities.” “I really thought they were just going to go after the criminals,” he said. “If you have been here for 25 years, you have a family, your kids go to school here, you speak the language…you’re just illegal, but you’re a contributing member to the community that up until now has been protected,” he added. “This is crazy.” He also criticized the Trump administration for Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension earlier this year from ABC after comments on the shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, and what he called restrictions on freedom of speech in universities. In his December 23 podcast episode, Rogan attacked Trump for his decision to update all the plaques in the Presidential Walk of Fame with highly subjective new ones. Framed portraits of President Donald Trump flank an image of former U.S. President Joe Biden's signature and an autopen along The Presidential Walk of Fame at the White House on September 25, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Biden is currently the only president who does not have a portrait, having a photo of an autopen signature instead—a reference to Trump’s frequent allegation that the former president was not fit for office by the end of his term. “There’s nothing nuttier than the plaques under the presidents’ names…How is this real? How are you allowed to do that?” Rogan said. “The autopen photo of Joe Biden? Crazy,” he added. Rogan said that clearly every president was allowed to do that, but had not used this authority before. What People Are Saying Activist and author Amy Siskind commented on the podcast episode, writing on X: “When you’ve lost the Joe Rogan show.” Journalist Gretchen Carlson wrote on X, commenting on the conversation between Rogan and Segura: “Uh, you guys made it real!” The Daily Beast wrote on X: “Joe Rogan has come to terms with the fact that the man he endorsed for president in 2024 is not all there one year later.” Tom Segura said in the December 23 podcast: “This presidency, though, does feel like a parody of a real thing. Like, it doesn’t even feel real.” Joe Rogan responded: “There’s a lot of stuff that doesn’t feel real.” What Happens Next The new bronze plaques Trump installed in the White House’s Presidential Walk of Fame are likely to remain until the end of his second mandate. In the December 23 episode, Rogan suggested they should stay as a museum. “It should be the facts of his presidency; what happened during his term,” he said. “They should have the Trump wing. This is what happened when he was president.”","summary":"Rogan described Trump&#039;s decision to install new, very subjective plaques in the Presidential Walk of Fame as “nuts.&quot;","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-rogan-trashes-donald-trump-11269970","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2219529296.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 17:21:36","author":"Giulia Carbonaro","authors":["Giulia Carbonaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":389032266,"title":"Trump Posts Tribute to ‘Home Alone 2’ Casting Biden and Harris as Villains","text":"On Christmas Day, the Team Trump Instagram account shared a social media post depicting President Donald Trump as Kevin McCallister from the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, in a holiday-themed tribute to his cameo in the movie.

Pro-growth policies matter. You can see it clearly at the state level, where red states are doing a far better job keeping inflation under control than blue states.\n\nA new White House analysis of inflation data underscores the divide. States President Trump carried in 2024 have an average year-over-year inflation rate of 2.5%, while states Kamala Harris won are running at 3.0%.\n\nHousing inflation in conservative states stands at 3.4%, compared with 3.6% in liberal states. Food and beverage costs follow the same pattern: 2.5% in red states versus 2.7% in blue states.\n\nThe gap is even bigger in energy.\n\nConservative states are at 3.5%, while liberal states are stuck at a painful 5.2%. Anyone who has filled up a tank in California already understands why. When it comes to transportation, red states are seeing just 0.7% inflation, while blue states are dealing with 2.5%.\n\nLook at those numbers and tell me politics doesn’t matter. It almost starts to look intentional, as if blue states are content to create higher prices and hope Trump takes the blame.\n\nStranger things have happened.\n\nEven at the metro level, the pattern holds. Cities in more conservative regions such as Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, and St. Louis are posting all-items inflation of about 1.9%. Liberal metro areas are running much hotter at an average of 3.0%. Housing costs widen the gap even further, with inflation in blue strongholds nearly double that of their red-state counterparts, 3.9% versus 2.3%.\n\nHow about energy? I’m glad you asked. Left-leaning cities are still paying for the legacy of Bidenomics. San Diego saw energy inflation surge to 8.7%, with Riverside close behind at 7.9%. Conservative metros kept energy increases far more restrained, and overall inflation barely moved past 2%.\n\nHow does this happen? I have a theory.\n\nStates that embrace free-market policies, keep taxes low, and avoid burying businesses in regulation post better inflation numbers across the board. Liberal states are trapped in a cycle of high taxes, runaway spending, and green mandates, which is why they are still dealing with the consequences of the policies they cheered during the Biden years.\n\nAre Democrats really going to pretend this is a coincidence or some geographic fluke? This comes down to who is in charge. States with Republican governors posted an average inflation rate of 2.3%, compared with 3.0% in Democratic-led states. Republican-controlled legislatures came in at 2.4%, again well below the 3.0% average in Democrat-run legislatures. States with unified Republican control recorded inflation of 2.3%, beating liberal-run states by 0.7%.\n\n🚨 IT'S OFFICIAL: Jaw-dropping new data CONFIRMS Treasury Sec.

Several prominent journalists who were best-known as the faces of their respective networks went the independent route in 2025, though not all by choice. The ones who did are, in all cases, even more outspoken than before, suggesting the corporate shackles of their former employers were no longer restraining their true opinions. Here are five figures who decamped from mainstream media this past year. CNN STAFFERS IN SHOCK ABOUT JIM ACOSTA'S ABRUPT EXIT FROM THE NETWORK Jim Acosta Known for his melodramatic style of reporting as White House correspondent and then news anchor at CNN, Acosta announced in January he was leaving the network after he was offered a midnight time slot instead of a dayside one. The left-wing anchor, who injected editorializing into his reporting on President Donald Trump and others, started \"The Jim Acosta Show\" on Substack, where he hosts a liberal podcast and also blogs and reports. In one of the most bizarre moments of the year in journalism, Acosta in August \"interviewed\" the artificially animated avatar of deceased teenager Joaquin Oliver, who died in the Parkland massacre, to promote a gun control message. Although the teenager's father endorsed the stunt, the interview drew significant criticism about the ethics of essentially putting words in the mouth of a deceased person and underscored Acosta's hyperpartisan approach. Joy Reid JOY REID SAYS MSNBC FIRED HER WITHOUT WARNING, SPECULATES HER COVERAGE OF TRUMP, GAZA LED TO OUSTER The long-time anchor for MSNBC — now known as MS NOW — was abruptly fired in February from hosting \"The ReidOut.\" Reid has speculated it was because of her outspoken stance on the Gaza war and Trump but said she never received a true reason for the ouster. Reid started \"The Joy Reid Show\" in June, where she's brought her far-left commentary and interviews to more than 382,000 subscribers on YouTube and counting. Among her highlights this year, which included numerous interview appearances on other shows, are sharing a video suggesting the song \"Jingle Bells\" is racist, mocking Erika Kirk's attire in the wake of her husband Charlie's assassination and suggesting Trump might not have really been shot last year. Terry Moran The longtime ABC correspondent parted ways with the network in June after being suspended for his social media rant against Trump and policy adviser Stephen Miller, when he referred to each man as a \"world-class hater.\" Moran, who had just weeks earlier interviewed Trump in the Oval Office, went the Substack route, naming his site \"Real Patriotism.\" EX-ABC NEWS REPORTER ADMITS EMPLOYER BIASED AGAINST TRUMP DUE TO LACK OF ‘VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY’ He also lauded the rise of alternative media that he's now part of with his Substack. \"The new media is messy, chaotic and sometimes misinformed. But it cannot be denied that this new journalism is more democratic, more diverse and less captured by corporate interests pretending that ‘objectivity’ means silence about reality.

Amid swirling online rumors that Noem’s role in President Donald Trump’s administration could be coming to an end, along with renewed speculation about an alleged romance with Corey Lewandowski, the past year has been a tough one for the former South Dakota governor.\n\nNoem faced controversy even before stepping into her current role, as allegations of an affair and mounting online criticism reportedly spilled over into her daughter’s professional life, leaving Kassidy Peters caught in the aftermath.\n\nHow Kristi Noem’s day is going so far:\n❌ Affair with Corey Lewandowski\n❌ Ethics complaint regarding conflict of interest with her daughter\n❌ Bribed by GOP mega-donor to send national guard to the border\n❌ South Dakota Attorney General is reviewing the scandals pic.twitter.com/pZx9WZA5vl\n— Protect Kamala Harris ✊ (@DisavowTrump20) September 29, 2021\n\nA 2021 CNN report highlighted allegations that Noem reportedly used her political influence to get her daughter a job. But instead of Peters landing her dream job, she ended up quitting because of the aftermath of the investigation.\n\nNoem’s daughter was pretty passionate about being a certified real estate appraiser in 2020. However, her dream was quashed when her certification application was rejected due to “deficiencies in her work,” per the publication.\n\nBack when Peters’ mother served as the Governor of South Dakota and Sherry Bren became the South Dakota Executive Director of the Appraiser Certification Program, things were blown out of proportion. Suspecting foul play from the department’s side, Bren was reportedly invited for a meeting with Noem and other state officials to discuss the matter with Peters present.\n\nNoem just really in fact wrecked her daughters career….\n— Rick for Democracy🇺🇸 @rick-p2.bsky.social🦋 (@RPenfore) September 29, 2021\n\nThe former executive director recalled feeling “nervous and intimidated” by Noem and her council of officials who showed up for the meeting. Apparently, Noem enquired about the truth behind her daughter’s application rejection. This was even though there was an email detailing the lack of qualifications Peters was missing to obtain her certification.\n\nMoreover, Peters was given a total of 3 chances to reapply for her certification when, under normal circumstances, applicants are only given 2. Not too soon after the meeting and approval of Peters’ application, Bren was fired from her job.\n\nThis resulted in accusations of Noem using her political influence to advance her daughter’s career, followed by a legal case against the State for age discrimination. While Bren won the legal case with a settlement of $200,000, she accused Noem of allegedly abusing her power.\n\nNoem had dismissed allegations of her involvement in Peters’ license being approved and accused critics of “twisting” the story. Shortly after, a formal inquiry was launched to uncover the truth.\n\nBut before the inquiry could either confirm or deny claims about Noem’s alleged involvement, her daughter decided to walk away from the real estate business entirely.\n\nPeters had decided to write to the South Dakota Department of Labour & Regulation about completing a few of her appraisal projects and then quitting entirely because of the “irreparable damage.”\n\nPeters expressed her distress over walking away from the business in the aftermath of rumors surrounding her mother’s alleged involvement. She had written, “My business is finished, and the years I spent to become licensed amount to nothing…”\n\nAlthough she lost her dream job, possibly because of her mother’s position, Peters is currently doing well for herself.

No, you don’t want coal… You mean, clean beautiful coal. I had to do that, I’m sorry,“ Trump said. “Coal is clean and beautiful, please remember that—at all cost,“ he laughed. Every year since 1955, NORAD has been taking calls on Christmas Eve from children wanting to track Santa in his gift-giving trip around the world. This year, Trump joined in the 70-year tradition, taking calls along with first lady Melania that were broadcast on C-SPAN. The president could not help cracking a joke every now and then, or touting his political wins—though these probably went right over the children’s heads. His reference to “clean beautiful coal“ tied back to Trump’s push for increasing the country’s energy production and lowering prices by promoting fossil fuels. The call during which the child said they did not wish for coal was far from the only moment Trump let the little callers into his world. After taking a call from a 5-year-old in Pennsylvania, Trump said: “Pennsylvania is great, we won Pennsylvania, actually three times. We won it in a landslide, so I love Pennsylvania.“ Trump won the battleground state with 312 votes and 49.8 percent of the popular vote in November 2024 against the 226 votes and 48.3 percent of the popular vote garnered by then-Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2020, Joe Biden won Pennsylvania with 50.0 percent of the vote against Trump’s 48.8 percent. In 2016, the state had gone to Trump with 48.6 percent of the vote over Hillary Clinton’s 47.9 percent. President Donald Trump participates in NORAD Santa tracker phone calls from the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 24, 2025. Responding to a child calling from North Carolina who asked Trump if Santa would be angry if he did not find any cookies when he got to their home, Trump said: “I think he won’t get mad, but he’ll be very disappointed. Santa tends to be a little bit on the cherubic side, do you know what cherubic means? He’s a little on the heavy side.“ He encouraged the child to leave some cookies, adding: “I think Santa has a serious appetite.“ The same call has gone viral on social media after Trump told the eight-year-old girl that she sounded “so beautiful and cute.“ He also added that the child sounded “so smart.“ Among other calls, Trump explained to a child asking why NORAD tracked Santa, saying: “We want to make sure that Santa is being good—that Santa is a very good person. We want to make sure that we’re not infiltrating into our country a bad Santa.“ According to the White House, more than 605,000 people have been deported from the U.S. since Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, with another 1.9 million who were in the country illegally reportedly self-deporting.","summary":"Trump joined NORAD’s 70-year tradition on Christmas Eve, taking calls from children wanting to track Santa.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-kid-coal-beautiful-election-wins-christmas-calls-11269533","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2252765810.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 11:01:35","author":"Giulia Carbonaro","authors":["Giulia Carbonaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":388984032,"title":"Trump Pummels ‘Pathetic Trainwreck’ Stephen Colbert: ‘CBS Should, Put Him to Sleep, NOW’","text":"Colbert’s “The Late Show” is scheduled to end in May 2026, a decision his fans say smacks of censorship.\n\nIn a late night Truth Social post, Trump wrote that Colbert “has actually gotten worse” since being “terminated by CBS, but left out to dry.”\n\n“Stephen is running on hatred and fumes ~ A dead man walking!

CBS called the cancellation “a purely financial decision.”\n\nTrump had sued Paramount, alleging that CBS News’ “60 Minutes” program deceptively edited an interview with his 2024 election rival, Kamala Harris, in her favor.\n\nIn another overnight post, Trump repeated threats to yank the broadcast licenses of networks whose content he deemed overly critical.\n\n“If Network NEWSCASTS, and their Late Night Shows, are almost 100% Negative to President Donald J.

The network denied the decision had anything to do with the “show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nTwo weeks before the news dropped, CBS News’s parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve Trump’s lawsuit over edits made in a 60 Minutes interview that favored then-Vice President Kamala Harris before the 2024 election.\n\nThe public perception was that Paramount axed Colbert as a favor to Trump following the settlement, so that the Federal Communications Commission could approve the Paramount-Skydance merger. The deal was approved one week after Colbert’s cancellation, leading some to question the timing of events.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest the fate of Colbert’s show had anything to do with Paramount’s settlement or merger. Nonetheless, Trump welcomed Colbert’s cancellation in a Truth Social post and teased that Jimmy Kimmel was “next.”\n\nFast forward to September, Kimmel was suspended by ABC and Nexstar for six days after making misleading remarks about the assassin of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk on air. The late-night television host suggested the alleged killer was associated with the “MAGA gang.”\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr held the view that Kimmel’s misleading comments possibly violated broadcasting standards, leading to the comedian’s brief suspension. His show was revived less than a week later and is now set to air until at least May 2027.\n\nKimmel and his show’s ratings have been repeatedly attacked by Trump on social media and in public, confirming he is one of the president’s least favorite late-night hosts. During the Kennedy Center Honors this month, Trump said Kimmel was not among the “great” late-night hosts, such as Johnny Carson and Bob Hope, and called him “horrible.”\n\nThe president has also called for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, calling both “total losers.” Fallon attempted to bridge the gap between himself and conservatives by inviting Fox News host Greg Gutfeld as a show guest, but Meyers has been relentless in his criticism of conservatives and Trump.\n\nMaintaining a cozy relationship with Paramount Skydance\n\nTrump’s shadow over Hollywood can be seen in his strategically close relationship with Larry Ellison, whose son heads the newly merged Paramount Skydance studio.\n\nDavid Ellison, who led Skydance for nearly 20 years before taking over Paramount, has been cordial with the White House ever since Trump’s FCC approved his company’s merger. The acquisition included a complete overhaul of CBS News, with the appointment of Bari Weiss as its editor-in-chief and the establishment of an independent ombudsman to review allegations about the outlet’s political bias.\n\nSince the takeover, CBS interviewed Trump for a 60 Minutes episode that aired in November following their legal dispute.\n\nWhile Trump appeared happy with the new leadership at Paramount and CBS at first, he slammed the network for platforming Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on 60 Minutes this month. Greene disagreed with the president on certain policy issues, particularly regarding Israel and the Jeffrey Epstein files, before tensions between them escalated last month. Trump engaged in personal attacks on social media and withdrew his endorsement of the Georgia Republican, who said his comments fueled death threats against her and her family. In response, Greene announced she would retire from Congress next month.\n\n“My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor,” Trump said, referring to Greene. “It was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”\n\nDespite the kerfuffle between Paramount and Trump, David Ellison could possibly benefit from the president’s favor in seeking to outbid Netflix for the purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNetflix’s proposed acquisition of WBD is expected to face fierce antitrust scrutiny from the Department of Justice, putting the alternative bidder in an advantageous position. Paramount Skydance likely won’t face as much scrutiny on antitrust grounds because Netflix already dominates the streaming market. If it acquires WBD, Netflix would gain access to HBO Max and further solidify its place as the world’s leading streaming service.\n\nTrump recently cast doubt on a possible Netflix-WBD merger, saying it could pose a “problem” because Netflix’s market share would increase substantially if the deal closes. He added that he will be involved in the process of approving the deal.\n\nThe president later said that he would personally like to see CNN get sold as part of the merger. “I wouldn’t want to see the same company end up with CNN,” he said of WBD. “Because I think the people that are running CNN right now are either corrupt or incompetent [with] decision-making.”\n\nDavid Ellison reportedly told the Trump administration that he would make “sweeping changes” to CNN if his company took control, just like he did with CBS. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos similarly courted Trump ahead of his company’s bid, which doesn’t include CNN. Paramount Skydance is bidding for the entirety of WBD, while Netflix is only looking to buy WBD’s studio and streaming assets.\n\nWorking behind the scenes to get movies made\n\nNo stranger to entertainment, Trump has been able to get certain movies made in an unofficial capacity since his return to the White House.\n\nA recent example is Trump’s request to jumpstart the production of Rush Hour 4. With his connection to David Ellison, the president reportedly asked Paramount Skydance to greenlight the latest entry in the buddy cop action-comedy franchise. The studio is set to distribute the movie, with director Brett Ratner and actors Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker returning.\n\nSemafor reported that Trump, a big fan of the Rush Hour franchise, has been offering creative input on certain projects and wishes to bring back the hit comedies and action flicks of the 1980s and 1990s. While Trump hasn’t publicly commented on his role in reviving Rush Hour, White House communications director Steven Cheung made a post in celebration of the news.\n\nAnother movie that demonstrates Trump’s ability to leverage his Hollywood connections is his wife’s upcoming documentary. Melania is set to release theatrically in January, before it hits streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Incidentally, the first lady’s documentary was filmed by the director of all three Rush Hour films.\n\nWHAT A NETFLIX-WBD MERGER WOULD MEAN FOR MOVIE THEATERS\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump has launched a new production company, called Muse Films, that will debut with her eponymous documentary. The project is said to give viewers a behind-the-scenes look into her life leading up to her husband’s second presidential inauguration.\n\nThe president was reportedly involved in helping set up the $40 million deal with Amazon, and Melania Trump pitched the documentary idea to her agent after releasing her 2024 memoir of the same name. She serves as an executive producer on the project.","summary":"Forty years after entering Hollywood, initially making small cameos and later hosting his own reality television series, President Donald Trump has never exhibited stronger ties to the entertainment industry than in the first year of his second term.

One point of discussion he often returned to is Trump’s feud with the media, including a misleading edit the BBC created of Trump’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021. Rogan said media outlets aren’t meant to be “the propaganda arm,” and called the BBC’s edit “f***ing nuts!”\n\nAnother major story this year that drew commentary was the assassination of Kirk on Sept. 10, an act of political violence that some celebrated online. Rogan predicted two possible aftermaths from Kirk’s death: people either “have a conversation about being able to have conversations, or it’s going to get a lot worse.”\n\nRogan also addressed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s career post-White House, and pushed back against Harris’s claim she had the “closest” presidential election of the 21st century. He also pushed back against claims he wouldn’t cooperate in interviewing her ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nComedian and podcast host Theo Von guest-hosted Vice President JD Vance on his show, This Past Weekend with Theo Von, where they discussed the public breakup between Musk and Trump in June. Von noted that Musk retweeted a post calling for Trump’s impeachment and Vance to take Trump’s place, prompting Von to joke, “Dude, that’s one vote!” in reference to Vance possibly running for president in 2028.\n\nVance downplayed this, however.\n\nVon also requested that the Department of Homeland Security not include him in the department’s “banger” social media edits in September. The video featured him saying to a phone camera, “Heard you got deported, dude … Bye!” Von said DHS pulled the clip “out of context,” and the edit made him “paranoid.”\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nComedian Trevor Noah also addressed Kirk’s assassination, saying that comedians are being pressured not to discuss Kirk’s murder since “there’s nothing funny” about it. Noah pushed back on this, saying Kirk was shot while defending guns, and one has to admit “that is an incongruous, funny thing that happens.” \n\nNoah contended the purpose of comedy is to “find the moment of solace,” and being told not to joke about certain topics only makes him “find the funny” in them. He added that the United States’ response to Kirk’s murder “was to limit speech,” instead of limiting “the thing that ended his life.”\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nJimmy Kimmel became one of the most Googled people in the U.S. this year, due to his show briefly being pulled for comments he made about Kirk’s suspected assassin, Tyler Robinson, and the “MAGA gang’s” attempt to score political points from Kirk to distance itself from Robinson. The show returned roughly a week later.\n\nWhen Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned to the airwaves, Kimmel commended Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, for forgiving her husband’s suspected assassin. The late-night host said her words moved him and that she is someone “we should follow.”\n\nJon Stewart\n\nFormer The Daily Show host Jon Stewart is known for his comedy on politics, and 2025 proved to be no exception. \n\nOne major story he commented on this year was the release of the book Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson, which explored former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline while in office. Stewart is among the many critics of Tapper’s involvement, as the CNN host previously defended Biden’s fitness while criticizing concerns that the former president was faltering.\n\n“I understand the excitement over an insidious Democratic cover-up about Joe Biden’s mental decline. The thing is, though, it was a terrible cover-up, because we all f***ing knew,” Stewart said. \n\nStewart also criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) handling of the government shutdown, calling the senator a “human flat tire.” He later said the Democratic Party “caved on the shutdown” in early November, less than a week after the party’s massive wins in the 2025 election cycle. \n\nRob Schneider\n\nComedian Rob Schneider was one of many to partake in Turning Point USA’s “This is the Turning Point” tour after Kirk’s death, delivering a speech at the University of California, Berkeley, in November. The former Saturday Night Live actor recalled an encounter he once had with actor Robert De Niro, who questioned how he could support a “schmuck” like Trump.\n\nSchneider said he was surprised in the moment, saying all he could think of at the time was that De Niro knew who he was and proceeded to tell the actor, “I love you.” Schneider added that this type of interaction is the “only way to handle” hostility in an era of growing political polarization, encouraging attendees to pursue kindness over cancel culture.\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nCBS canceled The Late Show with Stephan Colbert this year, ending his show that began in 2015. Colbert, a vocal critic of the president, said “the gloves are off” now that his show is coming to an end when addressing the cancellation and Trump’s celebration of it. \n\nSTEPHEN COLBERT CHALLENGES KARINE JEAN-PIERRE ON BIDEN’S MENTAL ACUITY\n\nColbert also pressed former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Biden’s cognitive acuity, as Jean-Pierre was promoting her new book in October. The former press secretary said the president she saw “nearly every day” was engaged in his job, prompting Colbert to disagree.\n\n“In a moment of great pressure onstage, we saw someone shock us and worry us. And nothing could assuage that worry,” Colbert said.","summary":"Comedians and podcast hosts were among the many commentators shaping the news cycle in 2025, offering their takes on the Trump administration and other major events this year.&#160; The year’s largest stories include the assassination of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, billionaire Elon Musk breaking his alliance with President Donald Trump, and the longest [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/entertainment/3920061/comedians-podcast-hosts-comments-us-culture-2025/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-collage-18d1a7x3k-1765920429382-e1766016742355.jpg?1765902805&#038;w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 10:00:00","author":"Asher Notheis","authors":["Asher Notheis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.012},{"id":388851206,"title":"2025 Media Malpractice Recognized With the Heckler Awards Pt. 2 — The Individual (Dis)Honors","text":"It is time to continue the rundown of the worst seen from our media complex with The Heckler Awards, our recognition of the worst from the problematic press in 2025.

In our four-part year-end series, we give notice to the worst offenders and most dysfunctional reporting seen from the media landscape.\n\nIn this, the second installation, we will recognize some of the individual (dis)honors from either specific outlets or named journalists. So, let’s dig in and continue the scrounging through this year’s dustbin of the media landscape! Here are the technical award trophies for the disturbing acts from news sources or newsmakers last year. \n\nCelebrating Media Malfunctions With the Heckler Awards - Part 1: The Industry Technical Trophies\n\nMedia Rehab Facility – CNN\n\nWhile it has always been the case that the networks — especially the cable nets — are available to assist Democrats in image repair, CNN was especially active in helping party members spin their problems late in the year. In rapid succession, we saw the network bring on Stacey Plaskett, Hakeem Jeffries, Jasmine Crockett, Ilhan Omar, Keith Ellison, and Mark Kelly to try to repair the controversies swirling around them, and the compliant network allowed them to filibuster to beat back criticisms.\n\nThe Papal Chase – The Daily Beast\n\nFor some reason, this outlet was especially focused on Vatican activity involving the vice president, and for that same reason, they consistently got things wrong. The outlet claimed that JD Vance broke a Vatican rule by taking pictures inside the Sistine Chapel, except the pics were taken by the White House photographer while they were on an official guided tour. In April, it claimed that Pope Francis refused to meet with JD Vance, and then, one day later, was shamed into reporting the two had a private meeting — but tried to say the Pope was critical of the vice president. Then it repeated this lie with the new Pope Leo, with a similar disqualifying follow-up, and it ended the same way for the outlet.\n\nGator Done – The Miami Herald\n\nWith the debut of Alligator Alcatraz in South Florida, it is not surprising that the regional paper would be attuned to the developments. However, there is a difference between local interest and unhealthy obsession. In the days ahead of its opening, through the arrival of the first detainees, the Miami Herald was posting dozens of pieces some days, hitting 75 entries in one week, and compiling 200 mentions of the facility in less than one month.\n\nYou’re an Adult Now, Get Out – Teen Vogue\n\nCondé Nast Publishing came out with the announcement it was dissolving the bulk of the staff at Teen Vogue and folding any remaining elements into the parent publication. The demise of the hyper-leftist outlet had many upset, and it led to a comical display when staff from other Condé Nast publications whined in protest in the offices, leading to many of them getting fired for their little snit-fit. In a dose of fitting irony, Teen Vogue came to an end appropriately, as it ended as it turned 20 years old.\n\nVideo Emerges of the Condé Nast Offices ‘Confrontation,’ As Infantile Woke Staff Earned Their Pink Slipshttps://t.co/FovI3oSa4V— RedState (@RedState) November 7, 2025\n\nProse & Conspiracy – Rolling Stone\n\nAs Tulsi Gabbard released the wealth of government documents concerning the busted Russian Collusion narrative, the bulk of the media that had been obsessed with the story became instantly apathetic at the arrival of the disqualifying evidence. Typifying the approach by the press was Rolling Stone, which tried to dismiss this revelation by saying…it was all cooked up by Russia. To explain this conspiracy inception: 10 years ago, Russia planted the elements of the scandal to disprove that the scandal was real, which would then be a conspiracy by Russia to disprove a conspiracy had taken place. We think…\n\nCreative Editing Honor – BBC\n\nThe BBC was exposed for manipulating the speech given by President Trump on January 6. The British outlet cut up his audio to make it sound like he encouraged the riot that day, hiding the changes with video edits whenever the cut-and-paste took place. It was a clearly intentional act, one that the likes of Brian Stelter desperately tried to spin as an unfortunate error. What they had to ignore is that this revelation was part of a lengthy internal report that displayed a voluminous list of journalism problems within the network. \n\nPentup-agon Frustration – Intelligence Correspondents\n\nFrom the time he was tabbed for the role in the Department of War, Pete Hegseth has been targeted perpetually by the press. He made moves early on in his term to reconfigure the media arrangements in the Pentagon, and then made rules changes on the media to address leaks. Most correspondents complained about the adjustments, while weirdly saying Hegseth was imposing rules on things they previously were restricted from doing. The bulk of the outlets working the Pentagon quit, rather than agree to the new standards put in place.\n\n🚨Update: The mainstream media journalists who cover the Pentagon had to choose today between signing a new access agreement that would make it impossible to get and release classified information and turning in their Pentagon press badges. Almost all of them turned in their… pic.twitter.com/Z1cWPsWPNa— US Homeland Security News (@defense_civil25) October 16, 2025\n\nSignal Virtue-ing – Jeffrey Goldberg\n\nOn the subject of Hegseth, the press felt they had him dead to rights and primed to be removed when it was revealed that Jeffrey Goldberg from The Atlantic had been inadvertently added to a Signal group chat. He was able to see Pentagon officials discussing some of the details about a military strike in Yemen. There was dispute about how much sensitive or classified details were disclosed, but ultimately it only led to the dismissal of Mike Waltz from his post. \n\nCredibility Gap – CBS News / 60 Minutes\n\nThe network has been in perpetual upheaval for most of the year. It started with the long-delayed release of the full Kamala Harris interview from October, followed by President Trump suing over the matter. (As an added dose of idiocy, the Emmys awarded the program for a Best Editing honor.) CBS settled the suit, bothering many inside the network. Then, Bari Weiss was hired to take over the news division, causing more division in the ranks. Things culminated this week with her decision to hold a report on the El Salvador prison where the U.S. has sent illegal immigrant criminals. The hysterics over this common move have been hyperbolic.\n\nSpotlight Meal – Gaza Toddler\n\nThis summer there was a rash of reports about the plight in Gaza in which children were said to be dying of malnutrition. It became a questionable detail when it was noticed that in almost all of the reports of a widespread problem they used images of the same child. Then it was noted that the rest of the child’s family was in fine health. Eventually the facts came out: Hamas was feeding out these pictures of a toddler with a genetic condition to use as propaganda.\n\nAt least 16 children under five have died of starvation-related illnesses since July 17 and half a million people are currently experiencing \"an extreme lack of food,\" according to a UN-affiliated report out Tuesday. pic.twitter.com/r9kWSCe2KB— Axios (@axios) July 30, 2025\n\nFake News Is the Best News – The Pulitzer Prize Committee\n\nThe outfit that is positioned as the arbiter of journalism excellence went lower than just its biased selection process. More than avoiding any outlet that may trend toward the right, this year the biggest Pulitzer Prize committee decided to recognize fake news with its highest honor. ProPublica was given the prize for Distinguished Public Service for a series of articles showing the adverse effects of tightened abortion laws in the country. Most of the cases the outlet cited were instances where women were imperiled by issues unrelated to the laws (such as miscarriages), or through other actions, like the woman who died after she took the abortion pill on her own accord.\n\nWord of the Year – “Retribution”\n\nMany in the press have been particularly bothered at the moves President Trump has invoked in pressing charges against individuals, accusing him of employing lawfare. This is amusing given the actions seen from Joe Biden against Trump that the same press cheered. But making this all the more hilarious is how often they use the term “Retribution” to describe his moves, with no consideration about what he is supposedly seeking revenge over. ABC’s Jon Karl took this obliviousness to the highest level when he released his book titled…well, you know.\n\n“Retribution” coming October 28 pic.twitter.com/5YbhVzvRoJ— Jonathan Karl (@jonkarl) October 23, 2025","url":"https://townhall.com/columnists/bradslager/2025/12/24/2025-media-malpractice-recognized-with-the-heckler-awards-pt-2-the-individual-dishonors-n2668474","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/2/a0cff6d3-8fd4-4a9f-ae8e-9b6d6db29e64.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 01:40:07","author":"Brad Slager","authors":["Brad Slager"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":388847912,"title":"Whoever Trump picks, the next Fed chair won’t be independent","text":"As for who should get the job, many on Wall Street say: not Hassett.\n\nWhy the dissonance? The same thing that makes Hassett the favorite is what worries his critics—that someone so close to Trump can’t be an independent central banker.\n\nAnd yet this Fed transition is unique in that the president wants a Fed chair who doesn’t fit traditional notions of “independent.” He wants someone to support his overall economic agenda, which means lowering interest rates, a lot.\n\nTrump made this clear in a social-media post Tuesday. He lauded the strong third-quarter growth report, then lamented that markets often sell off on good news in anticipation of the Fed raising interest rates to avoid inflation.\n\nActually, the market didn’t go down Tuesday. Nor has the Fed raised interest rates in response to good news. Over the last two years economic growth has been solid, the stock market has romped to one record after another, and the Fed has lowered rates. That’s because it sees inflation as less of a concern than unemployment.\n\nFor Trump, that isn’t good enough. “I want my new Fed Chairman to lower Interest Rates if the Market is doing well, not destroy the Market for no reason whatsoever. I want to have a Market the likes of which we haven’t had in many decades,” he wrote in his post. “Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!”\n\nSimply put, the next Fed chair will only get the job having precommitted to lowering interest rates. That doesn’t fit most definitions of independence. All the finalists have said they favor lower rates: Hassett; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, in close contention for the job; Chris Waller, a sitting Fed governor; and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, considered a long shot.\n\nGiven that, the case against Hassett might be overstated, and his qualifications understated. His economics credentials—a Ph.D., stints on the staff of the Fed, at mainstream think tanks and publications in respected journals—are solid. He has had some peculiar forecasts, but mostly communicates in language economists understand.\n\nAs chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in Trump’s first term, Hassett did show some independence. Many staffers “wanted me out of the Trump White House from the beginning,” he recalled in a 2021 memoir. He clashed with trade adviser and tariff supporter Peter Navarro. When Trump turned against current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, his own appointee, for raising rates, Hassett told reporters that Powell’s job was safe.\n\nBy 2019, “I had had enough,” Hassett later wrote. Trump repeatedly challenged his “established opinions” while colleagues and the media attacked him. “It was exhausting.”\n\nOut of office, Hassett was critical of Biden’s policies which he correctly predicted would, along with low interest rates, drive inflation up. On the Fed, though, he was generally balanced, defending Powell for raising rates in 2022.\n\nWhen Powell slashed rates by a half point a few months before the 2024 election, Hassett at first backed him up. It “made a great deal of sense based on the data that they had at the time,” he told the Financial Times the next month.\n\nBut after becoming director of Trump’s National Economic Council this year, Hassett turned more partisan. He called the Fed’s half-point cut in 2024 a favor for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Powell for being slow to cut interest rates and attacked federal statistics agencies as partisan.\n\nFew would object if pre-2025 Hassett took the helm of the Fed. The worry is that the Hassett of 2025 shows up instead.\n\nStill, 2025 might not be a clean read of Hassett. After all, you can’t disagree with Trump in public and remain part of his administration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent started out a defender of the Fed and a critic of tariffs, and is now a defender of tariffs and critic of the Fed. No one on Wall Street seems to hold this against him.\n\nWarsh’s backers think he would be more independent because he isn’t close to Trump and has long been hawkish on inflation and monetary policy.\n\nYet despite not being part of the administration, Warsh has shown little sign of disagreeing with Trump on anything this year. He has been a harsher critic of Powell than Hassett has. He hasn’t spoken out against Trump’s attempts to take control of monetary policy by threatening to fire Powell or governor Lisa Cook.\n\nWarsh has generally been hawkish since his time as Fed governor, from 2006 to 2011, including when inflation was at or below the Fed’s 2% target. He has also consistently opposed the Fed buying bonds, dubbed “quantitative easing.”\n\nBut his hawkishness is less evident when Trump is in the White House. A few months after Trump began criticizing Powell for raising rates in 2018, Warsh called for an end to rate increases. And this year, though inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, Warsh began echoing Trump’s call to slash rates. “We can lower interest rates a lot, and in so doing get 30-year fixed-rate mortgages so they’re affordable, so we can get the housing market to get going again,” he said in October.\n\nUnlike Hassett or Warsh, Waller has arrived at his position in favor of lower rates without attacking Powell, and with economic arguments that have remained relatively consistent and coherent. Economists find this reassuring because it means when the data no longer supports rate cuts, presumably Waller won’t, either.\n\nHassett says he, too, would be guided by the data and Trump’s opinion “would have no weight.”\n\nBut here’s the hard reality: Trump is counting on lower rates to stoke growth, propel markets and reduce the federal deficit. At some point, he will demand something Fed officials don’t want to deliver. Could Hassett withstand the sort of pressure Trump would then unleash, including threatening to remove him or his colleagues? Would Warsh, Waller or Rieder? We won’t know until it happens.\n\nIn fact, we only know of one central banker who could stand up to Trump, because he already has. It’s why Powell isn’t under consideration for another term.\n\nWrite to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.com","url":"https://www.livemint.com/global/whoever-trump-picks-the-next-fed-chair-won-t-be-independent-11766625965562.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/25/1600x900/logo/Federal-Reserve-Powell-14_1766626087509_1766626102672.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 01:28:54","author":"Greg Ip","authors":["Greg Ip"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":388848040,"title":"The 5 keys to resisting social media envy — for good","text":"The following is an adapted excerpt from Ruchika T. Malhotra’s new book, “UNCOMPETE: Rejecting Competition to Unlock Success.” \n\nThe average person spends 147 minutes a day on social media — or nearly 2.5 hours according to consumer research company GWI. At its best, social media is a wonderful way to connect with and keep up with loved ones, especially those who are far away. \n\nIt can help advance your career, too. Over the years, posting regularly on my social media channels has been extremely necessary for building and finding my audience. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that this book wouldn’t be in your hands without the time I’ve spent online. Social media has helped activists from around the world assemble and organize, championing important global causes, raising the voices of marginalized people, and holding oppressive governments accountable through large protests.\n\nHowever, although social media has its perks and can be an agent for good, it’s one of the main drivers of envy in the modern age. That’s according to behavioral scientists, mental health experts, and even some technologists. Most adults are intuitively aware of how our feeds are carefully curated highlight reels — not honest depictions — of others’ lives. We all know that the photos are heavily filtered and that some of the videos are completely staged. But envy still threatens to consume and compel us to compete whenever we see others’ lives compared to ours when we log into these apps.\n\nMartha Burwell and I saw evidence of how social media impacted women’s feelings of comparison and envy in our “uncompete” survey. Women reported feeling high levels of envy because of comparisons on social media, especially with their colleagues’ achievements and their physical appearance. Compared with white respondents, women of color felt more envy and pressure to change their looks at work based on their social media use.\n\nRuchika Malhotra is the author of “UNCOMPETE: Rejecting Competition to Unlock Success.”\n\nIn a different study, university students who used social media for more than three hours each school day suffered from poor sleep, poor academic performance, and much higher rates of depression, substance abuse, stress, and suicide. One of the reasons for this could be the constant comparison bred by social media platforms, concludes psychologist Nicholas Kardaras.\n\nBut completely disengaging from social media is not a viable option for most of us. Certainly not for many women of color, who often make invaluable work and community connections that aren’t always accessible in real-life situations.\n\nUndeniably, it’s a privilege to be someone who can completely cut out social media and still be able to generate income or connect with your community. So rather than advocating for total abstinence from social media, I’ve curated some ways that experts recommend engaging more intentionally. In doing so, we have a better chance to create collaborations and cultivate an abundance mindset. I believe that it is possible to uncompete on social media if we do it mindfully.\n\nStep 1: Discern Who Really “Wins” on Social Media\n\nSocial media is designed to have us believe that our “worth” is based on how many followers we have and how much engagement there is with the content we post. Its algorithms rely on us comparing ourselves and competing with others on a regular basis. But when feelings of envy creep in, we can pause and remember that social media has become a powerful tool for companies to monetize our attention and benefit from our insecurities. We can reject the tactics of competition, start uncoupling our self-worth from the metaverse, and look within for validation. The best way to begin is by asking ourselves why we’re using social media in that moment — “I’m on Instagram to post a photo I just took,” “I want to see what my friends are up to,” “I’m reading it for news”— rather than just mindlessly reaching for it.\n\nRuchika Malhotra in an author and founder of inclusion strategy firm, Candour. \n\nIf we engage in social media with a purpose in mind, we have a higher chance of noticing when and how envy is showing up in our bodies. Then there’s a greater possibility for us to log off and do an activity that grounds us, such as going for a walk outdoors or listening to our favorite music.\n\nStep 2: Reframe Envy\n\nThe envy that comes from seeing people’s highlights on social media, especially when we’re struggling in our lives, can steal away every ounce of joy. The incessant comparison and the pressure to portray a perfect life and receive a comparable or greater amount of engagement than those we follow remain constant.\n\nIt’s not easy, but being able to reframe some of those emotions and negative self-talk when we see others winning on social media could be useful in helping us navigate our feelings effectively. \n\nHere are some of the ways I’ve tried to reframe my envious feelings in my journey to uncompete online:\n\nMalhotra's guidance for curbing social media envy.\n\nStep 3: Take Meaningful Breaks from Social Media\n\nIt’s no secret that social media algorithms are designed to reward us for posting more and spending more time on the apps. Our phones also activate the parts of our brains that produce dopamine, and this is why it’s so difficult for us to put them down. Taking a break from social media is a great way to reset our internal thoughts, which often turn negative and self-hating the more time we spend on it. Experts recommend setting planned breaks from social media such as during weekends, evenings, or even one day per week. I’ve also benefited from setting timers that log me out of social media after I’ve spent a certain amount on it.\n\nStep 4: Follow, Support, and Boost Those Who Are Using Social Media Thoughtfully\n\nFollowing creators and websites that do not immediately stoke feelings of competition is a great way to combat envy and strengthen our resolve to uncompete. There are so many creators out there who are sharing more realistic looks at their lives.\n\nFor example, Zoe Blaskey and Motherkind, Mom Life Comics, and the Not Safe for Mom Group are Instagram accounts that offer honest approaches to motherhood and how hard it is. Brown Girl Therapy by Sahaj Kohli, Lizzo, and Alex Light promote body confidence. POC in Tech and Decolonize Myself provide antiracist content.\n\nWe can also use our own social media to practice radical generosity and solidarity by supporting and boosting other creators, especially businesses or channels owned or run by women of color.\n\nEvery July, I turn over all my social platforms to amplify creators who applied to be amplified (via an online form). My social team then shares each applicant’s content once every weekday of July, so by the end of the month, we amplify more than twenty individuals, spreading the word on books, podcasts, businesses, nonprofits, art, and other amazing projects that people had shared. A few people asked me why I had turned over my platforms for the whole month – after all, don’t I have my own books, consulting, and speaking services to amplify? Why a month, why not just a day every week? What if I lost followers? People were choosing to follow me for, well, me?\n\nObviously, I understood the concerns, and it was a “risk” in terms of pure growth and engagement numbers. But Amplify July is a huge hit for me every year. I don’t lose followers. I get to learn about interesting people around the globe who also uncompete and create a better online community and world. More than anything, I seem to “trick” the algorithms away from suggesting creators who seem to live “perfect” lives of travel, luxury, and beauty and toward recommending other accounts that are built on community and collaboration. Win win!\n\nhttps://www.ms.now/career-growth/kamala-harris-name-mispronounced-whole-life-s-reclaimed-rcna165347\n\nStep 5: Advocate for Less Addictive, Safer Social Media Algorithms\n\nTo uncompete at scale, we need social media companies to acknowledge that social comparison and competition are harmful. As consumers and humans, we need them to radically rewrite their business models so their profits are not directly tied to their users’ feelings of envy. This is literally how their algorithms work: They’re trained to understand and incite our deepest insecurities!\n\nFor instance, on days we’ve been feeling vulnerable about our appearance, we get a stream of content suggestions on platforms like Instagram specifically showing us photos and videos of conventionally attractive women as well as suggestions of expensive products to buy. One of the ways I’ve tried to stay informed is by supporting organizations advocating for better social media platforms. A short list includes the Center for Humane Technology, the Organization for Social Media Safety, and the National Cybersecurity Alliance.\n\nI’m not trying to tell people how to “break up with their phone.” All I want is for us to believe really believe — that we have an active choice in how we spend our time online and to demand that companies act responsibly in turn.\n\nExcerpted from “UNCOMPETE: Rejecting Competition to Unlock Success,” by Ruchika T.

Trump and Kennedy Center Production.\"\n\n Trump then took the stage, becoming the first sitting president to host the ceremony. But according to The Washington Post, CBS significantly cut Trump's 12-minute opening monologue to a mere two minutes, removing a joke about the crowd being full of \"miserable, horrible people.\"\n\n The network's news division also reportedly implemented a policy to omit Trump's name from the Kennedy Center name in ongoing coverage, according to the Post. \n\n \"On Tuesday, CBS will broadcast the annual Kennedy Center Honors,\" wrote CBS News senior director of standards and practices Jack Renaud in an email to his colleagues, which the Post says it obtained ahead of the ceremony. \"Yesterday, the newly appointed board of the Kennedy Center voted to change the facility's name to the Trump-Kennedy Center... But it would take Congressional approval to officially change the name.\"\n\n Renaud then concluded, according to the outlet, \"Therefore, CBS News will continue to use the 'Kennedy Center,'\" adding that \"if the president or other administration officials use the new name in a soundbite, that is their prerogative.\"\n\n Entertainment Weekly has reached out to representatives for the White House and CBS.\n\n Trump has made much of the Kennedy Center name change after the institution's board \"voted unanimously\" to approve it, as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt noted in a Dec. 18 social media post. But Ohio Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, who sits on the board, disputed that claim, saying she was prevented from casting her true vote.\n\n \"For the record. This was not unanimous,\" she explained in a response to Leavitt's post. \"I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also, for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship.\"\n\n Still, Trump trumpeted the broadcast of the \"TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER HONORS\" in a post to his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, hours before the ceremony was to take place.\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n This is the latest development in the ongoing conflict between Trump and CBS.

That same month, the network made the unprecedented move of axing The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, following Trump's continuous criticism of its host.\n\n Some critics characterized the move as Paramount's attempt to silence one of the president's most prominent critics ahead of their bid to merge with Skydance Media, which was founded by Trump backer David Ellison.\n\n The effects of a new, Trump-friendly regime at Paramount can already be felt at CBS News, which landed in hot water this month after new boss Bari Weiss pulled a segment covering the Trump administration's new policy of deporting Venezuelan men to CECOT, a notorious, maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\n\n Longtime 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi slammed the decision as \"political,\" warning that even the venerable investigative news program now faces the prospect of going \"from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.\"","summary":"Trump became the first sitting president to preside over the annual ceremony, which has become embroiled in controversy over his push to add his name to the institution's title.","url":"https://ew.com/cbs-adds-trump-kennedy-center-honors-broadcast-voiceover-rebranding-controversy-11876030","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/zhk52k3ESI0kEo1qRBuopFR2bzo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Donald-Trump-48TH-ANNUAL-KENNEDY-CENTER-HONORS-2025-122425-11f2c34aa627475592e0e4e9d911a22d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 00:21:42","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":388839216,"title":"Donald Trump Takes Call from Child for Christmas, Brags About Winning Pennsylvania 'Actually Three Times'","text":"President Donald Trump bragged about his election victories while taking calls from children on Christmas Eve.\n\n On Wednesday, Dec. 24, the president and first lady Melania Trump celebrated Christmas at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.

Four years later, former President Joe Biden won the state by a 1.17% margin, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.\n\n In 2024, Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris, after earning 3,543,308 votes, while Harris received 3,423,042, per The New York Times.\n\n Trump also told a child from Oklahoma that their state was \"very good to me in the election,\" and that they should \"never leave Oklahoma.\" (Trump won Oklahoma in three consecutive presidential elections, and the state hasn't gone to a Democrat since 1964.)\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n The president’s comments this holiday season follow his newsworthy Christmas conversation during his first term.

Are you still a believer in Santa?” She confirmed she did, and he responded, “Because at 7, it’s marginal, right?” \n\n Trump's comments on Wednesday are similar to his remarks in November about West Virginia following the death of U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom.\n\n The 20-year-old West Virginia National Guard member and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot and killed near the White House on Nov. 26. When Trump was asked if he would attend Beckstrom’s funeral, he commented on her home state. \n\n “I hadn’t thought about it yet, but it certainly is something I could conceive of,” Trump replied, then adding, “I love West Virginia.

I love the people of our country,\" he said. \"But I haven't given it any thought, but it sounds like something I could do.”\n\n Although Trump did not attend Beckstrom's funeral on Dec. 9, he did offer invitations to both soldiers’ parents to visit the White House, NBC News reported.

Perhaps I don't want to know the answer. It's been more than two decades, and people change.\n\nBut I would love to hear her take on Bari Weiss, who is committing flagrant acts of journalism over at CBS, much to the dismay and downright irritation of the other members of her profession. Weiss, hardly a conservative, worked for The New York Times. She left because the publication couldn't tolerate running a dissenting op-ed by Senator Tom Cotton. It was the right call, but I notice that no one hailed her bravery when she resigned. They saved that for the Jennifer Rubins of the world, when Rubin and her ilk left places like The Washington Post because they wouldn't endorse Kamala Harris, or any political candidate, last year.\n\nAfter leaving The New York TImes, Weiss built The Free Press from the ground up and on the principles of \"honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.\" For her hard work, CBS and Paramount bought The Free Press and gave Weiss a much-deserved editorial role at CBS.\n\nThe past few days have also proven that Weiss is a much-needed presence at CBS.\n\nEarlier this week, Weiss spiked a story about CECOT, the El Salvadorian prison where the Trump administration is sending some illegal immigrants. She wrote a memo explaining what she'd like staff to do before running the story. Her requests were simple.\n\n\"If we're going to run another story about a topic that has by now been much-covered we need to advance it,\" her memo read. Among the ways to do so: does anyone in the administration or anyone prominent who defended the use of the Alien Enemies Act now regret it in light of what these Venezuelans endured at CECOT? That's a question I'd like to see asked and answered.\"\n\nWeiss also noted the story did not \"present the administration's argument for why it sent 252 Venezuelans to CECOT\" and asked, \"Isn't there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing?\" She pushed to get principals like Stephen Miller and Tom Homan on the record. She urged a deeper dive into what CBS knows about the Venezuelans, too. Notably, she pointed out the semantic game: \"The data we present paints an incongruent picture,\" Weiss wrote. Of the 252 Venezuelans sent to CECOT, we say nearly half have no criminal histories. In other words, more than half do have criminal histories. We should spend a beat explaining this.\"\n\nAll of these things are more than reasonable requests. But the reaction of CBS staff shows they're not used to having an editor who does her job. Correspondent and producer Sharyn Alfonsi accused Weiss of pulling the story because of \"political reasons.\" Alfonis claims 60 Minutes tried to speak to Stephen Miller, who (along with other Trump officials) refused to talk to the network.\n\nTurns out that was a lie, too. Axios reported that the White House, State Department, and Department of Homeland Security all provided on-record comments to CBS, and not one of those comments made it into the 60 Minutes segment that was eventually leaked to Canadian networks. \n\nThis wasn't Alfonsi's first brush with problematic reporting, either. She was the reporter who ran a misleading piece on Ron DeSantis during COVID, alleging wrongdoing when DeSantis paired up with Publix to offer the COVID vaccine.\n\nBut the most offensive meltdown of all comes from Peter Rothpletz. In a none-too-subtle piece titled \"Bury Weiss\" (seems a bit threatening, no?), Rothpletz calls Weiss \"the faux-free speech warrior, faux-queer rights advocate, and arguably faux-journalist.\"\n\n“Over the last 48 hours, the faux-free speech warrior, faux-queer rights advocate, and arguably faux-journalist “editor-in-chief” of CBS News decided to drop the mask; she opted to go full fash, as the kids say.” - ⁦@PeterTwinklage⁩ for First Draft: https://t.co/Q9tdDGGNBl— Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) December 23, 2025\n\nI liken this to a child who has spent his whole life being indulged and spoiled. Raised by parents who didn't know how to say \"No,\" the first time that spoiled brat is denied what he wants, he throws a tantrum. He doesn't know how to function in a world where he doesn't get his way.\n\nJournalists, for far too long, have gotten away with not only injecting their politics into every noun, verb, and adjective of their \"news\" stories, but they also never offer pushback against Democrats — hence why I call them stenographers — and they gladly parrot DNC talking points like the propagandists they are. Now that someone is asking them to do the most basic, fundamental duties of their job, they're appalled that they can't continue their incestuous relationship with the Democratic Party.\n\nNow Bari Weiss is trying to save her industry from self-destruction, and she's being attacked for it. Weiss, for her part, is unfazed:\n\nMy job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.\n\nMany years ago, President Trump called the media the enemy of the people, and he was right.\n\nBut they're also the enemy of actual journalists like Bari Weiss.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/12/24/vip-journalistic-integrity-n2668437","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/53/c303f02b-9fd9-438e-9401-7a7399906eeb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-24 23:30:27","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":388834056,"title":"Lara Trump says 'scrambling' Democratic Party in a 'bit of a pickle' over next star","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle December 24, 2025 05:26 \n\n Lara Trump says 'scrambling' Democratic Party in a 'bit of a pickle' over next star \n Fox News host Lara Trump sets the record straight on the Democratic Party's potential rising star and mocks former Vice President Kamala Harris' dating advice on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE INGRAHAM ANGLEV-VIDEOKAMALA HARRISMEDIADEMOCRAT ELECTIONSGOVERNORSKENTUCKY","summary":"Fox News host Lara Trump sets the record straight on the Democratic Party&apos;s potential rising star and mocks former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; dating advice on &apos;The Ingraham Angle.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6386919415112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/683a9127-221f-40a8-a513-438af483d3fb/872e8c20-a3a2-48c2-b9a3-83ef6f69f112/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-24 22:31:04","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":388825844,"title":"Trump says comedian Colbert should be ‘put to sleep’","text":"CBS called the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show 'a purely financial decision'.

Tim Pawlenty says 2026 is ‘best chance’ for GOP to win statewide","text":"Tim Pawlenty was the last Republican to win statewide office after he was re-elected to his second term as Minnesota’s governor in 2006.\n\nThe former governor thinks 2026 might be Minnesota Republicans’ “best chance” to achieve the same feat 20 years later, he told Forum News Service in November.\n\nThe GOP race is crowded, with MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, House Speaker Lisa Demuth, state Rep. Kristin Robbins, attorney Chris Madel, and previous gubernatorial candidates Kendall Qualls and physician Scott Jensen.\n\n“The 2026 elections are the best chance for Republicans to win statewide here in a long time. Those chances will be impacted by (President Donald) Trump and (Gov. Tim) Walz’s popularity a year from now, the state of the economy, whether key consumer items are affordable, the quality of our candidates, and the growing sense things are off track in Minnesota,” Pawlenty wrote in an email.\n\n‘Political climate more polarized’\n\nLast year, a few Republicans and former Republicans declared themselves in support of former Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nPawlenty was not one of them, but when asked to reflect on the “Republicans for Harris wave,” he said, “If you haven’t closed a sale with your product in nearly 20 years, it’s long past the time to get a better product, better marketing, or both.”\n\nPawlenty said he thinks Republicans currently in office have done a good job addressing “concerns about illegal immigration, crime, out-of-control wokeness and more,” but that more efforts are needed toward affordability.\n\n“Almost nothing stays the same in politics for long, and recent changes have featured MAGA taking over the Republican Party and socialists taking over the Democratic Party. The political climate is now markedly more polarized than when I was governor,” he wrote.\n\nDuring his tenure, Pawlenty focused on not raising taxes. He turned a budget deficit into a surplus — that later turned into a budget deficit. He passed a concealed carry law, and oversaw major infrastructure projects like the Northstar Commuter Rail and Target Field.\n\nBefore he was governor, he served 10 years in the Minnesota Legislature. He also had an unsuccessful run for the 2012 Republican nomination for president in 2010. He finished second to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be U.S. Sen. John McCain’s presidential running mate in 2008. Pawlenty sought a third term as governor in 2018 but lost the Republican primary to Jeff Johnson.\n\n‘A chilling effect on our discourse’\n\nNow, Pawlenty serves on various boards, periodically writes and speaks about policy and politics, and sometimes appears on cable news shows.\n\nTwo of those appearances were on Twin Cities-based KARE 11 in the wake of the June 14 Minnesota lawmaker shootings.\n\nIn one appearance on June 18, he provided context on misinformation regarding the appointment of accused assassin Vance Boelter to a government board. In another appearance on June 14, he said Minnesota’s “civic and political fabric seems to be so torn.”\n\n“It’s going to have a chilling effect on our discourse, on our political leaders, but importantly, also their families,” Pawlenty said on KARE 11. “Can you imagine being the child or a spouse, a significant other, of a political leader in this environment — every time you open the door, every time you go to the grocery store, you don’t know who is just going to question you or who might harm you?”\n\nFraud cases\n\nOn Dec. 5, he weighed in on Minnesota’s fraud investigations and the rhetoric about Minnesota’s Somali community that has followed.\n\n“Over 80 people have been charged … criminally for that fraud, and the vast majority of almost all of them are, in fact, Somali,” he said on News Nation. “So we don’t want to stigmatize any group because they belong to an ethnic group or another group, but we also don’t want to excuse illegal behavior or misconduct because they’re in that group.”\n\nWhen asked about how the current administration has handled the issue, Pawlenty responded, “There’s no question … that the early signals around this fraud were ignored.”\n\nWhen Forum News Service asked what’s ahead for him, Pawlenty didn’t rule out all elected office but did comment on one 2026 race.\n\n“While I’ve been asked to run for the U.S. Senate, I don’t think I could win my party’s endorsement at the convention or in a primary because I guess I’m now viewed as too ‘mainstream’ — which I find kinda funny,” he wrote.","summary":"The former governor discussed what he is up to these days and his reflections on the current state of politics.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/12/24/former-mn-gov-tim-pawlenty-says-2026-is-best-chance-for-gop-to-win-statewide/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jmp-005-0183-pawlenty.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-24 21:41:50","author":"Mary Murphy","authors":["Mary Murphy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":388819136,"title":"Struggling student loan borrowers get screwed before Christmas","text":"The Trump administration will officially begin garnishing wages from people who default on their student loans, the Department of Education announced on Tuesday—a move that could impact millions of Americans.\n\nAccording to a report from CNN, the Department of Education will direct employers in January to begin withholding employees' income if they have not made payments on their federal student loans for 270 days.

Zaid was one of the attorneys for Susan Monarez, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Jean Carroll civil case, an incorrect accusation he repeated no less than 10 times. \n\nIn July, Paramount Global also paid $16million in another civil lawsuit after Trump sued CBS for deceptive practices, alleging that 60 Minutes selectively edited an interview with his then-2024 presidential race opponent, Kamala Harris, to make her answers seem more coherent just weeks before the election.FCC Threats Against Jimmy KimmelTrump's FCC hinted it would flex its muscle when it came to bias claims against Republicans following Turning Point USA founder and MAGA firebrand Charlie Kirk's assassination in September.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel claimed in a monologue that Kirk was killed by a right-wing Trump supporter, even though days earlier, authorities revealed the free speech activist's alleged murderer, Tyler Robinson, had been indoctrinated by far-left ideology.\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatened \"immediate action\" against Kimmel, ABC, and Disney for \"deliberately misleading the public\" for the host's untrue claim that \"the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"\n\nKimmel was pulled off the air 'indefinitely\" by Disney later that day after Carr's comment on a right-wing podcast, although he only ended up being away for a total of six days.Host With the MostTrump's provocative comment about network broadcast licenses came shortly after he seemingly joked about stepping down from office after showing off his hosting skills at the Trump Kennedy Center Honors telecast on CBS. \n\n\"At the request of the Board, and just about everybody else in America, I am hosting the event,\" he boasted on Truth Social\n\nHe added, \"Tell me what you think of my 'Master of Ceremony' abilities. If really good, would you like me to leave the Presidency in order to make 'hosting' a full-time job?\"","summary":"Donald Trump cited overwhelmingly negative coverage on liberal network news and late night shows as reasons to pull their licenses.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/donald-trump-threatens-to-terminate-network-fcc-licenses/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/1ULu5S1PN/0x0/donald-trump-broadcast-license-threat-1766597011909.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-24 18:30:00","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":388795350,"title":"Kamala Harris savjetovala slobodne djevojke: “Nekad želite vezu petkom navečer, nekad nedjeljom ujutru”","text":"Bivša potpredsjednica Sjedinjenih Američkih Država i kandidatkinja demokrata za Bijelu kuću 2024. godine Kamala Harris tokom gostovanja na jednom podcastu davala je savjete djevojkama koje su same.\n\nBivša potpredsjednica Sjedinjenih Američkih Država i kandidatkinja demokrata za Bijelu kuću 2024. godine Kamala Harris tokom gostovanja na jednom podcastu davala je savjete djevojkama koje su same.\n\n“Izaberi da budeš s nekim ko ti dozvoljava da se smiješ sebi i njima.

In 2024, we lost more Americans to drug overdoses than we did at U.S. personnel in the entire Vietnam War. That’s insane. The only people that doesn’t think this is a good idea to send these narco terrorists to the bottom of the ocean and to for them to, you know, to rot in whatever their eternity is going to be is these Democrats that are in Washington, D.C. that are so deranged hatred towards President Trump.

Why allow it to poison our towns and our states?”\n\n“Yes, let’s go attack them and sink them in the waters that they’re using to transport this poison into our states,” he continued. “And by the way, this war power or this authority that the president is using is the same power that the other presidents, including Barack Obama that used it 500 times and killed 3,700 individuals, including U.S. citizens. And this is the same authority that President Trump is using, right? This has been going on for almost 25 years now. And so, for the fact that they said that he doesn’t have the authority, that’s not correct. We have terrorist organizations that are drug cartels that are bringing this poison into our state, into our states and to our country. The difference is the hemisphere that they’re operating underneath. Why would any person in their right mind think that it’s wrong that we are being proactive, attacking these drug cartels and keeping this poison from flooding our states?

Definitely read his piece to get the full picture. Me? I'm going to make the case, once again, that these countries cannot be called \"allies\" if they attack the rights of Americans. \n\nThe war on free speech in the West isn't going away, and until President Trump re-assumed office, the Biden administration was as belligerent against our rights to speak our minds as any petty tyrant in the UK, the EU, or other countries that we like to call the \"Free World.\"\n\nThe issue of free speech has been a flashpoint between the Trump administration and our \"allies\" in the West, and by now it should be clear that Trump—and even more so Rubio and Vance—are not merely making performative statements for the cameras. They clearly mean what they say. \n\nRubio has turned out to be a superstar and the clearest-speaking Secretary of State in my lifetime. He rarely minces words, so it doesn't take an interpreter to parse out diplo-speak to understand the message he just delivered to our allies in Europe. \n\n\"Are we going to live in a world where some American puts up a social media post and then gets to some airport somewhere and is arrested?\"Secretary of State Marco Rubio issues a warning to Americans over Europe's assault on the First Amendment. pic.twitter.com/tOG8Lf8Ov0— Free Speech America (@FreeSpeechAmer) December 23, 2025\n\nAre we gonna live in a world where some American puts up a social media posts and then gets to some airport somewhere and is arrested? Um, we’re also concerned about the impact that some of their policies are having on our social media platforms. As you recently saw, you know, X. Is facing this massive multimillion dollar fine that they’re gonna have to pay, I guess, if they want to continue to operate. But I think more importantly, I think it, it, it, it touches on the broader question that was asked a little bit earlier. We all talk about how these alliances, in many cases, our alliances with our European partners are built on our, on our common principles are common values as much as anything else. These aren’t just a geopolitical arrangement. It is an alliance with like-minded countries with whom we share values and principles. And one of those values and principles, we hope is freedom and the freedom of expression, and we’re concerned that that is eroding. \n\nIn other words, the United States' defense of Europe is predicated on preserving shared values, and Americans won't be inclined to spend so much blood and treasure to defend countries that are determined to erode Americans' rights and even pervert our political system. \n\nAnd make no mistake, speech policies in other Western countries are aimed directly at Americans and American elections. In the 2024 election, the Europeans and the United Kingdom did far more to interfere in the outcome than Vladimir Putin ever could have. The United Kingdom actually sent election workers to help Kamala Harris, and the European Union actually threatened to fine Elon Musk billions of dollars for having an online discussion with Donald Trump during the campaign. \n\nI remember thinking last year that this was one of the most chilling letters I’d ever read.

It treats freedom of speech as merely one factor to be weighed in the balance against “detrimental effects on civic discourse and public security.” And the letter was targeted specifically at a conversation on this very platform between @elonmusk, an American, and @realDonaldTrump, also an American then running for the US Presidency. When the letter talks about “content that may incite violence, hate and racism in conjunction with major political—or societal—events around the world” in this context, it’s talking about core political speech. More than any other document I’ve ever read, this letter bares the fangs of the global censorship-industrial complex and underscores that unelected bureaucrats in the EU are ready, willing, and able to use their regulatory reach to try to influence elections and nullify the First Amendment in the US. When I wrote earlier this month about the glaring inconsistency between US relations with the EU and NATO, this is exactly what I had in mind. If the sovereign nations of Europe allow the EU to attack fundamental freedoms in the US, those same nations cannot expect the US to defend fundamental freedoms in Europe.\n\nSeriously, now. How can we call countries that interfere with Americans' rights and our political system in such ways \"allies?\" Over the decades, Americans have spilled the blood of hundreds of thousands of our men and spent trillions of dollars to ensure the freedom and independence of these countries.\n\nThat letter from the EU is long, but it boils down to this: The EU hates Donald Trump and believes that his every utterance is \"hate speech,\" so if you let him onto X, we will fine your company billions of dollars. The fine for violating the EU's Digital Services Act is 6% of worldwide revenues, and Breton made clear than in Musk's case that would include all his businesses, and not just X.\n\nDear Mr Musk,I am writing to you in the context of recent events in the United Kingdom and in relation to the planned broadcast on your platform X of a live conversation between a US presidential candidate and yourself, which will also be accessible to users in the EU.I understand that you are currently doing a stress test of the platform. In this context, 1 am compelled to remind you of the due diligence obligations set out in the Digital Services Act (DSA), as outlined in my previous letter. As the individual entity ultimately controlling a platform with over 300 million users worldwide, of which one third in the EU, that has been designated as a Very Large Online Platform, you have the legal obligation to ensure X's compliance with EU law and in particular the DSA in the EU.This notably means ensuring, on one hand, that freedom of expression and of information, including media freedom and pluralism, are effectively protected and, on the other hand, that all proportionate and effective mitigation measures are put in place regarding the amplification of harmful content in connection with relevant events, including live streaming. which, if unaddressed, might increase the risk profile of X and generate detrimental effects on civic discourse and public security. This is important against the background of recent examples of public unrest brought about by the amplification of content that promotes hatred, disorder, incitement to violence, or certain instances of disinformation.It also implies i) informing EU judicial and administrative authorities without undue delay on the measures taken to address their orders against content considered illegal, according to national and/ or EU law, ii) taking timely, diligent, non-arbitrary and objective action upon receipt of notices by users considering certain content illegal, ill) informing users concerning the measures taken upon receipt of the relevant notice, and iv publicly reporting about content moderationIn this respect, I note that the DA obligations apply without exceptions or discrimination to the moderation of the whole user community and content of X (including yourself as a user with over 190 million followers) which is accessible to EU users and should be fulfilled in line with the risk-based approach of the DA, which requires greater due diligence in case of a foreseeable increase of the risk profile.As you know, formal proceedings are already ongoing against X under the DSA, notably in areas linked to the dissemination of illegal content and the effectiveness of the measures taken to combat disinformation.As the relevant content is accessible to EU users and being amplified also in our jurisdiction, we cannot exclude potential spillovers in the EU. Therefore, we are monitoring the potential risks in the EU associated with the dissemination of content that may incite violence, hate and racism in conjunction with major political - or societal - events around the world, including debates and interviews in the context of elections.Let me clarify that any negative effect of illegal content on X in the EU, which could be attributed to the ineffectiveness of the way in which X applies the relevant provisions of the DSA, may be relevant in the context of the ongoing proceedings and of the overall assessment of X's compliance with EU law. This is in line with what has already been done in the recent past, for example in relation to the repercussions and amplification of terrorist content or content that incites violence, hate and racism in the EU, such as in the context of the recent riots in the United Kingdom.I therefore urge you to promptly ensure the effectiveness of your systems and to report measures taken to my team.My services and I will be extremely vigilant to any evidence that points to breaches of the DA and will not hesitate to make full use of our toolbox, including by adopting interim measures, should it be warranted to protect EU citizens from serious harm.Yours sincerely,Thierry BretonCe: Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X\n\nBreton literally compared allowing Donald Trump to speak to amplifying terrorism. \n\nLetting Donald Trump speak, according to the European Union, was a threat to its existence and an illegal act. \n\nEvery American’s right to free speech is enshrined in our US Constitution.

Democratic National Committee Deputy Executive Director Libby Schneider told Newsweek that the party should “feel buoyed by the strong results we’ve seen up and down the ballot all year long.” Why It Matters Off-year special elections can be a gauge of the mood of the electorate between the presidential election and midterms set for next November, when Democrats are hoping to reclaim control of the House and Senate. The results suggest heightened Democratic enthusiasm, and polls for next year give the party an edge. They also served as a test of President Donald Trump’s popularity, as he supported Republican candidates in many of these races. What To Know Democrats began 2025 in a tough spot, still grappling with former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss in the last year’s presidential race. The party was divided about the best path forward as well as what contributed to Trump’s victory. Despite those woes, special elections this year yielded strong results for Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks during a news conference in Washington on May 5, 2025. Florida House Special Elections Democrats overperformed Harris’ margin by double digits in two Florida House special elections this year. Although Republicans still won each race, Democrats put up stronger-than-expected showings. In Florida’s 1st Congressional District, Republican Jimmy Patronis defeated Democrat Gay Valimont by about 14.6 percentage points, much narrower than Trump’s 37-point victory last November. In Florida’s 6th Congressional District, Republican Randy Fine defeated Democrat Josh Weil by about 14 points—a notable change from Trump’s 30-point victory in 2024. This race was viewed as being potentially competitive and drew national attention—and spending. Virginia’s 11th Congressional District Democrat James Walkinshaw overperformed in the special election to fill the seat vacated by the late Representative Gerry Connolly. He won the race in the Northern Virginia district by more than 50 points against Republican Stewart Whitson. Harris won the seat by 34 points last November. Arizona’s 7th Congressional District In Arizona’s 7th Congressional District, a seat that drifted rightward last November as Trump made inroads with Hispanic voters, Democrat Adelita Grijalva easily won the race to replace her father, the late Representative Raul Grijalva. She won her race by nearly 40 points, compared to Harris’ 22-point victory last November. Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District The special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District to replace former Representative Mark Green, who left Congress for a private-sector job, was viewed as a competitive race by both parties. Democrats were hopeful that Aftyn Behn could defeat Republican Matt Van Epps, and the race drew investment from both parties. Van Epps, who received the support of Trump, ended up winning, but Behn still made the race closer than expected. He won by just under nine points, compared to Trump’s 22-point victory last year. Miami Mayoral Race Democrat Eileen Higgins this month defeated Republican Emilio Gonzalez by nearly 20 points in the Miami mayoral election. She secured just over 59 percent of the vote, while Gonzalez received just under 41 percent. That’s a strong improvement for Democrats from 2024, when Harris won Miami by less than a percentage point. Miami was once a Democratic stronghold but has shifted right as Republicans have made gains among Hispanic voters, especially Cuban voters who are prominent in Miami. Wisconsin Supreme Court Election Although Wisconsin’s Supreme Court elections are technically nonpartisan, liberal-aligned Susan Crawford won by double digits against the conservative-aligned Brad Schimel in a state that Democrats lost at the presidential level last November. Crawford won by just about 10 percentage points; Trump carried Wisconsin by less than a percentage point in last year’s election. State Legislative Elections Democrats outperformed Harris in the following state legislative races by double digits, according to The Downballot: What People Are Saying Democratic National Committee Deputy Executive Director Libby Schneider, in a statement to Newsweek: “With another 40%+ overperformance by a Democrat from the top of the 2024 ticket last week in Kentucky, and as Democrats enter the midterm year, our party should feel buoyed by the strong results we’ve seen up and down the ballot all year long. Across red, purple, and blue states, Democrats have gotten off the mat and proven that when you organize everywhere, you can win anywhere — in every part of the country.“ CNN data analyst Harry Enten, this month after the Miami mayoral race: “It is just the latest shift that we’re seeing. That is what I think is so important going on here. We’ve seen in special elections. We saw it in Virginia gov. We saw it in New Jersey gov. We’ve seen it across the political map, where over and over and over again, the baseline from 2024, Democrats are consistently outperforming it.” Red Eagle Politics, a conservative political commentary account with more than 110,000 followers on X: “Democrats do better in off-year elections now. Cool, we get it. The thing is, Dems were massively overperforming in countless specials every year since Obama left office, almost ALL went back to baseline in the Midterm or Presidential year.” What Happens Next Whether or not these special-election overperformances translate to a strong midterm showing will be seen next November. Polls are giving Democrats an advantage on the generic ballot, but the results of the midterms could be shaped by factors such as how the economy fares over the coming months.","summary":"Democrats outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris&#039; margins in special elections across the country this year.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/list-of-democrats-double-digit-overperformances-in-2025-elections-11266946","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2213591265.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-24 16:27:01","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.148},{"id":388771808,"title":"‘This woman ran for President’: Kamala Harris’s dating advice sparks debate online","text":"For the time being as she takes a sabbatical from politics, Democrat leader Kamala Harris seems to be making a career move towards a dating coach. The former Vice President has been making quite the headlines on the dating advice she has for young girls and rather than making it easier for them, it seems she has them confused. On Tuesday, Harris appeared on the “Rich Little Broke Girls” podcast and shared amusing dating advice with her signature cackle. According to her, you can have all you want whenever you want. Kamala Harris’s dating adviceHarris, 61, who married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 had something really interesting to say to all the young and single woman dating out there. “Choose to be with someone who allows you to laugh at yourself and them,” said Harris. “Choose to be with someone who you know you like, going to the grocery store together, taking a walk together.”Up till here, her advice seemed like one from a wise woman who has experienced both dating and marriage. But soon, the tables turned. Harris also stated that there are “different phases in your life and you may not know what phase you’re in.”“Maybe you’re going to choose that you want to have that kind of Friday night relationship — or you want that Sunday morning relationship,” she continued. “Sometimes you can get both — and sometimes they just is oil and water. And that’s OK! Be in those phases where you are having fun!” she added. “Enjoy dating, by the way, because dating is fun. It’s supposed to be. Just do what, at the end of the day, when you go to sleep at night and when you wake up in the morning, makes you feel like, ‘I’m good,’” she suggested.While she met and married her husband in their 40s, she added that she couldn’t tell if they “would have really been in the same place” if they had met in their 20s.Netizens react to Kamala Harris’ dating advicePeople on the internet are less than impressed with Harris’s dating advice. As a former Vice President and presidential candidate, it seems the expectations for her were high. Americans wanted a wise and profound advice from her, but what they got was a casual dating tip. And it has left them enraged, considering it is coming from an experienced politician.“Nothing profound, but she acts like it's deep wisdom. Hard to believe this woman ran for president. But hey, Dems—please nominate her again in 2028. I’m begging you,” said a post on X. “Sounds like a cyclical recipe for insecurity and constant self-questioning of one's worth, based on sexuality's power dynamics. Figuring this out on your own is one thing; having a political leader say it is another,” pointed out another. “Was this career advancement or relationship advice? Can never tell with that one...,” trolled another referring to Harris’ past relationship with Willie Brown. “Honestly, the advice itself isn’t that crazy. She’s basically saying different people serve different roles in different seasons of life, and that it’s okay to be honest about what you want at the time. Some people will hear this as empowering, others will see it as unserious coming from a politician,” explained an X user. Kamala Harris on being a ‘humble’ womanElsewhere in the interview, Harris recalled a reporter asking her about criticisms of her lack of humility. \"I don’t aspire to be humble. Humility, yes, is very important. [It’s] a very dated perspective on who women should be. To say that women should be humble. Women should be quiet. Women should laugh quietly,\" she said.\"Women should not have a sense of humour. Women should not raise their voice,\" she continued. \"I have never felt burdened by those very dated, and I think out-of-touch standards.\" In an April 2024 interview with Drew Barrymore, she also addressed the criticism she faced on her signature cackle. \"Well, let me just tell you something: I have my mother’s laugh,\" she continued. \"And I grew up around a bunch of women, in particular, who laughed from the belly.\"While the netizens are expecting something sage from the politician all the time, sometimes one can be just an honest woman and share a tip that is ideal for a modern woman. Not everything around a politician needs to be politicised. Additionally, there were others on the internet who also found her dating advice ideal, writing comments such as, “Dating advice from Kamala Harris is something I never knew I needed but love to have.”","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-woman-ran-for-president-kamala-harriss-dating-advice-sparks-debate-online/articleshow/126162965.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126162971/126162971.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-24 16:09:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.012},{"id":388770616,"title":"Harris Suggests Mocking Her Laugh Is Sexist, As She Gives Young Women Dating Advice","text":"Kamala Harris suggested that those who make fun of her cackle are simply sexist, on an episode of the “Rich Little Broke Girls” podcast, where the former vice president and failed 2024 Democratic presidential candidate was providing the show's listeners with dating advice.\n\n“I don’t aspire to be humble. Humility, yes, is very important,” Harris said when asked about the criticism that she lacks humility. “[It’s] a very dated perspective on who women should be. To say women should be humble, women should be quiet, women should laugh quietly.”\n\n“Women should not have a sense of humor. Women should not raise their voice,” she went on. “I have never felt burdened by those very dated, and I think out-of-touch standards.”\n\nSurprisingly, Harris largely avoided identity politics during her short presidential run. \n\nAfter losing to President Trump, she wrote a book titled 107 Days detailing her campaign and embarked on a promotional tour. In the book, she blamed everyone from the American people to her former boss, Joe Biden, for her loss, throwing several high-profile Democrats under the bus. Yet publicly, she has been unwilling to voice those same criticisms.\n\n“Choose to be with someone who allows you to laugh at yourself and them,” she said. “Choose to be with someone who you know you like, going to the grocery store together, taking a walk together.”\n\n“There are different phases in your life, and you may not know what phase you’re in,” Harris explained. “Maybe you’re going to choose that you want to have that kind of Friday night relationship, or you want that Sunday morning relationship.\"\n\n“Maybe you’re going to choose that you want to have that kind of Friday night relationship, or you want that Sunday morning relationship.\n\n“Sometimes you can get both — and sometimes they just is oil and water.

He is my best friend,” she reflected.\n\n“And we’ve talked about it, if we had met in our 20s, I don’t know that we would have really been in the same place.”\n\nHarris should also be among the last people offering dating advice to young women, given that she famously launched her political career while dating former San Francisco mayor and political kingmaker Willie Brown. Harris’s introduction to the broader political stage largely occurred during their year-and-a-half relationship. \n\nWhile serving as Speaker of the California State Assembly, Brown appointed Harris to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and later placed her on the California Medical Assistance Commission, two positions that gave her significant political visibility. He also introduced her to the state’s political elite and Democratic donor network, paving the way for her eventual run for California attorney general.\n\nEditor's Note: President Trump is leading America into the \"Golden Age\" as Democrats try desperately to stop it. \n\nHelp us continue to report on President Trump's successes.

There is no point tinkering at the margins by debating wording, editing choices, or how a segment might be polished or improved. The problem is not execution. The entire 60 Minutes operation is corrupted, and it has been for a very long time, going back at least to the Dan Rather fake letter episode, which was explicitly designed to take down George W. Bush.That was followed by a long series of scandals, including 60 Minutes loudly insisting that Biden family corruption claims had been debunked, insisting that Hunter Biden’s laptop was not verified, and, more recently, deceptively stitching together Kamala Harris’s incoherent word salad into something that resembled a coherent answer. These are not the mistakes of a newsroom that occasionally gets something wrong. They are the consistent behaviors of a political propaganda operation.Framing this as a debate about journalistic standards completely misses the point. These are political operatives, not reporters, and the only serious course of action is to shut the operation down and rebuild from scratch with entirely new people.\n\nEverybody is pretending that this controversy is about journalistic standards and whether 60 Minutes did its work appropriately. There is a lot of talk about Standards and Practices, lawyers, vetting, and the like, as if crossing all the Ts and dotting all the Is in a manner that might keep CBS on just the right side of the \"slander\" line were the point. \n\nSome nuggets in here @axios:- Can confirm WH, State Dept and DHS all provided on record comment in response to CBS News journalists’ request for comment ahead of the segment. None of those comments made airhttps://t.co/hFkRmt5Uv9— Sara Fischer (@sarafischer) December 22, 2025\n\nThat's not even close to the point, and neither is the claim that every statement in the story is factual (which turns out not to be the case, if that matters by now). \n\nI can make factual statements about somebody that, for instance, pass the \"factual\" test without actually conveying truth. For instance, I could say that Dan Rather fondled his mother's breasts regularly, and that would be factually correct, and without context would be a shocking assertion. If I added that he was an infant breastfeeding at the time, the truth of the matter would be revealed by the context. The first statement makes him sound like a pervert; the second makes him sound perfectly normal. \n\nSharyn Alfonsi’s producer for the botched DeSantis story (Oriana Zill de Granados) is also the producer for the CECOT story. https://t.co/BByr8wnMan— Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 23, 2025\n\nIf a \"journalist\" only reports the \"fact\" without proper context, it's clear that they are not using \"journalistic\" judgment to inform people of important information; they intend to slander somebody in the slyest way possible and get away with it. \n\nThat is the sort of thing that went on here, just as has gone on at 60 Minutes for years. By massaging words or facts in ways intended to manipulate the viewer, these \"reporters\" are acting as political propagandists, not journalists getting to the truth. \n\nThey are doing the same thing to discredit Bari Weiss, accusing her of giving Donald Trump a \"kill switch\" on their reporting. \n\nThose of us who are interested in the truth—and I don't mean by that \"conservatives,\" but rather all people who are interested in understanding reality and communicating its nature fairly and accurately—need to get past the idea that we must pretend that Pravda propaganda is just another type of journalism. \n\n“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Ms. Alfonsi wrote in the note, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”Ms. Weiss said in a statement late Sunday: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nPropagandists aren't journalists, and we should quit acting as if they can be negotiated with or persuaded. As you can see from the very fact that the \"journalists\" in question lied about whether the administration would comment on their story, and then leaked their drivel into the media after their Editor in Chief told them to do better, these people have an agenda. They want to \"get\" Trump and they want to evict Bari Weiss. \n\nThey should be fired, not coddled or negotiated with.","url":"https://hotair.com/david-strom/2025/12/24/bari-fire-them-n3810220","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/ha/images/2024/63/6b5a7134-5aa7-4d2c-9f34-d5bf8091dabd.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-24 15:00:31","author":"David Strom","authors":["David Strom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.428}]}
