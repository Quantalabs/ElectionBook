The ethics code would meanwhile force judges to declare gifts and possible conflicts of interest.The US Supreme Court plays an outsize role in determining the lives of ordinary Americans, with justices appointed for life deciding on almost every key issue from reproductive health to the environment.It currently has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three right-leaning justices appointed by Trump while he was president.But public opinion has recently turned against an institution once seen as the last impartial arm of the US government, with a recent poll showing nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that the court's decisions are mainly political.As well as the abortion judgement, the court has also rolled back the power of federal agencies and blocked Biden's signature student debt forgiveness plan.It then partially ruled in early July in favor of Trump's claims that he had immunity from prosecution for acts committed while president.Trump is now using that ruling to challenge his recent criminal conviction in a porn star hush-money case and a series of other prosecutions.Meanwhile the Supreme Court has been rocked by ethics scandals involving arch-conservative justices.Justice Clarence Thomas recently admitted that two luxury vacations he took in 2019 were paid for by a billionaire Republican political donor.Thomas, the longest-service justice on the court, has also ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election, after his wife took part in the drive to keep Trump in power despite his electoral loss.And Justice Samuel Alito has rejected calls to recuse himself from some Trump-related cases after flags linked to the former president's false election fraud claims were discovered to have been flown outside his home and vacation property.Legal expert Steven Schwinn warned that Biden had a \"close to zero\" chance of getting the plan through Congress.But Biden was probably trying to \"raise public consciousness\" and \"introduce the Supreme Court as an election issue,\" Schwinn, a law professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, told AFP.","summary":"Joe Biden unveiled plans Monday for sweeping US Supreme Court reforms, as he seeks to cement his legacy in the twilight of his presidency despite Republicans branding the proposals dead on arrival.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/biden-unveils-long-shot-plan-overhaul-us-supreme-court-3738404","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4539014/us-president-joe-biden-speaks-lbj-presidential-library-austin-texas-july-29-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 00:42:11","author":"Brendan Smialowski With Danny Kemp In Washington","authors":["Brendan Smialowski With Danny Kemp In Washington"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":252923062,"title":"North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper withdraws from consideration to be Kamala Harris' running mate","text":"North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is no longer in the running to be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate this election season.

Josh Shapiro laid into Donald Trump in a show that he has what it takes to be Kamala Harris’ running mate. The Democratic governor made the case against Trump by claiming the former president is ‘weird,’ ‘dangerous’ and proposing some ‘scary s***’ on his 2024 platform – and claimed the former president is ‘scared’ of the vice president. But Shapiro also sought to prove he was ready to take on Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) during a rally for Harris’ campaign outside of Philadelphia. Pennsylvania is massively important in this election cycle and is one of the few battleground states that could determine the outcome in November. Trump nabbed a victory in Pennsylvania in 2016 by just 0.7 percent before the state flipped blue in 2020 to go for Biden over the incumbent by a 1.2 percent gap. The Keystone State is one of the three toss-ups for 2024, according to Cook Political Report. The other two are rust belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin. A Bloomberg report Monday reveals that Shapiro as well as Arizona Gov. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are the top three contenders Harris is considering adding to her ticket. Joined by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during a stop in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Monday afternoon, Shapiro launched expletive-ridden attacks against Trump and Vance, whom he would debate if selected to join Harris’ ticket. ‘I have a message to Donald Trump – stop s*** talking America,’ Shapiro said to an auditorium of about 1,000 Democrat voters. ‘This is the greatest country on the face of the earth, let’s start acting like it.’ ‘You ever see this guy? When he’s on the stage, he’s like kind of meanders over, he can’t really walk well. And he goes over to the flag and he, like, hugs the flag,’ the Pennsylvania Governor said in reference to a bit the former president sometimes repeats during appearances. ‘I love the flag, but it’s a weird thing he does,’ Shapiro added. ‘But while he’s hugging the flag, you know what he’s doing? He’s ripping away our freedom. That’s what he’s all about.’ He also claimed Trump is scared to debate Harris after the ex-president said he wouldn’t commit to anything until she was officially the party’s nominee, which happens next month at the Democratic National Convention. The governor said that Harris is ‘not only ready, she’s damn ready.’ ‘You know who else knows she’s ready? Donald Trump knows she’s ready,’ Shapiro added. ‘And you know how I know this?’ he went on. ‘Because he’s afraid to debate her now. And it’s not just because she’s a skilled debater… He’s afraid to debate her because he can’t defend his record.’ Whitmer claims that Harris will choose her running mate in the next six or seven days. In her remarks at the Wissahickon High School gymnasium on Monday, the Michigan governor seemed to join-in on Shapiro’s audition for the VP role. ‘Another governor who believes in our three-part strategy: Get s*** done,’ Whitmer said of her Pennsylvania counterpart. The crowd then began chanting the phrase. Harris entering the race has injected enthusiasm in eastern Pennsylvania voters and many told DailyMail.com that they were getting ‘sad’ continuing to support Biden before he exited the race last weekend. ‘I am absolutely more excited to vote,’ mother of one and store manager Amanda Baker, 40, said. ‘Like when Biden was running, I knew I had to vote because you have to do your civic duty to save the country,’ she continued. ‘But now I’m like excited to vote and tell people who I’m voting for.’ Leah, 48, works at a hospital in Lehigh Valley and told DailyMail.com: ‘I feel a spring in my step.’ ‘Also it’s more fun to talk about, you know, the election, whilst before it was almost like something you wanted to hide because it was just like so sad and depressing with Joe Biden.’ A door-knocker in Conshohocken said he got tired of arguing with people about Biden’s age. ‘I’ve been kind of dragging my feet because I didn’t want to argue about whether he [Biden] was too old or not too old,’ said Bill Gwynn, 70. ‘Now I’ve got a story to tell.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

He also called on lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity. Biden, who has less than six months left in his presidency, detailed the contours of his court proposal in an address at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, where he was marking the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. His calls for dramatic changes in the court have little chance of being approved by a closely divided Congress with 99 days to go before Election Day. Still, Democrats hope it’ll help focus voters as they consider their choices in a tight election. The likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has sought to frame her race against Republican ex-President Donald Trump as “a choice between freedom and chaos,” quickly endorsed the Biden proposal. “Extremism is undermining the public confidence in the court’s decisions,” Biden said. He added, “We can and must prevent abuse of presidential power and restore faith in the Supreme Court.” The White House is looking to tap into the growing outrage among Democrats about the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, issuing opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that stood for decades. Liberals also have expressed dismay over revelations about what they say are questionable relationships and decisions by some members of the conservative wing of the court that suggest their impartiality is compromised. Biden pointed to the 2013 high court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and rolling back abortion rights, and a 2023 decision “eviscerating” affirmative action in college admission programs as three prime examples of what he saw as “outrageous” decisions that have shaken Americans’ faith in the high court. Harris, in a statement, said the reforms being proposed are needed because “there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court.” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House.” Biden in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of his address shrugged off Johnson’s pronouncement that the proposal is going nowhere. “I think that’s what he is — dead on arrival,” Biden offered. He added that he would “figure out a way” to get it done. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and “reduce the chance that any single president imposes undue influence for generations to come.” He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a court code of ethics that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden also is calling on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. That decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. “This nation was founded on the principle there are no kings in America,” Biden said. “Each of us are equal before the law. No one is above the law. For all practical purposes, the court’s decision almost certainly means the president can violate their oath, flout our laws, and face no consequences.” Most Americans supported some form of age limit for Supreme Court justices in an AP-NORC poll from August 2023. Two-thirds wanted Supreme Court justices to be required to retire by a certain age. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to favor a mandatory retirement age, 77% to 61%. Americans across age groups tend to agree on the desire for age limits – those age 60 and over were as likely as any other age group to be in favor of this limit for Supreme Court justices. The first three justices who would potentially be affected by term limits are on the right. Justice Clarence Thomas has been on the court for nearly 33 years. Chief Justice John Roberts has served for 19 years, and Justice Samuel Alito has served for 18. Supreme Court justices served an average of about 17 years from the founding until 1970, said Gabe Roth, executive director of the group Fix the Court. Since 1970, the average has been about 28 years. Both conservative and liberal politicians alike have espoused term limits. An enforcement mechanism for the high court’s code of ethics, meanwhile, could bring the Supreme Court justices more in line with other federal judges, who are subject to a disciplinary system in which anyone can file a complaint and have it reviewed. An investigation can result in censure and reprimand. Last week, Justice Elena Kagan called publicly for creating a way to enforce the new ethics code, becoming the first justice to do so. The last time Congress ratified an amendment to the Constitution was 32 years ago. The 27th Amendment, ratified in 1992, states that Congress can pass a bill changing the pay for members of the House and the Senate, but such a change can’t take effect until after the next November elections are held for the House. Trump has decried court reform as a desperate attempt by Democrats to “Play the Ref.” “The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site this month. There have been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Thomas accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed during the Obama administration, has faced scrutiny after it surfaced her staff often prodded public institutions that hosted her to buy copies of her memoir or children’s books. Alito rejected calls to step aside from Supreme Court cases involving Trump and Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection defendants despite a flap over provocative flags displayed at his homes that some believe suggested sympathy to people facing charges over storming the U.S. Capitol to keep Trump in power. Alito says the flags were displayed by his wife. “These scandals involving the justices have caused public opinion to question the court’s fairness and independence that are essential to basically carrying its mission of equal justice under the law,” Biden said. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back that Biden’s proposal amounted to taking a “torch” to the “crown jewel of our system of government.” “President Biden and his leftist allies don’t like the current composition of the court so they want to shred the Constitution to change it,” McConnell said. ___ Madhani reported from Washington.

Indeed, they showed just how far they’re willing to go to take down Donald Trump and win an election. And that they are the real threat to democracy and America’s political system. The plan, rolled out by President Biden and Veep Kamala Harris, would impose 18-year term limits on justices, essentially, a plan to pack the court with liberals. They’d subject justices to a code of conduct you can bet will be used similarly against justices they dislike. Plus, they want more limits on presidential immunity after the Supreme Court reminded them that, under the Constitution, presidents cannot be charged with crimes for official actions they take while in office. That could help promote their strategy of using lawfare against political foes. Make no mistake: This would be a radical upturning of an institution that has served the nation well for decades. Dems aim to undermine the court’s legitimacy and overturn its decisions — all to frame Trump and win an election. Their sock puppets in the media laid the groundwork for a code of conduct with their perverted attack on the conservative justices — Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, in particular. But it’s all theater. It’s part of the Dems’ fantasyland claim that “democracy is at stake” and the end of America as we know it is nigh. How can we know? Because Biden himself once opposed court-packing. Because the idea for term limits has come up only now, with conservatives holding a majority of the court’s nine seats. Indeed, Dems were quite happy with lifetime appointments when left-leaning justices, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, were in the majority. Also because there’s no actual problem here this plan aims to fix (other than Dems not getting their way on key issues before the court). Rather, the nation’s high court is functioning not only as it was meant to function — but in precisely the way you’d want it to: i.e., not as an extension of the political system, but as an independent branch of government that puts a check on other branches. Under the Biden-Harris, the court would no longer be an apolitical arbiter that judges issues — like the constitutionality of laws, say, and the limits of congressional and executive-branch power — based on the merits. But here’s the kicker: Dems know none of this is going to happen. And that doesn’t matter: They’ll just blame those evil Republicans for blocking “reform.” Let’s face it: The idea of subverting an independent body to the will of politicians is precisely what voters should be most worried about. It would destroy a political system that has long served America well. Democrats may be right that “democracy” is at risk this year — from them.","summary":"Democrats just revealed their true, sick political nature with their cynical push to remake the Supreme Court.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/29/opinion/the-biden-harris-plan-to-wreck-the-supreme-court-is-the-real-threat-to-americas-democratic-system/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/president-joe-biden-vice-president-86026154_dc4fe0-e1722298056806.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 00:27:45","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":252922986,"title":"How Elon Musk allowed X to become a stalwart platform for Trump supporters","text":"On July 13, less than an hour after the attempted assassination on US presidential candidate Donald Trump, Elon Musk posted the following to his more than 190 million followers on X (formerly Twitter): A few days later it was reported Musk planned on committing US$45 million per month to a pro-Trump super political action committee (PAC). Musk denied this and said he had established a new “America PAC”, with a focus was on “meritocracy and individual freedom”. It’s expected Trump will benefit from donations by Musk, who has said “Republicans are mostly, but not entirely, on the side of merit and freedom”. Musk has previously described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and political moderate. His political views often haven’t aligned neatly with the left-right binary. In the context of US presidential elections, however, he supported the Democratic candidate in every election between 2008 and 2020. Now he is being viewed as a potential meal ticket for conservatives – particularly after his endorsement of Trump. So what changed? The death of Twitter – and birth of X Ever since Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 and rebranded it as X, the platform has been criticised for allowing hate speech and bots to proliferate. Research suggests both accusations are true. According to a 2023 report from The Centre for Countering Digital Hate, Musk’s ownership corresponded with a 119% rise in tweets relating to a conspiracy that claims LGBTQ+ people are grooming children. The report sparked Musk’s ire and legal backlash. This week, Musk is in the news for using transphobic rhetoric in reference to his own daughter, Vivian Wilson, whom he has described as being “dead — killed by the woke mind virus”. This isn’t the first time Musk has been involved in anti-trans rhetoric. Last year, a colleague and I conducted our own analysis of X posts that revealed the strong presence of predominantly right-wing bot accounts. Over the course of the first Republican primary debate (and simultaneously streamed interview between Trump and right-wing media figure Tucker Carlson) in August, we found a coordinated network of more than 1,200 accounts promoting the conspiracy theory that Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 US presidential election. This content received more than three million impressions. We also found a sprawling network of 1,305 unique bot accounts (many of which were pro-Trump). Beyond this, Musk’s rule over X has prompted hundreds of thousands of users (including journalists and academics) to delete or abandon their accounts. But while left-leaning public figures lost followers, reinstated right-wing personalities including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate and Trump himself have rapidly gained them. Last year, NPR News was falsely labelled as “state-affiliated media” – a label that until then had been reserved for propaganda outlets from autocratic regimes. X later revised the label to call it “government-funded media”, despite NPR stating less than 1% of its budget is from the government. What this mean for Trump supporters? X was once touted as being a “global town square” where journalists, politicians and interested citizens could congregate for public debate. But given the number of journalists, academics and left-leaning users who have left, it seems unlikely it will ever return to this. In the absence of diverse perspectives and robust moderation practices, it’s no surprise it has become a space for Trump supporters to mobilise. Just this week, Musk seemingly violated his platform’s policies by sharing a deepfake video of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris without noting that it was satirical. The video, which includes voice manipulation, purports to show Harris making negative comments about President Joe Biden, Democrats and her own qualifications to be president. Musk also called Harris an “extinctionist” in relation to a video in which she discusses young people’s climate anxieties. Offline, Musk has reportedly been involved in meetings with a group of conservative billionaires aiming to ensure Trump wins the election. As to why he has changed his political tune from being a consistent Democratic voter, we can only speculate. Before his acquisition of Twitter, Musk claimed his problems with the platform stemmed from the “far left” management’s censorship of content. Reporters have also noted Musk’s actions often seem motivated by personal grievances and business motives. For example, after the Biden administration didn’t invite Tesla to a White House event for electric vehicle manufacturers, Musk took to Twitter to post criticisms of the US president. As the world’s richest man – with key positions in companies including Space X, Tesla, Neuralink and The Boring Company – Musk’s business bottom line has long been subject to policies and regulatory action from both sides of government. What’s next? Musk isn’t the first billionaire to air his personal political grievances online. Nor is he the first to throw money at whatever candidate’s policies suit him most. But he is arguably the first to do so while having control over a social media mouthpiece the likes of X. Returning to the upcoming US presidential elections, it is particularly concerning that Musk is seemingly allowing both incendiary speech and bots on his platform – especially in light of the Russian interference in the 2016 elections. And our own research from last year shows X’s bot problem is far from solved. In the lead-up to the November election, it will be important for researchers to keep track of automated activity and accounts on X. Unfortunately, they won’t be able to do this as they have in the past. Much of the valuable research that was once conducted through free access to Twitter’s API stopped last year when Musk made this access prohibitively expensive.","summary":"While Elon Musk has described himself as ‘politically moderate’, his words and actions over the past few months suggest he is picking sides.","url":"https://theconversation.com/how-elon-musk-allowed-x-to-become-a-stalwart-platform-for-trump-supporters-235516","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/609820/original/file-20240729-17-pc93jk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=7%2C197%2C4866%2C2433&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 00:24:10","author":"Katherine M.

Pritzker's complex financial portfolio could take time to vet","text":"WASHINGTON — The vast fortune of billionaire Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker may take time to vet — which could be a factor — as Vice President Kamala Harris vets potential running mates under a tight deadline. Selecting a vice president will be the first major decision for Harris, whose presidential campaign as of Monday is only eight days old. And she does not have much time to make it. A process that in other years takes a presumptive presidential nominee months is being squeezed into days. Democrats want to hold a virtual nomination for president and vice president no later than Aug. 7 in order to not risk being left off the ballot in a GOP-run state. If no other Democrat jumps into the race, electronic voting could start as early as Thursday. The roll call of the states at the Democratic convention in Chicago, kicking off on August 19, will be symbolic but important in messaging and for firing up the troops. The tight timetable means Harris has to make her pick at the political equivalent of warp speed. Pritzker is part of a strong battle-tested Democratic bench for Harris to consider: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. And even though Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told CBS News on Monday: “I am not a part of the vetting,” that could change in a snap. Vetting is the word used to describe the background check and investigation to be done on anyone in the running for vice president. That’s an intense process. So that brings us to Pritzker and his enormous wealth. In an interview on MSNBC on Saturday — and in other interviews — Pritzker brushed aside questions about his dealings with the Harris camp when it comes to vice presidential vetting. “I’m not gonna talk about the interactions I’ve had with the campaign,” Pritzker said. “But let’s just say I’m aware that the vetting process is quite an in-depth one, one that takes often weeks and months and there’s really only about eight days until a decision probably has to be made.” Because Pritzker, in my analysis, opened the door in that interview about the time it will take for an in-depth vet, I’m going to walk through it. The financial life of billionaire Pritzker is complex. Pritzker’s assets are in a blind trust. The governor’s trust makes investment decisions. Pritzker’s holdings are not a secret. He’s been through two well-funded campaigns where his GOP opponents had the resources to dig into his financial holdings. By law, Pritzker files a Statement of Economic Interest with the Illinois secretary of state. His most recent report is dated May 1, 2023. According to the statement, the disclosure covers “every underlying asset in any entity in which Gov. Pritzker, his spouse or his children had a direct beneficial ownership interest” that exceeded $10,000. Any source of income over $7,000 also has to be listed. Pritzker in his 2023 disclosure goes on to list 270 assets. That’s followed by a list of 127 entities that provide income. While the state Statement of Economic Interest disclosures may seem at first blush useful to taxpayers, in reality its utility is limited. That’s because only the name of the entity has to be reported. The address of the business or the size of the holding is not required. Some of Pritzker’s assets are easy to discern and lack controversy: Amazon, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s and Walt Disney. The dozens of other assets Pritzker holds are not obvious. Pritzker’s finances are a just a piece of the vetting. His record as governor should not be lost in the conversation. Pritzker has done almost everything on the Democratic agenda: codify abortion rights in Illinois — with his Think Big political operation fighting nationally on the abortion front; banning assault weapons; expanding healthcare; and overseeing a massive capital plan to rebuild roads and bridges. As Harris evaluates her vice president options, she has a lot of factors to weigh, including the ability of Pritzker to use his fortune to help the ticket. But the reality is the Harris team only has a short time to scrub Pritzker’s extensive holdings, and the clock is ticking.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/07/29/kamala-harris-president-election-politics-running-mate-campaign-washington-dnc-pritzker-vetting","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cd13f1c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4911x2803+0+235/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F05%2F62%2Fb43d49564f86b147b466f6baded7%2Felec","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 00:17:53","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":252922346,"title":"Trump launching ad blitz to try to slow Harris surge","text":"Camera IconThe Trump campaign has had to pivot to find a new message targeting Kamala Harris.

Cooper, 67, withdrew before Harris formally began soliciting vetting material from potential vice presidents, the people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive search process. Harris’ search is ongoing and her teams of lawyers and political aides are still reviewing information on a narrowing list of potential candidates. Cooper, the former chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, has been close to Harris since they were both state attorneys general. His potential selection was seen as a possible asset in shifting North Carolina — the Democrats’ only significant opportunity to expand on their 2020 map — into Harris’ hands. Under the state constitution, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who is the GOP’s nominee to replace the term-limited Cooper, becomes acting governor and can assume the Democrat’s powers when he travels out of state. Cooper, according to one of the people, has expressed concern about what Robinson might do if he were to leave the state extensively for campaign travel. Robinson is an ardent social conservative, who once called abortion “child sacrifice.” In various church pulpits, Robinson has asserted men as the rightful leaders in church and society. He once mused that leaders of the original birth control movement in the U.S. were “witches, all of ’em.” He has discussed LGBTQ people with words like “filth” and “maggots.” The New York Times first reported that Cooper had withdrawn himself from the process, but did not detail the timing of his decision or his rationale.

Dhillon told the Washington Examiner. On Monday, Biden unveiled a plan to address recent rulings by the conservative-majority Supreme Court that were disfavored by Democrats, namely the July 1 presidential immunity decision in Trump v. United States. His plan proposes term limits for justices, who currently have lifetime appointments, an enforceable ethics code, and a constitutional amendment to overturn the recent ruling that grants former presidents substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts. Biden’s plans have been reported since at least mid-July, prior to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Since then, legal experts from both sides of the political aisle have expressed agreement that basic constitutional rules make Biden’s high court plans highly unlikely. Undoing the Trump immunity decision So far, the one planned amendment in the three-part plan requested the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment,” which aims to clarify that the Constitution does not shield former presidents from federal indictments, trials, convictions, or sentencing. This move would aim to undo the 6-3 ruling that found former presidents have immunity from being prosecuted for official acts while they were in office. However, to amend the Constitution, the proposal must be approved by two-thirds of both chambers of Congress and then ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures or state conventions — a process that has succeeded only 27 times in history, with the last amendment ratified in 1992. Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, questioned in a July 18 Substack blog why Biden was merely highlighting the recent Trump v. United States decision when there are multitudes of other high court decisions Democrats disfavor. “What about an amendment to overrule Rucho and reaffirm that the federal courts can adjudicate severe partisan gerrymandering? Or an amendment to overrule Citizens United and allow Congress to meaningfully limit the money in our elections? Or an amendment to overrule Dobbs? All of these have the exact same chance of getting two-thirds of the House and Senate to approve them (0.0%),” Vladeck wrote. Given the slim divide between Democrats and Republicans in Congress and the fragmented state governments, passing such an amendment, especially one favored by a single party, is highly improbable. 18-year term limits for justices In addition to term limits for justices, Biden referenced the 22nd Amendment, which imposes a two-term limit on presidents following Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four terms. This portion of the plan aims to impose 18-year term limits on the justices. However, imposing term limits on Supreme Court justices through an amendment faces similar improbabilities. Even if congressional Democrats could pass term limits as a law, it would likely be challenged in court and potentially struck down, as term limits for justices are not specified in the Constitution. Some legal experts believe this too would need to be approved via the required 60-vote constitutional amendment process, while others, such as Vladeck, suggested that the limits might only apply to “future officeholders.” “So, in my view, statutory term limits would be constitutional only if they went into effect starting with the next justice,” Vladeck said. “That means that, 30-40 years from now, when the last of the current justices leaves the Court, we’d have nine justices with term limits—but not tomorrow.” An enforceable ethics code Biden also called for Congress to pass a law establishing an enforceable ethics code for the Supreme Court, requiring disclosure of gifts, abstention from political activities, and recusal from cases with conflicts of interest. Such a law would also need to pass Congress and likely secure 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. Additionally, Vladeck voiced caution over an enforceable ethics code on the nine justices, saying that if anyone other than the justices is given power to enforce a code on the members for violating roles, “we’d no longer have ‘one Supreme Court,’ as Article III, Section 1 says we must; we’d have two.” Is there any way Biden’s plans could be enacted? Mike Davis, founder of the conservative Article III Project and a former clerk to Justice Neil Gorsuch, suggested the only way for Democrats to accomplish Biden’s plan is for Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to win against Trump in the November election. “If Kamala Harris wins the White House, she will almost certainly carry the House and Senate with her,” Davis posted to X.“They will nuke the Senate’s legislative filibuster — 60 vote threshold — and pack the Supreme Court with radicals,” Davis added. For now, given that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has not brought a similar Democratic bill to the floor, meeting the 60-vote threshold in a divided Congress appears unlikely. The Washington Examiner contacted Schumer for a comment. Meanwhile, other judiciary advocates, such as Kelly Shackelford, chief counsel for First Liberty Institute, renewed concerns that Biden’s plans merely aim to “subvert the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.” “Term limits are simply court-packing by another name,” Shackelford said, adding that if Biden’s plans were somehow successful, “the judiciary will no longer be a safeguard of our civil liberties but will instead be little more than a political tool used to crush the freedom of Americans.”","summary":"President Joe Biden’s ambitious three-pronged proposal to reform the Supreme Court is not likely to survive past its 15 minutes of fame, legal experts from across the partisan spectrum say. “It&#8217;s all posturing for the election season to try to garner votes amongst the far Left but also to bully the United States Supreme Court [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3103055/biden-supreme-court-reforms-already-on-life-support-legal-experts-say/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24184012822003-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:57:02","author":"Kaelan Deese","authors":["Kaelan Deese"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":252922820,"title":"Biden proposed enforceable ethics code and term limits for Supreme Court. How might they work?","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden on Monday proposed major changes for the U.S. Supreme Court: an enforceable code of ethics, term limits for justices and a constitutional amendment that would limit the justices’ recent decision on presidential immunity. There’s almost no chance of the proposal passing a closely divided Congress with Election Day looming, but the ideas could still spark conversation with public confidence in the court hitting an all-time low amid ethical revelations about some justices. It also comes against the backdrop of a contentious presidential election and growing Democratic outrage about recent decisions from the conservative-majority court. Here’s a look at how the ideas, how they might work, and the possible stumbling blocks: How would justices’ terms be limited? Limiting how long justices serve on the nation’s highest court has broad support among Americans, polling indicates. A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July 2022 found 67 per cent of Americans support a proposal to set a specific number of years that justices serve instead of life terms, including 82 per cent of Democrats and 57 per cent of Republicans. Biden’s proposal would limit justices to 18-year terms, a system that he says would make nominations more predictable, less arbitrary, and reduce the chances that a single president could shape the court for generations to come. There’s a big problem: The Constitution gives all federal judges lifetime tenure, unless they resign, retire or are removed. There are ideas about how to impose term limits without an amendment — but if such a law passed and were challenged in court the justices could end up ruling on it and it's unclear how they'd come down, said Charles Geyh, a law professor at Indiana University and expert in judicial ethics. How would a code of ethics be enforced? The Supreme Court didn't have a formal code of ethics until last year, when the justices adopted one in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices, like Clarence Thomas. It still lacks a means of enforcement — something Biden says is “common sense.” Members of Congress, for example, generally can’t accept gifts worth more than US$50. Anyone can file complaints against other federal judges, who are subject to censure and reprimand. Justice Elena Kagan voiced support for adding an enforcement mechanism to the Supreme Court ethical code in a public appearance last week. Still, making the high court's ethical code enforceable raises thorny questions about how it might be enforced, and by whom. Lower courts say their discipline process isn’t intended to directly police their code of ethics, maintaining the code is too broadly phrased for violations to directly translate into discipline, Geyh said. That ethical code is overseen by the Judicial Conference, which is headed up by Chief Justice John Roberts. He “might be reluctant to use whatever power the conference has against his colleagues,” Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at NYU School of Law, said in an email. What about presidential immunity? Biden is also calling for a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court's recent decision giving former president Donald Trump — and all other presidents — broad immunity from criminal prosecution. The amendment would “make clear that there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office,” Biden wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. “We are a nation of laws — not of kings or dictators.” It wouldn't be the first time - the Constitution has been amended about five times to in US history to overturn a Supreme Court decision, Geyh said. But constitutional amendments have even higher hurdles than new laws. The proposal must get support from two-thirds of both the House and Senate and then be ratified by three-quarters of state legislatures. No new amendments have passed in more than 30 years. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has called Biden's proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House.” Biden has resisted other calls to reform the Supreme Court A former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden has long resisted calls to reform the Supreme Court. In 2021, he fulfilled a campaign promise by convening a commission to study potential changes to the court. It was not charged with making recommendations and cautioned that excessive change could potentially erode democracy. The latest proposals come years later, and amid growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers. There's also a hotly contested presidential election against Trump underway. Even if Biden's ideas aren't likely to pass, they could draw voter attention. Vice president Kamala Harris, who Biden endorsed for president after dropping out of the race, backed the proposal.

The reasons behind his withdrawal remain unclear, with both the Harris campaign and Cooper's office declining to comment on the development.Newsweek contacted Harris and Cooper's office via email for comment.As a two-term governor of a battleground state, Cooper brought valuable experience and electoral success to the table. His decision to step back from national consideration raises questions about the challenges and pressures facing potential running mates in this unique electoral cycle.The timing of Cooper's exit is particularly notable, coming just weeks after President Biden's surprising departure from the race. Biden's endorsement of Harris as his successor followed what many observers described as a lackluster debate performance against former President Donald Trump, sparking intense discussions within the Democratic Party about leadership and electoral strategy.With Cooper's withdrawal, attention now focuses on the remaining candidates on Harris's shortlist. According to recent reports from Bloomberg and other media outlets, the vice president has narrowed her choices to three elected officials:1. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona 2. Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania 3. Governor Tim Walz of MinnesotaEach of these potential running mates brings unique strengths to the ticket. Kelly, a former astronaut, offers national security credentials and represents a crucial swing state. Shapiro, as the governor of Pennsylvania, could help secure a key battleground state that has been hotly contested in recent elections. Walz, leading Minnesota, provides a Midwest presence that could appeal to voters in a region that has often determined presidential outcomes.The Harris campaign has remained tight-lipped about the selection process, with a spokesperson stating only that the vice president has \"directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates.\" This careful approach reflects the high stakes involved in the decision.As the selection process continues, the remaining candidates are likely to face intense scrutiny from both the media and the public. Their past records, policy positions, and personal histories will all be examined as indicators of their potential performance on the national stage.The compressed timeline for Harris's decision adds an extra layer of pressure to the process. With the Democratic National Convention (DNC) looming and the general election campaign set to kick into high gear, the vice president must balance the need for thorough vetting with the urgency of presenting a unified ticket to the American people.","summary":"North Carolina Gov.

Add to that list a series of hastily organised Zoom calls to raise money and rev up supporters – including one on Monday night built around “White Dudes for Harris”. In barely a week since US President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris, tens of thousands of people have joined virtual gatherings spun up by activists and outside organisations to rally support for the vice-president among specific groups including black women, Hispanic women, black men, Asian-American, Native Americans and the LGBTQ community. The calls reflect how Democrats, including Biden, have frequently relied on voters from broad and disparate backgrounds to piece together a diverse coalition of support. Biden’s 2020 victory, for example, relied on segments of the population ranging from organised labour to conservative, suburban women disillusioned with Republican Donald Trump. We are organising ourselves this time because we aren’t going to sit around and let the MAGA crowd bully other white guys into voting for a hateful and divisive ideology Ross Morales Rocketto, White Dudes for Harris founder Organisers of Monday night’s “white dudes” Zoom expect 100,000 attendees to join a gathering featuring appearances from actors including Mark Ruffalo, Sean Astin, Mark Hamill and Bradley Whitford. Democratic officials including Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, all of whom have been mentioned as potential running mates for Harris, are also set to take part. “We are organising ourselves this time because we aren’t going to sit around and let the MAGA crowd bully other white guys into voting for a hateful and divisive ideology,” Ross Morales Rocketto, a progressive operative who founded the group, said in a statement. He was referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement. This month’s Zoom calls have not been organised by Harris’ team, but her campaign welcomes the assist – and the millions of dollars in fundraising. “Winning campaigns are powered by real, organic support,” Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. The calls often feature celebrities who have supported Biden’s campaign in the past. And their sheer number shows how the vice-president will need to appeal to different facets of the increasingly pluralistic population. The political networking group “Win With Black Women” held a Zoom meeting the same night that Biden dropped out, and saw its number of participants swell to more than 44,000. It featured celebratory speeches from activists, business leaders, members of Congress and staff from the vice-president’s office. After that, a “Win With Black Men” virtual fundraising event attracted more than 53,000 attendees. They heard several presentations, including by 27-year-old Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost of Florida, who had been a leading advocate for Biden’s campaign among younger voters, and Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock. A Zoom of “White Women for Harris” attracted more than 164,000 participants – so many that the platform struggled to meet the demand. It was headlined by the likes of singer Pink and football star Megan Rapinoe. “As white women, we are the ones who have the privilege, of course, and we too have had to fight – and continue to fight – for our equality our selfhood, our freedom,” actor Connie Britton told participants. She supported Biden’s campaign in 2020 and this cycle before shifting enthusiastically to Harris. Trump’s campaign has also organised different groups of supporters by their distinct backgrounds, including events in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia for black voters and “Latino Americans for Trump”. Some Republicans have criticised Harris for her “diversity, equality and inclusion politics”, arguing that the vice-president’s political career was helped by Democratic efforts to promote diversity. That is despite House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders on Capitol Hill discouraging lines of criticism they considered racist and sexist – instead urging members of the party to focus their criticisms on Harris’ political record.","summary":"Organisers of the ‘white dudes’ Zoom expect 100,000 attendees to join a gathering featuring actors Mark Ruffalo, Sean Astin and Mark Hamill.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272394/white-dudes-harris-latest-series-zoom-gatherings-backing-us-vice-president","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/30/da5f16c3-9491-4819-9f21-97379300c441_f665243c.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/web%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:47:32","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.159},{"id":252921640,"title":"Megan Thee Stallion Will Perform at Kamala Harris Atlanta Rally: Source","text":"From Brat Summer to Hot Girl Summer: Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris during a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday.

No further details about the Meg performance were made available. The Atlanta rally appearance from Megan won’t be the first time the Houston-born rapper and Harris link up. The “Mamushi” rapper visited the Vice President’s mansion during a Women’s History Month event in mid-March. The vice president’s election campaign has been tapping into the Gen Z electorate as videos of Harris — including the “coconut tree” meme — have gone viral across social media platforms. Harris even joined TikTok last week, and over the weekend, she made a video with Lance Bass, playing on *NSYNC’s “Bye Bye Bye.” Harris’ campaign team also played into Charli XCX’s Brat Summer by changing their X header to the chartreuse aesthetic of the British singer’s album. After clips of Harris to the beat of Charli XCX’s album Brat went viral, the singer declared on X, “Kamala IS brat.” Harris’ X account then followed Charli on the platform. “Our job as a campaign is to break through the noise and make sure we’re talking to voters wherever they are — TikTok is one of those landscapes, and we’re leaving no stone unturned,” deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty previously told People. Harris has received numerous endorsements from musicians, including Megan’s friend and “WAP” collaborator Cardi B, who defended the presumptive Democratic nominee against misogynistic hate.

Indeed, both the president and Court as we know it could be gone. In a failed attempt to save his nomination, Biden offered to “reform” the Court by imposing an 18-year term limit that would jettison the three most senior conservative justices. With only six months left in his presidency, Biden’s efforts are likely to fail, but, unfortunately, could set the stage for activists under a Harris Administration in seeking to change the Court forever. For more than 50 years, Biden staunchly refused to play politics with the Supreme Court and support calls for “reforms” from the left of his party. For a politician who has long been criticized for changing positions with the polls on issues from abortion to criminal justice to gun rights, the Court was one of the few areas of true principle for Biden. Even though he refused to answer questions on packing the Court in the 2020 election, he ultimately rejected the call as president. Yet Biden’s final principle fell this month when facing the premature and involuntary end of his candidacy. Faced with being a one-term president, the Supreme Court would have to be sacrificed. Biden opted for the least of the evils in pushing for term limits rather than court packing. It was the more popular option for Biden to yield on. Voters have always loved term limits. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found 67% of Americans, including 82% of Democrats and 57% of Republicans, support a proposal to set finite terms for justices. But there were few law professors and even fewer Democratic members clamoring for term limits until conservatives secured a stable majority on the Court. Then, suddenly, the Court had to be “reformed” without delay. It is no accident that the first three justices who would term limited off the Court are conservatives: Clarence Thomas (after 33 years on the Court), Chief Justice John Roberts (after 19 years), and Justice Samuel Alito (after 18 years). Think, however, about the iconic decisions we would have lost with term limits in place. Liberal Justice Williams Douglas’s 36 years on the Court would have literally been cut in half. He would have been kicked off in 1957. His famous opinions like Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), striking down bans on contraceptives, would not have been written — an ironic result for those seeking limits after the Court’s ruling in Dobbs. Likewise, liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s tenure would have ended in 2011 before she wrote her famous dissent Shelby County v. Holder (2013), defending voting rights. Anthony Kennedy’s term would have ended in 2011 rather than 2018, before he wrote opinions such as United States v. Windsor, striking down the Defense of Marriage Act. Obviously, other justices could have written opinions in these cases, but the point is that many justices wrote their best opinions after 18 years on the Court. Moreover, the Framers clearly wanted these positions as lifetime appointments as an added protection against political pressure or influence. For more than two centuries, presidents have struggled with the Supreme Court, but none (until now) have attempted to end life tenure on the Court. Presidents have served as the firewall for the anger and radicalism that has periodically engulfed the Court. Now President Biden is leading the mob for changing this institution for the first time since its founding. It is a testament to what I call “an age of rage” in my new book. After years of supporting the Court when it was setting aside conservative precedent, liberals now want the Court changed to dump or dilute the majority. It is unlikely to end there. After sending Thomas, Roberts, and Alito packing, many want to go further and pack the Court itself. Democratic leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have called for outright court packing — a proposal that Vice President Kamala Harris has suggested that she might support. Where Biden is a political opportunist in belatedly joining this movement, Harris is a true believer from the far left. If she is elected, the Congress is still likely to be closely divided. That will only increase pressure to convert the Court into an alternative avenue for social and political reform. Harvard professor Michael Klarman warned that all of the plans to change the country were ultimately dependent on packing the court. With the 2020 election, he stated that Democrats could change the election system to guarantee Republicans “will never win another election.” Notably, if Biden were to seek this change as a legislative matter without a constitutional amendment, future Congresses could short terms further from 18 to 8 years or even less. In his speech, Biden declared that he wanted the membership of the Court changed with greater “regularity.” If Congress has this authority, it could change the occupants of the Court faster than a South Beach timeshare condo. That is clearly the opposite of what the Framers intended, but Biden insists that these times are different and democracy will only be safeguarded by attacking one of our core stabilizing institutions. According to the Washington Post, the president made his pledge in a Zoom call to the left-wing Congressional Progressive Caucus, chaired by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and co-chaired by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). It did not succeed in resuscitating his candidacy. The pledge will be dead on arrival with Congress. What is left is a King Lear-like tragedy of a presidency, betrayed by those closest to him, and wandering the land for continued relevance. History will show a pitiful figure who offered up the Court as the cost of staying in power, only to lose his candidacy and his legacy.

Before then, Biden had been recalcitrant that he would not withdraw from the race. He insisted that he was strong and healthy and was the only person who could defeat the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. Even though Biden had given the American public many signs that indicated that he was mentally and physically unfit for the job, it was during the first presidential debate that his shortcomings became indisputable. Biden spoke in a raspy voice without any force. He looked feeble. But that was not all. He regularly lost his train of thought and mixed up the names of people and incidents. Even his opponent at that debate, Trump, had occasions when he was surprised at the lack of coherence in what Biden was saying. At a point in the debate, Trump said, while responding to an answer Biden gave to the moderators: “I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence, and I don’t think he did, either.” Biden’s performance was embarrassing. Opinion polls showed that Trump was widening the gap between them. Many Democrats, including legislators, began to openly ask him to withdraw from the race and save the party from not just losing the presidency but also losing some of their strongholds in Congress to Republicans and becoming weakened. To show their seriousness, many sponsors of the party withdrew their support. But the more Democrats asked Biden to withdraw, the more he said no and insisted that he was the person who could defeat Trump just as he did in 2020. The Democratic Party was divided and confused. The morale of members was low. Their case was worsened by the fact that Biden was (and still is) an incumbent president. As a result, he did not face any strong challenge for the ticket of the party earlier this year. Another factor – not usually publicly discussed – was the fact that Biden’s deputy, Vice President Kamala Harris, is a woman as well as a person of non-White race. Despite the high level of human rights in the United States, it has never elected a woman. It took America 232 years to elect a non-White person in 2008 in the person of Barack Obama. And it was because Obama had an amazing personality and showed exceptional promise with no bad story associated with him. It would be disastrous to sideline Harris because of her gender and race to pick a White male as Biden’s replacement at the polls. But with less than four months to the presidential election, even if Harris became the candidate of the Democratic Party, it was not obvious whether she could make any impact. Conversely, the Republican Party was upbeat. The morale of members was high. The missed assassination attempt on Trump some weeks ago drew him sympathy and helped to shoot up his rating. At the Republican Party’s convention, where Trump was officially confirmed as the presidential candidate and where he named his running mate, the party was as united and confident as it had not been in many years. All polls showed that Trump was ahead. It was obvious that Trump would rout Biden in the presidential race in November. Then on Sunday, July 21, Biden announced his withdrawal from the presidential race and support for Harris. Within 48 hours, the presidential bid of Kamala Harris received over $100 million in donations: a record. (Within one week, it raised $200 million). The Democratic Party was rejuvenated. Attention shifted from the Republicans to the Democrats. The campaign dynamics also completely changed. Before that Sunday, Trump was the younger and healthier candidate, while Biden was the old and feeble candidate. That was meant to be the focal point of the campaign. Immediately after Biden’s announcement, Trump became the old candidate: the oldest candidate in American history to run for president. The Republicans would be forced to change their campaign message and focus. Opinion polls showed that Harris had gone narrowly ahead of Trump, even though it is still within the margin of error, which makes it an open game. The Republicans believe that Trump will rescue the United States from the dangerous grip of Biden and the Democrats. The Democrats believe that Kamala Harris and the Democrats will save America from falling into the dangerous hands of Trump a second time. Another thing that happened after Biden’s announcement was the resignation of the Director of the American Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle. Since the attempt on Trump, Cheatle had vowed not to resign. Last week, she was grilled by Congress and both Democrats and Republicans tore her to shreds and told her to write her resignation letter immediately. She refused. But the next day, she resigned. This is why warts and all, the United States is an exemplary and exciting democracy. The system is above everyone. One person does not decide what happens in the country. People take responsibility for any lapses under their watch. There is no room for excuses. If they refuse to do that, they are put under pressure until they do the right thing. Biden is the president of the strongest country in the world. Therefore, he is the strongest president and individual in the world. But he had to succumb to the pressure from his party members to withdraw from the presidential race. The difference between the US and the Nigerian situation is that in cases like this, the Nigerian president would not resign. It happened when Umaru Musa Yar’Adua was ill. It happened when Muhammadu Buhari was also ill. It happened when Bola Tinubu was contesting for the presidency. Besides, there were many allies of theirs who came out and spoke strongly in their support, giving all kinds of reasons why their health situation was not an issue. Another point is the importance Americans place on presidential debates. Any candidate who refuses to attend a presidential debate is seen as showing disrespect to the American populace. The presidential debate is the avenue through which the American people, as well as citizens of all developed countries, gauge the physical and mental acuity of those who wish to lead them. They use it to find out who seems prepared for leadership. But in Nigeria, politicians snub debates and all attempts to answer unscripted questions. Tinubu did not participate in any presidential debate before the 2023 election. Before him, Buhari did the same thing. Likewise, Goodluck Jonathan, Yar’Adua and Olusegun Obasanjo either avoided presidential debates or participated in the one they created. There were always people who defended them and argued that talking is not the same thing as leadership. Nigeria copies most things from the US. The current presidential system of government which Nigeria practises was copied from the US after the First Republic failed and it was blamed on the British parliamentary system. The presidential system has not succeeded in delivering a reliable system that creates progress and stability. That proves that Nigeria’s governance failure has no connection with the system of government in place. The problem of Nigeria is that of a bad workman who continuously quarrels with his tools. Nigeria does not copy the transparency that the American system is known for. It does not copy the proclivity of Americans to put the interest of the country before their personal and parochial interests. Resigning from positions is almost unthinkable. Individuals are most times above the law. This makes it difficult for democracy to produce the desired dividends that are associated with it. The only dividend of democracy that has accrued to Nigeria is the fact that no president has stayed in power for more than two terms like what obtains in countries like Russia, Rwanda, Cameroon, etc, which purport to practise democracy. Nigerians look forward to the time their politicians will start copying the good examples from the United States.

Regarding turnover, he should have started by looking at the mile-long list of senior and mid-level Trump people who quit or were fired. As for the bar exam, Harris is in good company. Others who took the exam more than once include Franklin D. Roosevelt, Michele Obama, John F, Kennedy Jr., and former California Governors Jerry Brown and Pete Wilson. He also claims she has been a bad campaigner. He’s entitled to his opinion, but her first speech in Milwaukee looked pretty impressive to me, in contrast to Donald Trump’s 93-minute meandering speech at the Republican convention.

Insurers profit most off denying coverage, that is, if you were fortunate enough to have health insurance in the first place. Capitalism turns housing into a scarce commodity and then blames people who lack it. Rather than treating the unhoused as untouchable, we should give them security and more chances. It is the Christian thing to do and a humane imperative. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to sweep away homeless encampments is cruel. It does nothing to solve the systemic problems that cause homelessness in the first place. And by treating other people like trash, the Ggovernor has proven he’s garbage. Alan Marling Livermore Harris win is best hope for multiracial society I was one of 50,000 Black men on a call for Kamala Harris, a day after 44,000 Black women got together. I haven’t seen this level of excitement since Barack Obama in 2008. Black women and men being this energized is how we will win the fight for a multiracial democracy. Kamala was born at the same Oakland hospital as my son. In 2020, hundreds of us danced in front of her former Berkeley apartment to celebrate her victory. And boy will we party if, natch, when she wins the presidency. Ludovic Blain Berkeley Courts are best place to resolve ambiguities Re: “Eviscerating agencies’ power is dangerous” (Page A6, July 10). A letter writer complained that the Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimundo now prevents federal administrative agencies from “resolving statutory ambiguities.” But that is exactly how it should be. That’s what courts do. While agencies may have certain “expertise,” they are not courts. Courts have the expertise to resolve ambiguities in the law; agencies don’t. I don’t want an agency expert to interpret a legal ambiguity; that is not the job of a federal bureaucrat. That expert might be a conservative or liberal who lets his or her worldviews influence a decision. If an agency finds an ambiguity in the law, have them go to Congress to clarify the issue. That is the job of our representatives.

He also called on lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity. Biden, who has less than six months left in his presidency, detailed the contours of his court proposal in an address at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, where he was marking the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. His calls for dramatic changes in the court have little chance of being approved by a closely divided Congress with 99 days to go before Election Day. And in fact, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House.” Still, Democrats hope it’ll help focus voters as they consider their choices in a tight election. The likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has sought to frame her race against Republican ex-President Donald Trump as “a choice between freedom and chaos,” quickly endorsed the Biden proposal. “Extremism is undermining the public confidence in the court’s decisions,” Biden said. He added, “We can and must prevent abuse of presidential power and restore faith in the Supreme Court.” The White House is looking to tap into the growing outrage among Democrats about the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, issuing opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that stood for decades. Liberals also have expressed dismay over revelations about what they say are questionable relationships and decisions by some members of the conservative wing of the court that suggest their impartiality is compromised. Biden pointed to the 2013 high court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and rolling back abortion rights, and a 2023 decision “eviscerating” affirmative action in college admission programs as three prime examples of what he saw as “outrageous” decisions that have shaken Americans’ faith in the high court. Harris, in a statement, said the reforms being proposed are needed because “there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court.” Biden in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of his address shrugged off Johnson’s pronouncement that the proposal is going nowhere. “I think that’s what he is — dead on arrival,” Biden offered. He added that he would “figure out a way” to get it done. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and “reduce the chance that any single president imposes undue influence for generations to come.” He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a court code of ethics that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden also is calling on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. That decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. “This nation was founded on the principle there are no kings in America,” Biden said. “Each of us are equal before the law. No one is above the law. For all practical purposes, the court’s decision almost certainly means the president can violate their oath, flout our laws, and face no consequences.” Most Americans supported some form of age limit for Supreme Court justices in an AP-NORC poll from August 2023. Two-thirds wanted Supreme Court justices to be required to retire by a certain age. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to favor a mandatory retirement age, 77% to 61%. Americans across age groups tend to agree on the desire for age limits – those age 60 and over were as likely as any other age group to be in favor of this limit for Supreme Court justices. The first three justices who would potentially be affected by term limits are on the right. Justice Clarence Thomas has been on the court for nearly 33 years. Chief Justice John Roberts has served for 19 years, and Justice Samuel Alito has served for 18. Trump has decried court reform as a desperate attempt by Democrats to “Play the Ref.” “The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site this month. There have been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Thomas accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed during the Obama administration, has faced scrutiny after it surfaced her staff often prodded public institutions that hosted her to buy copies of her memoir or children’s books. Alito rejected calls to step aside from Supreme Court cases involving Trump and Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection defendants despite a flap over provocative flags displayed at his homes that some believe suggested sympathy to people facing charges over storming the U.S. Capitol to keep Trump in power. Alito says the flags were displayed by his wife. “These scandals involving the justices have caused public opinion to question the court’s fairness and independence that are essential to basically carrying its mission of equal justice under the law,” Biden said. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back that Biden’s proposal amounted to taking a “torch” to the “crown jewel of our system of government.” “President Biden and his leftist allies don’t like the current composition of the court so they want to shred the Constitution to change it,” McConnell said.","summary":"President Joe Biden said Monday that \"extremism\" on the U.S. Supreme Court is undermining public confidence in the institution and called on Congress to quickly establish term limits and an enforceable ethics code for the court's nine justices.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/29/biden-decries-extremism-on-supreme-court-details-plan-for-term-limits-ethics-code-for-justices/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24211785156918.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:22:55","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":252920450,"title":"Megan Thee Stallion to Join Kamala Harris During Rally in Atlanta for Special Performance","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is looking to go full steam ahead on her quest to become the next president of the United States, so she’s enlisting some help. According to a source, Harris will have Megan Thee Stallion join her at her rally on Tuesday (July 30) in Atlanta for a special performance. Over the weekend, Harris teamed up with *NSYNC star Lance Bass for a special TikTok clip slamming former President Trump ahead of this upcoming November election. “Hey Kamala, what are we gonna say to Donald Trump in November?” Bass asks Harris in the video. “Bye, bye, bye,” Harris sharply responds, referring to the pop group’s 2000 hit single of the same name. Over a week ago, President Biden decided to step aside from the presidential race, giving Harris his nod and endorsement to compete against Trump. This pivotal moment was followed by a surge of support from celebrities, including Cardi B, Lizzo, Lil Nas X and more, who have joined forces to back Harris in her historic bid to become the first female president of the United States. “On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,” Harris responded to Biden’s announcement. “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement, and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.” Following the endorsement, Harris released a campaign video featuring Beyonce’s 2016 “Freedom,” urging Americans to lean in and support her. “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate. But us? We choose something different. We choose freedom.” Billboard reached out to Harris and Megan Thee Stallion’s team for comment.","summary":"Megan Thee Stallion is the next celebrity to support Vice President Harris' presidential run.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/megan-thee-stallion-kamala-harris-rally-atlanta-1235742703/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Megan-Thee-Stallion-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:19:45","author":"Carl Lamarre","authors":["Carl Lamarre"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.495},{"id":252920026,"title":"North Carolina Gov.

JD Vance and his ruminations on the “bunch of childless cat ladies” who run the Democratic Party. “How does it make any sense we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Vance, now former president Donald Trump’s running mate, asked in a 2021 Fox News interview. It was mostly people who would never vote for Trump, with or without Vance on the ticket, who pretended to be offended. Why, how dare Vance mock us as “cat ladies,” they demanded, as they re-listened to Barack Obama’s speech about those terrible white people clinging to God and guns. Judgment about my life choices; well I never. But some Republican women were also annoyed: The comments came off as condescending and judgmental, not to mention personal. Vance wasn’t wrong on the macro level — societally, we need people to have children. A June Pew Poll showed that Republicans largely understand this, with 59% of Trump supporters saying “society should prioritize marriage and having children,” while only 19% of then-candidate Joe Biden’s supporters agreed. But on the micro level, Vance’s comments picked at a painful personal scab for many women — especially those who wanted to have children but, for one reason or another, did not. Insulting people in your own base, especially women, is something Democrats do with ease but Republicans have yet to master. A few days ago, a Zoom call titled “White Women: Answer the Call!” raised a ton of money for Kamala Harris, largely by disparaging white women. “White women so rarely do this work,” writer Glennon Doyle said on the call. “Because you might make your neighbors uncomfortable. Because you also desperately need to be approved of and liked.” White women are the worst, said a white woman. The vagueness is part of what the left does well. White liberal women can say awful things about white women, while talking to white women, and everyone on the call will just assume it doesn’t apply to them. The Trump campaign has to walk a fine line in its appeal to the fairer sex — but earning our votes is not some insurmountable hurdle. In 2016, Trump won 39% of the female vote; by 2020, that number had climbed to 44%. (Erosion of his male support cost him re-election.) To build on that gain, the Trump campaign should not follow Harris in treating women as some fringe minority. In fact, female voters share the concerns of men on most issues. Like men, women care about safety and security, being able to buy food to feed our families and giving our children the life that we dream of for them. Trump’s vow to curb illegal immigration, to be tough on criminals and to establish “universal school choice” should all be popular issues with the ladies, as well as the men. Meanwhile, for any woman who gets sticker shock at the supermarket, Trump’s economic plan promises to reduce inflation. Anyone, of any gender, struggling to get by while the Biden/Harris White House pretends inflation is a myth will want to hear more about that. Even on abortion, Trump came off as the moderate in his debate with Joe Biden by emphasizing that Roe v. Wade allowed for abortion up until the moment of birth. Many people simply don’t know this truth, which illustrates the radicalism of the left’s position: While most Americans support keeping abortion legal, support drops precipitously after the first trimester. Still, to earn the votes of women, Trump and Vance must curb personal attacks. Sarcastic quips like Vance’s “cat ladies” comment will inevitably be clipped and shared to claim the misogyny of the all-male ticket. Yet following the July 13 assassination attempt on the former president, voters saw glimpses of a kinder, gentler man. His granddaughter Kai’s speech at the Republican National Convention showed a side of Trump few get to see. The campaign should lean into this powerful form of persuasion and feature more women who know Trump well — it doesn’t hurt to show us that he doesn’t actually bite. So while male and female voters may care about the same issues, getting women to turn out and proactively cast a Trump vote calls for the campaign to adjust its tone. The former president already has a ready-made line: Are you better off than you were four years ago? Few of us — women and men alike — are.

The Biden-Harris proposals include passing legislation that would impose an 18-year term limit for Supreme Court justices; requirements that justices disclose gifts, avoid public political activity and recuse themselves if they or their spouses have conflicts of interests; and a new constitutional amendment that would limit presidential immunity. “That is outrageous,” Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) said in a video posted on X, arguing that overhauling the high court “goes against the system – the American exceptionality we all enjoy.” “Be very careful, because touching the Supreme Court is touching the core of the American system,” she added. Appearing alongside Salazar were two other GOP members of Florida’s congressional delegation, who suggested the reforms were politically motivated. “We’ve seen this in history happen time and time again, when somebody for political reasons tries to change the institutions,” Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said. “It is highly dangerous, unacceptable and that is a real threat to democracy and all of the freedoms we enjoy in the United States,” he added. Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.) compared Biden and Harris’ proposed reforms to what the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez did when he took power in the late 1990s. “What’s the first thing that Hugo Chavez did when he became president? He actually reformed the Supreme Court of Venezuela, so he made things legal for himself,” Gimenez noted. “So what are they doing today? They’re using that same court system to put in jail the main opposition leader,” he added, referencing Maria Corina, the Maduro regime opposition leader who was blocked by the country’s high court from running for any office for 15 years and is now under investigation for allegedly conspiring with North Macedonia to hack Sunday’s election results. “Touching the judicial system is one way to maintain power,” Gimenez continued. “And so this is really, really dangerous for our national security and for the security of democracy.” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) echoed the Florida Republicans’ concerns. “My colleagues are 100% correct,” Malliotakis wrote on X. “Hugo Chavez packed the Supreme Court of Venezuela from 20 to 32 justices that repeatedly ruled in the corrupt government’s favor.” “It is how they destroyed the richest country in South America,” she added. “We can NEVER allow that to happen here.” The president’s three-pronged plan faces long odds, as the divided Congress is unlikely to take up the issue in the six months Biden has left in office. Biden’s push for a constitutional amendment restricting immunity – which comes in response to the Supreme Court affirming on July 1 that presidents, including former President Dnald Trump, have absolute immunity for official acts – faces even more hurdles, as it would require two-thirds support from both the House and the Senate or the approval of three-fourths of state legislatures in convention that must be called for by two-thirds of the states. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) indicated Monday that the proposed reforms will be “dead on arrival in the House.” “President Biden’s proposal to radically overhaul the U.S. Supreme Court would tilt the balance of power and erode not only the rule of law, but the American people’s faith in our system of justice,” the House speaker wrote in a statement. “This proposal is the logical conclusion to the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats’ ongoing efforts to delegitimize the Supreme Court. Their calls to expand and pack the Court will soon resume,” he argued. “It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with some of the Court’s recent decisions. This dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris Administration is dead on arrival in the House,” Johnson concluded.","summary":"“It is highly dangerous, unacceptable and that is a real threat to democracy and all of the freedoms we enjoy in the United States,\" Rep.

All signs point to a tight race in November, and the GOP ticket is already behind with women: In five battleground states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Harris leads by 9 points or more with the ladies. Closing that gap may be an uphill battle. Even if Trump were ahead, it would be foolish to ignore the power of women voters: About 7.4 million more women than men were registered to vote in 2022, according to the Center for American Women in Politics, and more women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1964. Yes, Trump prevailed over a woman in 2016, but Hillary Clinton ran with decades of political baggage that repelled many voters. And that was before Roe v. Wade was overturned, which made abortion a hot-button issue, particularly for women: It hurt GOPers in 2022, and Democrats see that as the ace up their sleeve this year, too. Besides, the chance to vote for a woman who feels like a relative newcomer will almost certainly attract female voters who sat out other elections (or even some of those who pulled the lever for Trump in 2016 because they couldn’t stomach the alternative). Sure, there are plenty of women who want what Trump and Vance are selling: school choice, parents rights, a better economy, safer neighborhoods and a more secure border. But this is a different political landscape than 2016, and both Trump and Vance need to keep on the straight and narrow to avoid alienating female voters who might otherwise agree with them on policy. Maybe Trump should start by quit hurling derogatory nicknames and ad hominem insults at his foes. He can ding Kamala on policy without making crass comments or veering into petty pot shots about her looks or gender that might make women balk. He and his running mate must certainly avoid missteps like the one Vance made in 2021, when he blasted “childless cat ladies” who run the country but are “miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” He also foolishly suggested penalizing women without kids with higher taxes. For real? Vance’s comments resurfaced recently and spread like wildfire on social media, drawing backlash from even conservative women. Meanwhile, there’s plenty he can and should attack Harris on — inflation, the border disaster (which she oversaw), her lack of experience and her support for unpopular far-left causes, like defunding police, packing the court and the Green New Deal. Trump and Vance need to reassure women that they take them seriously as a voting bloc, and they have no interest in pushing national policy that controls women’s decisions on family matters. The GOP ticket knows women will play a major role in deciding this election, perhaps they should start acting like it.","summary":"A warning to Donald Trump and J.D.

Senate candidate Dave McCormick and other Pennsylvania Republicans have been quick to highlight what such a ban would mean for the Keystone State as Harris attempts to change course on the issue. “The Biden-Harris-[Sen. Bob] Casey energy agenda has essentially been to stop fossil fuels, and transition from lithium batteries and solar panels from China,” McCormick said on “Fox and Friends” Friday, adding: “It truly is out of step [with] where most Pennsylvanians are.” A McCormick campaign ad released last week featured similar attacks on Harris’ energy record, including her support for the Green New Deal — a series of progressive policy initiatives designed to phase out fossil fuels in America. Donald Trump Jr. and Ric Grenell are among other high-profile Republicans slamming Harris on X last week for her position on fracking. “Kamala Harris is even more extreme than Joe Biden – She wants to ban fracking and kill countless jobs in states like PA for American workers,” Trump Jr. wrote. “Dear Pennsylvania… take it from this Californian, don’t let Kamala Harris anywhere near your energy sources,” wrote former Director of National Intelligence Grenell. Perhaps such attacks are driving the Harris campaign’s recent shift on the issue? As of this weekend, Harris’ campaign claims she no longer supports a fracking ban, with a Harris campaign spokesperson telling The Hill that Donald Trump’s energy policies would “enrich oil and gas executives at the expense of the middle class.” Trump had criticized Harris’ support for a fracking ban at his North Carolina rally last Wednesday. Back on the left, Pennsylvania Democrat Conor Lamb — a once-promising young congressman who lost to John Fetterman in the 2022 Senate primary — praised the Harris’ pivot. “A good leader learns in public and isn’t afraid to admit when they change their mind,” Lamb tweeted Monday morning. With Trump set to rally in Pennsylvania’s capital this Wednesday, the former prez is likely to push the issue.

The plan — which comes after a string of terms in which the court’s conservative supermajority preached judicial restraint while gutting landmark precedents — is entirely unattainable in the short term. And it’s thin on details. Among the open questions is whether some of the proposed reforms could withstand efforts by the Supreme Court itself to strike them down. “We can and must prevent the abuse of presidential power and restore faith in the Supreme Court,” Biden said in a speech Monday afternoon in Austin, where he rehashed his proposals without fleshing out the logistics. Yet the move signals a key shift in the political discourse: Once the stuff of progressive pipe dreams, now even staunch centrists like Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee who quickly co-signed the president’s proposals, want to address the court’s outsized power. Though Biden stopped short of proposing to expand the court to even out its ideological imbalance, which a slight majority of Americans have endorsed in recent polling, the announcement marks a course change for the president. Biden, an institutionalist who defended the filibuster until the Dobbs decision in 2022, has finally started playing checks-and-balances chicken with a judiciary that continues to consolidate its own authority while pretending to be above the political fray. As previewed in an op-ed for the Washington Post, Biden’s plan has three basic proposals. First is to override the court’s recent decision about far-reaching presidential immunity by amending the Constitution itself. Although fanciful given the difficulty of the constitutional amendment process, this is also Biden’s most concrete proposal. Unlike his other proposals, this one includes a specific mechanism of binding the court to 21st-century realities about presidential power, instead of cherrypicking from the musings of Alexander Hamilton and his fellow founders. So far, Biden hasn’t proposed how he might accomplish his other two proposals: an 18-year term limit for Supreme Court justices, and an enforceable ethics code. Both provisions implicate Justice Clarence Thomas, who has been on the country’s highest bench since 1991 and who refused to recuse from cases stemming from the January 6 insurrection this term despite his wife’s deep involvement in Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” efforts to reverse his loss in the 2020 election. There are serious debates about whether these two measures would require constitutional amendments or if Congress has the authority to enact them in some fashion through legislation. The cross-ideological commission Biden appointed in 2021 — before the Supreme Court tossed Roe v. Wade and other bedrock doctrines — produced almost 300 pages of collective, heavily footnoted shrugs on such questions. Many Democrats are eager to at least try the legislation route, even if court reform bills will just wind up before the Supreme Court upon inevitable challenge. “It’s time for Congress to take significant action on Supreme Court ethics and term limits reform,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., wrote on X following Biden’s proposal. “I’ve got legislation to get it done.” Whitehouse’s bill, which would create a process to disqualify justices from particular cases and require the Supreme Court to draft its own ethics code, among other provisions, has dozens of co-sponsors and passed favorably out of the Judiciary Committee but is unlikely to pass the full Senate. Setting aside, again, the moonshot logistics and the unresolved particulars, Biden’s announcement is significant for its frank, if belated, diagnosis: There aren’t meaningful checks on the Supreme Court.","summary":"Once the stuff of progressive pipe dreams, now even centrists like Biden are questioning the court’s outsized power.\n\n\nThe post Now a Lame Duck, Biden Finally Floats Supreme Court Reforms appeared first on The Intercept.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2024/07/29/biden-supreme-court-reform-presidential-immunity-ethics/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24211739656366.jpg?fit=4000%2C2667","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:02:54","author":"Shawn Musgrave","authors":["Shawn Musgrave"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.217},{"id":252919214,"title":"Biden’s illegitimate ‘reforms’ are a nakedly political bid to tilt the Supreme Court on his way out","text":"Kamala Harris is so moderate that she only wants to pack the Supreme Court by stealth. By poorly disguised stealth, to be sure, but it’s difficult to obscure the intended destruction of an institution of American government. The newly minted Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed President Biden’s plan for Supreme Court “reform,” the centerpiece of which is a proposal for an 18-year term limit that would immediately usher Justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito off the court. This is court-packing by another name. Biden also wants an enforceable ethics code imposed on the court and a Constitutional amendment saying that presidents don’t have immunity from prosecution for their official acts, countering the Supreme Court’s recent decision on this question. Harris is strongly in favor: “These popular reforms will help to restore confidence in the court, strengthen our democracy and ensure no one is above the law.” They will do none of the above. As a matter of basic legitimacy, foundational rules of government should be fashioned without knowing which party or faction will benefit from, or be harmed by, them. The term-limits idea, in contrast, is obviously crafted to undo the effect of Democrats losing the 2016 election and handing Donald Trump three Supreme Court appointments. (The left wasn’t agitating for term limits when the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who joined the court in 1993, had already served more than 20 years — they were cheering her on.) No one is going to have more trust in the court after it’s been kneecapped for partisan purposes. If the Romans created a desert and called it peace, the Democrats want to blow up the court and call it restored. The court-packing scheme is another way station in Biden’s sad slide left. Years ago, he spoke of FDR’s attempted court-packing — also sold as a reform to freshen up the composition of the court — in harsh terms. Roosevelt had been “corrupted by power,” according to Biden. Then, he evaded the pressure from the left to endorse court-packing in 2020; now, he’s buckled to his party’s progressive base, yet again. But Biden has never paid the full political price for his leftward lurch. Until he pushed it too far, this is where Biden’s age helped him: It was hard to look at a frail old man who talked of being a working-class kid from Scranton and conclude that he was a radical. As a woke progressive from Oakland, Calif., Kamala Harris doesn’t have the same latitude. Her promise to destroy a pillar of our government won’t help moderate her image. Democrats are willing to do anything to address Donald Trump’s supposed threat to our norms and institutions, except honor those things themselves. Between Barack Obama and Joe Biden’s multiple lawless unilateral acts, they’ve done more than their part to normalize executive overreach. By never truly accepting the results of the 2016 election, they’ve contributed to the cycle of disputing the legitimacy of lost elections. By heedlessly opening the border, they’ve created precedent for ignoring unwelcome laws. By pursuing a strategy of lawfare against Trump, they’ve created the precedent for distorting the legal system to try to destroy a political opponent. And now they are going after the Supreme Court for the offense of issuing rulings that they don’t like — rulings, by the way, that may be flawed, but are well-reasoned according to a transparent, consistent theory of constitutional interpretation. The conservative justices, sticklers for the details and history of the law, are the opposite of everything the Democrats dislike about Donald Trump. That doesn’t matter, though, since the left isn’t opposed to Trumpism so much as anything that stands in the way of the unchecked implementation of its progressive vision. The most fruitful line of attack against Biden was that he was old, incompetent and a bad president. The best line of attack against Harris is that she’s a radical. By endorsing court-packing, she’s offering fresh evidence for the indictment.

Just days after President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic presidential nomination, top officials from both major political parties have been asking the publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News if Harris can regain the support of the nation’s largest Muslim population located in metro Detroit. His response: “We are in listening mode.” Harris, who is moving to seize the Democratic nomination after Biden stepped down, appears to be pivoting quickly to the task of convincing Arab American voters in Michigan, a state Democrats believe she can’t afford to lose in November, that she is a leader they can unite behind. Community leaders have expressed a willingness to listen, and some have had initial conversations with Harris’ team. Many had grown exacerbated with Biden after they felt months of outreach had not yielded many results. “The door is cracked open since Biden has stepped down,” said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. “There’s an opportunity for the Democratic nominee to coalesce the coalition that ushered in Biden’s presidency four years ago. But that responsibility will now fall on the vice president.” Arab American leaders such as Hammoud and Siblani are watching closely for signals that Harris will be more vocal in pressing for a ceasefire. They’re excited by her candidacy but want to be sure she will be an advocate for peace and not an unequivocal supporter of Israel. But Harris will need to walk a fine line not to publicly break with Biden’s position on the war in Gaza, where officials in his administration have been working diligently toward a ceasefire, mostly behind the scenes. The divide within Harris’ own party was evident in Washington last week during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to address Congress. Some Democrats supported the visit, while others protested and refused to attend. Outside the Capitol, pro-Palestinian protesters were met with pepper spray and arrests. Michigan Rep Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress whose district includes Dearborn, held up a sign that read “war criminal” during Netanyahu’s remarks. Harris did not attend.Some Arab American leaders interpret her absence – she instead attended a campaign event in Indianapolis – as a sign of good faith with them, though they recognise her ongoing responsibilities as vice president, including a meeting last Thursday with Netanyahu. Her first test within the community will come when Harris chooses a running mate. One of the names on her short list, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, has been public in his criticism of pro-Palestinian protesters and is Jewish. Some Arab American leaders in Michigan say putting him on the ticket would ramp up their unease about the level of support they could expect from a Harris administration. “Josh Shapiro was one of the first ones to criticise the students on campus. So it doesn’t differentiate Harris very much if she picks him. That just says I’m going to continue the same policies as Biden,” said director of the National Network for Arab American Communities Rima Meroueh. Arab Americans are betting that their vote holds enough electoral significance in pivotal swing states like Michigan to ensure that officials will listen to them. Michigan has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation, and the state’s majority-Muslim cities overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020. In February, over 100,000 Michigan Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted”, securing two delegates to protest the Biden administration’s unequivocal support for Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Nationally, “uncommitted” garnered a total of 36 delegates in the primaries earlier this year. The groups leading this effort have called for – at a minimum – an embargo on all weapons shipments to Israel and a permanent ceasefire. “If Harris called for an arms embargo, I would work around the clock every day until the election to get her elected,” said Abbas Alawieh, an “uncommitted” Michigan delegate and national leader of the movement. “There’s a real opportunity right now to unite the coalition. It’s on her to deliver, but we are cautiously optimistic.” Those divisions were on full display last Wednesday night when the Michigan Democratic Party brought together over 100 delegates to pitch them on uniting behind Harris. During the meeting, Alawieh, one of three state delegates who did not commit to Harris, was speaking when another delegate interrupted him by unmuting and telling him to “shut up”, using an expletive, according to Alawieh. The call could be a preview of tensions expected to surface again in August, when Democratic leaders, lawmakers, and delegates convene in Chicago for the party’s national convention. Mass protests are planned, and the “uncommitted” movement intends to ensure their voices are heard within the United Center, where the convention will be held. Trump and his campaign, meanwhile, are keenly aware of the turmoil within the Democratic base and are actively seeking the support of Arab American voters. That effort has been complicated by Trump’s history of anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy during his one term as president. A meeting between over a dozen Arab American leaders from across the country and several of Trump’s surrogates was convened in Dearborn last week. Among the surrogates was Massad Boulos, a Lebanese-born businessman whose son married Tiffany Trump, the former president’s younger daughter, two years ago. Boulos is leveraging his connections to rally support for Trump. Part of the pitch that Boulos and chairman of Arab Americans for Trump Bishara Bahbah, made was that Trump has shown an openness to a two-state solution. He posted a letter on social media from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and pledged to work for peace in the Middle East.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/a-ray-of-hope/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/page-24-b_30072024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:01:32","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":252919980,"title":"Republicans blast newly floated Harris vice presidential contender","text":"Though Gov.

Gary Peters (D-MI) is reportedly being considered as a possible running mate by the Harris campaign in an effort to appeal to labor unions. Michigan is a swing state with 15 electoral votes up for grabs, and the Harris campaign is looking at the best way to win it over. Approximately 564,0000 workers in Michigan belong to a labor union, accounting for 12.4% of workers. While the number of workers in organized labor in Michigan has been on the decline since the 1980s, labor unions have long been strong supporters of Democrats. Already, Harris has received the endorsement of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest federation of labor unions, the United Steelworkers, and the American Federation of Teachers. Peters was a prominent supporter of the United Automobile Workers strike against the big three auto workers last fall. Currently, the UAW has withheld its endorsement to Harris, but Peters being picked as the running mate could encourage the auto labor union, according to Axios. “I know for sure that one of the reasons his name is in the mix is that labor really wants to have somebody who is undoubtedly pro union, and Gary fits that definition quite well,” Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) told the outlet. The outlet also reported the senator is interested in the nomination, according to a Michigan Democratic party official. As the chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, Peters has been applauded by Democrats for helping the party retain its Senate majority back in 2022, but now the National Republican Senatorial Committee sees Peters moving for the White House as his jumping ship. “Gary Peters knows Democrats are about to lose the Senate majority, so now he’s trying to quit on his members and become Kamala Harris’s vice president,” NRSC Spokesman Philip Letsou told the Washington Examiner. “Kamala Harris is the most far-left presidential nominee in American history and is already absolutely toxic for down-ballot Democrats.” However, in the first week of Harris’s campaign, the vice president raised $200 million, with two-thirds of donations coming from new donors. The DSCC raised a million dollars two days in a row last week, and Peters said the number of volunteers in Michigan doubled in the four days since Harris announced her run for president.","summary":"Though Gov.

Vance, who has faced widespread mockery for his attacks on “childless cat ladies,” claimed that Harris wants to end the child tax credit in a so-far failed effort to move on from his proposals to favor parents over others. “A lot of parents and a lot of non-parents look at our public policy for the last four years and ask: How did we get to a place where Kamala Harris is calling for an end to the child tax credit?” Vance, 39, said in a Fox News interview Sunday night. Vance’s claim about Harris is flat-out false. In fact, the Biden administration dramatically increased the credit during the COVID-19 pandemic and pushed for its extension. Vance and his Republican allies in the Senate killed that effort a few months ago. The Harris campaign today lobbed new attacks on Vance, a first-term senator from Ohio, calling him too inexperienced to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. “(He’s) one of the most unprepared people that we have ever put up to hold the vice presidency of the United States,” said Mitch Landrieu, co-chair of Harris’s campaign, told CNN. The newly minted No. 2 pick on former President Donald Trump’s ticket is facing a second week of questions about his less-than-optimal rollout after being unveiled at the Republican National Convention. After delivering an underwhelming speech at the RNC, Vance has been dogged by myriad questions about his far-right views, which Democrats have branded as “weird.” He was caught on tape suggesting that Democrats cannot be trusted with America’s future because they are led by unhappy people without biological children like Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Vance has also proposed giving more votes to parents of young children, an idea that would violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection for all, including those he derides as “childless cat ladies.” Trump has been surprisingly slow to defend Vance against the backlash over his remarks, sparking speculation that the GOP could even swap him out for a candidate with less baggage. Democrats may seek to keep Vance’s missteps in the public eye as Harris considers making her own vice presidential pick as early as this week. She was catapulted into the top spot on the Democratic ticket when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and backed her. Top candidates for the No. 2 Democratic slot include more experienced political figures like Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Buttigieg and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.","summary":"Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has falsely accused Vice President Kamala Harris of opposing the child tax credit as he seeks to turn the page from his rocky debut on the national stage.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/29/breaking-news/vance-falsely-claims-harris-opposes-child-tax-credit-in-walkback/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_20240729_brk_jdv01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:00:00","author":"Tribune News Service","authors":["Tribune News Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":252919250,"title":"Biden unveils plan for Supreme Court changes, calls for term limits and ethics rules","text":"US President Joe Biden has unveiled a long-awaited proposal for changes at the US Supreme Court, calling on Congress to establish term limits and an enforceable ethics code for the court’s nine justices. He is also pressing lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity. The White House on Monday detailed the contours of Biden’s court proposal, one that appears to have little chance of being approved by a closely divided Congress with just 99 days to go before election day. Still, Democrats hope it will help focus voters as they consider their choices in a tight election. The likely Democratic nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has sought to frame her race against Republican ex-president Donald Trump as “a choice between freedom and chaos’, quickly endorsed the Biden proposal. She added that the changes are needed because “there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court”. The White House is looking to tap into the growing outrage among Democrats about the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, issuing opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that stood for decades. Liberals also have expressed dismay over revelations about what they say are questionable relationships and decisions by some members of the conservative wing of the court that suggest their impartiality is compromised. “I have great respect for our institutions and separation of powers,” Biden argues in a Washington Post article published on Monday. “What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.” Harris in a statement said the reforms being proposed “will help to restore confidence in the Court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law”. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House”. The president planned to speak about his proposal later on Monday during an address at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and adds a measure of predictability to the nomination process. He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a court code of ethics that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden also is calling on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. That decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. Most Americans supported some form of age limit for Supreme Court justices in an AP-NORC poll from August 2023. Two-thirds wanted Supreme Court justices to be required to retire by a certain age. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to favour a mandatory retirement age, 77 per cent to 61 per cent. Americans across age groups tend to agree on the desire for age limits – those age 60 and over were as likely as any other age group to be in favour of this limit for Supreme Court justices. The first three justices who would potentially be affected by term limits are on the right. Justice Clarence Thomas has been on the court for nearly 33 years. Chief Justice John Roberts has served for 19 years, and Justice Samuel Alito has served for 18. Supreme Court justices served an average of about 17 years from the founding until 1970, said Gabe Roth, executive director of the group Fix the Court. Since 1970, the average has been about 28 years. Both conservative and liberal politicians alike have espoused term limits. “If justices have this much power, then they should be individuals who reflect America as it currently is, not the America of 30 or 40 years ago, the dead hand of the president who appointed them still influencing policy,” Roth said. An enforcement mechanism for the High Court’s code of ethics, meanwhile, could bring the Supreme Court justices more in line with other federal judges, who are subject to a disciplinary system in which anyone can file a complaint and have it reviewed. An investigation can result in censure and reprimand. Last week, Justice Elena Kagan called publicly for creating a way to enforce the new ethics code, becoming the first justice to do so. Still, when it comes to the Supreme Court, creating an ethics code enforcement mechanism is not as easy as it sounds. The attorney general has always had the power to enforce violations of the financial and gift disclosure rules but has never apparently used that power against federal judges, said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at NYU School of Law. The body that oversees lower court judges, meanwhile, is headed by Roberts, “who might be reluctant to use whatever power the conference has against his colleagues”, Gillers wrote in an email. The last time Congress ratified an amendment to the Constitution was 32 years ago. The 27th Amendment, ratified in 1992, states that Congress can pass a bill changing the pay for members of the House and the Senate, but such a change cannot take effect until after the next November elections are held for the House. Trump has decried court reform as a desperate attempt by Democrats to “Play the Ref”. “The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honourable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site this month. There have been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Thomas accepted luxury trips from a Republican megadonor. Democrats say the Biden effort will help put a bright spotlight on recent High Court decisions, including the 2022 ruling stripping away women’s constitutional protections for abortion, by the conservative-majority court that includes three justices appointed by Trump. The announcement marks a remarkable evolution for Biden, who as a candidate had been wary of calls to reform the High Court. But over the course of his presidency, he has become increasingly vocal about his belief that the court has abandoned mainstream constitutional interpretation.","summary":"US president is also pressing lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272392/biden-unveils-plan-supreme-court-changes-calls-term-limits-and-ethics-rules","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/30/d880e393-eb2b-405c-8a86-534cd13f26b5_5ee1d6b5.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/WEB%20-%20Biden%20drop.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-29 22:59:39","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":252919626,"title":"Odd moment Biden calls lawmaker ‘dead on arrival’ for ripping his Supreme Court reform plan","text":"President Joe Biden (right) bizarrely called Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson (left) ‘dead on arrival’ after the lawmaker slammed his Supreme Court overhaul proposal (Pictures: AP/REX) President Joe Biden had some strong words for a US lawmaker who called his proposal to drastically reform the Supreme Court ‘dead on arrival’.

Just days into her candidacy — after President Joe Biden was reportedly forced out as the presumptive Democrat nominee amid a behind-the-scenes pressure campaign from top Democrats, donors, and Hollywood elites — Republicans have shown they are ready for Harris’s candidacy. As Times reporter Reid Epstein noted Monday, several videos and policy visions that Harris, who has been an elected official since 2004, espoused in her last bid for the presidency have already come back to “haunt” her. For example, the Pro-Trump Super PAC Make America Great Again Inc. has wasted no time hammering Harris. Shortly after Biden bowed out of the race on July 21, the group put out an ad highlighting that Harris shares Biden’s legacy as his vice president. It also unleashed an ad going through her record, exposing her as “dangerously liberal.” More ads are in the works with tens of millions of dollars in airtime booked through Labor Day in swing states. Team Trump just released a new attack ad against Kamala Harris. The most compelling one yet. pic.twitter.com/DvqsXUamiT — End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) July 23, 2024 Pennsylvania Republican Dave McCormick’s Senate campaign released an ad on Tuesday exposing Harris’s record and viewpoints while tying her to his opponent, Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA). Bob Casey just endorsed the most liberal nominee in U.S. history. pic.twitter.com/J0V6W7CUlh — Dave McCormick (@DaveMcCormickPA) July 23, 2024 The video recounts her view that illegal immigration should be decriminalized while also underscoring her vision to ban fracking, among many other far-left stances she has held. Her campaign said that she had about-faced this issue on Friday and that she is not for a fracking ban, the Hill reported. GOP strategist Brad Todd, who is working with the Pennsylvania Republican’s campaign, told the Times that the Harris “archive is deep.” “We will run out of time before we run out of video clips of Kamala Harris saying wacky California liberal things. I’m just not sure that the rest of this campaign includes much besides that,” Todd emphasized. As the Times notes, Harris did not leave a shortage of material for Republicans during her White House bid in the 2020 cycle: She said then that she opposed fracking; would “think about” abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency; called the idea of adding more police officers “wrongheaded thinking”; entertained the idea of allowing felons to vote; said she supported a “mandatory buyback program” for some guns; and called for the elimination of private health insurance. A central part of the left’s effort to broaden Harris’s appeal to swing voters includes embracing her record as a prosecutor to brand her as a law and order Demcroat. Harris’s 2020 campaign screeched to a halt before even the Iowa Caucuses amid internal turmoil and a cold relationship with her campaign manager, Juan Rodiguez, as the Times noted at the time. One former Harris aide, Gil Duran, told the Times in 2019, “You can’t run the country if you can’t run your campaign.” Breitbart News covered a similar angle to Monday’s Times story on July 23, which noted that Harris’s record is coming back to “haunt” House Democrats. “Kamala Harris allows GOP campaigns to talk to voters with surgical precision about how she would make their lives worse with her dangerous San Francisco liberal policies,” National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Press Secretary Will Reinert told Breitbart News. “Harris’s 2019 primary campaign for president is a Republican ad maker’s dream and a swing-district Democrat’s nightmare.” Just days later, on Thursday, when CNN’s Manu Raju approached Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA)— chairwoman of the NRCC counterpart, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — to ask if it is “a good idea for those vulnerable Democrats to align themselves with Kamala Harris,” she worked to distance her colleagues from the vice president.

The warning comes after a tumultuous few weeks in U.S. politics that have prompted Russia, Iran and China to revise their propaganda playbook rapidly. What hasn’t changed, intelligence officials said, is their determination to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims about American democracy to undermine faith in the election. “The American public should know that content that they read online — especially on social media — could be foreign propaganda, even if it appears to be coming from fellow Americans or originating in the United States,” said an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director. Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, authorities said, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024. Groups linked to the Kremlin are increasingly hiring marketing and communications firms located within Russia as both a way to outsource the work of creating campaigns and as a way to hide their tracks, the officials said during the briefing with reporters. Two such firms were the subject of new U.S. sanctions announced in March. Authorities say the two Russian companies created fake websites and social media profiles to spread Kremlin disinformation. The disinformation can focus on the candidates or voting, or on issues that are already the subject of debates in the U.S., such as immigration, crime or the war in Gaza. The ultimate goal, however, is to get Americans to spread Russian disinformation without questioning its origin. People are far more likely to trust and repost information that they believe is coming from a domestic source, officials said. Fake websites designed to mimic U.S. news outlets and AI-generated social media profiles are just two methods. In some cases, Americans and American tech companies and media outlets have willingly amplified and parroted the messages of the Kremlin. “Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand, and getting Americans to do it,” said the official, who spoke alongside officials from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last month that he worries the U.S. may be more vulnerable to foreign disinformation this year than it was before the 2020 election. On Monday he said the warning from intelligence officials shows the U.S. election is “in the bullseye of bad actors across the globe.” “It also, disturbingly, emphasizes the extent to which foreign actors – and particularly Russia – rely on both unwitting and witting Americans to promote foreign-aligned narratives in the United States,” Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said in a statement. In one measure of the threat, officials tracking foreign disinformation say they have issued twice the number of warnings to political candidates, government leaders, election offices and others targeted by foreign groups so far in the 2024 election cycle than they did in the 2022 cycle. Officials won’t disclose how many warnings were issued, or who received them, but said the significant uptick reflects heightened interest in the presidential race by America’s adversaries as well as improved efforts by the government to identify and warn of such threats. The warnings are given so the targets can take steps to protect themselves and set the record straight if necessary. Russia and other countries are also quickly pivoting to exploit some of the recent developments in the presidential race, including the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump as well as President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Following the attack on Trump, for instance, Russian disinformation agencies quickly amplified claims that Democratic rhetoric led to the shooting, or even baseless conspiracy theories suggesting that Biden or the Ukrainian government orchestrated the attempt. “These pro-Russian voices sought to tie the assassination attempt with Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine,” concluded the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, which tracks Russian disinformation. Intelligence officials have in the past determined that Russian propaganda appeared designed to support Trump, and officials said Monday they have not changed that assessment. Eroding support for Ukraine remains a top objective of Russian disinformation, and Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past and is seen as less supportive of NATO. While China mounted a sprawling disinformation campaign before Taiwan’s recent election, the nation has shown much more caution when it comes to the U.S. Beijing may use disinformation to target congressional races or other down-ballot contests in which a candidate has voiced strong opinions on China. But China isn’t expected to try to influence the presidential race, the officials said Monday. Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., said Monday that his government has no intention to interfere with U.S. politics. Iran, however, has taken a more aggressive posture. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said earlier this month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and have provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said. Iran opposes candidates likely to increase tension with Tehran, officials said. That description fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of a top Iranian general. Messages left with representatives from the Russian and Iranian governments were not immediately returned Monday. « Previous Next","summary":"Tumultuous U.S. politics in recent weeks have prompted Russia, Iran and China to revise their propaganda playbook rapidly.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/07/29/russia-relies-on-unwitting-americans-to-spread-election-disinformation-u-s-officials-say/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Election_2022_Fighting_Misinformation_22584_f8cdd7-1722297162.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 22:51:45","author":"David Klepper,DAVID KLEPPER - Associated Press","authors":["David Klepper","DAVID KLEPPER - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.069},{"id":252918934,"title":"Celeb-led ‘White Women for Kamala’ is cringe city","text":"Just when I thought the racialized madness of 2020 was floating away — that it had being destroyed by reason and sanity. It’s back. And on Zoom no less, the medium of choice for the crazy Covid era. With a woman of color on the Democratic ticket, progressives have fallen back on their worst instincts: performative allyship and race essentialism. Politics by segregation. Last week, Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts organized a massive Zoom meeting — “White Women: Answer the Call” — for Kamala Harris. On the call, which drew over 200,000 participants, reportedly raised $2 million and has been dubbed the largest Zoom in history, Watts declared (with great humility, of course): “White women, we have 100 days to help save the world.” I thought white saviors were bad? Hey, on the plus side, the left suddenly knows what a woman is again. Author Glennon Doyle lectured. The singer Pink was there. “The White Lotus” actress Connie Britton spoke, jokingly calling herself and the others “Karens for Kamala.” In other words, gazillionaire elites with the luxury of telling other women — ones who may be worried about paying their grocery bills — that they should cede their personal interests in favor of intersectionality. And then there was influencer Arielle Fodor, who has 1.3 million followers on TikTok, where she is known as Mrs. Frazzled. She speaks like a mid-level marketing mama on the verge of being invited to the annual conference in Cabo if only she can enlist five more eager wine moms to her vitamin-selling team. Fodor was introduced as someone “here to help gentle parent us through this election.” Perhaps because I am personally familiar with wooden spoon parenting, this came off as incredibly infantilizing. But hey, maybe it’s just this white woman. “BIPOC women have tapped us in as white women to step up, listen and get involved this election season,” she said. Thank you, BIPOC women, for allowing your white proxy to give us other white chicks explicit permission to exercise our rights as Americans. Fodor outlined ways to use white privilege “to make positive changes.” Chief among them: Shut up. “if you find yourself talking over or speaking for BIPOC individuals or, God forbid, correcting them, just take a beat. And instead we can put our listening ears on.” Oh, the soft bigotry. Politics by strict affinity groups is not only the height of cringe — regressive and reductive. It’s also clearly the #KHive plan, as member are organizing Zoom pep rallies by ethnicities and gender. There’s also “White Dudes for Harris” on Monday night, which comes with Pete Buttigieg and trucker-cap merch. There are grass-roots calls for South Asians, Latina women, black men. And while it’s not out of the realm to campaign to specific demographics, the spirit isn’t about building a coalition. In this version, we all fit in neat little boxes that correspond with our immutable characteristics. What happened to rugged individualism? What happened to thinking for yourself and freedom of thought, free from the boxes you check on a census form. The liberal women I grew up around made fun of Stepford Wives, only to become an even more bizarre version of them: bots programmed to speak in therapeutic language while performing guilt rituals in the name of virtue. Real people — men and women of all races and creeds — want intellectual rigor. We want to discuss ideas. We want to disagree like adults, not be shushed like kindergartners in segregated classrooms. If this is the campaign, it doesn’t bode well for a Harris presidency. Will debate and dissent only be allowed if the person is the right race and sex?

But he used his speech in Texas, part of the library’s commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, to also criticize former President Donald Trump and Project 2025, in addition to promoting Vice President Kamala Harris, now his party’s presumptive standard-bearer. “The president is no longer constrained by the law,” he said. “The only limits on abuse of power will be self-imposed by the president alone. That’s a fundamentally flawed view and a fundamentally flawed principle.” Biden’s Supreme Court reforms include term limits and a binding code of conduct for justices, as well as a constitutional amendment ensuring former presidents are not immune from prosecution for crimes committed in office, a direct response to the court’s decision in Trump v. United States. Biden opened by praising Johnson, whose footsteps he followed last week when he, like Johnson before him in 1968, delivered an Oval Office address confirming that, as an incumbent president, he would not seek reelection months before voters begin casting their ballots. “As a kid coming up, I always admired President Johnson for his public service, whether as a school teacher in South Texas, a master of the United States Senate, a historic vice president and president,” he said. “His philosophy was simple: in a great society, no one, no one should be left behind.” Biden was warmly welcomed by the audience and detoured from his prepared remarks to speak at length about his decision to pursue politics. Biden was supposed to appear at the library on July 15, but the event was rescheduled due to the attempt on Trump’s life the weekend before. Instead, the president taped an interview with NBC‘s Lester Holt before being diagnosed with COVID-19 later that week. The White House conceded en route to Texas that Biden’s reforms would be difficult to turn from recommendations into reality, particularly as some would require congressional approval and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has already described them as “dead on arrival.” “We’re going to have to count on members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, outside of the aisle, listening to the constituents here,” Office of Public Engagement Director Steve Benjamin told reporters on Air Force One. At Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, Biden told the same reporters the White House and congressional Democrats would find “a way” to pass the reforms. At the library, he added Johnson’s thinking was “dead on arrival.” In an opinion piece published by the Washington Post, Biden wrote that, as a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has a “great respect for our institutions and separation of powers.” “What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms,” Biden wrote Monday morning. “We now stand in a breach.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “We can and must prevent the abuse of presidential power,” he continued. “We can and must restore the public’s faith in the Supreme Court. We can and must strengthen the guardrails of democracy. In America, no one is above the law. In America, the people rule.” Harris has also expressed support for Biden’s reforms, indicating she would advocate them next year if she becomes president.","summary":"President Joe Biden has embarked on his long goodbye to the White House, calling for the Supreme Court to be reformed one week after stepping down as the 2024 presumptive Democratic nominee. &#8220;I have great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers laid out in our Constitution, but what&#8217;s happening now is not [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3103280/biden-dings-supreme-court-trump-lbj/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/biden-supreme-court-1-scaled.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 22:42:51","author":"Naomi Lim","authors":["Naomi Lim"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":252918762,"title":"I am convinced Kamala Harris will be our next president","text":"Something like 65% of voters wanted candidates other than Joe Biden and Donald Trump running for President.
