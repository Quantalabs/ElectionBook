They were divided into 35 separate documents detailing all the eligible entries in 107 categories, totaling 846 pages of everyone who’s eligible.\n\n(Not all categories are included in the posted ballots, because some use judging panels or other methods of choosing nominees.) \n\nWe’ve looked through all of those pages and learned a few things. So here’s an overview of Emmy nomination voting in 2025, which will last through Monday, June 23.\n\nThere are fewer entries than there were in 2024\n\nLast year was a rough one for the Emmys, with the effects of the pandemic and the actors and writers strikes reducing the number of shows that made it on the air and cutting the number of entries in the vast majority of categories, sometimes by as much as 40%. But rather than rebounding to pre-strike levels, this year’s field is also down, though not nearly as much.\n\nOf the 106 categories for which a year-by-year comparison is possible, 44 have more entries this year than they did last year; six have the name number of entries; and 56 have fewer entries. Overall, the number of submissions in all categories is down – but only slightly, with a total drop of 142 entries spread out across all of the categories.\n\nLimited series had an off year\n\nIn the program categories, Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series took the biggest hit. Only 33 series qualified, 16 fewer than last year’s total and 28 fewer than the 61 eligible titles only two years ago. That led to the three biggest drops in the acting categories, which all took place in the limited series/TV movie categories: lead actor fell by 22, supporting actor by 37 and supporting actress by 32.\n\nSomething similar happened up and down the ballot: In every category devoted to limited series and TV movies, both above and below the line, this year saw a significant drop, almost always in double digits.\n\nBut we’ll have more nominees this year\n\nApart from the Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Comedy Series categories, which are set at eight nominees each, the number of nominees in each category is determined by how many submissions are made in that category. If it’s 20 to 80, the category gets five nominees; 81 to 160 gets six; 161 to 240 gets seven; anything over 240 gets eight. \n\nAnd despite the overall drop in submissions, more categories appear to be in line to go up in size than to go down this year.\n\nIn the acting races, for example, lead actor in a drama series should drop from six nominees last year to five this year, and supporting actor in a limited series should drop from seven to six. But supporting actor in a comedy should go up from six to seven, guest actor in a drama should go up from five to six (with guest actress following because the rules dictate actor/actress equity) and performer in a short-form series should go up from three nominees last year to five this year.\n\nOverall, eight categories are in line to grow in size compared to last year; only six are in line to go down. \n\nCategory hogging in the acting categories is quite possible this year\n\nFor years, a small number of shows have grabbed a large number of acting nominations. “The White Lotus” is a prime example, dominating the supporting categories in its first two seasons by getting eight noms in its first year and nine in its second. “The Morning Show” got seven acting noms of its own last year, while “Succession” set a record with 14 acting nominations in 2022 and then tied it in 2023.\n\nCould it happen again this year? The Emmy ballots suggest it’s possible, starting with the roster of candidates from “The White Lotus.” A full 20 of the actors from Mike White’s show were submitted, from favorites like Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs, Carrie Coon and Aimee Lou Wood to lesser-known contenders like Nicholas Duvernay, Lalisa Manobal and Charlotte Le Bon. Nine men and 10 women are entered in the supporting actor and actress category, while Scott Glenn is the sole cast member entered in a guest category.\n\nBut while “Lotus” has had the greatest success among this year’s contenders in racking up multiple nominations in the past, it’s not the show with the most acting entries this year. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “The Studio” has 22 entries, which include cast members along with 12 movie-industry figures who are submitted for playing themselves, or at least versions of themselves: Zac Efron, Dave Franco, Ron Howard (also up for playing himself in “Only Murders in the Building”), Zoe Kravitz, Greta Lee, Anthony Mackie, Sarah Polley, Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Stoller, Olivia Wilde, Ramy Youssef and, most surprisingly, journalist Matt Belloni.\n\nOther shows with lots of acting submissions include “Abbott Elementary” with 12, “Hacks” with 13, “The Pitt” with 17 and “Severance” with 19. But they’re all slackers compared to our next item.\n\n“Saturday Night Live” went all out\n\n“SNL” celebrated its 50th season by submitting an astonishing 43 different actors to the Emmys. You’d think they could have gone for an even 50 to match the number of seasons – but there really wasn’t anybody left to enter. The “SNL” submissions included every one of the season’s 14 “repertory players,” all three of its “featured players,” five celebrity guests (Dana Carvey as Joe Biden, Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walz, Mike Myers as Elon Musk, Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff and Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris), and every single one of the season’s 20 hosts, from Jean Smart to Scarlett Johansson. Plus, Darrell Hammond was submitted for narrating the series’ anniversary special.\n\nAs fine as the anniversary spirit is, though, voters have been cooling on the show’s performers in recent years. After “SNL” averaged almost eight acting nominations a year from 2015 through 2021, it has averaged only three in the past three years. The only cast members to be nominated in that time have been Kate McKinnon once and Bowen Yang twice, plus nods for hosts Quinta Brunson, Jerrod Carmichael, Ryan Gosling, Pedro Pascal, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig.\n\nThe choreography category has the ultimate category-hogger\n\nThere are 34 entries in the Outstanding Choreography for Variety or Reality Programming categories. They come from shows that include Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show, “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” the Grammys and the Oscars and “Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2024,” with 18 different programs supplying 18 of the nominees.\n\nAnd then there’s “Dancing With the Stars,” which submitted the other 16 entries in the category. No other category has this kind of imbalance, with 47% of the entries coming from one program. But it’s worth noting that while “DWTS” has received 23 Emmy nominations for choreography and won five times (placing it a distant second to the 43 noms and 12 wins for “So You Think You Can Dance”), it hasn’t had more than one nomination in the category since 2021, and the only time it has had more than two was in its first year in the competition, 2006. \n\nSome shows are worried about vote-splitting. Others, not so much\n\nIn the directing and writing categories, “How many episodes should we submit?” has long been a thorny question. If you enter multiple episodes, are you increasing your chance of being nominated or are you making it easier to split the vote and lose out entirely? Pundits tend to favor the latter theory, though it’s not hard to find examples of a popular show landing multiple nominations: “The Bear” did it last year for directing and “Shogun” did it for writing.\n\nThis year, many of the top contenders stop with one or two entries in those categories, though it’s fairly common to go up to three submissions in directing. In comedy directing, “Abbott Elementary,” “Agatha All Along,” “The Bear,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “Runing Point” and “Somebody Somewhere” are among the programs that entered a trio of episodes for directing, while “Poker Face” and “Shrinking” were the only two shows to enter four episodes.\n\nDrama directing, though, was a different matter. Seventeen shows entered at least three episodes, with “The Pitt,” “Paradise” and “Severance” stopping at three but others going much farther. “The Boys” and “House of the Dragon” submitted five, “Will Trent” did six (including one directed by Howie Deutch and one directed by his wife, Lea Thompson), “Yellowstone” did seven and Ryan Murphy’s medical drama “Doctor Odyssey” submitted 11, one for each of its first season directors.\n\nWriting submissions were more modest, with the “Star Wars” spinoff series “The Acolyte” submitting eight episodes and the comedy series “The Conners” and “Poker Face” submitting five. Among the shows that stuck with a single entry were the comedies “Abbott Elementary,” “Hacks,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Righteous Gemstones” and “The Studio” and the dramas “The Last of Us,” “Matlock,” “Severance,” “Slow Horses” and “The White Lotus.”\n\nAnd yes, “Lotus” submitted the episode with Sam Rockwell’s monologue.","summary":"Submissions are down but nominations will be up, and \"Saturday Night Live\" put EVERYBODY on the ballot\n\n\nThe post What I Learned Reading the 846 Pages of Emmy Ballots appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/emmy-ballots-2025-takeaways-submissions/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Emmy-nominating-ballots.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 22:37:41","author":"Steve Pond","authors":["Steve Pond"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.006},{"id":331205858,"title":"In Alex Padilla’s Pacoima, fracas over ICE raids hits home","text":"Inside a cell phone repair shop on Van Nuys Boulevard, Juan Reynoso watched the video playback of what happened to Alex Padilla on Thursday. It wasn’t pretty.\n\n“Oh my God,” he said slowly and softly, his mouth agape as the stream played out on the monitor in front of him.\n\nOn the screen: A United States senator, the first Latino from California in that role, the one raised by immigrant parents in this very part of L.A. — the community of Pacoima — was being forced to the floor by federal agents and then handcuffed.\n\nJust moments before, on that very monitor, he’d been watching an app that reports to show where Immigration and Customs Enforcement stops were happening across the country.\n\nHe scooted the monitor over to show a reporter how on this Thursday afternoon — just hours after Padilla went to the mat — the raids Padilla was protesting were highly concentrated in L.A.\n\nIn fact, one of the multitude of blips on the screen, just down the street, was near a Target store in the heart of Pacoima.\n\nA week after amped-up immigration sweeps began in earnest in L.A., the widely seen incident at U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristy Noem’s press conference at the Federal Building in Westwood on Thursday was rippling into Padilla’s own L.A. hometown. The only thing overshadowing it, perhaps, was fear of ICE raids.\n\nThis is Padilla country, the place he often touts as the starting point to his journey to the U.S. Senate, and now ultimately at the forefront of the region’s clash with the Trump Administration over its immigration raids in the region.\n\nIt’s here, where in one of the oldest neighborhoods in the northern San Fernando Valley, a stretch along Van Nuys Boulevard over the years morphed into the “Mural Mile,” richly adorned with 50 murals representing Pacoima’s cultures in a three-mile radius. This is the town, after all, that was the birthplace of rock legend Ritchie Valens. There’s a mural. And then there’s the fierce stare of Danny Trejo as you head north on the boulevard. Yes. A mural.\n\nThere’s the barbershop, the community center, the panaderia, the street vendors… . It’s a town that makes no bones about its deep immigrant roots.\n\nAnd it’s a community where Padilla, 52, began his ascent in L.A., state and ultimately national politics.\n\nIt was an unlikely ascent at that — but one many, including himself, define as the culmination of an immigrant family’s journey to the American Dream.\n\nFrom Prop. 187 to a ICE raids\n\nLocal allies and many constituents have long known Padilla’s origin story: A Pacoima kid and San Fernando High School graduate who watched his father carve out a living as a dishwasher and short-order cook in the San Fernando Valley and whose mom cleaned houses in nearby affluent Sherman Oaks.\n\nFrom such humble origins, the tall Padilla, whose first love was baseball but with a penchant for math and science, found his way to MIT, where he studied mechanical engineering. Still, he was from blue-collar Pacoima, long a hub for L.A.’s Latinos going back generations, and it fueled a sensitivity to inequities in health, education, and in the workplace.\n\nThe politics of late 1980s and early 1990s San Fernando Valley and L.A. was the catalyst into public service for a young Padilla and many of his contemporaries from L.A.’s growing Latino base of the time.\n\nThose politics were defined much in part by another intense era of anti-immigrant fervor. Proposition 187, a 1994 California ballot initiative approved by voters, aimed to deny undocumented immigrants access to public services, including education, healthcare, and social services. It also required reporting of suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\nThe courts ultimately struck it down on equal protection grounds, but the fervor propelled Padilla into public service. He would join protests against Prop. 187 in the early ’90s, ultimately finding a path into politics and government, managing political campaigns for several legislative candidates and serving as a field representative for Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nBy 1999, at age 26, he’d be elected to the L.A. City Council, becoming the body’s first Latino president, and its youngest. By 2006, voters gave him the nod for the state Senate.\n\nThe rest is more modern history, which aligns with the Gavin Newsom era on the state level and the Trump and Biden eras on the national scene.\n\nAt 47, Newsom appointed him to fill the vacancy created by the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, and the next year, 2022, he won election to the seat.\n\nFull Circle fray\n\nAnd then this week, it all came full circle for Padilla, with shades of the Prop. 187 fervor that got him into politics in the first place.\n\nIn a June 10 tweet, he said as much, comparing now to then: “It was the anti-immigrant rhetoric of Prop. 187 in 1994 that first launched me into politics,” he wrote. “Now, we are witnessing the same level of xenophobia from the White House, and it is fueling a level of extremism, cruelty and disregard for due process that has no place in our country.”\n\nBut in contrast to the 1990s, he’s now the senior senator from California, a state in a protracted standoff over the legality of the administration federalizing the state’s National Guard and sending in Marines to what White House officials say is an effort to bring order back to the area.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in her new conference that “We are not going away” moments before the senator was forcibly removed.\n\nVideo shows a Secret Service agent on Noem’s security detail grabbing the California senator by his jacket and shoving him from the room as he tried to speak up during the DHS secretary’s event. Padilla interrupted the news conference after Noem delivered a particularly pointed line, saying federal authorities were not going away but planned to stay and increase operations to “liberate” the city from its “socialist” leadership.\n\n“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” he shouted in a halting voice.\n\nIn a statement, DHS said that Padilla “chose disrespectful political theater” and that Secret Service “thought he was an attacker.”\n\nThe rough treatment of Padilla was widely condemned, including by Newsom, who called it “outrageous, dictatorial and shameful,” and by Mayor Karen Bass, who labeled it “absolutely abhorrent and outrageous.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said Padilla should be charged, because although Padilla verbally identified himself as a senator, he was not wearing the pin that identifies lawmakers from civilians.\n\nIn Pacoima on Thursday, not everyone was thinking about Padilla. Some didn’t even know about what happened.\n\nSome residents knew Padilla from signs they’d see around town with his name. Others weren’t yet even born when he became the L.A. City Council’s first Latino president in 2001.\n\nThere were more pressing concerns. Raids. Business owners said they’d seen ICE vehicles driving along Van Nuys Boulevard. They worry about the drop in customers, who are staying away out of fear of being picked up by federal agents.\n\nCindy, who declined to give her last name out of concern amid the raids, wondered: “If a person in such a high position, if they can do this, what do they expect for us?”\n\nCindy runs a party supply business in town and said her shop had been hit hard over the recent days. Customers have been canceling or reducing orders during the normally busy graduation season. People don’t want to make a spectacle out of fear it might attract federal agents, she said.\n\nLike many L.A. County cities, where immigrants have made livings cooking, serving, gardening, building, retailing, cleaning, many in Padilla’s hometown are staying home. An enterprising spirit has been replaced with fear of being detained, or worse.\n\nCindy said her business has seen an abrupt dip in sales as the raids grip L.A. She ran through some of the numbers over the last couple of weeks: Six cancellations, two reduced orders. In a festive season she relies on, customers have turned away.\n\n“The vendors are just not working that much,” she lamented. Those vendors are also her customers. So when they stay home, out of fear, they cut back. And then there’s the customers who are downsizing because they don’t want to make too much of spectacle – to be too noticed, she said, adding she’s been told this directly by her clients.\n\n“Everybody’s gone,” said Reynoso, concerned about the lack of business at the small shop in recent days since the ICE sweeps began.\n\nAfter hearing about Padilla and a reported ICE arrest nearby, Clarissa Sacedo, her cousins and a neighbor ventured out to the corner of Osborne Street and Lauren Canyon Boulevard.\n\nWaving a Mexican flag, they marched at the intersection, attracting drivers and others who would listen that “we belong here,” not ICE. Honks of support echoed.\n\nA lone vendor on Laurel Canyon mused on how a street once “stacked” with vendors is now pretty much empty of them.\n\nIn March 2021, Padilla gave his first speech on the Senate floor, to introduce himself to his fellow senators, in his first appointed term. His voice cracked, much like it did this week when describing the situation at the press conference. He held back tears. He took his place at the lectern: “My name is Alex Padilla y soy el hijo de Santos y Lupe Padilla…”\n\nHis speech was framed by his now-familiar backstory: The middle son of Mexican immigrants who settled their family in Pacoima.\n\nThe new senator flashed back to his roots. He reflected on his mother, a housekeeper, and his father, a short-order cook.\n\n“It seemed liked she never took a day off, ” he said.\n\n“Think about that. In one generation our family has gone from being immigrant cooks and house cleaners to serving in the United States Senate,” he said.\n\n“That’s the California Dream. That’s the American Dream.”","summary":"Now the senior U.S. senator from California, Alex Padilla's career in public service started amid intense fervor over immigration in the early 1990s.

They also asked that Paramount and CBS’ response to a motion to compel from Trump be due July 28.\n\n“The Parties are not seeking to extend any deadlines regarding the pending motions to dismiss, and Defendants intend to file their reply on or before June 23, 2025. Nor are the Parties seeking to extend any other deadlines in the Court’s Scheduling Order,” the filing adds. “Plaintiffs’ counsel has conferred with counsel for Defendants, and all Parties have consented to this motion in writing.”\n\nTrump’s lawsuit takes aim at an Oct. 7 “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he has claimed was deceptively edited to make her look good. \n\nIn a legal filing last month asking the court to deny Paramount’s motion to dismiss the suit, Trump alleged the Harris interview caused him “mental anguish and confusion” and that its “false advertising and tampering” withheld viewers’ attention from him and his social media platform Truth Social, resulting in a decrease in value for Trump Media and Technology Group and his other media holdings.\n\nCBS News has maintained that Trump’s accusations of deceitful editing were false, explaining that the promo shown on “Face the Nation” used a longer section of Harris’ answer. It also turned over the transcript and camera footage from the interview to the FCC as part of the agency’s investigation into allegations of “news distortion.” In a March filing to dismiss the Trump suit, CBS called it “an affront to the First Amendment” and “without basis in law or fact.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently shot down Paramount’s offer to settle the lawsuit for $15 million, with the president aiming to get at least $25 million and an apology.\n\nThe high stakes legal battle comes as Paramount’s pending $8 billion merger with Skydance Media awaits regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses of the media giant’s 28 owned-and-operated local TV stations. \n\nThe deal, which executives have said would close in the first half of 2025, recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7.\n\nDemocratic Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden issued a warning to Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone last month that reaching a settlement in exchange for regulatory approval could violate federal anti-bribery laws. The California State Senate has also launched an investigation into the matter and invited former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and former CBS News president Wendy McMahon to testify.\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has argued that the settlement talks with Trump are unrelated to the agency’s review of the Skydance deal. But he has warned that “all options remain on the table” in the agency’s ongoing investigation into alleged “news distortion” related to the Harris interview, including potentially revoking CBS’ broadcast license if the network is found to have violated the agency’s public interest standard.\n\nParamount’s settlement talks come as Disney previously paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Meta also paid $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit about being kicked off Facebook and Instagram after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.","summary":"The president's team asked the Texas federal court to delay the deadlines for the media giant's motion to compel and his response to that motion to June 30 and July 7, respectively\n\n\nThe post  Trump Lawyers Ask to Extend Deadlines in $20 Billion CBS Lawsuit, Citing &#8216;Active Settlement Discussions&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-cbs-lawsuit-deadline-extension-request-settlement-discussions/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Shari-Redstone.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 21:37:41","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":331197006,"title":"Trump’s plans to be a ‘peace’ president appear to have gone up in flames","text":"President Donald Trump tore into Tehran and stated his support for Israel Friday morning after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched aerial bombardments against Iranian nuclear sites hours earlier and took out some of Iran’s military commanders and nuclear scientists in the process. \n\nSpecifically, Trump chided Iran for not complying with his desire for a “deal” on its nuclear program. \n\nEarlier in the morning, he told Fox News that the United States would assist Israel. \n\n“I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,’ but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done,” he posted on Truth Social. “I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it.” \n\nIt marked a striking change in tone for the White House from just the night before, when Secretary of State Marco Rubio had issued a statement clearly emphasizing that Israel had acted unilaterally. Just hours before the strike, Trump still seemed to signal a willingness to make a deal even while acknowledging Israel could strike.\n\n“We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue! My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran,” he said. “They could be a Great Country, but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nThe flare-up between Israel and Iran is just the latest escalation that Trump has overseen. While Trump has always had an anti-interventionist streak, he has attempted more vocally during his 2024 campaign and his subsequent return to the White House to reduce America’s role in foreign conflicts and wind down conflicts that began before his second term. \n\nEarlier this week, Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican in the older model of the word and an ardent supporter of Ukraine, asked Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth whether Ukraine or Russia was the aggressor in the war. In response, Hegseth said Russia was, but when McConnell asked which side Hegseth wanted to win, Hegseth said “this President is committed to peace in that conflict.”\n\nThat reflected Trump’s larger avoidance of outright support for Ukraine. During his one debate with Kamala Harris, he said he wanted the war to end but not whether he wanted Ukraine to win. Specifically, he said that even before he would take the oath of office, he would speak to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nHe famously pledged that he could end the war in 24 hours\n\nTrump’s desire to end the war manifested itself in him blaming Zelensky for the conflict, despite the fact Russia invaded Ukraine. It culminated in his infamous blow-up where Vice President JD Vance tag-teamed with him to heckle Zelensky in front of the cameras and warned “You're gambling with World War Three.” \n\nOf course, Zelensky is simply defending his country from aggression by Russia and Putin has had its eyes on Ukraine long before the 2022 invasion. Zelensky has also shown his own willingness to do what he feels is necessary, such as when Ukraine launched a bold drone attack inside Russia entitled “Operation Spiderweb.” \n\nAnd Putin has not met Trump’s overtures in kind. \n\nRather, Putin continued his assault on Russia, with Trump often imploring “Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!” Last week, Trump spoke with the Russian president and said they had “a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.”\n\nTrump’s decision to side fully with Israel means that Trump will once again set aside his “America First” ambitions, which has sought to have America retreat from the larger world through a three-pronged approach of non-interventionist foreign policy, heavy tariffs to prevent foreign good from entering the United States and immigration restrictionism that seeks to close the country off from immigrants who come legally and illegally while deporting migrants in the United States. \n\nTrump has never been much of a peacenik for humane reasons — he famously threatened to “bomb the s***” out of ISIS — but now, he has realized he has to handle the larger burdens that come with being the president of the world’s super-power. \n\nAnd letting go of that responsibility is harder than he may have imagined.","summary":"The president’s decision to side with Israel’s offensive against Iran is the latest example of how his ambitions for non-interventionism have met reality, Eric Garcia writes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-iran-israel-ukraine-russia-peace-b2769826.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/13/17/Pictures_of_the_Week_Global_Photo_Gallery__02447.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wUv4G4GD-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-13 21:32:07","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":331208306,"title":"Top Trump stooge eyes California governor run—on one condition","text":"Richard Grenell can’t keep season ticket holders from leaving the once-nonpartisan Kennedy Center, where he’s president of the board of trustees, but apparently, Grenell thinks he has a chance at being California’s next governor. \n\nGrenell, who is also a Trump administration diplomat, is reportedly eyeing a run to replace term-limited Gov.

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., for his disruption Thursday of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem‘s press conference.\n\n“Sen. Padilla should have been in Washington, D.C., voting. He has a responsibility to his constituents to show up at work—not try to make a spectacle of himself,” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the Senate Majority Whip, told The Daily Signal. \n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also had harsh words for the California lawmaker.\n\n“Sen. Padilla should be standing up for the law-abiding citizens he was elected to serve—not defending illegal aliens committing horrific crimes in communities across California,” Blackburn said.\n\n“His decision to storm into Secretary Noem’s press conference and refuse to follow instructions was entirely unacceptable. This kind of behavior shouldn’t be tolerated from anyone, let alone a sitting U.S. senator,” the Tennessee lawmaker told The Daily Signal.\n\nAfter Padilla repeatedly ignored instructions from Noem’s security team to put his hands up and pushed against the team in attempting to make his way to interrupt her press conference, he was forcibly removed from the room. At that point, he was told to get on the ground and was handcuffed. \n\n“You can’t show up without your pin, refuse to announce yourself, and lunge at a Cabinet secretary. It doesn’t matter who you are,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said in a post on X. \n\n“If Sen. Padilla wanted to speak with Secretary Noem, he could have set up a meeting like everyone else,” Tuberville said. \n\n“But this wasn’t about that. Sen. Padilla wanted to cause a scene … and then to cry wolf when he got it,” the Alabama senator contended. \n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told The Daily Signal he was still assessing the situation.\n\n“Well, I’ve spoken with Sen. Padilla. I’ve spoken with Jennifer Hemingway, who is the sergeant-at-arms in the Senate, and I’m trying to connect with Secretary Noem. I haven’t reached her quite yet, but we want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator. And that’s try to gather all the relevant information,” Thune said. (The GOP leader said he has since spoken with Noem, a fellow South Dakotan.)\n\nPadilla defended his outburst in a number of posts on X. \n\n“What happened yesterday was part of a much bigger effort to try and silence anyone who dares to question what the Trump administration is doing. But we will not be intimidated, and we will not be deterred. We must hold this administration accountable,” the California senator said on the social media platform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the response to Padilla’s disruption. \n\n“[It] sickened my stomach—the manhandling of a United States senator,” Politico reported Schumer as saying. \n\nFellow California Democrat Sen. Adam Schiff also weighed in on the incident.\n\n“The disgraceful and disrespectful conduct of DHS agents, pushing and shoving him out of a briefing like that, demands our condemnation,” Schiff said in a post on X.\n\nPadilla was initially appointed to his Senate seat by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to fill the vacancy left by Kamala Harris after she was elected to the vice presidency in 2020. In November 2022, he won a special election to complete Harris’ term, which was set to expire in January 2023. He won a full six-year term for the Senate in a separate general election also held that November. \n\nNow 52, Padilla has spent half of his life in California politics, serving first as a member of the Los Angeles City Council, where he became the council’s youngest member at just 26 in 1999.\n\nPadilla was elevated to president of the City Council by his colleagues in 2001 and briefly served as acting mayor of Los Angeles after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S. From there, he entered state politics, serving as a member of the state Senate from 2006 to 2014. He became California’s secretary of state in January 2015, and served in that role until his appointment to represent the state in the U.S. Senate.","summary":"Senate Republicans are sharply criticizing Sen.

Bass, standing before a bank of news cameras, did not hold back. \"I want to tell him to stop the raids,\" she said. \"I want to tell him that this is a city of immigrants. I want to tell him that if you want to devastate the economy of the city of Los Angeles, then attack the immigrant population.\" After taking office in 2022, L.A.'s 43rd mayor carefully avoided public disputes with other elected officials, instead highlighting her well-known penchant for collaboration and coalition-building. The high-profile Democrat, who spent a dozen years in Congress, largely steered clear of direct confrontation with Trump, responding diplomatically even as he attacked her over her handling of the Palisades fire earlier this year. Those days of tiptoeing around Trump, and avoiding head-to-head conflict, are over. Bass is now sparring with the president and his administration at a perilous moment for her city and possibly for democracy. At the same time, the tumultuous events of the past week have given her a crucial opportunity for a reset after the Palisades fire, recalibrating her public image while leading her city through another historic crisis. \"Having two moments of crisis during the first six months of this year has really tested her mettle as mayor,\" said GOP political strategist Mike Madrid, a longstanding Trump critic. \"I think it's fair to say she did not perform to expectations during the fires. I think she's considerably improved during the current situation.\" Since agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal authorities fanned out across the region, searching for undocumented immigrants at courthouses, car washes and Home Depot parking lots, Bass has accused Trump of creating a \"terrible sense of fear\" in her city. Bass said Trump is on track to waste more than $100 million on troops who were neither requested nor needed. On multiple occasions, she said Trump wrongly gave credit to the National Guard for bringing calm to downtown L.A. on Saturday, when those troops had not even arrived yet. In many ways, Trump has emerged as the ideal foil for a mayor who, for much of the past six months, had been on her back feet. In the immediate aftermath of the Palisades fire, which erupted when she was out of the country, Bass struggled to show a command of the details and was savaged by critics over what they viewed as her lack of leadership. Months later, she released a budget that called for the layoffs of 1,600 workers, drawing an outcry from labor leaders, youth advocates and many others. Bass has been quicker to respond this time around, announcing a nightly curfew for downtown, warning of consequences for those who vandalize or commit violence and spelling out the real-world impacts of the ICE arrests on her constituents. The pushback reached a crescendo on Thursday, when — with just a few hours notice — Bass assembled more than a hundred people from religious, community, business and civic groups to denounce the raids. It made for a potent tableau: a multi-ethnic, multiracial crowd of Angelenos cheering on the mayor as she declared that \"peace begins with ICE leaving Los Angeles.\" Bass said she had received reports of ICE agents entering hospitals, workers not showing up to their jobs, parents afraid to attend their own children's graduations. An immigrant rights advocate said Trump had brought cruelty and chaos to Los Angeles. A church pastor from Boyle Heights said his parishioners \"feel hunted.\" Trump and his administration have disparaged Bass and her city since the raids began. Stephen Miller, the president's deputy chief of staff, accused Bass on X of using \"the language of the insurrectionist mob\" while discussing her city. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called L.A. \"a city of criminals\" whose law breakers have been protected by Bass. Republicans have begun threatening reprisals against outspoken Democrats, including Bass, with some hinting at criminal prosecution. Asked about Bass' comments over the past week, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said ICE agents would not be \"deterred from carrying out their mission.\" \"We will not apologize for enforcing immigration law and carrying out the mandate the American people gave President Trump in November: deport illegal aliens,\" she said. Fernando Guerra, who heads the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, said Angelenos fully expect their mayor to confront the president head on. Democrat Kamala Harris secured more than 70% of the vote in L.A. during last year's presidential election, while Trump received less than 27%. \"I'm not surprised by what she's doing,\" Guerra said. \"I would even suggest she push a little more. I don't think there's a cost to her politically, or even socially, to taking on Trump.\" The mayor is regularly calling in to TV and radio stations, as well as securing prime time hits on national cable shows. In appearance after appearance, she has warned that L.A. is becoming \"a grand experiment\" — a testing ground for Trump to see if he can usurp the authority of Democratic mayors or governors in other states. On Tuesday, while addressing troops at Fort Bragg, Trump described L.A. as \"a trash heap,\" with entire neighborhoods being controlled by \"transnational gangs and criminal networks.\" Hours later, Bass clapped back on MSNBC, saying: \"I have no idea what he's talking about.\" Bass has spoken repeatedly about traumatized Angelenos who could not locate loved ones caught up in the ICE raids. \"For the most part, the people that have been detained have been denied access to legal representation,\" Bass said during an appearance at the city's Emergency Operations Center. \"This is unprecedented.\" The raids, and their impact on families and children, are deeply personal for a mayor who cut her teeth organizing with immigrant rights activists decades ago. Bass' own family reflects the multi-ethnic nature of her city. Her late ex-husband was the son of immigrants from Chihuahua, Mexico. Her extended family includes immigrants from Korea, Japan and the Philippines. Immigration agents were recently seen making arrests outside her grandson's Los Angeles school, she said. The arrival of ICE, then the National Guard, then the U.S. Marines has caused not just Bass but several other Democrats to step out in ways they might have previously avoided. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a soft-spoken political figure for decades, was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a press conference in Westwood on Thursday after interrupting Noem's remarks. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently accused Trump of a \"brazen abuse of power,\" calling him \"unhinged\" and filing a lawsuit to block the deployment of the National Guard — not a huge departure for Newsom, who relishes both confrontation and the spotlight. Head-to-head accusations are much more out of character for Bass, who spent her first two years at City Hall boasting of her success in \"locking arms\" with her fellow elected officials on homelessness and other issues. In recent months, the mayor has praised Trump for the speedy arrival of federal resources as the city began cleaning up and rebuilding from the Palisades fire. Long before winning city office, Bass prided herself on her ability to work with other politicians, regardless of party affiliation, from her early days as a co-founder of the South L.A.-based Community Coalition to her years in Congress. Bass' strategy of avoiding public spats with Trump during the first few months of his administration was no accident, according to someone with knowledge of her thinking who was not authorized to speak publicly. The mayor, that person said, viewed an extended tit-for-tat as an impediment to securing federal funding for wildfire relief and other urgent needs. \"That's more her brand — to get things done with whoever she needs to get them done with,\" said Ange-Marie Hancock, who leads Ohio State University’s Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity. Mike Bonin, who heads the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State L.A., said he thinks that Bass' career of building multiracial, multi-ethnic coalitions makes her uniquely suited to the moment. Now that Trump has \"all but declared war on Los Angeles,\" Bass has no choice but to punch back, said Bonin, who served on the City Council for nearly a decade. \"I don't see that she had any political or moral alternative,\" he said.","summary":"For Bass, a high-profile Democrat who has avoided public conflicts with other elected officials, the days of tiptoeing around Trump are over.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out raids in Paramount, Los Angeles County, following similar actions at several locations throughout other parts of the city on Friday.The Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids, some of which have swept up individuals with proper documentation. In response to protests counter the raiding, Trump announced the deployment of thousands of National Guards and hundreds of Marines.California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's news conference on Thursday in Los Angeles.Mary Trump has been outspoken against her uncle for years, and in 2020, published Too Much and Never Enough, a tell-all book about Trump and their family. In it, she says the president is \"utterly incapable of leading this country and it's dangerous to allow him to do so.\"What To Know As Noem spoke at a scheduled news conference in L.A., Padilla, a California Democrat, was taken from the room while saying he had questions to ask her. Video footage from the incident showed that Padilla was pushed to the ground and handcuffed outside the door.\"I'm Senator Alex Padilla, and I have questions for the secretary,\" Padilla was heard saying as he was escorted out of the room. Noem continued her remarks, addressing an audience of reporters and law enforcement officials.Video footage from the incident showed that Padilla was pushed to the ground and handcuffed outside the door. Noem stopped speaking for a brief moment during the commotion, then immediately continued.Politicians on both sides of the aisle have condemned the interaction, with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, telling reporters the incident is \"shocking.\"\"I've seen that one clip. It's horrible. It is shocking at every level. It's not the America I know,\" she said.In a Thursday video, Mary Trump referenced Padilla's removal, saying, \"We've been getting to a darker and darker place in this country for quite some time now.\"She continued that since Trump's second inauguration on January 20, \"the rapidity with which America has been sliding down that slippery slope is a little unnerving. And the last week alone has made it clear that we are not turning this around anytime soon.\"Trump announced the deployment of the National Guard and Marines without the approval of California Governor Gavin Newsom, a rare assertion of federal authority over a state. The administration continues to clash with the state and city's Democratic leadership, with both sides trading criticism.In reference to the ongoing ICE raids and Padilla's removal, Mary Trump said, \"Trump and his regime are making it apparent to anybody who is paying attention that whether they are allowed to or not, whether it's constitutional or not, whether it's legal or not, they will detain, manhandle, and arrest anybody who has the audacity to question them, try to get in their way, or protest them.\"Noem addressed the incident afterward, telling Fox News, \"He was never arrested. Nobody knew who he was when he came into the room creating a scene. He was removed from the room and yes, they started to put handcuffs on him. When he finally identified himself ... that was stopped.\"She added, \"Basically, they are encroaching upon our first amendment rights—free speech and to protest peacefully,\" concluding that, \"this basically is what authoritarianism looks like, when the party of power starts arresting the opposition.\"\"No Kings\" protests, organized in part by the 50501 Movement (50 protests, 50 states, one movement) and other groups, are countering a military parade scheduled to take place in the nation's capital on June 14, coinciding with Trump's 79th birthday, the Army's 250th anniversary, and Flag Day.Organizers of the protests are calling for June 14 to be a \"nationwide day of defiance\" and are calling for both people to join in the protests as well as eat up tickets to the military parade.What People Are Saying Former Vice President Kamala Harris, on X: \"United States Senator Alex Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration's actions in Southern California. This is a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"Dan Bongino, deputy director of the FBI, wrote on X: \"With regard to the incident in LA this afternoon, the Senator in question was not wearing a security pin and physically resisted law enforcement when confronted. Our FBI personnel acted completely appropriately while assisting Secret Service and we are grateful for their professionalism and service.\"Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, on X: \"Senator Alex Padilla was fulfilling his Congressional oversight duties when he was thrown to the ground and handcuffed. This is no isolated instance; this is a pattern of behavior by the Trump administration. There is simply no justification for this abuse of authority.\"Padilla said in a statement after he was removed: \"If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farmers, to cooks, to day-laborers throughout the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country.\"The Department of Homeland Security posted on X on Thursday: \"Senator Padilla chose disrespectful political theater and interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem.\"What Happens Next The incident has intensified scrutiny of the DHS and has raised fresh concerns about civil liberties amid the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.Organizers are calling for people to attend demonstrations being held across the country or to organize their own events.

Cottom argued that Democrats desperate for Obama to save the party are \"undignified\" and weak, asserting that change will not come from above, but rather from \"the streets.\" \"We must start asking how we can save ourselves. We are seeing the start of that in places like Los Angeles, San Antonio and Raleigh, N.C.,\" she wrote, referencing the anti-ICE protests occurring across the country. \"Only direct, sustained protest will protect us.\" The Times columnist claimed that President Donald Trump has led the country into \"dangerous territory\" by deploying the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, suggesting the moment feels significant enough to warrant Obama’s intervention. DEMOCRATS FORGE STRANGE BEDFELLOWS AS PARTY FLOUNDERS IN TRUMP'S 2ND TERM She noted that the social media murmurs and essays questioning Obama's whereabouts at such a pivotal moment speak to an accepted truth: \"The Democratic Party lacks leadership\" in the wake of Kamala Harris' 2024 defeat. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., offer \"glimmers of a charismatic party head waiting in the wings,\" she wrote. While Obama may feel like a good option, she wrote, she gave his presidency a mixed review from a liberal perspective, saying he was a \"product of his times.\" Cottom diagnosed those who believe that Obama will come back to save the party with \"Obama Derangement Syndrome\" (ODS). She argued that even if Obama did make his return to the political arena, he would have a difficult time competing in the \"outrage era\" of social media algorithms and big tech monopolies.

It needs a Spotify,\" Cottom declared, reinforcing her argument by pointing out what Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter has done for conservative discourse online.

Tim Walz, D-Minn., is hoping for rain on Saturday during President Donald Trump's military parade. During a \"What’s Next: Conversations on the Path Forward\" event hosted by the Center for American Progress (CAP), Walz told CEO Neera Tanden that he had never hoped for rain so much in his life. \"I'm just going to confess to it,\" Walz said. \"It might get me in trouble. Whatever. I have never so hoped for rain in my life.\" Trump is hosting a massive Flag Day military parade on Saturday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to gather in the nation’s capital to witness the historic parade, which also coincides with the president's 79th birthday. TIM WALZ FLOATS CHINA AS 'NEUTRAL ACTOR' WITH 'MORAL AUTHORITY' TO NEGOTIATE MIDDLE EAST PEACE According to the FOX Forecast Center's Risk Of Weather Impact (ROWI) assessment, there is a medium risk of inclement weather in the nation's capital, with showers and thunderstorms expected throughout part of the evening. And Walz is hoping for that perfect storm. PROTESTERS EXPECTED TO CONVERGE ON DC, NEIGHBORING CITIES AHEAD OF TRUMP'S MILITARY PARADE The Democrat, who rose to the national stage as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during her brief 2024 presidential campaign, criticized Trump along his usual attack lines on Friday. Walz said Trump is \"incompetent at governing,\" and America is in a \"dangerous time\" under Trump's leadership, which the Minnesota governor said is \"marching towards authoritarianism\" following the chaotic incident in which authorities forcibly removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press conference Thursday. The Democrat confirmed on Friday that he will be speaking at a \"No Kings\" protest in St. Paul, Minn., this Saturday during Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C. \"Somehow this got tied to billionaires in China funding this or whatever,\" Walz said Friday. \"I'm like, these are like people in St. Paul that just do protests and stuff. That's what they do. They're feeling it, and they organized it. I think going and making that case, it is a good counter.\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., grilled Walz about attending the protest during a House Oversight Committee hearing with his fellow \"sanctuary governors\" on Capitol Hill Thursday. Luna said DHS discovered that China considered Walz a \"prime target for influence operations.\" \"You are working with, and going to be speaking at, an organization and rally that is not just funded by Christy Walton, the heiress of Walmart, but also has ties to the Chinese Progressive Association largely funding it, that actually brags on their website that they are pro-Maoist,\" Luna said. But Walz dismissed Luna's allegations, doubling down that Trump's military parade \"just looks wrong, feels wrong.\" \"I think I'm going to go be with a few thousand folks who kind of have the tradition that there is a separation there, that we don't need this. This is not Pyongyang on a Saturday,\" Walz said, before admitting he was hoping for rain. Pyongyang is the capital of North Korea, which is a communist, totalitarian dictatorship. Walz has joined many Democrats, including those planning to protest on Saturday, who have criticized Trump's military parade, drawing comparisons to China's and North Korea's military parades. Trump's military parade on Saturday comes amid escalated conflict in the Middle East, after Israel launched air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and military leaders, and Iran responded by launching missiles toward Israeli territory.

We can’t control everything.\n\nBut, at least to some degree, we make our own luck.\n\nThere’s an old saying, known as the serenity prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\n\nBut I like the new twist that I first saw in the most recent years, attributed to Angela Y. Davis: “I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.”\n\nOf course, most of us, acting alone, cannot change much.\n\nBut, acting together, we can change a lot.\n\nContact your reps and your senators – especially if they are GOP – and complain about that damned budget bill for billionaires.\n\nIf you can, attend a No Kings rally on Saturday.\n\nIt’s up to us. We are the story now. \n\nCome on in, friends, and see how many of us are making this story better.\n\nNote: I put most of this together before what happened to Senator Padilla. That was bad, but it was also theatrics designed to make us look in a different direction. There are many stories tRump is trying to hide, and the biggest one is about us.\n\nRegular Scheduled Programming\n\nNo one here is naïve; we are aware of the many who are fighting to destroy our country. Some of us expected it: the cheating, the lying, and the chaos. But we are here to read the efforts and the positive results of those (including us and our fellow gnus) who are working so hard to save our country and the planet from those very bad people. We are furious with them for what they are doing and we are letting them know.\n\n💜Although they lie all the time, reality matters.

So, take the time to recharge your batteries, make sure to protect yourself, your family and your friends, but find ways to contribute to the well-being of our country and our world.\n\n🗽 Reports on Resisters 🗽\n\nIn her opening monologue from Monday (June 9), Maddow points out that the most important story is how we respond:\n\nDon’t want to watch? Here are some of the highlights (I wish they still did transcripts).\n\n No question about what this president is trying to do. The question is, will he succeed? And the answer will not be found by looking at him. It’s by seeing what we do. The question is, what will this country allow him to do.\n The answer is what happens in the streets, the courts, the states, and Congress.\n We are seeing over and over again, is that protesting against him works. He wants to seem strong, but he is weak. Protesting works, courts work, pushback works.\n Marcelo (high school kid in MA), Carol (restaurant worker in MO), little girl with health issues is here, Antonio is still here\n Pushback doesn’t always work, but pushback is the only thing that ever does work\n She shows protests against ICE around the country, and says tRump is panicking\n Protests also put steel in the spine of the political opposition (e.g., the Dems). Shows Governor Newsom, Representative Maxine Waters\n Maddow argues that the forces sent to intimidate Los Angeles and other places are symptoms of weakness — a president who doesn’t know how to get the support of his people\n\nSo, my friends, keep on protesting.\n\nAnd especially you can protest tomorrow!\n\nNeed ideas for making a sign? How about\n\n No masks on ICE\n Budget for people not billionaires\n Tax the Rich\n Save Democracy\n Truth Matters! Love Matters!\n\nAlready got your sign?

Sorry about the Boebert comment.\n\nAnd some off the cuff analysis:\n\nTACO! TACO! TACO! tRump surrenders on deportation:\n\nIn case you don’t want to watch, tRump said, because of pushback from farmers and other employers, ICE is going to stop going after the hardworking undocumented. In fact, the incompetent ICE have been deporting fewer people than were deported daily under Biden.\n\nThis is a complete surrender.\n\ntRump stumbles — sorry for showing the ugly mug! But actually I’m showing it because it is so very ugly...\n\ntRump and musk broke the law. Surprise, surprise!\n\nIt’s important to fan the flames of division in the Rs.\n\nGeorge Conway on how tRump turns on allies Alex Henderson AlterNet\n\nDuring Donald Trump's first presidency, he was on very friendly terms with the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal group, and its activist, Leonard Leo. All three of Trump's U.S. Supreme Court appointees — Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch — were people the Federalist Society aggressively promoted. And many of Trump's appointees to the lower federal courts were endorsed by the Federalist Society as well.\n\nBut Trump, now four and one-half months into his second presidency, is angrily railing against the Federalist Society and called Leo a \"sleazebag\" and a \"bad person\" on his Truth Social platform. :scissors:\n\nThe fact that Trump now hates the Federalist Society after working with them in the past, according to Conway, underscores his \"narcissistic\" personality.\n\nConway told host Sarah Longwell — who, like him, is very much a Never Trumper and rooted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election — \"Remember Mary Trump's book?.... The title was 'Too Much and Never Enough.' You can never satisfy this narcissistic appetite of Donald Trump. Because there will always be something else that he'll want from you that you can't give him or won't give him. And then, he'll turn on you.\"\n\nNote: This is why no one should ever give him an inch. Won’t ever be satisfied.\n\ntRump’s paranoia could be bad news for Vance Alia Zehra AlterNet\n\nTrump's decision to select Vance as his vice president, Wolff noted, was influenced by Musk — who allegedly tied his substantial financial support to Vance’s nomination.\n\nIn a post on the social platform X following Musk's attacks against Trump last week, Vance said: “I’m the vice president to President Trump. My loyalties are always going to be with the president.”\n\nBut Wolff said it’s unclear whether Vance’s statement that he stands with the president will be enough to earn Trump’s trust following this fallout.\n\n🚚 💙 Democrats Deliver 💙 🚚\n\nSome inspiration: Governor Newsom has been speaking up. And filing in the court.\n\nAnd the call up was illegal. \n\nI don’t know, can the soldiers just go home? Because tRump, in this case, is not their commander…\n\nAlways enjoy Representative Crockett!\n\nAnd in case you missed it, and even if you didn’t (because repetition is good), Gina Ortiz won her election to become mayor of San Antonio.\n\nI bet some people wrote postcards for her, so well done, gnusies!!!\n\nSome excellent healthcare news in Oregon (sorry, arhpdx, for stepping into your state, but repetition is good)\n\nWe need unity.

But they are attracting all the cameras.\n\nVote to reduce the government, and the government is not there when you need it.\n\n📣 Let’s Honor Truth ☀️️\n\nWe honor truth tellers. We also honor those who protect the truth tellers. One of those groups is Whistleblower Aid. \n\nWant to know more? Here’s a description by Allison Gill, the founder of Mueller She Wrote, and currently the podcaster hosting The Daily Beans. \n\nHey everybody, it’s AG, and I'm super excited to announce our partnership with Whistleblower Aid. These are the lawyers that go up against the government to protect those willing to speak out, and they do this work pro bono!\n\nAnd they have a track record. Remember that in the first Trump administration, Whistleblower Aid successfully and safely empowered truth-tellers to stand up and protect democratic values, resulting in Trump's first impeachment as well as accountability for intelligence officers and others working to keep the Capitol safe on January 6. They are representing our good friend and fellow whistleblower, Miles Taylor, and are currently supporting several other Trump Administration whistleblowers we can’t even talk about because whistleblower aid cares about protecting the identities of those who want to speak truth to power anonymously!\n\nThese are David and Goliath cases that Whistleblower Aid takes on, again at no cost to those they represent, which is why they need our help. If you can give any amount, no matter how small, you can feel good about helping these incredible attorneys protect and defend the brave folks who want to speak out in the public interest and in defense of democracy.\n\nHere’s the case from the website about how they are representing Miles Taylor against the retaliation from the current evil regime (If you don’t recall, Miles Taylor was the guy who wrote Anonymous during the first evil regime):\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 3, 2025 – Miles Taylor, former President Trump-appointed Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Whistleblower Aid client, filed a complaint against the Trump Administration today, calling on federal watchdogs to investigate Trump’s retaliation against him. In April, Trump issued an Executive Order explicitly targeting Taylor for investigation for a litany of alleged serious crimes, including treason. This is the first time in U.S. history that a President has invoked investigative powers against a named private citizen.\n\nIn response to Miles’s complaint, Whistleblower Aid CEO, Libby Liu, issued the following statement:\n\n“Miles’s bravery in filing this complaint represents a major step in fighting back against President Trump’s weaponization of presidential power to punish those who disclose wrongdoing. Trump’s labeling of Miles as a ‘traitor’ and his issuance of an unprecedented Executive Order that invokes the full investigative weight of the U.S. government against a named, private citizen, is as unconstitutional as it is autocratic. Retaliation has no place in the democratic process, and the Trump administration’s revenge against whistleblowers, like Miles, is ripped right out of the authoritarian playbook. President Trump’s disregard of our Constitution – which he has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend – threatens the very fabric of our Republic.\n\n🌹 Let’s Celebrate Love ❤️\n\nAs this Sunday is Father’s Day, this week we celebrate Dads showing love: Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nFrom paying off their child’s credit card debt to donating a kidney, a new survey revealed some of the most life-changing ‘dad acts’ in honor of Father’s Day.\n\nThe survey of 2,000 Americans uncovered fatherhood stories showing they truly are the most helpful heroes, with people sharing stories of selflessness and kindness.\n\nOne respondent shared, “The most heroic thing my father has ever done for me was during Hurricane Harvey—he trudged through the waters to come get me.”\n\n📎Odds & Ends 📎\n\nGlobal investment in clean energy soaring Cristen Hemingway Jaynes EcoWatch\n\nAn increase in spending on clean energy is expected to drive record global energy investment of 3.3 trillion in 2025, with 2.2 trillion of that in “clean-energy technologies,” according to the latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nDespite economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, the World Energy Investment 2025 report shows China leads the way as the largest investor in energy.\n\nClean energy technologies will attract twice the capital of fossil fuels, with more investment being made in solar PV than in any other technology, the report said.\n\n“Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record $3.3 trillion as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks,” said Executive Director of the IEA Fatih Birol in a press release from the intergovernmental organization. “The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”\n\nFar fewer girls being aborted these days The Economist\n\nWithout fanfare, something remarkable has happened. The noxious practice of aborting girls simply for being girls has become dramatically less common. It first became widespread in the late 1980s, as cheap ultrasound machines made it easy to determine the sex of a fetus. Parents who were desperate for a boy but did not want a large family—or, in China, were not allowed one—started routinely terminating females. Globally, among babies born in 2000, a staggering 1.6m girls were missing from the number you would expect, given the natural sex ratio at birth. This year that number is likely to be 200,000—and it is still falling.\n\nNote: not perfect yet, and in some places still terrible. But this is a good sign.\n\nNote: without enough women to go around, some guys become incels. Not good for them, not good for society.\n\nNever too late to help your brain! Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nIt’s never too late to start eating better to prevent dementia, according a new analysis of research involving 90,000 adults.\n\nPeople over the age of 45 who followed a dietary pattern known as the MIND diet were “significantly” less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia, said the University of Hawaii scientists.\n\nThe MIND diet stands for Mediterranean Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, and was developed by the late Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush University nutritional epidemiologist. It combines the traditional Mediterranean diet with the blood pressure-lowering DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension).\n\nIt includes proven ‘brain-healthy’ foods such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, fish, and olive oil.\n\nThe study found that the MIND diet had a stronger and more consistent risk reduction relationship with dementia than other ‘healthy’ diets for the majority of racial groups in the study.\n\nNote : sometimes it does feel as if the US has become dumber – could this be why? My own father was a committed liberal until the end of his life – when he had dementia.\n\nBill Gates to give most of his fortune to Africa Farouk Chothia BBC News\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates says that most of his fortune will be spent on improving health and education services in Africa over the next 20 years.\n\nThe 69-year-old said that \"by unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity\".\n\nSpeaking in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, he also urged Africa's young innovators to think about how to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve healthcare on the continent.\n\nGates announced last month that he would give away 99% of his vast fortune - which he expects to reach $200bn (£150bn) - by 2045, by when his foundation planned to end its operations.\n\n🐦 I do a lot of other writing.

Alex Padilla responds after forced removal from immigration briefing","text":"U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday and handcuffed by officers as he tried to speak up about immigration raids that have led to protests in California and around the United States.\n\nNoem’s security detail was captured on camera grabbing Padilla by his jacket and shoving him around the room in a video as he tried to speak during the immigration briefing. Padilla interrupted the news conference after Noem said that federal authorities were not going away, but planned to stay and increase operations to “liberate” the city from its “socialist” leadership.\n\nAfter images and video of the scuffle ricocheted through the halls of Congress and social media, Padilla read a brief statement to reporters, saying he was in the federal building “awaiting a scheduled briefing from federal officials as my responsibility as a senator to provide oversight and accountability.”\n\nWhile Padilla was waiting for the briefing to begin, he learned that Noem was having a press conference a few doors down the hall, so he decided to attend.\n\nThe White House has accused Padilla of grandstanding.\n\nWhat happened at the news conference\n\nIn an update on immigration enforcement in Los Angeles on Thursday, Noem said immigration authorities will continue to carry out arrests of people in the country illegally who have criminal records, and that protesters who engage in vandalism and violence will “face consequences.”\n\nPadilla interrupted by shouting, “I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary.”\n\nNoem continued addressing reporters and law enforcement officers while Padilla was ejected from the room.\n\nScuffling with officers outside the room, Padilla can be heard shouting, “Hands off!” He was later seen on his knees and then pushed to the ground and handcuffed in a hallway, with several officers atop him.\n\nWhile addressing the media outside of the building, Padilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, said he and his colleagues had received little to no response from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to their questions in recent weeks, so he attended the briefing for more information.\n\n“I came to the press conference to hear what she had to say, to see if I could learn any new additional information. And at one point, I had a question,” Padilla said. “Let me emphasize, just like we emphasize the right for people to peacefully protest and to stand up for their First Amendment rights, for their fundamental rights, I was there peacefully.”\n\n“At one point I had a question so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room,” Padilla stated. “I was forced to the ground and I was handcuffed. I was not arrested. I was not detained.”\n\n“I will say this, if this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question … I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day labourers throughout the Los Angeles community, and throughout California and throughout the country. We will hold this administration accountable.”\n\nIn a statement, DHS said that Padilla “chose disrespectful political theater” and that Secret Service “thought he was an attacker.” The statement claimed that Padilla did not identify himself.\n\n“Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the statement said, adding that “officers acted appropriately.”\n\nNoem told Fox LA afterward that she had a “great” conversation with Padilla after the scuffle, but called his approach “something that I don’t think was appropriate at all.”\n\n“I think everybody in America would agree that that was inappropriate,” she added.\n\nNoem said that during her 15-minute meeting with Padilla, they “probably disagree on 90 per cent of the topics” but they will continue to speak to each other.\n\n“He and I exchanged phone numbers. We’re going to continue to talk and we’ll have conversations,” she said. “We may be as far apart on the political spectrum as possible but we’re all human beings and we all love this country, I hope.”\n\n“Padilla didn’t want answers; he wanted attention,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “It’s telling that Democrats are more riled up about Padilla than they are about the violent riots and assaults on law enforcement in LA.”\n\nPadilla disputes the Trump administration’s account of events\n\nDuring an interview with MSNBC, Padilla disputed the White House’s account of events that took place on June 12.\n\nPadilla said he was removed while demanding answers about U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration’s “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions.”\n\nHe called Noem’s description of the events “ridiculous” after she claimed that he “started lunging towards the podium, interrupting me and elevating his voice.”\n\n“It’s a lie but par for the course for this administration,” Padilla began.\n\n“They said I wasn’t wearing my pin. My polo says ‘United States Senate,'” Padilla said. “There was no threat. There was no lunging. I raised my voice to ask a question, and it took what, maybe, half a second before multiple agents were on me.”\n\nHe called the degree of force used by the FBI agents against him “excessive” and an “overreaction.”\n\nHe said that he complied with the agents’ orders because of the lessons he learned from growing up in San Fernando Valley.\n\n“Where I grew up, you know what happens if you don’t obey law enforcement. So I began to go on my knees to the extent that they would let me,” Padilla said. “I kept repeatedly asking them, ‘Why am I being detained?’ No answer. ‘Why am I being detained?’ No answer. ‘Why am I being detained?’ No answer.”\n\nAs for his meeting with Noem, Padilla said that the agents removed his handcuffs and he was invited to meet with her for “a few minutes.”\n\n“You’d think she might have started the meeting with an apology for what happened? Of course not,” Padilla said.\n\nPadilla noted that he is OK, but he hopes others feel the outrage he does.\n\n“If this can happen to a United States senator for having the audacity to ask a question for the secretary of homeland security … just image what could happen to anybody in the country for that matter,” he said.\n\nPadilla has been very vocal about Trump and his deportation agenda.\n\n“Trump isn’t targeting criminals in his mass deportation agenda, he is terrorizing communities, breaking apart families and putting American citizens in harm’s way,” Padilla said of recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles in a social media post.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nMany of Padilla’s colleagues shared their outrage after he was removed from the cabinet secretary’s news conference and many demanded an immediate investigation into the interaction.\n\nCalif. Gov. Gavin Newsom called Padilla’s removal “outrageous” in a social media post.\n\n“This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control,” he said. “This must end now.”\n\n“If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you,” Newsom added.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said what he saw “sickened my stomach.”\n\n“We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,” the New York senator said from the Senate floor. “It’s despicable, it’s disgusting, it’s so un-American.”\n\nKamala Harris wrote in a social media post Thursday that Padilla “was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this administration’s actions in Southern California.” She called his forceful removal “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”\n\nDemocratic senators quickly gathered in the chamber, denouncing the treatment of their colleague and urged Americans to understand what was happening.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump is making this country “look more and more like a fascist state.”\n\n“Will any Republican senator speak up for our democracy?” Warren pleaded.\n\nSen. Tina Smith called on Noem to resign, saying there was no justification for Padilla’s treatment and that the Trump administration needed to be held accountable.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson accused Padilla of “charging” Noem and indicated that the behaviour “rises to the level of a censure.”\n\n“My view is it was wildly inappropriate,” Johnson told reporters outside the House chamber as people walking past shouted over him, “That’s a lie!”\n\n“A sitting member of Congress should not act like that,” Johnson said, loudly speaking over reporters’ questions. “It’s beneath a member of Congress. It’s beneath the U.S. senator.”\n\nSenate Republican leader John Thune said he had spoken to Padilla and is trying to reach Noem but hasn’t yet connected with her.\n\n“We want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator and try to gather all the relevant information,” the South Dakota senator said.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said what happened to Padilla “was un-American” and those involved must be held accountable.\n\n“This is not going to end until there is accountability and until the Trump administration changes its behaviour,” Jeffries added.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal called the video “utterly revolting” and said there should be consequences.\n\n“If they can do this kind of violent reprisal against a United States senator just for showing up at a press conference, it can happen anywhere,” Blumenthal said.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called Padilla’s removal “abhorrent and outrageous.”\n\n“He is a sitting United States Senator. This administration’s violent attacks on our city must end.”\n\nLeaders from the League of United Latin American Citizens expressed their outrage and condemned Padilla’s treatment.\n\n“What happened to Senator Alex Padilla is nothing less than an outrageous abuse of power and a direct assault on our democracy,” Roman Palomares, LULAC national president, said in a statement. “That a Latino U.S. Senator was physically removed from a public press event simply because he dared to ask tough questions of a federal cabinet official is unacceptable and will not be silently tolerated in our country.”\n\n— With files from The Associated Press","summary":"'There was no threat.

During a \"What’s Next: Conversations on the Path Forward\" event hosted by the Center for American Progress (CAP), Walz responded to a question from CEO Neera Tanden about the \"escalatory\" nature of the strikes. Walz said, \"Iran has to retaliate, in their mind,\" and the \"Middle East is back on fire in a way that has now expanded.\" \"Now, who is the voice in the world that can negotiate some type of agreement in this? Who holds the moral authority? Who holds the ability to do that? Because we are not seen as a neutral actor, and we maybe never were,\" Walz said of the United States' role in de-escalating tensions in the Middle East. According to Walz, the United States once attempted \"to be somewhat of the arbitrator\" in those negotiations during the Iran Nuclear Deal, but he said Americans must face the reality that the \"neutral actor\" with the \"moral authority\" to lead negotiations in the Middle East \"might be the Chinese.\" WALZ RIPPED FOR 'SICKENING' USE OF NAZI-ERA LANGUAGE DESCRIBING TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICY: 'ANTI-AMERICAN' Walz didn't elaborate on why China would be that world leader. WALZ SAYS HARRIS PICKED HIM FOR VP TO 'CODE TALK TO WHITE GUYS' The Democrat's ties to China took center stage during his brief time as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election. During the 2024 campaign cycle, Fox News Digital reported that Walz had been a longtime vocal supporter of a medical research institute in his home state with a long track record of collaborating with a firm labeled by the Pentagon as a \"Chinese military company\" and with Chinese officials with controversial ties to the CCP. And in a letter unearthed by Fox News Digital, Walz boasted about Minnesota hosting several top Chinese leaders. The Minnesota International Chinese School showcased a 2021 letter from Walz on its YouTube channel celebrating the 10th anniversary of the school's Chinese New Year. CAP, who hosted the conversation with Walz, has its own questionable ties to China.

In 2020, their net favorability stood at +23 points. This year that has flipped to -6—a 29-point decline in support for undocumented immigrants among immigrants themselves. Enten did not specify which demographics were included in his aggregate.It comes as polls suggest that Trump's hardline immigration stance is resonating with much of the public. In a sharp turnaround from his first term, Trump now holds a net positive approval rating on immigration, rising from -21 in June 2017 to +1 today, according to CNN's Harry Enten—his biggest gain on any issue.A YouGov/CBS News poll conducted June 4-6 found 54 percent of Americans support Trump's deportation program targeting undocumented immigrants, surpassing his ratings on the economy (42 percent) and inflation (39 percent). Additionally, 51 percent approve of ICE conducting searches.An RMG Research poll echoed that result, with 58 percent backing the deportation efforts. And in an Insider Advantage survey, 59 percent approved of Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to the protests.But the support has limits. Some polls show that Trump's handling of deportations is broadly unpopular. A survey conducted by YouGov/Economist found that just 39 percent of respondents approve of how the former president is managing deportations, while 50 percent disapprove, giving him a net approval rating of minus 11. A separate Quinnipiac poll showed even deeper dissatisfaction, with 40 percent approval and 56 percent disapproval—netting a negative 16-point rating on the issue.Meanwhile, 56 percent disapprove of how Trump's mass deportation program is being implemented, according to the CBS/YouGov poll. A separate YouGov survey found only 39 percent approve of the administration's overall approach to deportations, while 50 percent disapprove.The issue remains deeply polarizing as 93 percent of Republicans support the deportation plan, compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Independents are divided. Nearly half of Americans believe Trump is going further than he promised during his campaign.His military deployment is even more controversial. A June 9-10 YouGov poll found only 34 percent of Americans support sending Marines to Los Angeles, while 47 percent disapprove. A majority—56 percent—say state and local governments, not the federal government, should handle the situation.But among immigrant voters, Trump's immigration policy appears to be resonating.Experts say that immigrants are increasingly backing Donald Trump's hardline immigration stance due to frustration over what they see as a broken and unfair system.Thomas Gift, a political science professor at University College London, told Newsweek that many immigrants feel betrayed by current immigration policies, especially ones created under President Joe Biden. \"Part of this shift likely stems from frustration among immigrants who feel they 'followed the rules' and now resent those who entered the country unlawfully,\" Gift explained.Jeremy Beck, co-president of the immigration reduction group NumbersUSA, told Newsweek that more immigrants came to the U.S. between 2021 and 2025 than during any other period in history—\"more than half of them illegally.\"Between 2021 and 2024, there were over 10.8 million total illegal border encounters, according to the Department of Homeland Security, far exceeding the 2.8 million total from 2017–2020.That surge, he said, has spurred a backlash even among immigrant voters who helped form Trump's \"winning coalition in November.\" These voters, he added, sent a \"decisive message\" to Washington: \"Manage immigration at levels we can sustain, and credibly enforce the limits.\"The shift is also visible in the broader electorate. Beck pointed to Latino-majority districts in Texas and Colorado where Trump or immigration hardliners performed strongly. Trump made historic gains among Hispanic voters in 2024, with only 55 percent supporting Kamala Harris to Trump's 43 percent—an 8-point increase from 2020 and the highest percentage for a Republican presidential candidate since such data has been tracked.Beck concluded that Trump's \"willingness to enforce immigration laws gives him a clear advantage\" with voters—especially immigrants who went through the legal process. \"After the border crisis, voters are aware of how important it is to manage immigration policy in the national interest,\" he said.But Maria Cristina Garcia, Professor of American Studies at Cornell University, cautioned against drawing broad conclusions from polling on immigrant views toward immigration enforcement and support for Donald Trump. \"This poll as represented here in the video doesn't really tell me much,\" she said, emphasizing that Latino and immigrant communities are far from monolithic.Garcia argued that attitudes on immigration vary significantly depending on national origin, geography, and personal history. \"People of Mexican ancestry who live in border counties along the Rio Grande... are likely more hawkish on immigration than, say, a Dominican American in Washington Heights in NYC,\" she explained. Similarly, Cuban Americans differ in outlook depending on when and why they migrated to the U.S.But she noted that economic conditions strongly influence immigration attitudes, which could explain their support for Trump: \"Historically, U.S. citizens (including the foreign-born) have been more likely to demand bars to immigration when the economy sputters and they experience more pressure on their day-to-day lives.\"Gift echoed this, explaining that, like other Americans, immigrants are feeling the economic pressure from illegal immigration, including \"stresses on public services, housing shortages, and rising competition in certain labor markets.\"Beck, meanwhile, noted that immigrants are often the first to feel the impact of mass migration: \"They tend to work in the same occupations. They feel the downward pressure on their wages, and witness the degradation of workplace conditions for themselves as well as new arrivals.\"According to a 2024 report, approximately 36 percent of immigrants lived in lower-income households, compared to 29 percent of U.S.-born individuals. And a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) indicates that 43 percent of immigrants anticipate their financial situation will worsen in the coming year, compared to approximately 33 percent of U.S.-born individuals.Trump has sought to attribute economic pressures like this to illegal immigration. During a June 2024 presidential debate, Trump claimed that illegal immigrants were \"taking Black jobs\" and argued they were \"killing\" working opportunities for minority communities.\"His big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in... They're taking Black jobs now... and they're taking Hispanic jobs,\" he said.And in a March 2025 speech to Congress, Trump blamed \"open-border\" policies for causing widespread strain—implying economic stress on hospitals, schools, and communities, which often correlates with inflation concerns.\"Joe Biden didn't just open our borders—he flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities,\" he said.For Beck, this is why immigration resonates so strongly with immigrant voters grappling with economic anxiety.\"The party that can set enforceable limits on immigration that serve the interests of immigrant voters could achieve a lasting realignment,\" he said.What People Are SayingEnten said: \"There is no bloc of voters that shifted more to the right from 2020 to 2024 than immigrant voters.\"Thomas Gift said: \"Part of this shift likely stems from frustration among immigrants who feel they \"followed the rules\" and now resent those who entered the country unlawfully or are seen as having bypassed the legal process. Like other Americans, immigrants themselves are affected by many of the same perceived challenges associated with illegal immigration, such as stresses on public services, housing shortages, and rising competition in certain labor markets. These numbers show just how far Biden's alleged \"open border policies\" have shifted immigrants toward supporting the Republican Party.\"Maria Cristina said: \"This poll as represented here in the video doesn't really tell me much, though.\"Let's say these pollsters just focused on Latinos who are foreign-born citizens. You're likely to find differences across Latino groups and geographic regions. People of Mexican ancestry who live in border counties along the Rio Grande, for example, are likely more hawkish on immigration than, say, a Dominican American in Washington Heights in NYC. A Cuban American who arrived in the 1960s and has no family left in Cuba might be more hawkish than a Cuban-born US citizen who arrived in 1996 and hopes to one day sponsor a family member. The more interesting question (to me) is why are some groups more hawkish than others? What is it about their experience that has led them to hold certain perspectives?\"For many foreign-born citizens (like all citizens in general), perspectives on immigration are tied to the state of the economy. Historically, US citizens (including the foreign-born) have been more likely to demand bars to immigration when the economy sputters and they experience more pressure on their day-to-day lives.\"As for why some immigrants voted for Trump...again, much depends on the group. Immigrants that fled a communist country, for example, might believe the MAGA-GOP's falsehood that Democrats are socialists or communists and worry about it. Or they might worry about the culture wars and feel that the Democratic party disregards their more religious or patriarchal values. There are many different reasons for the shift to the GOP. If so, voting GOP doesn't necessarily mean they liked Trump. Indeed, I'd like to see a polling question of GOP voters on whether they actually liked Trump.\"\"But in the end, immigrants are most concerned about the economy and the opportunities they believe will be available to them.\"Jeremy Beck said: \"Those are remarkable findings, although not entirely surprising. Whenever immigration levels spike, recent immigrants are among the first Americans to feel the impact. They tend to work in the same occupations. They feel the downward pressure on their wages, and witness the degradation of workplace conditions for themselves as well as new arrivals. They see the exploitation. They live in communities overwhelmed by unsustainable numbers. Mass immigration's strain on infrastructure, hospitals, schools, and homeless shelters affects foreign-born citizens directly and indirectly.\"More people came to the U.S. between 2021-2025 than in any other period in history; more than half of them illegally. The shift in immigrant voters is part of a broader shift in American voters who live off of their wages as opposed to their stock portfolios. These immigrant voters were part of Trump's winning coalition in November and they delivered a decisive message to Washington, D.C. last November: Manage immigration at levels we can sustain, and credibly enforce the limits. Enten's polling should not be surprising to anyone who remembers the shift toward Trump in majority-Latino districts in South Texas. Or in Colorado's 8th district, which is 40 percent Latino, where two candidates campaigned on who was tougher on immigration enforcement. The border crisis was tied with inflation for the top reason voters did not vote for Vice President Harris; and thirty six percent of Latino voters cited immigration as a top concern. One out of four Democratic voters believe the Party deliberately open the border. President Trump willingness to enforce immigration laws gives him a clear advantage with these voters. Many immigrant voters who themselves work through a sometimes difficult legal process understandably rejected policies that led to a crisis in which millions of people who should not have been admitted to the U.S. were released into the country outside of the legal system established by Congress.\"After the border crisis, voters are aware of how important it is to manage immigration policy in the national interest. The party that voters trust to fully enforce the law within the limits of the law has an advantage. The party that can set enforceable limits on immigration that serve the interests of immigrant voters could achieve a lasting realignment.\"What Happens NextTrump's approval rating among immigrant voters is likely to fluctuate.Meanwhile, coordinated nationwide protests against Trump and his administration's policies are also planned to take place in cities in all 50 states on the president's birthday on June 14.","summary":"The Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-immigration-immigrant-voters-2084425","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662774/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 16:45:39","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":331110710,"title":"Moore headlines another swing state event despite insistence 2028 isn’t on his mind","text":"The Detroit NAACP event, titled the “70th Annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner,” will feature Moore alongside Detroit leaders like NAACP Detroit President Rev.

The thinking is that current management is resizing the business because they plan on operating Paramount for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs On The Money was first to report, Paramount’s top brass – aside from Redstone (she’s recused herself because of the potential payday) – is wary of the optics of paying off Trump so Shari can walk away with what’s left of the nest egg left to her by her father, the late merger impresario Sumner Redstone.\n\nThey fear it could open the company to bribery charges by settling the frivolous lawsuit – alleging “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris in the heat of the campaign (Trump won the election so there’s no damages) – that their directors and officers insurance doesn’t cover if some prosecutor brought a case.\n\nAll true, but the layoffs had little to do with the future of the deal, one way or the other, people close the transaction told On The Money.\n\nSkyDance had planned to own Paramount by now, and was planning the exact same cuts to make the numbers work before it can invest and grow the business, sources said.\n\nWith the deal in limbo, Paramount just did it first so cross that tea leaf off your list.\n\nThe second tea leaf is a little more interesting, though I am told, just as inconsequential to the deal’s outcome.\n\nIt involves the appearance of Skydance boss David Ellison ringside at a UFC 314 fight in Miami several weeks ago with Trump, who was shaking hands and schmoozing with the likes of Joe Rogan and Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nThe tea-leaf-reading talk here speculated that the deal is back on – Trump can’t wait to approve it as a favor to David’s dad, and Trump bestie, Larry Ellison. Why would Trump be seen with Larry’s kid if he were about to screw him?\n\nExcept, guess who else was ringside as Trump made his way through the crowd? Elon Musk, yes that Elon who had just called Trump some really nasty names. So nasty that earlier this week, Elon issued a semi-apology. He was sitting with his son, not far from the younger Ellison and Trump.\n\nSo cross that one off as well, deal watchers tell me.\n\nFor now, those looking for clues on how this stalemate ends will have to turn over a new tea leaf.","summary":"If Shari Redstone settles Trump's \"60 Minutes\" lawsuit, will that be enough to get the deal approved by his broadcast regulators?","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/13/media/how-to-read-the-tea-leaves-on-stalled-8b-paramount-skydance-deal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Shari-Tea-leaves-ANIMATE2.gif?w=950","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 13:11:06","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":331058648,"title":"Texas' Largest Newspaper Trashes Greg Abbott Protest Move: 'Expect Better'","text":"The Houston Chronicle, Texas's top selling newspaper, has published an editorial fiercely critical of Governor Greg Abbott over his rhetoric and decision to deploy Texas National Guard troops in response to protests against immigration enforcement, saying \"we expect better of him.\"Newsweek contacted Governor Abbott for comment on Friday via email outside of regular office hours.Why It MattersOn Tuesday, Abbott announced the deployment of Texas National Guard soldiers. The following day on X he said \"5,000+\" National Guard personnel would help manage protests in the state adding: \"Don't mess with Texas.\"The move came after days of unrest in Los Angeles which began on June 6 when demonstrators clashed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents attempting to conduct raids in the city. The following days saw more violent disorder with Waymo self-driving vehicles set on fire and rocks thrown at police who responded with tear gas and other \"less lethal\" weapons.Abbott's move places him at odds with California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who opposed President Donald Trump's decision to deploy California National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles.What to KnowIn its editorial, the Houston Chronicle said Abbott's decision to deploy National Guard troops following protests \"seems like an overreaction,\" adding: \"But there was no serious indication Tuesday that Texas was on the verge of exploding. No burning cars. No looting. No mayors imposing curfews.\"Instead the editorial claimed the \"most significant provocation to violence seemed to come from Abbott himself, citing the governor's warning that \"Peaceful protesting is legal. But once you cross the line, you will be arrested. FAFO.\" FAFO is an acronym for 'F*** around find out.'The editorial described this as \"the kind of thing that middle schoolers say before a fistfight\" adding: \"This isn't the grown-up leadership that Texas needs.\"According to All Sides, a website which monitors media bias, the Houston Chronicle is a centrist publication. In recent years it has endorsed Democratic presidential candidates including Kamala Harris in 2024 and Joe Biden in 2020.There was some disorder in Austin and Dallas on Monday night during anti-ICE protests, police making a number of arrests in both cities.According to Fox 7 Austin, four officers were injured after some demonstrators began throwing rocks and other missiles, while police responded with pepper balls and tear gas.Further protests are expected across Texas on Saturday as part of the national \"No Kings\" movement, which said it has organized 1,800 demonstrations nationwide. The protests coincide with Trump's 79th birthday and a controversial parade planned for Washington, D.C. nominally celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ordered the Trump administration to return control of the California National Guard troops he deployed to Newsom, though this was later temporarily blocked by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal.What People Are SayingIn its editorial the Houston Chronicle said: \"We join Gov. Abbott in urging that anyone planning to protest do so peacefully. But we also hope that he and other leaders will set a respectful tone and allow police to do their jobs. Local law officers have more peacekeeping training and community knowledge than National Guard soldiers. And the National Guard, in turn, is far better at domestic peacekeeping than the U.S. military. Domestic policing is not the military's job, not what the vast majority of soldiers are trained to do.\"On Thursday, via X, Abbott said: \"Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we've seen in LA. I deployed 5,000+ Texas National Guard soldiers & 2,000+ DPS troopers across Texas to maintain order at these protests.\"Anyone who damages property or harms a person will be arrested. Don't mess with Texas.\"Speaking to Newsweek about Saturday's planned protests Mark Shanahan, who teaches American politics at the UK's Surrey University, said: \"How many people turn out for the 1,800 planned protests will be fascinating and an indication of the strength of opposition to Trump's hard-line policies on immigration and law and order. For 249 years the USA really hasn't tolerated kings or tyranny, yet this president continues to push ever-harder at those Constitutional barriers. His military parade is more reminiscent of the exercises in hubris and vanity often seen in Moscow and Pyongyang.\"What Happens NextIt remains to be seen what role, if any, the Texas National Guard will fulfill during Saturday's 'No Kings' protests. Any conflict between soldiers and demonstrators on American streets would likely spark civil liberties concerns.","summary":"Anti-Trump protests are expected across Texas on Saturday as part of the \"No Kings\" movement.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/texas-largest-newspaper-trashes-greg-abbott-protest-move-expect-better-2085043","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662458/greg-abbott.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 12:44:17","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.051},{"id":331046462,"title":"Angry Democrats could face Tea Party-like movement from the Left","text":"Hogg’s extracurricular activities created a crisis of confidence for new DNC Chairman Ken Martin, according to leaked audio.\n\n“I’ll be very honest with you, for the first time in my 100 days on this job … the other night I said to myself for the first time, I don’t know if I wanna do this anymore,” he said in a May 15 Zoom meeting.\n\n“No one knows who the hell I am, right? I’m trying to get my sea legs underneath of me and actually develop any amount of credibility so I can go out there and raise the money and do the job I need to put ourselves in a position to win,” Martin continued, directing his meltdown to Hogg. “And again, I don’t think you intended this, but you essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to. So it’s really frustrating.”\n\nThe DNC has voted to hold new vice chair elections and Hogg won’t run again. But Democrats are angry and want leaders who are generally younger and uniformly more willing to take on President Donald Trump. The fall of party boss Hogg is just a single example in a larger pattern. This could all lead to a political climate inside the Democratic Party similar to the one produced by the Tea Party inside the GOP more than a decade ago.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) abandoned months of yukking it up with political rivals such as Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his podcast to challenge Trump on sending the National Guard to Los Angeles during riots over immigration enforcement.\n\nIn the short term, Newsom may be rewarded for standing up to Trump. “This is about all of us, this is about you,” he said in a June 10 video. “California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.”\n\nBut Newsom may also help position Democrats as pro-riot and hostile to immigration controls and law enforcement more generally. These issues cost the Democrats in last year’s elections and Newsom is pushing the party to the left of positions many of its candidates took during that campaign.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) tussled with security after trying to interrupt remarks by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) hesitated to affirm his support for Schumer’s continued leadership. Schumer’’s book tour, already on a topic that divides Democrats (it’s titled Antisemitism in America: A Warning), was sharply curtailed for fear of left-wing protests.\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA), an erstwhile progressive hero who has been trying to move his party toward the center, has faced a whisper campaign against the state of his mental health not all that different from what Republicans were saying about him during the 2022 Senate race. Fetterman has said he is being smeared by the “left media.”\n\nLiberals were miffed that party elders passed over progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) for top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. The Democratic caucus voted 131-84 to install Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) instead. But Connolly was 74 and suffering from throat cancer. He died in office in May. The vacancy helped Republicans pass their reconciliation bill, which extends the Trump tax cuts and funds his immigration enforcement.\n\nProgressives have been complaining about Democratic Party leaders putting their thumbs on the scale since at least the 2016 primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nDemocrats lost last year’s presidential election after former President Joe Biden was shielded from a competitive primary process. After Biden dropped out, former Vice President Kamala Harris replaced him as the nominee without any opposition. \n\nOcasio-Cortez won her seat by beating former Rep. Joe Crowley, a member of the leadership team as House Democratic caucus chairman, in a primary as a progressive challenger in 2018. But former Rep. Jamaal Bowman lost a 2024 primary to a relative centrist, Rep. George Latimer (D-NY).\n\nDemocrats may finally have an appetite for more progressive primary challengers. The Tea Party proved a mixed bag for Republicans. Conservative activists helped the GOP gain 63 House seats in the 2010 midterm elections. But many Tea Party nominees proved to be weak general election candidates when running for Senate, delaying Republican control of the upper chamber until 2014.\n\nDemocrats are currently debating whether to head toward the center or the left in response to last year’s elections.

Its pretense as a cultural marker was timed to match McDonald’s Tony Award nomination for playing Mama Rose in the revival of Gypsy. It was meant to coincide with the presumed victory of her winning a seventh Tony Award, thus making statistical history alongside Gypsy’s political makeover as a black show. But the real news, as it turned out, was Nicole Scherzinger’s win for Sunset Blvd., blocking McDonald’s ascension. Time was humiliated just as Newsweek had been for its premature “Madame President” cover crowning Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe advance planners of the legacy media machine arranged for McDonald’s coronation by scheduling Oprah Winfrey, who has never performed on Broadway, to be the presenter for the Best Actress in a Musical category. It would certify McDonald’s triumph in a way only Oprah could: as a specifically racial and womanist achievement. That confirmation of the diversity agenda would, ironically, rewrite the cultural canon and impose racial superiority. Oprah could hand McDonald the glory she had sought for Kamala Harris but was denied. (The NAACP had similarly awarded Harris a consolation prize during its recent Image Awards ceremony.)\n\nAfter the Tony loss, Oprah’s reparations for McDonald kicked in. Social media was flooded with clips of McDonald’s Tony-night performance of Gypsy’s climactic number, “Rose’s Turn.” And Oprah’s earlier video hosannah to McDonald, on Oprah Daily, was revived: “To watch someone perform at their highest vibration, a performance straight out of the soul bed. It was so stirring, her soul stirring ours, the audience, and us all having this glorified, shared, frequency experience, like she was absolutely tapped into the god source.”\n\nMcDonald herself would match Oprah’s gushing overstatement with an exhibition of highly wrought theatrics and repulsive calculation. Coming after Scherzinger’s tour de force rendition of “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” McDonald strained to upstage the competition. Shockingly, her “Rose’s Turn” emphasized all the offense of the production’s modern, Hamilton-ized racial undertones.\n\nEarlier in the week, on a CBS Morning Show interview, McDonald told Oprah’s consort Gayle King that her characterization in the Gypsy revival obeyed director George C. Wolfe’s new interpretation, reflecting Millennial race consciousness. The original 1957 Gypsy had mythified the rough-and-tumble experience of Jewish showbiz transients as they moved from vaudeville into burlesque, based on the early years of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee and Mama Rose, her aggressive stage mother pushing her daughters into showbiz.\n\nInstead of producing an original play depicting the segregated vaudeville circuits where Ma Rainey, Louis Armstrong, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, the Bert Williams & George Walker duo, and many others struggled, Wolfe and McDonald offered an anachronistic, canon-challenging hybrid of white and black theatrical history. Though set in the early 20th century, their production appealed to the Millennial social-justice fad, presenting Mama Rose — in McDonald’s words — as “a single woman who, at this time when black people were being lynched, is trying to protect these babies.”\n\nOn Tony night, McDonald attacked the scourge of racism. She ramped up the most famous solo in American musical theater, second only to Carousel’s “Soliloquy (My Boy Bill),” into her personal version of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going!” — to evoke Jennifer Holiday’s anguish in Dreamgirls and to vanquish memories of all Broadway Mama Roses who came before her. She growled, whimpered, and shrieked, using hebephrenic vocal gymnastics, swinging her arms at invisible phantoms, and nudging aside ghosts of chattel slavery with her ample hips.\n\nBy contrast, the skeletal Scherzinger transformed Sunset Blvd.’s movieland horror story into a film noir Hollywood Babylon. Her barefooted, postmodern siren sang out a film-culture elegy; she deserved the Tony for that night alone. But McDonald choose angry ugliness to tell the world “J’accuse!”\n\nAnd the PC Tony audience went nuts for it. Their standing-O followed Oprah’s cult-leader directive: “Everyone in that theater got to see Audra McDonald at her highest vibration and share in that frequency. . . . I’m still so moved and vibing from it,” Oprah emoted, testifying to a sensual, almost erotic reaction. But it was also polemical: “I walked out of there wanting to do better and be better. That is what great art does.” On Instagram, she further praised McDonald: “She’s pulling from the ancestors, the forces of life.” Oprah went tribal — part of her Jim Jones act, which was replicated in polarized social media comments about McDonald’s conniption fit.\n\nMcDonald renounced the showbiz dazzle that underscored Ethel Merman’s legendary Mama Rose prototype to emphasize the social justice politics that now dominate Broadway and corporate media. When Oprah congratulated McDonald’s fake raw anguish — “That is what great art does” — it proved this era’s ignorance of art’s true effect and purpose. We are culturally deprived, and the attempt to venerate McDonald for her unedifying turmoil backfired. Oprah and Audra sought to institute a new legend based on accusatory narcissism. Audra destroys the connection between delight and purpose that justifies Gypsy and all of showbiz. Scherzinger closed her set with the lyric “We taught the world new ways to dream.” Oprah and Audra gave us a nightmare.","summary":"Gypsy’s famous stage mother, played by shrieking Audra McDonald, is racialized in Broadway’s latest instance of gaslighting.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/06/the-oprah-approved-mama-rose-is-an-angry-narcissist/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audra-mcdonald-gypsy-tony-awards.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 10:30:49","author":"Armond White","authors":["Armond White"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.204},{"id":331012308,"title":"Los Angeles seals the Democrats’ leftward lurch on immigration","text":"On the day Trump returned to office in January, the Senate voted 64 to 35 to pass the Laken Riley Act. Named after a 22-year-old woman who was murdered by an illegal immigrant while she was jogging at the University of Georgia, the legislation stiffened penalties on illegal immigrants who commit crimes in the United States and mandated detention for more offenses.\n\nTwelve Democratic senators voted in the affirmative. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), John Fetterman (D-PA), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) all represented battleground states Trump carried. (Ossoff and Warnock also hail from the state where Laken Riley was slain.) Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) came from states where Trump cut the Democrats’ margin of victory to single digits. \n\nForty-six House Democrats also voted for the bill. “Most Democrats waved the bill off as a political messaging effort last year when Republicans first proposed it,” NPR reported on Jan. 22, saying the vote “marked a sharp shift from recent immigration debates on Capitol Hill.”\n\nActivists were incensed, with one group calling the bipartisan vote “a betrayal” and another denouncing it as “shameful” and “anti-immigrant.” A third advocacy organization complained the new law, which Trump signed nine days into his second term on Jan. 29, “calls for the unjust detention of undocumented people accused of theft-related crimes, as small as shoplifting, and allows state attorneys general to sue the federal government if they believe their states had been harmed by its failure to enforce immigration laws.” \n\nDemocrats seemed finally ready to buck the activists behind their dramatic leftward lurch on immigration. They had just lost 45% of the Hispanic vote, and most Hispanic men, to Trump. But the shift proved short-lived. As protesters rage against Trump in the streets, Democrats are being pushed even further to the left on immigration than they were before losing the election.\n\nThe Democrats’ new embrace of immigration radicalism is being led by none other than Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who initially seemed desirous of presiding over a pivot back to the center. Newsom attempted a rebrand from symbol of blue-state liberal misgovernment to thoughtful podcaster who was going to get Democrats on the right side of those “80-20 issues” that bedeviled fellow Californian former Vice President Kamala Harris in her campaign last year.\n\nNewsom interviewed conservative influencers Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, both deeply ensconced in Trumpworld. He exhorted Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s running mate, to join him in trying to understand MAGA, even if only to figure out how to defeat the president’s political movement. “When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country,” Newsom explained to an underwhelmed Walz, later adding that what Bannon says “reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”\n\nThat all went up in smoke as quickly as a car on the streets of Los Angeles, as the city was convulsed by violent protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “My understanding is that protesters essentially attempted to barricade ICE inside where they were staging for their raids, which is an activity that has been going on around the country for some time now,” Kyle Shideler, an expert on radical protests with the Center for Security Policy, told the Tablet. But things soon got out of control. \n\nNewsom sided with the mob and against Trump, who sent in the National Guard and active-duty troops to protect federal buildings and keep the peace. Newsom said it was democracy that was under attack. He seized the anti-Trump opportunity in front of him while projectiles were being hurled at police.\n\n“This isn’t just about protests here in Los Angeles,” Newsom said in a video. “This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes.”\n\n“This moment we have feared has arrived,” Newsom warned, harkening back to his party’s repeated warnings that Trump posed a unique threat to democracy.\n\nNewsom’s comments echoed those of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, whom Joe Biden had passed over for vice president five years earlier. “It makes me feel like our city is actually a test case,” Bass told reporters in a sudden burst of federalism, “a test case for what happens when the federal government moves in and takes the authority away from the state or away from local government.”\n\nThis is exactly what many Democrats and Democratic-aligned interest groups want to hear. And Trump has been known to overreach at times, so it is always possible the situation in Los Angeles could evolve, or deteriorate, in unpredictable ways. \n\nBut it wed the Democrats to a series of unpopular positions from which they were trying to disassociate themselves. “Abolish ICE” was a kissing cousin of “defund the police” that even Biden had spent years disavowing, though as president from 2021 to 2025, he did undermine the agency and limit its reach in various ways. Democrats began backsliding on that before the Los Angeles riots commenced.\n\nLike defund the police, joining the anti-ICE protests makes it seem as if Democrats oppose all immigration enforcement. So does advocacy for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, alleged to be a gang member and human trafficker rather than just a simple “Maryland man,” and Emiliano Garduno-Galvez, an arrested LA rioter alleged to have lit and tossed a Molotov cocktail at Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department deputies. \n\nDemocrats were initially emboldened when their position on Abrego Garcia seemed to poll well. But most of those polls appeared to test narrowly whether Trump should obey valid court orders and avoid mistaken deportations, which most people would reasonably want. They did not reference the criminal allegations against him.\n\nThe focus of the protests and mainstream Democrats’ outrage is supposed to be on hardworking busboys and long-settled grandmothers who have not followed up their immigration violations with subsequent crimes. Some illegal immigrants caught up in the Trump dragnet might otherwise be sympathetic figures, and deportation quotas could lead officials to make occasional mistakes. But these are not the poster children the Democrats have chosen.\n\n“Emiliano Garduno-Galvez is a criminal illegal alien from Mexico who threatened the lives of federal law enforcement officers by attacking them with a Molotov cocktail during the violent riots in Los Angeles,” Department of Homeland Security official Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “These are the types of criminal illegal aliens that rioters are fighting to protect. The Los Angeles rioters will not stop us or slow us down. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nWorking-class voters have shifted toward the GOP under Trump in part because they don’t believe their wages should be undercut by even sympathetic illegal immigrants. Many of them believe people should be deported for violating immigration law, not just using these violations as a pretext for punishing them for breaking other laws, even if most think criminal immigrants should be the top enforcement priority. \n\nMoreover, it was the mishandling of the border under Biden and Harris that contributed to a hardening of public attitudes on immigration. A recent CBS News poll found that 54% supported Trump’s deportations, and a plurality believes they are making the U.S. safer. CNN found a 40-point swing in favor of the Republicans on the issue of immigration among legal immigrants. The RealClearPolitics polling average finds most voters approve of Trump’s job performance on immigration, with only Quinnipiac finding net disapproval. \n\nA 2024 Gallup poll found that 55% wanted to reduce immigration, the highest percentage taking that position since 2001. Only 16% wanted to increase immigration levels. While the results varied, some polls found a plurality to majority support for the mass deportations Trump was promising on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden did not take the most radical position on immigration in the 2020 Democratic primaries. He had opponents who favored decriminalizing border crossings and dismantling some aspects of internal immigration enforcement. But he did call the Obama-era deportations that took place while he was vice president, which were unpopular with progressive Democrats and immigrant activists at the time, “a big mistake.” Once he was in office, at least 8 million illegal immigrants poured across the border. The New York Times described Biden as having presided over “the largest immigration surge in U.S. history.”\n\nAfter his last State of the Union address, Biden apologized not for mispronouncing Laken Riley’s name but for describing her murderer as an “illegal.” No human is illegal, the activists would say. Not even a convicted murderer. \n\nAlthough Biden and most Democratic elected officials would never put it this way, the progressive activists who influence the party’s decision-making in this area fundamentally do not believe it is legitimate for wealthy, Western countries to enforce immigration limitations meaningfully against poor people of color. This is regardless of how unregulated immigration affects working-class citizens and lawful residents of all races and ethnicities, or what the voters want.\n\nDemocrats have not always thought or talked like this about immigration. When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) first ran for president, he told liberal journalist Ezra Klein in an interview that open borders were a libertarian concept harmful to the working class. “No, that’s a Koch brothers proposal,” the Vermont socialist said.\n\nThe backlash was swift. Vox published an article calling Sanders’s “fear of immigrant labor” — remember we are largely discussing illegal immigration here — “wrongheaded” and “ugly.” By 2020, Sanders was listed alongside asterisk candidate former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as one of the two hardest-core ICE abolitionists in that year’s Democratic presidential field. “Bernie Sanders was once wary of immigrant workers,” Vox noted approvingly in February 2020. “Now he’s on their side.”\n\n“All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,” then-President Bill Clinton said in his 1995 State of the Union address. “The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That’s why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.”\n\nClinton went on to mention his immigration reform commission, chaired by a former Democratic Texas congresswoman named Barbara Jordan. But she talked very differently about the issue than today’s Democrats do. “Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave,” Jordan said. “The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.”\n\nEven the sainted Barack Obama acknowledged the moral legitimacy of immigration enforcement. While he was accused of cooking the books to make his deportation numbers look higher than they were as president, he did pursue a policy of removing illegal immigrants even if he was mainly trying to build support for “comprehensive immigration reform,” a mixture of enforcement and a mass amnesty for most illegal immigrants already in the country.\n\n“When I see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment,” Obama wrote in The Audacity of Hope, published in 2006 before he won the presidency. “When I’m forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.” (Though Obama did preface this with a confession of “nativist sentiments.”)\n\nObama failed. As president, he was unable to persuade Republicans, especially in the House, to join him in support of amnesty. Many in the GOP felt they had tried this under then-President Ronald Reagan in 1986, and it did not work. The enforcement proved episodic at best, the amnesty was permanent, and illegal immigration increased into the 1990s. (Indeed, some point to this amnesty when they look at the scenes unfolding in California, a reliably Republican state at the presidential level as recently as 1988, now.) \n\nLeft-wing activists were outraged that a Democratic president was the “deporter in chief.” They held placards saying, “No borders, no nations, stop deportations!” While Obama did not go quite that far, he then moved toward legalizing illegal immigrants by executive fiat despite arguing not long before that he lacked the legal authority to do so. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, remains in place today.\n\nThe Los Angeles riots, with their Mexican flag-waving and clashes with law enforcement, threaten to radicalize the Democrats beyond the issue of immigration. They are reminiscent of the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the anti-Israel demonstrations that unfolded on college campuses after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.\n\nUntil recently, Democrats have treated 2019 and 2020 as a sort of fever dream from which they were trying to awaken. Harris spent most of her abbreviated presidential campaign trying to obscure or walk back positions she took during that period. The excesses of the pandemic and the so-called racial justice movement were regarded as at least somewhat regrettable. \n\nTrump’s popular-vote plurality in an election that was framed as a referendum on democracy itself appeared to catch Democrats off guard. There was not even symbolic opposition to certifying the election results. In the months leading up to his inauguration and for several weeks afterward, Democrats appeared to be weighing accommodation rather than Resistance.\n\nThe pendulum soon swung back in the opposite direction, gradually at first and eventually drastically. Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency, the tariffs, and ultimately the deportations deepened progressive anger. Now, it is in full force.\n\nBORDERS VS. BUDGETS: TRUMP ALLIES SPAR OVER SECOND-TERM PRIORITIES \n\nTrump appears willing to respond in ways he only talked about doing in 2020. Invoking the Insurrection Act if the riots continue to spiral, for example, remains on the table. His allies are already referring to the anti-ICE protesters as insurrectionists. (Though Trump has also signaled a willingness to accommodate certain industries, such as hotels and agriculture, inconvenienced by his immigration crackdown.) This time, voters have rejected the progressive fever dream at the ballot box. It isn’t 2020 anymore.\n\nBut we could be in for a long summer, nevertheless.\n\nW.

She's looking to be part of a root-and-branch overhaul of the Democratic Party.Foxx is running in the special election to fill the seat for Arizona's 7th District, which remains vacant after longtime Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva died of cancer in March. Foxx's campaign, in both style and substance, mirrors that of one of her political inspirations, New York's Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: young, unapologetically progressive and grounded in her personal experience as a member of the working class.Foxx, who told Newsweek she's determined to become the youngest woman elected to Congress, hopes to bring a fresh Gen Z voice to a Democratic Party that is still soul-searching after the fallout of the second election of Donald Trump in November.Viral OriginsIf Foxx's name sounds vaguely familiar, she went viral at the age of 16 when she confronted Arizona's Republican Senator Jeff Flake at a town hall over cuts to Planned Parenthood.\"I was a teenager living with my boyfriend, working at a gas station. We relied on Title X funding,\" she told Newsweek's Olivia Cataldo in a video interview, referring to the federal program that supports family planning and health services like those provided by Planned Parenthood.Foxx says she was at \"Planned Parenthood centers to get the birth control that I needed to take control of my body and my future when I had no money, no parents and no insurance. And this is just one of those ways that policymakers often disconnected from their constituents, vote without ever thinking about the consequences for real people.\"After the clip of her confronting Flake rocketed across the internet in 2017, she became more involved in advocacy, regularly pressing local leaders to update sex-education curricula to include consent and medically accurate information, while also opposing GOP cuts to Planned Parenthood.\"We won an organizing victory to rewrite that curriculum in southern Arizona's largest school district,\" she said. \"It was my first storytelling practice as an organizer and my first win. And I never looked back.\"Born in Tucson, which sits halfway in Arizona's 7th District, Foxx was raised by a single mother relying on Section 8 housing, a federal program providing rent assistance for low-income individuals. Her mother juggled a patchwork of jobs—cleaning houses, making deliveries, sorting mail—while also struggling with addiction and working her way through recovery.\"When she was out of work, I watched her step up to help our community members make enough,\" Foxx said, recalling how her mom volunteered to cover childcare so others could take extra shifts.\"Those are my first organizing memories,\" she added, reflecting on how neighbors pitched in—offering rides to school, pooling gas money, and providing collective childcare.\"That's really the organizing tradition in which my politics is rooted,\" she told Newsweek.Life and Political Experience Foxx is the first in her family to attend college, earning a full ride to Columbia University in New York. She studied political science there, but she's quick to point out what she believes many overlook: \"Lived experience is experience.\" Her campaign, she insists, isn't just rooted in policy knowledge—it's shaped by her life.She's critical of policymakers who \"attempt to understand the implications\" of cutting programs like Medicaid or SNAP by leaning on data and cherrypicked anecdotes. \"It often falls flat because they can't actually understand the experiences,\" she said. Her official platform advocates for affordable housing, a $17 hour minimum wage, investment in early‑education and protection of social services including Medicaid.\"I have an intimate knowledge of [those social services], a personal knowledge of the stakes of what we are voting on and the responsibility we have to our constituents.\"While at Columbia, Foxx found herself thrust into the behind-the-scenes of a national presidential campaign. At 19 years old, she joined then-Senator Kamala Harris's first presidential campaign as one of its youngest staffers, leading the 2020 campaign's influencer strategy.\"What it taught me is a lesson that I took in to 2024 and that I'm taking into my own special election here in 2025 as I stick my head up to lead and to run — which was what it means to be fearless.\"Foxx says she carries that lesson forward, seeking to \"get into something. To get into a fight. Not because you're certain you can win, but because you're certain of your values.\"In the wake of the 2024 election—when Harris lost all seven swing states, including Arizona, to Donald Trump, with congressional Democrats not faring much better—Foxx said she looked around at young voters and \"felt a deep sense of responsibility.\"\"It wasn't enough for me to just work the behind the scenes of campaigns or in front of the cameras,\" she said, adding \"I needed to give them someone they could get excited about, or we would stand to lose our generation.\"Foxx said her peers were feeling \"so disillusioned and they have every right to. They feel left out. They feel left behind. They feel lied to,\" and that her campaign is offering a new leader for them to \"put their hope on.\"\"We are doing the hard work to put a new face to this party,\" she said.An Arizonan AOC? Foxx's vision and approach to politics draws obvious comparisons with Representative Ocasio-Cortez's longshot 2018 Congressional campaign that shook the Democratic establishment when she defeated longtime incumbent Joe Crowley in her New York City district.Ocasio-Cortez, then 29, ran on an unapologetically progressive platform that included support for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal and tuition-free public college. The Bronx-born activist worked as a waitress and bartender, positioning herself as a voice for working-class communities and challenging establishment Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez is now so well known in national politics — even floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender — that she is one of the few elected leaders to be recognized by nothing more than a three-letter nickname.The young Arizonan candidate, who also prides herself in grounding her campaign in lived experience rather than generational political careers, says she looks to both AOC and Representative Jasmine Crockett, Democrat of Texas, as guiding leaders who \"best represent the values of the party.\"What draws her to them, she says, is that they are \"outspoken, who are clear in their values, and who communicate with voters right where they are.\" She added that AOC is respected by some even on the right because \"she's honest, she feels real in a time where inauthenticity is running our party.\"\"And I stand in that lineage,\" she stated.Even more so than AOC in 2018, Foxx's campaign remains a longshot. Polling for Arizona's 7th remains scant, but a small Public Policy Polling survey in April put her at 5 percent support, compared to 11 percent for Daniel Hernandez and 49 percent for Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late Rep. Grijalva now hoping to fill her father's long-held seat.Foxx remains undaunted by those numbers. She says her campaign mirrors the community she represents, with 98 percent of contributions coming from small-dollar donors, \"people who donate under $200,\" she explains, noting the \"average contribution is about $29.\" It's that kind of grassroots support that helped carry AOC over the line, to say nothing of the wave of support that built behind Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.In a Congress with an average age of 59, Foxx is trying to lean into the symbolism of generational change of which many disillusioned Democratic voters say the party is in desperate need.\"If everybody who told me I was too young went and told somebody that they were too old, we would be in a vastly different, political structure right now,\" she said.The Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th District is scheduled for July 15, with the special general election set for September 23.","summary":"Deja Foxx, a young progressive in Arizona, is mounting a long-shot bid for Congress. It's one that resembles that of her political inspiration.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/deja-foxx-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-arizona-special-election-democrats-2084714","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662168/deja-foxx.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 10:00:02","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.178},{"id":330998230,"title":"Is Pentagon planning to invade Greenland and Panama?

Speaking on behalf of the American people, I don't think the American people voted for President Trump because they were hoping we would invade Greenland, Smith said.It is not unusual for the Pentagon to draw up contingency plans for conflicts that have not arisen, but his handling of the questions prompted a Republican lawmaker to step in a few minutes later. Lawyer here, I just want to help because help you out because people try to, you know, twist your words, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio said to Hegseth.

That became a quick trap, as Hegseth has asserted that nothing he posted — on strike times and munitions dropped in March — was classified. His questioner, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, jumped on the disparity.“You can very well disclose whether or not it was classified,” Moulton said.“What’s not classified is that it was an incredible, successful mission,” Hegseth responded.Lawmakers raised concerns about the politicization of the military after former President Donald Trump delivered a campaign-style speech at Fort Bragg, where uniformed troops were seen applauding him and jeering his political rivals, with MAGA merchandise openly sold nearby. General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he was not aware of any rule violations and reiterated that military personnel are expected to remain politically neutral. Pete Hegseth faced tough questions about his views on women and transgender individuals in the military.

JB Pritzker pauses in the very first exhibit.\n\nThe narrow hall of photos and headlines about the Nazis’ rise to power isn’t as emotionally heavy as other parts of the museum, like the German railcar of the kind used to deport people to the concentration camps, or the room of remembrance, which lists the names of some of the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis.\n\nBut he has a point to make.\n\nIt was at this moment in the early 1930s, when the Nazis crushed democracy and dissent while painting Jewish citizens as immigrant enemies of the state.\n\n“People are having to make decisions about whether they’re going to stand up and speak out, or whether they’re going to try to keep their heads down and not be noticed,” Governor Pritzker says. “These are the choices that, in a slightly less dramatic fashion but no less important, that I think people are having to make today.”\n\nGovernor Pritzker has emerged as one of the loudest Democratic voices sounding the alarm about what he sees as the authoritarian tendencies of the Trump administration. And increasingly, he’s put his own personal story at the center of his argument. He has drawn on his family’s history as Jewish refugees, and his decade working on Holocaust issues, to warn in stark terms about the administration’s aggressive moves to crack down on immigrants and suppress dissent.\n\n“It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours, and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” he warned in his State of the State speech in February. “When the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.”\n\nIn New Hampshire in late April, he excoriated some Democrats’ “simpering timidity,” and called for mass protests. “These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,” he said. “We must castigate them on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.”\n\nBoth speeches went viral on social media, helping to introduce the governor to a wider audience ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.\n\nAnd it’s put him squarely in the all-out-fighting side of the Democratic debate over how best to confront President Donald Trump.\n\nIt’s unclear how well this message will resonate. After all, former Vice President Kamala Harris closed her 2024 campaign with a similarly stark warning about President Trump’s authoritarian views – and lost. Many Capitol Hill Democrats believe attacking Republicans over pocketbook issues like proposed Medicaid cuts are a better political strategy than focusing on his crackdown on immigrants and dissent.\n\nBut in the wake of escalating raids from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, President Trump’s move to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests, and his and ICE head Tom Homan’s threat to arrest California Gov. Gavin Newsom, more and more Democrats are issuing similar warnings.\n\nOn Thursday, House Oversight Committee Republicans summoned Mr. Pritzker and two other Democratic governors to testify about their states’ “sanctuary” policies. Mr. Pritzker talked about his own family’s refugee story – and vowed to fight ICE overreach. “I will stand in the way of Tom Homan going after people who don’t deserve to be frightened in their communities, who don’t deserve to be threatened, terrorized. I would rather that he came and arrested me than do that to the people of my state,” he said.\n\nGovernor Pritzker is also one of the most prominent Jewish politicians in the United States at a time of rising antisemitism driven by Israel’s war in Gaza, which the Trump administration has used to justify its crackdown on foreign students and universities. But his record of working on – and worrying about – these issues predates his political ambitions.\n\nHe first got involved with the Illinois Holocaust Museum in 1999, when Sam Harris asked for three minutes of his time.\n\nMr. Harris, an irrepressible former insurance executive who survived two concentration camps as a child, was working with other survivors to expand their small storefront museum and make sure their stories lived on after they were gone. He was told by a friend he needed to get “the richest guy in town” to help make it happen, so he reached out to Mr. Pritzker, a billionaire scion of the Hyatt hotel fortune.\n\nSkokie, where the museum is located, at one point was home to more than 7,000 Holocaust survivors – believed to be the largest number anywhere outside Israel. In the late 1970s, neo-Nazis tried to hold a march in the town, spurring international attention, a Supreme Court case, and massive local pushback. Out of that fight sprang the original museum – a small storefront – and a successful campaign that made Illinois the first state in the nation to require Holocaust education in public schools.\n\nBy all accounts, Mr. Pritzker threw himself into building a new museum. For the next decade, he poured countless hours into securing funding and finding staff and experts, meeting with the group nearly every week. In the process, he developed close relationships with many survivors.\n\n“He gave everything that he had,” Mr. Harris tells the Monitor, describing Governor Pritzker as family. “It definitely shaped his life.”\n\nThe 65,000-square-foot museum opened in 2009 with keynote speeches from Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel and former President Bill Clinton. More than 182,000 people visited the museum last year.\n\n“Anything he says about the Holocaust, he is not just saying it for political purposes,” Mr. Harris says. “You’ve got to give him the credit. And anyone who doesn’t, doesn’t know. Let them talk to me.”\n\n“Remember the past, transform the future.”\n\nGovernor Pritzker sees the current moment through the lens of his own family history.\n\n“My family is only still alive because my grandfather and his father and the rest of the family escaped the pogroms in Ukraine,” he says.\n\nThe Pritzker family, like many American Jews, escaped the riots and antisemitic violence in the Russian Empire that spiked sharply beginning in the 1880s. He brought to the interview a family history his great-grandfather penned in 1940, a copy of which is given to every child in his family on their bar or bat mitzvahs to let them know where they’d come from, and what they’d survived.\n\nMr. Pritzker’s family story is Kennedy-esque in its combination of enormous wealth, political ambition, and personal tragedy. His father, who turned Hyatt into an international chain, died suddenly when Mr. Pritzker was 7 years old. His mother, Sue Pritzker, died a decade later after a long struggle with alcoholism. She was treasurer of the Northern California Democratic Party when Nancy Pelosi was its chair; their desks were in the same office.\n\n“I knew his mother very well,” former Speaker Pelosi tells the Monitor, calling Sue Pritzker a “lovely woman.” She knew the governor when he was young, and says it’s clear he got his “commitment to public service” from his parents.\n\nHis first foray into politics was a Capitol Hill internship with Rep. Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor ever to serve in Congress.\n\nAnnette Tillemann Lantos, the congressman’s wife and a fellow Holocaust survivor, also worked on his staff running the bipartisan Congressional Human Rights Caucus. As a fresh-faced intern, Mr. Pritzker “was so smart and enthusiastic,” she recalls. “Our office was deeply focused on issues of human rights and, of course, fighting antisemitism. You could tell that these issues really resonated with JB,” she says.\n\nAlthough he left Capitol Hill to make his career in business, he never left politics behind. He became a major Democratic donor, and unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 1998.\n\nIt was shortly after his congressional run that he got involved in the museum.\n\n“I’ve seen the impact he’s allowed the survivors to have on him. I’ve seen him get emotional with them. I’ve seen him hug them and hold hands with them as they’re sharing the most difficult parts of their stories,” says Kelley Szany, the museum’s senior vice president of education and exhibitions.\n\nMs. Szany says Mr. Pritzker pushed to make sure the museum focus not just on the past – but also on the prevention of similar horrors in the future. The museum’s slogan: “Remember the past, transform the future.”\n\nIn 2018, during his first run for governor, Mr. Pritzker took time off the campaign trail to interview Mr. Wiesel’s son Elisha onstage. The conversation wasn’t political, but Mr. Pritzker’s concerns about the Trump administration surfaced nonetheless. “When you walk through the Illinois Holocaust Museum exhibits, you’ll be frightened at how many things that occurred during that period feel like they’re occurring today,” he said.\n\nDuring that conversation, Mr. Pritzker was told a bunkmate of Mr. Wiesel’s in the Buchenwald concentration camp was in the audience. He brought him onstage and ceded his seat and microphone, happy to step aside.\n\n“When JB would be in conversation with survivors, he listened with every fiber of his being. What ultimately would be created had to be what the survivors wanted,” says Lillian Polus Gerstner, a daughter of Holocaust survivors who ran the original museum and served as director of public programs at the new site.\n\nIn a 2022 speech to Florida Democrats, Mr. Pritzker talked about how his relationships with survivors had affected him and shaped his life’s mission.\n\n“What I learned, working so closely with survivors of genocide, is that history loses all meaning if we sanitize it,” he said. “And we are cowards, unworthy of the blessings of our ancestors, if we don’t wear ourselves out fighting every attempt to cast a group of people as less than human, less worthy of fundamental rights, less deserving of basic decency and love and respect.”\n\nA dramatic rise in antisemitism\n\nPresident Trump isn’t the only thing worrying Governor Pritzker these days.\n\nThe Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally and riot in 2017 was followed by white supremacist attacks on synagogues in Pittsburgh in 2018 and outside San Diego in 2019. Israel’s brutal invasion of Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack has led to a backlash against Israel, including antisemitic threats and violence from the left.\n\nThe past few years have featured “a rise in antisemitism that I have never seen before in my life,” Governor Pritzker says.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League recorded more than 9,300 antisemitic incidents nationwide last year – the most in 45 years, and a nearly ninefold increase from a decade ago.\n\nIn April, an arsonist attacked the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, citing his support for Israel. In late May, a Chicago man flew to Washington, D.C., and opened fire outside the Capital Jewish Museum, killing two Israeli Embassy employees. One of Governor Pritzker’s staffers was there.\n\n“It made it very personal,” he says.\n\nJust days before Governor Pritzker sat down with the Monitor, a man threw Molotov cocktails at pro-Israel Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, who were calling for the release of Israeli hostages. One of the 15 wounded was an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor.\n\nIt’s gotten harder to be a Jewish politician in America, Mr. Pritzker says. His religion rarely came up in his first campaign. But death threats and antisemitic comments directed at him have skyrocketed in recent years, from both the left and the right. He’s had anti-Israel protesters show up at his home in the middle of the night. He’s had to increase his security. One person who’d made threats against his family was sentenced to four years in prison just days before the interview.\n\nHe blames President Trump for the initial surge of antisemitism, but says anger from Israel’s ongoing assault in Gaza has made things worse.\n\n“The rise of antisemitism across the United States has been seemingly exponential since just 2019,” he says. “We have the president that we had back then. But there seems to have been a broader acceptance driven by the war in Gaza.”\n\nMr. Pritzker is one of six Jewish governors currently in office, all of them Democrats – the most to hold that position at the same time in U.S. history. There are 10 Jewish senators, and 25 Jewish House members from both parties, high numbers considering that Jews make up just 2.4% of the U.S. population. Americans’ willingness to support a Jewish president have risen significantly over the past half-century, with around 9 in 10 Americans consistently saying they’d vote for a qualified Jewish candidate in polls since 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Joe Lieberman came within a few hundred votes of becoming the first Jewish vice president. And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ran arguably the most successful presidential campaigns of any Jewish presidential candidate in U.S. history in 2016 and 2020.\n\nFairly or not, however, Jewish candidates face more questions, and more pressure about their views on Israel, than other politicians. Left-wing anger at Governor Shapiro’s pro-Israel views were seen as hurting his chances of becoming Vice President Harris’ running mate in 2024. Governor Pritzker was also vetted, but not chosen. (It’s worth noting that many who loathe Israel love Senator Sanders, who has strongly condemned Israel’s invasion – many voters who hold stridently anti-Israel views are still open to Jewish candidates who share their views.)\n\nGovernor Pritzker’s specific profile as a billionaire businessman might also be a hard sell in a Democratic primary. The last Jewish billionaire to run for president, Michael Bloomberg, flopped spectacularly in his 2020 run.\n\nIllinois Rep. Brad Schneider has been friends with Governor Pritzker long before either ran for office. They were both involved in a Chicago chapter of a national Jewish organization in the early 1990s. He thinks America is ready to vote for a Jewish president. But he says the past few years have been alarming.\n\n“The fact that Jews can can rise to positions of being able to represent broader communities – as Democrats, as Republicans, I think that’s a very positive thing,” he says. “At the same time, we are in a moment of rising antisemitism in the country and across the world.”\n\nIf you Google “JB Pritzker Gaza,” the first hit that pops up asks if he is “a zionist or genocide-supporter.”\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, Governor Pritzker said that Illinois “unequivocally stands” with Israel, and prayed for “strength and safety of the men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces as they embark on this most difficult and important mission” of destroying Hamas.\n\nHe’s since called for an end to the conflict, posting on the one-year anniversary of the attack that “It’s past time to honor the innocent Palestinian and Israeli lives lost by securing the release of the hostages and implementing a ceasefire.”\n\nAsked if he believes Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, he demurs. “You know, there’s a room in the museum where the definition of genocide is laid out, and I think that’s for other people to address.”\n\nMr. Pritzker says he stands by Israel’s right to exist and defend itself. But he makes clear he isn’t happy with how Israeli leaders have handled the invasion.\n\n“The war in Gaza began with an attack by Hamas, a terrorist organization, against Israel, and the response by Israel should be focused on Hamas, a terrorist organization. Those are the murderers – not the innocent population of Palestinians who live in Gaza,” he said. “Not enough has been done to protect innocent Palestinians.”\n\nWhat “Never again” means\n\nPresident Trump has responded to the widespread anti-Israel protests on college campuses by cracking down on foreign students in the name of rooting out antisemitism. The administration has arrested and moved to deport pro-Palestinian protesters who were here legally, many on student visas.\n\nIt has formed a “Task Force To Combat Anti-Semitism” that has aggressively targeted universities, threatening their funding. And it has sought to make a particular example out of Harvard University.\n\nMr. Pritzker’s sister Penny, a former Obama administration commerce secretary, is the chair of Harvard’s governing board. The governor says he’s “proud” of her work leading the school’s fight against the Trump administration – and furious that Trump officials are using, as he sees it, charges of antisemitism to target and threaten entire groups of people, including targeting protesters whose views he disagrees with.\n\nUnprompted, he takes a shot at Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of the president’s immigration crackdown – and the most prominent Jewish member of his team.\n\n“Stephen Miller is the purveyor of much of this,” he says. “It’s very disappointing and sad.”\n\nWhen asked what he means, Mr. Pritzker pauses.\n\n“It is disappointing and sad that he has been put in a position where he is driving much of this,” he says “And second, because he’s Jewish. And it’s an anti-immigrant sentiment that he is clearly pushing.”\n\nMr. Miller didn’t respond to requests for comment. White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson responded: “The only thing that’s sad is JB Pritzker’s desperate attempt to stay relevant when his woke, left-wing ideology has been repeatedly rejected by the American people.”\n\nBut Mr. Miller has been publicly critical of Governor Pritzker in the past, saying his April New Hampshire speech “clearly could be construed as inciting violence.”\n\nMr. Pritzker scoffed in response, saying he’d called for peaceful protest.\n\nPresident Trump, whose daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism, has made a number of remarks that many Jews have taken as antisemitic. He regularly invokes an old antisemitic trope that Jews have a dual loyalty, repeatedly telling Jewish Americans how much he loves “your country” of Israel. In 2015, he told the Republican Jewish Coalition that it wasn’t supporting him because he couldn’t be bought and “You want to control your own politicians.” In late 2022, he dined with white nationalist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, who has regularly expressed antisemitic views.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump said in 2019 that Jews who voted Democratic showed “great disloyalty,” Governor Pritzker accused him of telling Jews “You’re the other; you’re not one of us; you’re not American; you don’t belong.”\n\nIllinois Rep. Brad Schneider has been friends with Governor Pritzker long before either ran for office. They were both involved in a Chicago chapter of a national Jewish organization in the early 1990s. Mr. Schneider chairs the New Democrat Coalition, a group of centrist House Democrats, and has pushed his party to moderate both on tone and policy over the years. But he lauds Mr. Pritzker for taking a stand – and showing his authentic self in doing so.\n\n“He has not shied away from who he is in all of its manifestations, including his Jewish identity,” he says. “I agree with him. We have to call out [the administration’s] efforts to dismantle the Constitution and undermine the rule of law.”\n\nBack in Skokie, as Governor Pritzker finishes showing me through the museum, he is asked what “Never again,” the rallying cry of Holocaust survivors, means to him.\n\n“It means our obligation – all of us, and I don’t just mean Jews – it means all of our obligation is to make sure that the horrors, the targeting, the inhumanity of the Holocaust, must, at every angle, be pushed back on, fought, against, prevented,” he says.\n\nIs that what’s fueling him now?\n\n“I am in a moment when it is my obligation as a public official, as a Jew, and as somebody who has been engaged in fighting antisemitism my whole life – and who can see the degradation of democracy occurring,” he says. “Anybody, if they understand what ‘Never again’ meant about the Holocaust, understands that this is a moment when we should be standing up and speaking out.”","summary":"Illinois Gov.

Then I Saw An Old Photo — And What I Discovered Next Left Me Shaken.","text":"I tried not to stare when I first saw her. Her gaunt, heavily lined face made her look older than I expected. She wore a dingy pumpkin-orange thrift-store turtleneck that swallowed her 5-foot-7, 98-pound frame. But her ice-blue eyes sparkled like a kid’s on Christmas morning.\n\n“Oh boy! Oh boy,” she said, walking toward me with outstretched arms. “It’s so good to see you!”\n\nThat was the first of many visits. Most followed the same script: her astonished joy upon my arrival, my mechanical hug, and then sitting on her couch to talk about her favourite topic, classic torch love songs from the 1950s and early ’60s. \n\n“Who’s the better singer?” I’d ask. “Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole?”\n\nShe’d close her eyes to ponder. “Nat King Cole,” she’d announce, nodding in reverence. \n\nAfter about an hour, I’d stand to leave. Her smile would evaporate. Another awkward hug. As I left, she’d call out, “Don’t take any wooden nickels.” \n\nOn the surface, we had nothing in common. She was a white Irish Catholic woman who grew up in a family that freely used the N-word, thought that Black people were lazy, and believed that Black and white people should live apart. I was a young Black man who grew up primarily in foster homes in a Black inner-city neighbourhood where just about everyone — including me — regarded white people with distrust or contempt. \n\nYet she was my mother. And, as the years have passed, she’s become something else. She’s the person I find myself turning to when I struggle with the mixture of emotions that so many Americans are experiencing right now. Many of us are exhausted, demoralised, and drained by constant political and racial divisions. Countless Americans have become, as author David Brooks put it in a recent essay, “passive, discouraged. … They’ve lost the confidence to wish for more.”\n\nI’ve been swimming in this grim national mood for years. As a journalist at CNN and elsewhere, I’ve covered virtually every so-called racially transformative event in America during the past 32 years, from the Rodney King riots in 1992 to the George Floyd “racial reckoning.” All of them generated massive hope for transformational change; all were followed by a massive letdown. At my lowest moments, I’ve wondered whether human beings are too susceptible to racism and tribalism to make democracy work. \n\nBut my mother offered another way to look at the future, without ever intending to do so. She was a person who seemed to have no power or reason to hope. Still she, and others like her, gave me the confidence to wish for more. \n\nIn the beginning, I thought I’d never know her. When I was born in the mid-1960s, interracial marriage and intimate interracial relationships were illegal in Maryland, as in much of the country. My mother vanished from my life not long after I was born, and so did her family. No one told me why. I didn’t know what she looked like. My father’s name was on my birth certificate, but hers was not. All he told me and my younger brother, Patrick, was this: ”Your mother’s name is Shirley, she’s white, and her family hates Black people.”\n\nTheir hatred did not surprise me. I grew up in a West Baltimore neighbourhood that served as the setting for the HBO series “The Wire,” a crime drama that depicted a Black inner-city community ravaged by racism and drug violence. I routinely heard my friends and neighbours refer to white people as “honkies” and “crackers.” I heard white people yell “Nigger!” when I strayed into their neighbourhoods. During my entire time in Baltimore’s public schools — from Head Start to high school graduation — I saw only one white student. \n\nIt wasn’t the time or place to be biracial. There were no biracial public figures like former President Barack Obama or former Vice President Kamala Harris when I grew up in the 1970s and early ’80s. I was too ashamed to tell anyone my mother was white. I marked her race as “Black” on school forms. I became a closeted biracial person.\n\nAt 17, though, I discovered that there was one place worse than my neighbourhood: where I first met my mom. There was another reason why I tried not to stare when I first saw her. I was trying to hide my emotions because I was in shock. I was standing in the waiting room of a psychiatric facility called Crownsville Hospital Center in rural Maryland. \n\nMy mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness. I didn’t make that discovery until I met her in Crownsville. No one in my family, including my father, had told me — not even on the car ride to the hospital. They didn’t know how. My father had waited until I had graduated from high school to suddenly ask me one day if I wanted to meet my mom. He didn’t think I could handle knowing about her illness until I became a young man. Many people didn’t talk openly about mental illness in their families when I met my mother in the early 1980s. \n\nFor over 30 years, I blocked out most of the memories from that first meeting, but one detail lingered. Before I left, my mother looked at me and made a request.\n\n“Will you send me a St. Jude prayer book?” she asked.\n\n“Ah, yeah, I will,” I said, not knowing at the time that St. Jude is the patron saint of hopeless causes. \n\nOutwardly, I didn’t skip a beat after that meeting. I attended and graduated from Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, D.C., where Kamala Harris was a classmate. I became a journalist at several newspapers before joining CNN. But I had stepped out of one closet into another. Now, I was ashamed that my mother had a mental illness. I didn’t even tell my closest friends. It took two years to tell the woman I would date and marry about my mom’s illness — and another two into our marriage before allowing them to meet. \n\nIn the life I hid from others, I tried to build a relationship with my mom. I wrote her a flood of letters, telling her about myself, my dreams and my hope that we could get to know each other. There would be no reply for months, and then a letter would finally arrive. I’d tear it open to find a single sheet from a yellow legal pad, with large cursive letters spilling over the margins: “Dear John! I could use some money and to see you in person. Could you send a picture of yourself and Pat for Mother’s Day? I need another St. Jude prayer book. Love, Shirley.” \n\nPersonal visits were no better. She would drift away in the middle of conversations. She’d forget what we talked about two minutes earlier. Her lips would tremble, and she’d lapse into silence if I asked too many questions about her past. At times, she’d sense my frustration, turn to me and say with a rueful smile, “Don’t mind me. I’m crazy.”\n\nEach visit left me more depressed. My mother had been a mystery when I had no contact with her — and even more so once she was in my life. Her mental illness was like a thick fog; I didn’t know how to navigate around it to see her. All I could see was schizophrenia. \n\nIn my 30s, I gave up. I stopped writing her letters and trying to reach her through conversations. I kept visiting her and mailing her St. Jude trinkets, but I was just checking a box. Our visits were filled with awkward silences. I didn’t expect our relationship to change. \n\nOne day, when my wife, Terry, asked me why I didn’t talk more about my mother, I cut her off.\n\n“All I do is send her money,” I said with a heavy sigh. “I can’t really communicate with her. There’s nothing left to tell.”\n\nBut there was so much to her story that had not been told. One night, when I was about 19, my father reached into a Ziploc bag and pulled out a sepia-stained black-and-white photo. In the photo, a young white woman with a beehive hairdo looked at the camera with a wide, dimpled smile. She was holding a cigarette in her right hand and looked like she was about to burst into laughter. She looked confident, and her eyes sparkled with intelligence and mischief. It was my mother. The photo was taken when she was 20, the same year she gave birth to me. I couldn’t stop staring at the photo. It bore little resemblance to the fragile woman I knew. \n\nI set out to learn about the woman in that photo. I pressed relatives to talk about my parents’ relationship. I knew the outline: They met in 1963 at a hospital in downtown Baltimore. My mother was a nurse’s assistant, and my father, Clifton Sr., was in the Merchant Marines. Their first date was a disaster. My father couldn’t persuade a Black cabdriver to take him to my mom’s house because she lived in a white working-class neighbourhood where no Blacks dared venture. When my father finally did knock on her door, her father answered. He tried to shove my father off the doorstep and called the police. “This nigger is trying to see my daughter,” my mother’s father told the arriving officers. They arrested my father for disturbing the peace.\n\nMy mother decided that she would visit my father instead. She started taking walks toward my father’s house in West Baltimore, which was the central meeting place for my father’s extended family. My relatives described her as “quick-witted,” “chatty” and driven to help people in need. She sat on my father’s front steps, smoking Marlboro cigarettes with my uncles, and hung out in the kitchen to watch my paternal grandmother, Daisy, sing Negro spirituals while baking sweet potato pies. \n\nMy father’s family didn’t know what to make of her. In the early 1960s, white politicians routinely warned against the evils of “race-mixing.” Psychiatrists declared in scholarly journals that whites who married or “mated” with Blacks had a death wish or sought an outlet for “deviant” sexual urges. Baltimore passed the nation’s first racially restrictive housing law in 1910, which banned Black people from buying homes in white neighbourhoods and vice versa, and was heavily segregated when my parents met. My father’s relatives chuckled as they recalled a 20-year-old white woman walking alone into an all-Black neighbourhood to see a Black man.\n\n“It was like a breakthrough,” my cousin Reese recalled. “She was a white woman on the block, not scared, not worried about being attacked, not looking over her shoulder. She didn’t seem to be conscious of her colour. She was like one of the family.”\n\nI then heard stories that filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t even know was there. Unprompted, relatives recounted memories of a doting young mom who took her two children on walks in the park, rubbed her nose against their bellies while they giggled and sang Patsy Cline and Tony Bennett songs to them. My mom loved to sing one song in particular to me, Doris Day’s “Que Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).” Try as I might, though, I have no memories of those moments.\n\nMercifully, I also have no memory of what happened next. My mother’s illness became apparent after she gave birth to Patrick, nine months after I was born. She started drifting away during conversations, chain-smoking and disappearing for long solitary walks. She couldn’t keep a job. When my parents moved into an apartment together, she’d leave with the gas stove on or the front door ajar. My parents never married.\n\n“She tried, but she didn’t have the capacity to do normal things,” my father told me. “She wanted to be accepted like normal people.”\n\nAnd then one day, my relatives said, she disappeared. Years later, Patrick accidentally discovered the reason why while consulting her Social Security records. Her father had placed her in a psychiatric facility, a not uncommon fate in the 1950s and early 1960s for white women in interracial relationships. \n\nHearing how my parents’ relationship ended left me emotionally numb. I no longer wanted to know more about my mother — every story seemed to end in tragedy. I thought I would never meet any semblance of the vibrant woman in that old photograph. \n\nBut there was another side to those stories about my mom that I had overlooked. It was her “marvellous victory.”\n\nPart of that victory can be seen in a viral photograph from last year that is now forgotten because the news cycle has moved on. It’s a snapshot of Kamala Harris taken last summer during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It was shot from the point of view of a brown biracial girl in a pink pantsuit and pigtails, transfixed as she gazes upward at Harris from the front row at the United Center in Chicago. The girl is Amara, Harris’ great-niece, age 8.\n\nIt’s easy to see why the photo went viral. It was a sneak preview of a Brown New America. The U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority country (the majority of citizens will be non-white) by 2044. The number of people who identify as multiracial increased by 276% over the past decade. Advertisements today routinely depict interracial couples, straight and gay, along with their children. And some of our most prominent public figures — Obama, Harris, film director Jordan Peele and NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes — are biracial.\n\nThe acceptance of interracial marriage cuts across racial and partisan lines. Harris and Doug Emhoff, her Jewish husband, were the first interracial couple to reach the highest levels of the executive branch, but they were immediately followed by another interracial couple, GOP Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, the daughter of Indian immigrants. Some white supremacists objected to Usha Vance’s race but even within the MAGA universe there is widespread acceptance of the Vances’ interracial marriage.\n\nSomeday, perhaps soon, an interracial couple will occupy the White House.\n\nIt’s easy to miss, but Usha Vance’s ascension and Harris’ groundbreaking run for the White House represents one of the greatest victories of the Civil Rights Movement: the normalisation of interracial marriage and biracial people throughout America. When Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 2022, few if any news stories dwelled on the fact that her husband is white.\n\nThe casual acceptance of interracial couples at even the highest echelon of American life demonstrates something that’s so important to remember today: how quickly people’s attitudes on seemingly intractable issues can shift. When a Gallup poll asked Americans about their views on marriage between Black and white people in 1958, only 4% approved. Gallup asked the same question in 2021, and 94% approved — an all-time high. Public opinion about one of the most entrenched racial taboos in American history went from near-universal disapproval to virtual universal approval within a lifetime. \n\nHow did this happen? The quick answer is that in June 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down “anti-miscegenation” laws in the Loving v. Virginia case. But something else also made it happen. It was a choice that certain people made and a type of courage they all displayed. One of them was my mom.\n\nI only saw my mom as this fragile flower, but my brother, Patrick, was the first to notice another side to her. One morning, he took her to a hair salon that served women in a group home where our mom lived. She had been transferred to the home with other women with severe mental illnesses after Crownsville was shut down, in part, for mistreating patients. While they were waiting, our mom watched a hairdresser berate and throw hair products at a woman sitting in her chair.\n\n“She’s a bitch,” my mom said, her eyes narrowed on the hairdresser. \n\nPatrick had never heard our mother speak in such an indignant tone before. He suppressed a smile.\n\n“Mom, do you know you just said a bad word?”\n\n“I’m sorry, Pat.” Our mom briefly paused, then added, “But she is a bitch.”\n\nAs I dug deeper into old family stories, I discovered that my mom had long been infuriated by any display of injustice. She glared back at white people who stared at her while she walked in public with my father in the early 1960s. Sometimes she’d say, “You act like you ain’t never seen people before.” She and my father trashed a bar when the bartender refused to serve them. Once, I heard my mom say she had been arrested as a young woman. For what, I inquired. “For opening my big fat mouth,” she said with a wide grin.\n\nEven her illness couldn’t erase her spirit of defiance. I hated visiting her group homes. Some were run by good people who treated my mom with compassion, but many seemed designed to crush whatever humanity was left of those consigned there. Unscrupulous caretakers stole from or bullied people in their care. Some confined them to squalid, roach-infested rooms. When I came in to greet my mom, I’d often see heavily medicated residents sitting on couches, staring zombie-like at soap operas on television. Most of them hadn’t received a visitor in years. There were few smiles or genuine laughter in these environments. But my mom could somehow bring light into the most desolate places.\n\nPatrick sneaked into a group home to surprise our mom one morning, only to be shocked by what he saw: our mother bopping and weaving down a “Soul Train” dance line as the group home staff and residents cheered her on. Any gifts we sent her quickly disappeared because, we discovered, she gave most of them away to other group home members who she said needed them more. And when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, her caretaker had to buy a separate living room chair for my mom to enforce social distancing rules. All of the group home members wanted to sit near her.\n\nI didn’t appreciate the depth of her defiance until I was in my mid-50s, when I did something that I had never done: I traveled to her childhood home in Baltimore.\n\nOn an overcast summer morning, I drove to Mill Hill, my mother’s childhood community. She lived on Wilkins Avenue, on a quintessential Baltimore block of gleaming marble steps, neat row houses and a still-stately St. Benedict Church, where my mom was confirmed. I parked my rental car and walked to the spot where my father had been assaulted and arrested for trying to date my mother over 50 years ago. I scanned the street to see white, Black and brown neighbours talking to one another from their front steps and hanging out together at a corner tavern. \n\nI was surprised by something other than the racial mix. When I looked at my smartphone’s app, I was stunned to discover that my father’s former home was only 4.1 miles away. I had no idea that my estranged white and Black relatives had lived so close to one another. Racial segregation was so entrenched when my parents met that their families might as well have lived in separate solar systems. Baltimore’s segregation wasn’t just racial; it was also ethnic. Jews, Italians and Poles kept to their neighbourhoods. Outsiders, particularly those who had the “wrong” colour, risked getting hurt walking into the wrong area.\n\nAs I stood in front of my mom’s childhood home, I imagined for the first time what it must have been like for her. The contemporary Wilkins Avenue landscape dissolved, and the circa early 1960s Wilkins Avenue appeared. I saw her — a thin, young white woman with a beehive hairdo — close the front door and walk toward a neighbourhood to meet people her family and community had told her to hate.\n\nI paused outside my car and shook my head in admiration, and confusion.\n\nDamn, I thought. Why would she take such a risk?\n\nI’m still not quite sure. Was my mother’s relationship with my father driven by youthful rebellion, the allure of a taboo relationship, or was it an early symptom of the illness that would engulf her? Or was it truly love? I learned through others that my parents remained close after she was institutionalised. My father routinely visited my mother and continued to take care of her even when his health began to fail late in his life. \n\nWhat I do know is that she did something that remains so important: She refused to accept the status quo. My mother was part of a vanguard of Black, brown and white people who would smash a taboo against interracial relationships that had been enshrined as law for centuries. They didn’t wait for the Supreme Court or politicians to tell them whom to love. I was born four years before the Loving decision. \n\nLike most big changes, it started small, with countless acts of invisible courage from everyday people. My mother’s decision to walk from Wilkins Avenue to my father’s house “sent forth a tiny ripple of hope.” That ripple fed into another, emboldening others to do the same. Those ripples eventually turned into a tsunami that gave us the Loving decision and a New America — one where a brown girl in a pink pantsuit could look at a biracial woman making a credible run for the White House or another brown woman at the White House today and think, “That could be me one day.” This was the same dynamic that gave us marriage equality. Everyday people acted first, coming out to their parents, friends and co-workers; the politicians and courts followed later. \n\nAs I returned to my car and drove away from Wilkins Avenue, I smiled. I felt a warm sensation well up in my chest, and something else that I’d never felt before about my mom: pride. Pride that I was her son. She was no hopeless cause. She was more powerful than she realised. She, and others like her, helped make Usha Vance and Kamala Harris possible. \n\nThe historian and activist Howard Zinn said there is a tendency among people “to think that what we see in the present moment will continue.” He said people often forget how often throughout history people have been astonished by extraordinary changes in people’s thoughts, by unexpected eruptions of rebellion against tyrannies, and “by the quick collapse of systems of power that seemed invincible.”\n\nHe said that if people only look at the worst in the past and present, it destroys their capacity to act. \n\n“And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future,” Zinn wrote. “The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvellous victory.”\n\nAfter Wilkins Avenue, my visits to my mom changed. I painted her fingernails. I asked her to sing “Que Sera Sera.” I asked her to show me some dance moves. And I laughed along with her as she did a little shimmy of her hips. I stopped dwelling on what I had lost; I became grateful for what remained. My wife noticed. \n\n“You used to hug your mom like she was an eggshell and get frustrated when you couldn’t talk to her the way you wanted,” Terry told me one night.\n\n“And now?” I asked her.\n\n“You hug her tighter now, and you’re not afraid of the silence when you talk to her.”\n\nDuring one of my last visits with my mom, Terry took a photo that I treasure. We stopped by my mother’s group home in Baltimore on a luminous summer day with oak trees in full bloom. That visit followed the same script: a ring of the doorbell, the scurrying of footsteps behind the front door, and my mom gleefully shouting, “Oh my Lord, Oh my Lord!” \n\nTerry’s smartphone camera snapped what happened after the front door swung open. I leaned forward and wrapped my arms around my mother as she pillowed her face on my shoulder, a contented smile on her face. \n\nIf I could have written a caption for that photo, it would be the final words I wrote to her not long after that visit — words that she never saw. It’s what I wished I could have said to her so many years earlier. \n\n“Now I see you, Mom. I finally see you.”\n\nThis story originally ran in February 2025 and we are rerunning it today, June 12, the 58th anniversary of the Loving v.

A related aim is to shift the government’s focus away from consumption growth and toward production, even if it means price hikes in the short term.\n\nCass edits and mostly writes the essays that constitute The New Conservatives, though it also includes contributions from former Trump trade representative Robert Lighthizer, current Secretary of State and “Mr. Everything” Marco Rubio, and writers such as Wells King and Elbridge Colby, who hold smaller roles in the Trump administration.\n\nDespite his prominence in the New Right, Cass has more than a little bit of the Old Right in him. He worked on Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 before a transformation that began when he crafted a plan to fight poverty. On the heels of Romney’s infamous “47%” comments, Cass sought to fight the perception that Republicans didn’t care about the poor, catching the attention and support of Rubio in the process. Then, as Trump refashioned the GOP as a blue-collar, working-class party, Cass sought to define the movement with a 2018 book titled The Once and Future Worker, which was praised by Vice President JD Vance as “A brilliant book” and “among the most important I’ve ever read.”\n\nToday, Cass has friends in very high places, including the second- and third-most powerful people in the federal government. So what’s The New Conservatives about? Namely, it sees the Trump phenomenon as a fundamental reworking of the Republican Party, and even of politics writ large, and seeks to explain exactly what that means.\n\n“Have you noticed conservative political leaders sounding strange new notes about Wall Street, labor unions, trade deals, antitrust enforcement, industrial policy, and so many issues where the GOP position had always been so uncomplicated and predictable?” Cass writes. “Have you wondered, ‘What are they talking about?’ This is what they are talking about.”\n\nIndeed, for those who view Trump’s policy positions as something he thinks up two seconds before typing them into Truth Social, the book may surprise you. For example, in an essay first published in 2021, Lighthizer advocates a 10% universal tariff on all foreign imports, which has now come to pass. (And heads up: Lighthizer calls for upping the ante to 20% and then 30% if trade deficits persist.) In an essay first published in 2023, contributor Chris Griswold writes that “a supply-side economics for the 21st century would worry far less about the difference between a 39% and 37% top marginal tax rate” and more about stimulating real investment in the U.S. economy. Sure enough, Trump is now flirting with a modest hike in the top marginal tax rate.\n\nThe big-picture message in The New Conservatives is that the old GOP mantras — free trade, tax cuts, limited government — were crafted in the 1980s in response to the issues of that decade and must be updated for a new generation. This leads to one of Cass’s most controversial positions, which is that taxes in some instances should be raised. When President Ronald Reagan cut the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50% and then to 33%, it generated fantastic economic growth. But, Cass argues, repeating the trick over and over again triggers the law of diminishing returns, and runs up the national debt besides.\n\nSuch a position has led opponents to brand American Compass as a group of progressives in disguise. Nonetheless, Cass and those he has aligned with certainly appear ascendant on the Right, as embodied by the rapid rise of Rubio and Vance. Haley, by contrast, was left out of the Trump administration and comes in for scorn throughout the book. She’s mentioned 10 different times in the volume, called out for arguing that tax cuts are “always a good idea” and that any government intervention in the free market represents a “slow path to socialism.”\n\nLooking further back, the book venerates figures from the early days of the United States by explaining how they backed government planning and tariffs. Henry Clay, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison all favored investing in domestic manufacturing and protecting infant industries. Abraham Lincoln was a tariff man who donated government land to create public colleges. Even the seminal free trade economist Adam Smith comes in for a redefinition. Cass highlights two passages from The Wealth of Nations, one in which Smith writes that profit is “naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin.” The other is the one time Smith used his famous term “invisible hand,” in a passage that reads, emphasis added, “By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry … he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.”\n\nFrom this origin, many conclusions flow. The U.S. must end its reliance on Chinese supply chains, reshore industry, encourage real business investment rather than “financialization” of the economy, raise wages by locking out illegal labor, and even embrace labor unions under certain conditions. And while the doings of a wonky think tank may never capture the wider public imagination, no less a figure than Rubio argues its vision can, in fact, must, become mainstream not only in the Republican Party but across the electorate.\n\nVANCE REACTS TO ELON MUSK’S ANTI-TRUMP TIRADE IN REAL TIME ON PODCAST APPEARANCE\n\n“Forging a path towards a pro-American capitalism that protects our nation’s interests and serves the common good will not be easy,” Rubio writes in his essay. “… It will not be the work of one person or one party. To succeed, it must be the work of an entire generation and cross the entire political spectrum. It must become our new consensus.”\n\nIf that sounds fanciful, check the news.\n\nHaisten Willis is a White House reporter for the Washington Examiner.","summary":"When Donald Trump won his second term in the White House last fall, a whole host of other politicos and organizations won with him.

The events of the past week indicate that the question, which has sat in the shadow of Trump’s politics since before he was first elected, is not likely to go away.\n\nCrikey has long been trying to keep track of the Trump government’s concrete actions (rather than rhetorical flourishes), which happen to be similar to those of regimes generally considered to be fascist.\n\nThis is our third instalment. You can read Part 1 and Part II here.\n\nLaw enforcement deployed against political enemies\n\nCalifornia Democratic Senator Alex Padilla attempted to ask a question at a press conference led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday. In response, he was forced to the ground by federal agents and handcuffed, before being released. \n\nNoem’s and Homeland Security’s X accounts both falsely asserted that Padilla had not identified himself.\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested in May for his protest at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed federal immigration detention center opened by the Trump administration that month. He was held in custody for several hours. His wife Linda accused the federal government of targeting her husband.\n\n“They didn’t arrest anyone else. They didn’t ask anyone else to leave. They wanted to make an example out of the mayor,” she said.\n\nFurther, the Justice Department has charged New Jersey congressional representative LaMonica McIver with “assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement” as she tried to block Baraka’s arrest. \n\nMcIver has called the charges “political intimidation”. \n\nAs The New York Times cautiously noted, “It is rare for the Department of Justice to pursue federal criminal charges against a sitting member of Congress for matters other than corruption or campaign finance violations.”\n\nAttacks on journalism\n\nTrump filed a US$10 billion lawsuit against CBS in October last year, alleging it deceptively edited a 60 Minutes interview with his Democratic Party opponent in the presidential election, Kamala Harris. He has since doubled his claim to US$20 billion. Trump has already received US$15 million towards his presidential library from a defamation lawsuit against the ABC network.\n\nBeyond lawfare, there have been increasing physical dangers faced by journalists in Trump’s America, as the shooting of Australian 9News journalist Lauren Tomasi by a cop with a rubber bullet, while she was covering demonstrations in Los Angeles, starkly brought home to Australia.\n\nAdvocacy group Reporters Without Borders says there have been at least 35 attacks on journalists — 30 from law enforcement — since the protests started.\n\nFurther, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the First Amendment Coalition and Freedom of the Press Foundation and others sent a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that stated “federal officers appear to have deliberately targeted journalists who were doing nothing more than their job covering the news”.\n\nCult of personality \n\nThat there is a cult of personality around Trump is so obvious as to be redundant at this point, and to present all the Insta-kitsch examples would take up more space than we have here.

He says the parade will be “like no other”.\n\nProtests are planned nationwide under the heading “no kings”.\n\nDiscussing the parade on Tuesday, Trump promised:\n\nIf there’s any protester that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force.

But that is how long ago it is since a US president ordered the national guard into a state without a request from the state governor. \n\nThe line between federal and state-level law enforcement is one of the many very clear demarcations of authority in the US federal system. It is another hallowed line that Donald Trump has crossed. From a purely public order standpoint, Trump’s dispatch to Los Angeles of a 4,000-strong contingent from the national guard, bolstered by 700 US marines, appears to be having the intended effect. \n\nThe violent protests that erupted in response to the efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to detain and deport people with no legal right to be in the United States have died down. Order has mostly been restored, and thousands are under arrest – whether for immigration violations, for violence, or for defying the city-imposed curfew. \n\nSmaller protests that subsequently broke out in other cities also appear to have been discouraged by Trump’s characteristically unsubtle – and constitutionally contestable – application of presidential power. If the short-term effect looks close to being an unqualified success from the perspective of the White House and Trump’s political base, there has to be a question, indeed several questions, about the longer term. \n\nHow likely is it that the president’s actions are storing up liabilities, either for him or his political heirs? One immediate effect has undoubtedly been to propel California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, into the limelight again as a leader of the state-level opposition to Trump, as he became in Trump’s first term. And it has to be said that the Democrats are in sore need of such leadership. \n\nFar from being energised by Kamala Harris’s defeat, to refresh their party and rally around a new leader, Democrats have seemed at a complete loss as to how to combat the second-term Trump. \n\nCould the Democrats now find a new champion in Gavin Newsom – and is he equal to the task? Might he even be able to exploit his stand-off with Trump to become a plausible presidential contender for 2028? He certainly seems up for the challenge. \n\nHaving said after Trump’s victory – to the distress of some supporters – that he would work with the second-term president, Newsom has come out fighting over the ICE raids on illegal migrants and has threatened to sue through the courts over the deployment of the national guard. And whereas the last time the national guard was sent into a state without the governor’s say-so – to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama – there was an element of covert politicking, there is nothing of that this time around. \n\nAn argument can – and doubtless will – be made that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility; that the ICE agents met violent resistance and that they required protection that the city of Los Angeles and the state of California either would not (or could not) give. Whether that justifies federal intervention, however, is a matter that may well be decided in court. \n\nSo long as the national guard operate within their lawful parameters, which appears to be the case – and so long as the marines are not used to keep civil order, but only to protect the national guard – there may be no case for Trump to answer. \n\nWhat’s more, however much Trump’s opponents might like to present him as riding roughshod over states’ rights to assert federal control, this is not entirely true either. The Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade on abortion rights, which was lauded by Trump, was as much of a reassertion of states’ rights as a rolling back of the rights of women. \n\nA win on the issue of states’ rights would undoubtedly project Newsom on to the national stage. Even then there could still be a question about his prospects of rising to lead a coherent Democratic Party opposition to Trump more broadly. Yes, he was a contender to become Kamala Harris’s running mate – had an all-California ticket not been judged a potential liability (which, of course, it was). Yes, he became a thorn in the side of the first-term Trump on a host of issues. And yes, Ronald Reagan made the governorship of California a stepping stone to the presidency. But that might not be enough. \n\nNewsom has provoked vocal opposition within his own majority Democrat state, and there is little doubt that Trump would be up for a fierce rhetorical and political fight in defence of his programme. He has shown little but contempt for Newsom hitherto, whom he sees as left, liberal and weak, with an insatiable appetite for high taxes. He is to the great detriment, as he sees it, of California’s wellbeing (a one-person equivalent, in a way, of Trump’s other object of hatred, the EU). Many of Trump’s loyal base will be of like mind. \n\nThen again, even if Newsom were to emerge as a politician capable of arguing the Democrat cause on the national stage, there are compelling reasons why this particular stand-off might not work in his favour in the bigger scheme of things. \n\nThe problem for Newsom is that, even as Trump has been losing support nationally on other issues, support remains strong for his tough stance on migration. Appearing to support illegal aliens to remain in the US is probably not a hill Democrats will want to die on, either now, in the run-up to next year’s midterm congressional elections, or in 2028. \n\nTrump may also be less vulnerable than many previous presidents to party political opposition. There is some new talk of impeachment (already), but he saw off two attempts before, and anyway, electorally, as a second-term president, he has little to lose, for all the loose talk he might try to change the constitution to make possible a third term. \n\nThe awkward reality is that Republicans running for office are more dependent on him, than he is on them. Added to which, Trump is not a party creature. He is a one-off deal-maker turned president, who is testing constitutional power to its limits.\n\nHis Republican badge is a flag of convenience, required by the political system. Traditional Republicans may be counting the days until their party can nominate a real, more predictable, Republican for the highest office. \n\nIn the meantime, their political fortunes are tied to his, and his sights are set on what he will bequeath, which includes a country with fewer illegal migrants, where America – in his definition – comes first. Gavin Newsom may have a national future; but he might do well to rein in his fury and bide his time.","summary":"Have Democrats at last found a credible champion in the California governor – and can he exploit his LA stand-off with the president to become a 2028 White House contender, asks Mary Dejevsky","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/donald-trump-gavin-newsom-la-ice-migration-protests-b2768914.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/12/12/47/SEI255178467.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZS0oSh5V-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-13 05:00:00","author":"Mary Dejevsky","authors":["Mary Dejevsky"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":330886744,"title":"Trump officials slam Sen.

Her appearance on such a highly popularised new medium was meant to nail her bid for the presidency. Instead, we have Trump and Stephen Miller in the White House and lingering whimpers of “Why didn’t Kamala go on Joe Rogan instead?” Such retrospection is, unfortunately, futile at this point. So, instead, let’s find out more about Alex Cooper and what it took to become the most influential female podcaster of a generation. Directed by Ry Russo-Young (Nuclear Family), this two-part docuseries follows Cooper from a shy Pennsylvania kid to a progressive sex-and-dating podcaster, evolving over six years into the CEO of a media empire. More than a success story, it’s a portrait of a person creating a space where women feel heard (and their respective others in their life can glean some often-necessary pointers).\n\nThe Survivors Netflix, streaming now\n\nWe’re mostly used to two types of Australian viewing: soaps and super-dry (to the point of cringe) comedy. This is different. The drama follows Kieran Elliott’s life after two people drown in his hometown of Evelyn Bay, Australia. To top it off, a young girl also went missing. Returning with his family 15 years later, the simmering guilt resurfaces, especially when the body of a young woman is found on the beach…\n\nK.O. Netflix, streaming now\n\nNo one does visceral city grit like the French. Bastien has lived as a recluse since accidentally killing his opponent Enzo in an MMA fight three years ago. Now, Enzo’s widow tracks him down as, essentially, he owes her one. Her request? Find her missing teenage son.\n\nTyler Perry’s Straw Netflix, streaming now\n\nBetween this and last month’s release of She the People, Mr Tyler Perry is getting himself around. This offering, however, is far more stark than May’s fare. Here, one mum’s day unfurls as it goes from tricky to catastrophic. Pushed to the precipice by a world that seems indifferent to her plight (until they can livestream it), she soon gets attention when she unwittingly holds up a bank.\n\nThe Orkney Assassin Prime Video, streaming now\n\nThe Orkney Isles lie 130 miles north of Aberdeen. It’s a peaceful place with a strong sense of community. In June 1994, however, Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was working at the lone curry house when a masked man fatally shot him. This documentary revisits one of Scotland’s most extraordinary murder cases, examining racism, loyalty, and the impact of trauma decades later.\n\nOcean with David Attenborough Disney+, streaming now The man who will never retire explores stunning ocean habitats, highlighting the challenges for marine-life recovery.\n\nThe Astroworld Tragedy Netflix, streaming now\n\nOn November 5, 2021, Travis Scott stepped on stage to perform at Astroworld, which ended in the deaths of 10 people.

An entire day of just harping on something that, frankly, most of which was false. … I think this entire Republican-controlled Congress is a waste.”\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the hearing. \n\n1. Members seeking higher offices make a splash\n\nMany members, who are eyeing higher offices such as a Senate or gubernatorial run, questioned the witnesses with Republicans laying into the governors and Democrats condemning the Trump administration and the hearing as “unserious.”\n\nReps. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Mike Lawler (R-NY) grilled Hochul as both House Republicans eye a run for governor in the state where they would seek to unseat Hochul.\n\n“We deserve a governor who stands up for law-abiding New Yorkers,” Stefanik said before an increasingly frustrated Hochul, who repeatedly attempted to condemn the crimes by illegal immigrants.\n\n“These crimes are horrific, I condemn them,” Hochul stated.\n\n“Because of your sanctuary state policies,” Stefanik quipped back. \n\nLawler told Hochul after a heated exchange, “New York is better off with you down here and not in the state.” \n\n“I don’t think it’s better off with you here,” she responded.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), a top contender for the open Illinois Senate seat, attacked President Donald Trump, saying, “he may not like state law, as we are seeing in California.” \n\nThis hearing comes as protests continue to sweep Los Angeles following Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that happened last week.\n\nTrump has called up the National Guard and activated U.S. Marines to deal with the protests in California, against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) wishes. Protests against Trump’s mass deportation operation carried out by ICE have turned violent at times.\n\n2. Governors dare Trump’s border czar Tom Homan to arrest them\n\nThe governors defended Newsom’s position that Trump sending in the National Guard to control anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles undermined local law enforcement. Trump also expressed support for Newsom’s arrest earlier this week after the governor dared the border czar Tom Homan to arrest him following the National Guard coming in.\n\nThe governors said Trump’s border czar can “try” to come and arrest them, too.\n\n“If Tom Homan comes to Albany to arrest me, I’ll say go for it,” Hochul said.\n\n“I have the highest duty to protect the people of my state, and indeed, if Tom Homan were to come to try to arrest us, me, rather, I can say first of all that he can try,” Pritzker added.\n\n3. News of Padilla’s handcuffing sparks divisions \n\nDuring the hearing, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was shoved out of a Department of Homeland Security press conference in California after he interrupted Secretary Kristi Noem and approached her podium with questions. Security officials, possibly not knowing he was a senator, treated his approach and physical resistance as a threat to the secretary and acted to remove and restrain him. \n\nMembers added the headlines of stories about Padilla into the hearing’s official record.\n\nRep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ) showed a printout photo of the post on X showing the senator being shoved out and reading the news that he was “forcefully removed from the news conference being held by DHS Kristi Noem.”\n\nRep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL) showed the video of Padilla, where Comer then argued that they should show the portion where he approached Noem.\n\nHouse Oversight acting ranking member Stephen Lynch (D-MA) asked for an investigation into the incident to take place in House Oversight.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said, “Mr. Chairman, for the record, he rushed the podium. He was being disruptive.”\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told reporters that “sitting members of Congress” were “lying about what happened” with Padilla.\n\nRep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) got into a screaming match involving House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) when he asked for a point of order to subpoena Noem. Comer told Frost to “shut up,” and Greene then accused Frost of being a “former antifa member.”\n\n“He has been out of order six times, he’s trying to get on MSNBC,” Comer said of Frost.\n\n4. Republicans question Walz on Biden’s mental fitness\n\nWhile the hearing was largely focused on immigration, Comer grilled Walz on his vice presidential run with former Vice President Kamala Harris, asking what he knew about former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline. \n\n“Did you ever ask Vice President Harris about former President Biden’s … cognitive decline?” Comer asked.\n\n“No, not that I can recall,” Walz said.\n\nComer pressed Walz on why he wouldn’t have asked Harris about Biden’s health after the disastrous debate performance against Trump that ultimately led to Biden dropping out of the race.\n\n“I was probably more concerned with my own debate performance than President Biden’s, so no,” Walz insisted.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is investigating Biden’s health decline and whether his White House aides not only shielded him from the public but also used an autopen to carry out official business without his knowledge. Autopen usage is not uncommon in modern White Houses, and Biden has insisted he was the ultimate decision maker on executive actions and pardons.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) also grilled Walz on the mental decline of Biden while in office and whether Harris talked to him about it. “Not that I can recall,” he said.\n\n5. Governors grilled on past quotes \n\nRep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) questioned Pritzker on an X post made by the governor back in 2017, calling on people to protest against Trump by using the other gender’s bathroom. \n\n“Have you ever considered that women don’t want you in their bathrooms?” Gill asked.\n\nWalz was on defense throughout the hearing for previously calling ICE agents “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo” during a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota Law School, claiming agents were “scooping folks up off the streets” who were being “disappeared.”\n\nAsked to apologize or recant for comparing U.S law enforcement to Nazi’s treatment of Jews, Walz refused. But he got an ally in Lynch, the top Democrat at the hearing, who condemned how ICE agents were abducting “peaceful” illegal immigrants from their communities.\n\n“When you compare the old films of the Gestapo grabbing people off the streets of Poland, and you compare them to those nondescript thugs … it does look like a Gestapo operation,” Lynch said.","summary":"Three blue state governors were on defense for hours on Thursday during a marathon House Oversight Committee hearing where Republicans accused them of reckless immigration policies in their states.

And despite identifying himself as a senator, Padilla was forced out of the room before he could finish asking his question, pushed to the floor, and handcuffed. \n\n“I was there peacefully,\" he told reporters, highlighting that, if this is how a senator is treated, this is a concerning sign of how average Americans will be treated.\n\n“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they’re doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country,” Padilla said.\n\nThe DHS, meanwhile, tried to deny responsibility for the mistreatment of Padilla by claiming that he never identified himself. Even House Speaker Mike Johnson went as far as to say that Padilla, whose every move was caught on camera, rushed the stage. \n\nUnsatisfied with these lies, Democrats marched to Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office to demand answers.\n\n“The brutal handcuffing of Senator Padilla is an affront to democracy,” Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland wrote on BlueSky. “I’m joining House Democrats to march to Senator Thune’s office and to demand that he protect his Colleagues from this out-of-control authoritarian onslaught.”\n\nAnd while Republicans hide behind flimsy excuses, Democrats like Rep.

At the time, White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor said it was basal cell carcinoma, but it did not require further treatment.\n\nIn 2021, he underwent a colonoscopy to remove a \"benign, slow-growing but thought to be precancerous lesion\" from his colon.Biden Penned an Emotional Statement After Revealing His Cancer DiagnosisFollowing the announcement of his cancer diagnosis, the former commander-in-chief took to Instagram to share a photo alongside his wife, former First Lady Jill Biden.\n\n\"Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support,\" he said in the post.Biden Has Reportedly Lived With Cancer for 'Many Years'Top oncologist Dr. Zeke Emanuel, who served as an advisor for health policy under Barack Obama, spoke out about Joe's health crisis, claiming the 46th U.S. president \"did not develop [prostate cancer] in the last, 100, 200 days\" and that he \"had it while he was president.\"\n\n\"He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021,\" Dr. Zeke said during an appearance on Morning Joe on May 19. \"Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that.\" \n\nHe assumed Joe \"had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading.\" Still, the politician's records reportedly showed \"no evidence that when he got his health status and the medical records were released that he had a prostate-specific antigen.\"\n\nDr. Zeke noted it was \"a little surprising to many of us oncologists\" that Joe was not diagnosed earlier.\n\nBefore Joe learned about his prostate cancer, his wife underwent Mohs surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma found above her right eye during a routine skin cancer screening in 2023.

Historically, it was used sparingly—only when a case had a strong chance of succeeding and there was clear irreparable harm in letting a lower court ruling stand.\n\nBut today’s shadow docket is something else entirely. It’s become just another weapon in the conservative Supreme Court’s arsenal to tilt the scales in the GOP’s favor—especially for President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly benefited from this judicial shortcut in both of his terms. But President Joe Biden wasn’t so lucky.\n\nNow liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has had enough, openly calling out her conservative colleagues for abandoning even the pretense of restraint and turning the Supreme Court into a partisan cudgel. \n\nAs Millhiser writes:\n\nMaybe there is a nonpartisan explanation for why the Court treated Biden differently than Trump… But, if such an explanation exists, the Republican justices did not explain what it is… They’ve chosen to sit silently while Jackson levies some very serious charges against them — all while presenting evidence that strongly suggests her colleagues are rooting their shadow docket decisions in partisanship and not the law.\n\nLet’s be blunt: When a 6-3 conservative majority still feels compelled to rig the rules for Trump, that’s not jurisprudence; it’s corruption. This isn’t about ideology. It’s about raw, unaccountable power cloaked in judicial robes.\n\nAnd it’s not new. The rot goes back at least to Bush v. Gore, when the conservative justices handed George W. Bush the presidency, even though he lost both the popular vote and, frankly, Florida. That ruling was so nakedly partisan that the majority actually wrote that it shouldn’t be used as precedent. They knew how full of shit it was.\n\nBut let’s put a pin in the Supreme Court issue for a moment and pivot to this Politico story about a recent conference hosted by “centrist” Democrats, which was framed as a counterweight to the party’s left wing. Their thesis? Progressives are why Democrats lose elections.\n\nNow, anyone who’s followed me for the last 23 years knows I’m a pragmatist. I back progressive candidates when they help us win, and I criticize left-wing rigidity when it loses us elections. But let’s be real: The biggest disadvantage progressives face isn’t policy; it’s the media ecosystem. \n\nThe right has one. We don’t.\n\nRight-wing billionaires built Fox News, talk radio, and Facebook propaganda farms. Progressives? We waste hundreds of millions of dollars on TV ads that no one remembers and invest pennies in media that can actually shape public opinion.\n\nJust look at 2024. Kamala Harris and her outside allies raised more than $1.1 billion, while Trump and his outside allies raised just over $600 million. Democrats also outraised Republicans in Senate and House races but still lost. Why? Because TV ads don’t stand a chance against the right-wing noise machine.\n\nSo, yeah, if you’re reading this, please consider redirecting your political donations away from TV ads and into media infrastructure—like Daily Kos and your other favorite progressive outlets. That’s how we change minds. That’s how we win.\n\nIf focusing on what voters care about is the centrists’ message, I’m not arguing. If Democrats want to get together to figure out how to win over voters in next year’s brutal battleground states—Nebraska, Iowa, Florida, and Texas—then great. If the economy is what voters care about—and they do—then let’s talk about the economy, and only the economy, until the day after the election. \n\nIf that’s called “centrism,” fine. I don’t care. I just want to win.\n\nAnd if that sidelines some groups who haven’t done much to help Democrats win power? Also fine. \n\nPolitico quotes Justice Democrats as the progressive foil to centrists, but come on. This is the group that excommunicated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. That’s not a serious organization; it’s a purity cult. And it’s a shame, because their anti-billionaire message is great. But if AOC isn’t pure enough for them, then … good luck.\n\nThe problem isn’t centrism. The problem is people who hide behind centrism to avoid doing what’s right.\n\nWhich brings me back to the Supreme Court. The New York Times reported that at that same centrist conference, organizers were handing out buttons pushing a campaign to keep the Supreme Court at nine justices.\n\nPushing to lock in nine justices—after Republicans stole two seats—isn’t just absurd, it’s strategically suicidal. It’s also weird for a group that claims that we need to focus on the issues that voters actually care about to make this a talking point. \n\nThe average voter isn’t concerned about the Supreme Court headcount. No average voter gives a damn about court packing. They didn’t care when Republicans rigged the court, and they don’t care about the shadow docket.\n\nThey care about groceries, rent, wages, and whether they can afford to live.\n\nBut here’s the thing: just because voters aren’t talking about the Supreme Court doesn’t mean that Democrats should ignore it. If we retake the White House and both chambers of Congress, we should expand the court immediately. The Constitution gives us that power. \n\nBecause this isn’t an ideological court. If it were, there’d be a stronger case for leaving it alone. Rather, this is a partisan court. It rewrites precedent depending on who’s in the White House. It changes the rules to help Republicans and punish Democrats. That’s not justice. That’s rot.\n\nAny Democrat arguing to preserve this illegitimate 6-3 conservative majority is arguing for one thing: permanent conservative rule.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that we explicitly run on court expansion, but it sure as hell means that, if we ever get the power, we fix this broken institution. \n\nWhether you’re a proud progressive or a data-driven centrist, if you actually believe in democracy, the current Supreme Court cannot stand.","summary":"Ian Millhiser, senior correspondent at Vox, recently dropped a must-read on one of the most galling features of today’s Supreme Court: the shadow docket. \n\n\n\nIt’s the legal equivalent of fast-tracking a decision without the usual hearings, written opinions, or transparency.

Alex Padilla is forcefully removed from Kristi Noem’s news conference on immigration raids and handcuffed","text":"By KRYSTA FAURIA, MICHAEL R. BLOOD and LISA MASCARO\n\nLOS ANGELES — Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla on Thursday was forcefully removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles and handcuffed by officers as he tried to speak up about immigration raids that have led to protests in California and around the country.\n\nVideo shows a Secret Service agent on Noem’s security detail grabbing the California senator by his jacket and shoving him from the room as he tried to speak up during the DHS secretary’s event. Padilla interrupted the news conference after Noem delivered a particularly pointed line, saying federal authorities were not going away but planned to stay and increase operations to “liberate” the city from its “socialist” leadership.\n\n“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” he shouted in a halting voice.\n\nScuffling with officers outside the room, he can be heard bellowing, “Hands off!” He is later seen on his knees and then pushed to the ground and handcuffed in a hallway, with several officers atop him.\n\nThe shocking scene of a U.S. senator being aggressively removed from a Cabinet secretary’s news conference prompted immediate outrage from his Democratic colleagues. Images and video of the scuffle ricocheted through the halls of Congress, where stunned Democrats demanded an immediate investigation and characterized the episode as another in a line of mounting threats to democracy by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said what he saw “sickened my stomach.”\n\n“We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,” the New York senator said from the Senate floor. “It’s despicable, it’s disgusting, it’s so un-American.”\n\nIn a statement, DHS said that Padilla “chose disrespectful political theater” and that Secret Service “thought he was an attacker.” The statement claimed erroneously that Padilla did not identify himself — he did, as he was being pushed from the room.\n\n“Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the statement said, adding that “officers acted appropriately.”\n\nThe fracas in Los Angeles came just days after Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers outside a detention center in New Jersey while Newark’s mayor was being arrested after he tried to join a congressional oversight visit at the facility. Democrats have framed the charges as intimidation efforts by the Trump administration.\n\nIt also follows days of rising tension between Trump and Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom over the federal military intervention in California. In a speech earlier this week, the governor warned that “democracy is under assault before our eyes.”\n\nEmerging afterward, Padilla said he was removed while demanding answers about the Trump administration’s “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions.” He said he and his colleagues had received little to no response to their questions in recent weeks, so he attended the briefing for more information.\n\n“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question … I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the Los Angeles community, and throughout California and throughout the country,” he said.\n\nNoem told Fox LA afterward that she had a “great” conversation with Padilla after the scuffle, but called his approach “something that I don’t think was appropriate at all.”\n\nThe White House accused Padilla of grandstanding.\n\n“Padilla didn’t want answers; he wanted attention,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “It’s telling that Democrats are more riled up about Padilla than they are about the violent riots and assaults on law enforcement in LA.”\n\nPadilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, has been a harsh Trump critic and his mass deportations agenda. In a social media post, he said of recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, “Trump isn’t targeting criminals in his mass deportation agenda, he is terrorizing communities, breaking apart families and putting American citizens in harm’s way.”\n\nPadilla in 2021 became the state’s first Latino U.S. senator when he was selected by Newsom to fill Kamala Harris’ Senate seat after she was elected vice president. At the time, Padilla was the state’s chief elections officer.\n\nHarris wrote in a social media post Thursday that Padilla “was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this administration’s actions in Southern California.” She called his forceful removal “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”\n\nDemocratic senators quickly gathered in the chamber, denouncing the treatment of their colleague — a well-liked and respected senator — and urged Americans to understand what was happening.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Trump is making this country “look more and more like a fascist state.”\n\n“Will any Republican senator speak up for our democracy?” Warren pleaded.\n\nSen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., called on Noem to resign, saying that there was no justification for Padilla’s treatment and that the Trump administration needed to be held accountable.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., accused Padilla of “charging” Noem and indicated that the behavior “rises to the level of a censure.”\n\n“My view is it was wildly inappropriate,” Johnson, a Trump ally, told reporters outside the House chamber as Democrats walking past shouted over him, “That’s a lie!”\n\n“A sitting member of Congress should not act like that,” Johnson said, loudly speaking over reporters’ questions. “It’s beneath a member of Congress. It’s beneath the U.S. senator.”\n\nSenate Republican leader John Thune said he has spoken to Padilla and is trying to reach Noem but hasn’t yet connected with her.\n\n“We want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator and try to gather all the relevant information,” the South Dakota senator said.\n\nThe No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, said that he was unaware of what happened but that Padilla should have been at work in Washington.\n\nThe stark incident comes as Congress faces increasing episodes of encroachment on its authority. As a coequal branch of the U.S. government, the Trump administration is exerting its executive powers in untested ways.\n\nAs part of their work in Congress, lawmakers are responsible for providing oversight of the administration, its agencies and actions.\n\nSeveral senators and representatives have been exercising their oversight roles by surveying the treatment of immigrants and others being detained as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation operation.\n\nFrom the steps of the U.S. Capitol, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said what happened to Padilla “was un-American” and those involved must be held accountable.\n\n“This is not going to end until there is accountability and until the Trump administration changes its behavior,” he said.\n\nMascaro reported from Washington.

Stand up. Grow a pair of balls.'\n\n'F***ing get over there and get some f***ing balls! Tell them! Tell them! You know who I am!' \n\nAt that point, the microphone over the House floor was turned off and all that could be heard was muffled shouting. \n\nIn a statement to social media, Lawler didn't hold back in his contempt for the Democrat.\n\n'John Mannion was entirely unhinged and unprofessional. That was a shameful display that exposed his complete lack of temperament,' Lawler said. \n\n'No wonder numerous staffers have previously alleged a toxic work environment. He should go seek help for anger management - and f*** off.'\n\nLast August, Mannion was cleared by a New York State Senate investigation into claims of harassment, The New York Post reported. \n\nWhen asked what the shouting was about Mannion told Axios that he and Lawler 'served in the state legislature' in New York and that he 'knows well enough. \n\n'I asked him to compel his colleagues to save the country and stop what the people of this country do not want ... the defiance of law,' Mannion added.\n\nHowever, even Mannion's fellow Democrats were left baffled, as Panetta - who Lawler was originally speaking to - asked him: 'What are you doing?'\n\n'My own thing,' Mannion shrugged and replied.\n\nAll Panetta could say in response was: \"Apparently, man.' \n\n'What we're seeing with the actions of this administration is out of control, and Republicans aren't doing anything to reign it in. Tempers are flaring,' Texas Democrat Julie Johnson said of the mood on the House floor.\n\nPadilla began shouting over Noem before he was forcibly removed from the room by multiple guards and placed in handcuffs. \n\nNoem was speaking and the Q&A portion of the meeting had not started when Padilla started heckling and interrupting, saying: 'I'm Senator Alex Padilla, and I have questions for the secretary...'\n\nAs he was escorted out of the room during the tense interaction, he said: 'The fact of the matter is half a dozen violent criminals that you're rotating on your…. hands off!'\n\nStartling footage shared by Padilla's team showed that he was forced to his knees, then onto the ground, outside of the room - and was put in handcuffs by the FBI. \n\nPadilla, who is the son of Mexican immigrants, slammed the Trump administration and their treatment of migrants after the ordeal at his own blistering press conference.\n\n'If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community,' he said in the impassioned statement. \n\nTrump's immigration chief Noem was in Los Angeles to discuss the Trump Administration's response to the anti-ICE protests and immigration raids in the area.\n\n'We are not going away. We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and mayor have placed on this country and what they’ve tried to insert in this city,' she said as Padilla interrupted. \n\nNoem condemned the senator for the disruption and noted that he had not even asked for a meeting with her. \n\n'I think everybody in America would agree that that was inappropriate,' she said.\n\nSen. Padilla's team released a statement shortly after insisting he was at the press conference to perform his congressional duties.\n\n'Senator Padilla is currently in Los Angeles exercising his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government's operations in Los Angeles and across California,' the statement said.\n\n'He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem's press conference.\n\n'He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed. He is not currently detained, and we are working to get additional information.'\n\nAfter the press conference, Noem addressed the incident while standing outside the federal building. \n\n'If he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was and wanted to talk. His approach was something I don't think was appropriate at all. But the conversation was great and we are going to communicate,' she said.\n\n'We exchanged phone numbers and we are going to continue to talk. People need to identify themselves before lunging during press conferences.'\n\nDHS said on X that Secret Service agents believed Padilla was an attacker and they acted accordingly.\n\n'Senator Padilla chose disrespectful political theatre and interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem,' the agency said.\n\n'Mr. Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands. @SecretService thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately.\n\n'Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.'\n\nNoem called Padilla's statement about the incident 'ridiculous' and told Fox News she believed he wanted to cause a scene.\n\n'The way that he acted was completely inappropriate. It wasn't becoming of a U.S. Senator or official and perhaps he wanted the scene,' she said.\n\n'This man burst into a room and started advancing towards the podium, interrupting an opening statement and, elevating his voice and shouting questions. \n\n'People tried to stop him from interrupting the press conference, but he refused and continued to lunge towards the podium.'\n\nThe DHS secretary told the outlet she met with the senator for about 10 to 15 minutes afterwards and the two even exchanged phone numbers.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom condemned Padilla's detention on social media.\n\n'Sen. Alex Padilla is one of the most decent people I know. This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now,' he said.\n\n'If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you.'\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who Padilla replaced in the senate when she was elected VP, said, 'United States Senator Alex Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration's actions in Southern California. This is a shameful and stunning abuse of power.'\n\nRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters, 'It's horrible. It is shocking at every level.

I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla shouts, as he struggles to move past against the men pushing him back toward the exit.\n\n“Hands off!” Padilla says at least three times. Outside the room, he is pinned to the floor and placed in handcuffs.\n\nRelated: ‘Snatching off the streets’: Ice targets churches, car washes and workplaces \n\nEmerging afterward, Padilla, the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on immigration, citizenship and border safety, said he and his colleagues had repeatedly asked DHS for more information on its “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions” but had not received a response to his inquiries.\n\n“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the DHS responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they’re doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers, throughout the LA community and throughout California and throughout the country,” Padilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, told reporters. “We will hold this administration accountable.”\n\nThe extraordinary scene stunned his Democratic colleagues from Capitol Hill to California, though his actions drew criticism from Republicans, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who called for Padilla’s censure. It comes amid escalating tensions between California and the federal government, after Donald Trump deployed national guard troops and US Marines to LA to quell protests prompted by immigration raids, over the objections of the state’s governor and the city’s mayor.\n\n“I am shocked by how far we have descended in the first 140 days of this administration,” Adam Schiff, the junior senator from California said in a speech from the Senate floor shortly after viewing the video of the incident. “What is becoming of our democracy? Are there no limits to what this administration will do? Is there no line they will not cross?”\n\nIn a statement, the DHS said the senator “chose disrespectful political theatre” and disrupted a live news conference. They falsely claimed that Padilla had failed to identify himself and believed he was an attacker when he “lunged toward” Noem as she delivered remarks.\n\n“Mr Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the department said in a statement posted on X, adding that officers responded and “acted appropriately”.\n\nThe deputy FBI director Dan Bongino accused Padilla of “not wearing a security pin” and said he “physically resisted law enforcement when confronted”.\n\n“Our FBI personnel acted completely appropriately while assisting Secret Service and we are grateful for their professionalism and service,” Bongino added.\n\nNoem was in Los Angeles to accompany federal agents on immigration operations in the area.\n\nNoem said Padilla’s approach “wasn’t appropriate” and that she wished he had reached out to her office before interrupting the event. Following the incident, she and the senator met for 15 minutes, according to DHS. Noem told reporters that they had a “great” and “productive” conversation and exchanged phone numbers.\n\nDemocratic officials said they were stunned by what the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, described as the “manhandling” of a sitting US senator.\n\nThe California governor, Gavin Newsom, called Padilla “one of the most decent people I know”, before adding: “This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now.”\n\nIn 2021, Padilla became California’s first Latino senator when he filled Kamala Harris’ seat after she was elected Joe Biden’s vice-president. Harris weighed in on his removal from the press conference, calling the incident “a shameful and stunning abuse of power”.\n\n“Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration’s actions in Southern California,” she wrote on X.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, wrote on X that “watching this video sickened my stomach, the manhandling of a United States Senator, Senator Padilla. We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.”\n\nJimmy Gomez, a California representative, wrote on X : “This isn’t just shocking, it’s a threat to the rule of law and democratic accountability. Sen Padilla is conducting oversight over the lawlessness of the Trump and the violations of the #RuleOfLaw. If this can happen to immigrant communities, it can happen to anyone.”\n\nNorma Torres, a California representative, lambasted the treatment of Padilla in an impassioned video, writing: “Senator Alex Padilla was dragged and handcuffed out for daring to question Secretary Noem. This wasn’t a threat – it was dissent. They’re not keeping us safe – they’re silencing us.”\n\nThe clash with Padilla comes just days after the Democratic representative LaMonica McIver of New Jersey was indicted on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers after a clash with law enforcement at a May protest outside a detention facility in Newark. Democrats have cast the charges as a politically motivated attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate the opposition.\n\nAs he exited the floor of the House of Representatives, Johnson said the senator had been at fault, accusing him of “charging a cabinet secretary at a press conference” and calling his actions “wildly inappropriate”.\n\n“A sitting member of Congress should not act like that,” he said. “It is beneath a member of the Congress, it is beneath a US senator.”\n\nJohnson said he believes Padilla’s behavior “merits immediate attention” by Congress and “at a minimum, it rises to the level of a censure” by the Senate.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/senator-alex-padilla-forcibly-removed-184525806.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/4d8b00871819cd2a8da0f10b3f8df2a3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-12 23:30:40","author":"Jenna Amatulli, Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles, And Chris Stein In Washington","authors":["Jenna Amatulli, Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles, And Chris Stein In Washington"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":330850046,"title":"Sen Alex Padilla dragged out of Noem immigration briefing in LA","text":"California's Governor Gavin Newsom called on Republican congressional leadership to condemn the detaining of Padilla. \n\n\"If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you,\" Newsom wrote on social media.\n\nBut the White House accused the California senator of storming the press conference, and said he \"yelled and lunged toward Secretary Noem\". \n\n\"Padilla didn't want answers; he wanted attention,\" Abigail Jackson, White House spokesperson said. \"Padilla embarrassed himself and his constituents with this immature, theater-kid stunt – but it's telling that Democrats are more riled up about Padilla than they are about the violent riots and assaults on law enforcement in LA.\"\n\nFormer vice-president and Trump opponent, Kamala Harris also criticised the move and said the California senator was trying to get answers for his constituents about the ongoing immigration raids in the state. \n\n\"United States Senator Alex Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration's actions in Southern California,\" she said on Twitter. \"This is a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygn48djrko","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ef37/live/e89f1130-47ca-11f0-84b6-6bf0f66205f1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-12 23:19:35","author":"Ali Abbas Ahmadi & Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu","authors":["Ali Abbas Ahmadi & Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":330855458,"title":"US senator dragged out of LA immigration news conference","text":"Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla has been forcibly removed from a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles.\n\nNoem was offering the latest figures on immigration enforcement in the area, which has led to nearly a week of protests in the city, to members of the news media when Sen Padilla interrupted and started shouting a question.\n\nOnce removed from the room, the California senator was handcuffed.\n\nPadilla's removal caused condemnation on both sides of the aisle, with fellow senators calling the arrest shocking and a \"sickening disgrace\" and the Trump administration dubbing it \"disrespectful political theatre\".\n\n\"I'm Senator Alex Padilla,\" he said as he was confronted by authorities. \"I have questions for the secretary!\"\n\nNoem, who was speaking about immigration and the protests in LA, continued addressing reporters and law enforcement officers while the senator was ejected from the room.\n\nPadilla's office said he was \"forced to the ground and handcuffed\" by federal agents when trying to ask the secretary a question, and added that he was not currently being detained.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Padilla had engaged in \"disrespectful political theatre\" and that Noem met with the senator after the news briefing.\n\nLA Mayor Karen Bass called the incident \"absolutely abhorrent and outrageous\", adding that the Trump administration's \"violent attacks on our city must end\".\n\nPadilla told reporters that he was already in the federal building for a previously scheduled meeting.

Walz's title was then reduced to master sergeant.The Minnesota governor drew sharp scrutiny over his military service during the 2024 presidential campaign after he publicly referred to himself as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"What To KnowOn Thursday, Walz was again grilled over his record by Republican Representative Pete Stauber of Minnesota. The exchange came during a hearing in which Walz and other governors representing states with sanctuary immigration policies testified before the Republican-led House Oversight Committee.\"Governor, what weapons did you carry in war?\" Stauber asked Walz during the House hearing.\"Congressman, for 24 years, I carried—\" Walz began.\"No, no, no,\" Stauber said, cutting him off and pointing his finger at Walz. \"What weapons did you carry in war?\"\"What did you carry in uniform?\" Walz shot back at Stauber, who served as a lieutenant in the Duluth Police Department before running for Congress.\"You know I misspoke,\" Walz added, referring to his previous comments about retiring as a Command Sergeant Major.\"I'll tell you what, governor, you're barking down the wrong tree, okay?\" Stauber said, while pointing at Walz. \"You lied to the Minnesotans. You said that you carried weapons in war. That is stolen valor.\"At that point, a Democratic lawmaker on the House oversight panel asked the chairman, GOP Representative James Comer, to step in and allow Walz to speak, but Stauber continued speaking over them.\"Stolen valor!\" Stauber shouted as Walz tried to respond. \"You didn't carry weapons in war. Will you apologize for lying?\"Representative Stephen Lynch, the ranking member on the panel, again asked Comer to step in, saying, \"That's not questioning a witness.\"\"You are hectoring,\" Lynch said, addressing Stauber.Walz addressed his public comments about his military service in an August 2024 interview with CNN's Dana Bash. At the time, Bash asked Walz, who spoke alongside then-Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, if he misspoke while saying that he carried a weapon \"in war.\"Walz responded: \"I said, we were talking about in this case—this was after a school shooting—the ideas of carrying these weapons of war, and my wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar is not always correct. But again, if it's not this, it's an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it's an attack on my dog.\"Walz added: \"The one thing I'll never do is I'll never demean another member's service in any way. I never have and I never will.\"This is a breaking news story.
