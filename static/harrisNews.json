But having no peaceful and democratic means at hand, we have to continue military operation.”\n\nHe would go on to say that U.S. and European weapon shipments to Kyiv would need to be halted for those talks to take place.\n\n\"Otherwise, it will be advantage for Ukraine.

She shot down Peskov’s assertion that Ukraine was refusing the possibility of talks beginning at once.\n\n“President Zelensky today already said that, yes, Ukraine is ready to negotiate,” Markarova said. Ukraine has set a temporary ceasefire as a condition for talks to take place. Russia, meanwhile, said that it would not accept the presence of European peacekeeping forces.\n\n“We have heard loud and clear from President Trump that ceasefires should be full and unconditional.

The question of the day is whether Russia wants it.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent much of 2024 hammering his two opponents, Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris, for the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts, which he says started under their watch. The 47th president claimed often that Putin would not have dared to launch an invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had he been in office, and boasted as well that he could end the eastern European conflict in a matter of hours.\n\nThose hours have stretched into weeks as Trump has come to publicly grumble that Russia may be stringing his administration along in the hopes of securing a more advantageous position on the battlefield. The U.S. president has threatened damaging sanctions against Moscow if the conflict continues, but has yet to act on those threats.\n\nAfter an Oval Office blow-up between the two men earlier this year, Trump met Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican in late April. Soon after the meeting, he posted his suspicions of Russia’s aims on Truth Social.\n\n“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.”\n\nOn Sunday, Trump condemned the “bloodbath” in another Truth Social posting and urged Zelensky to accept an invitation for talks in Turkey with Putin scheduled for this coming Thursday. Zelensky, along with a coalition of NATO leaders, presented the U.S. with a pledge on Saturday stating that Ukraine would accept an immediate temporary ceasefire and to begin talks with Russia. Putin, in his response, accepted an invitation to negotiate while refusing to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n\n“President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!”\n\n“I’m starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin, who’s too busy celebrating the Victory of World War ll, which could not have been won (not even close!) without the United States of America,” he continued. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”\n\nZelensky accepted, responding in his own post to Twitter.\n\n“We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,” he said. “There is no point in prolonging the killings.

Meanwhile, Vance is seen by many as the most likely Republican to follow Trump, who is term-limited and can't technically run for a third term.Although Trump and some of his allies have repeatedly teased the idea of him seeking an additional term, most constitutional experts believe this would not be possible unless the Constitution is officially changed, which would be an all but impossible process given current political dynamics.What To KnowNo Democratic politician has declared an intention to run for president yet, but most analysts speculate that some of the leading contenders in 2028 would be Harris, Ocasio-Cortez, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.Polling aggregation site Race to the WH currently shows Harris, who lost to Trump in 2024, leading the pack with a polling average of 27.2 percent. She is followed by Ocasio-Cortez in second at 15.9 percent, Buttigieg in third at 12.8 percent, Booker is fourth at 8.6 percent and Newsom is fifth at 7.1 percent.Donald Trump's PopularityThe president's popularity rating currently stands at 43 percent in the first quarter of 2025, according to YouGov's latest data. Popularity is measured by YouGov as a percentage of people who have a positive opinion of a given politician.Trump is disliked by 40 percent of people, which means his popularity rating is 3 points above water. An additional 11 percent have a neutral opinion.The data also shows that Trump ranks as the 10th most popular politician in the country, below Harris and Ocasio-Cortez, but above Buttigieg, Newsom and Booker. He is the third most popular Republican, with California's former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ranked No. 1 followed by former President George W. Bush in second.YouGov's polling data for Trump aligns closely with Gallup, which had Trump's approval rating at 44 percent as of April. The average for Trump' second term thus far, according to Gallup, is 45 percent.JD Vance's PopularityThe vice president is less popular than the president, according to YouGov. Just 39 percent of people have a positive view of Vance compared to 42 percent who dislike him—meaning his popularity is negative 3 points. An additional 14 percent have a neutral view.Although Vance ranks as the 4th most popular Republican, he is only the 17th most popular politician overall. That places him below all the leading potential 2028 Democratic contenders except for Booker.Kamala Harris' PopularityThe former vice president is significantly more popular than Trump and Vance, with a popularity rating double-digits above water. Harris is popular with 55 percent of respondents, compared to 31 percent who dislike her—giving her a positive rating of 24 points. An additional 13 percent have a neutral view.Notably, Harris is the third most popular Democratic politician—after former Presidents Jimmy Carter, who died last year, and Barack Obama, respectively. Overall, she is the 4th most popular U.S. politician, with Carter coming at No. 1, followed by Obama and then Schwarzenegger in third.Pete Buttigieg's PopularityButtigieg's popularity rating is significantly above water, although the percentage of people who have a positive view of the former Biden administration official is slightly lower than for Trump, while higher than Vance.According to YouGov, Buttigieg popularity stands at 41 percent. Meanwhile, just 21 percent say they dislike him, giving him a positive rating of 20 points. An additional 16 percent have a neutral view.Buttigieg ranks as the 14th most popular politician overall, and as the 11th most popular Democrat. Among the potential 2028 Democratic candidates, that places him third after Harris and Ocasio-Cortez, respectively.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's PopularityThe New York progressive is more popular than Trump and Vance. Ocasio-Cortez's popularity rating stands at 45 percent, while just 24 percent dislike her—meaning her popularity is 21 points above water. An additional 15 percent view her neutrally.The congresswoman is ranked as the sixth most popular Democrat, and the eight most popular politician overall. This places her second among the leading potential 2028 candidates after Harris.Gavin Newsom's PopularityThe California governor's popularity rating is tied with that of Vance, but below Trump. Thirty-nine percent of people have a positive view of Newsom while 24 percent said they disliked him, which means his rating is above water by 15 points. An additional 19 percent viewed him neutrally.He ranks 13th among Democrats and 16th among politicians overall. That places him below Trump and one spot above Vance.Cory Booker's PopularityThe senator from New Jersey has a popularity rating of 37 percent, while 16 percent said they dislike him. That puts Booker's popularity below Vance and Trump, although his rating is also positive by 21 percent. A further 14 percent have a neutral view.Among Democrats, Booker ranks the lowest among the leading potential 2028 contenders, at 16th. He also ranks the lowest among politicians overall, coming in at 20th.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump when asked by Fox News in February if he saw Vance as his successor: \"No, but he's very capable. I think you have a lot of very capable people... So far, I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early, we're just starting.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez when asked by Fox News about her 2028 plans in April: \"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights. We're getting 2-year-olds that are getting deported into cells in Honduras. We're getting people that are about to get kicked off of Medicaid. That, to me, is most important.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris on the Trump administration last month: \"We all know President Trump and his administration, and their allies, are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that if they make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others. But what they're overlooking, what they have overlooked is that fear is not the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious, the courage of Americans who are banding together...\"What Happens Next?Americans' views of the potential 2028 contenders are expected to shift substantially in the coming months as years. As of now, none have announced an intention to run, and voters will likely take a more serious look at candidates once they launch campaigns.","summary":"No Democratic candidate has yet declared an intention to run in 2028, but speculation continues to swirl.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-leading-2028-democrats-popularity-compares-trump-jd-vance-2070673","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2642462/aoc-vance-trump-buttigieg.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 20:25:24","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":320275572,"title":"WATCH -- Jasmine Crockett: Democrats Supporting 'Safest White Boy' Prior to 2028 Election","text":"Rep.

So, you take those two factors, it's hard to see how he wins,\" Brooks said. During the interview, the former president pushed back on criticism that Harris didn't have enough time to run an effective campaign, alleging that she had six months to do so. The former vice president had around 90 days. \"But, he's a proud man with a chip on his shoulder who feels himself under attack, frankly, in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, and so he wants to stand up for himself,\" he continued.

Mike Lawler (R-NY), a fellow panelist on the overtime segment of “Real Time With Bill Maher,” noted that the Republican National Committee has a rule that when there’s a male chair, the vice chair has to be female. \n\nEarlier in the conversation, the panelists discussed murmurs that Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) may run for president in 2028 and groused over the hype about him potentially being the first Latino president. \n\nHogg similarly seemed displeased with the focus on identity politics and said the important factor should be, “Are you good at your job?”\n\nThe 25-year-old activist is at risk of losing his DNC vice chairmanship role over his plans to meddle in primaries. \n\nDNC chairman Ken Martin has opposed Hogg’s plans and called for top party brass to adhere to a neutrality policy.\n\n“Our job is to be neutral arbiters,” Martin told DNC members in a call last month. “We can’t be both the referee and also the player at the same time.”\n\nMartin has pushed to tweak party rules so that DNC officers are required to stay neutral in primaries. The DNC is expected to vote on that measure in August, which would force Hogg to make a decision about his future.\n\nLawler praised Hogg’s plans to intervene in primaries. \n\n“I can tell you, having been in politics for quite a while, as far as an intern for [John] McCain. Some of these people don’t know when it’s time to go,” Lawler said. \n\n“Chuck Schumer has been in elected office for 50 years. 1974, he was first elected,” he added. “AOC will absolutely kick his a—. She is the leader of the Democratic Party in this moment, and will continue to be.”\n\nHogg added that longtime Dem incumbents have essentially grumbled that “if I retire, my life is effectively over.”\n\n“What I would say is, ‘Get over yourself.’ This is about our country, and it’s about your constituents,” Hogg said. “That seat is not yours, it is your constituents.'”","summary":"Democratic National Committee vice chair David Hogg bashed his own party for being too hostile towards men and cited that as a major factor in why Republicans cruised to victory in the 2024 election.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/11/us-news/david-hogg-dems-have-abandoned-men-who-just-want-to-get-laid-and-have-fun/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104277163.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QbGQFABo-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-11 17:13:16","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.039},{"id":320198576,"title":"Jasmine Crockett says Democrats want ‘the safest white boy’ for 2028 ticket and have a specific candidate in mind","text":"Representative Jasmine Crockett has revealed Democratic donors are vying for the “safest white boy” possible in the 2028 presidential race.\n\nThe Texas lawmaker joined Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Malcolm Kenyatta Thursday on SiriusXM’s Urban View to discuss their party’s future following Democrats’ electoral defeat in November.\n\nThere, Crockett said Democratic donors are already starting to rally behind potential 2028 presidential candidates.

Democratic members of Congress held the press conference to introduce the “Protected Time Off Act”. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nIf one sign of a leader is the ability to express themselves strategically, effectively, and efficiently, then there are several things that Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) could teach corporate executives about communication and leadership.\n\nLike Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Crockett is in the public spotlight thanks to what she says and how she says it. The increased media presence of the two lawmakers comes at a time when Democrats are looking for new and younger leaders to help re-brand the party.\n\nCrockett has shown that she can express herself in attention-getting and memorable ways, such as when spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year and said that “Kamala Harris has a resume. Donald Trump has a rap sheet.” She made headlines for the colorful way that she responded to disparaging remarks about her by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA) during a House committee hearing last year.\n\nIn a commencement speech last week at Tougaloo College, a historically Black college in Mississippi, she pointed out that “every significant social justice movement has been led by young people [and]\n\nnoted that she is now older than Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X were when they were assassinated,” according to Diverse Education.” Crockett went on to say that “Your moment is not in the future. Your moment is now. This country is relying on each and every one of you to walk into your purpose and to walk in greatness with your head held high.”\n\nCrockett’s presentation and message resonated with the audience. “She was dynamic and passionate,\" according to Rose Lucas, whose niece was among the more than 120 undergraduates who heard the speech. \"At a time when so many of our politicians are afraid to speak out against the injustices in Washington, I am encouraged by the Congresswoman’s passion and commitment,” Diverse Education reported.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\niOS 18—Here’s Why There’s A New Black Dot On Your iPhone\n\nMicrosoft Confirms New Free Update Deadline For Windows Users\n\nLeak Reveals Mark Zuckerberg Is Quietly Plotting To Blow Up The Bitcoin Price And Crypto Market\n\nCrockett’s Jargon-Free Communication\n\nCrockett’s communication and leadership styles reflect her background, career and political experience. Her leadership style “combines her legal background with jargon-free political communication. She effortlessly integrates complex policy debates into everyday conversation. Her plain-spoken style keeps constituents engaged, while her legal acumen grounds every argument in statutes and the Constitution,” Jacqueline Twillie, a leadership and development expert, explained via an email interview.\n\nWhile corporate executives don’t have Crockett’s resume, they can learn from her that “clear audience-centered language is a strategic advantage. It builds trust, accelerates buy-in, and positions the leader as credible and approachable,” Twille observed.\n\nThe verbal skills of new and aspiring leaders can be instrumental in helping them to achieve their goals and attract new follower. “Crockett doesn’t just show up in spaces; she repositions the space around her. That’s a vital skill for any business leader navigating power dynamics, equity conversations, or high-stakes decision-making,”\n\nPatrice Williams-Lind0, CEO of Career Nomad, commented in an email message to me.\n\nAccording to her, there are the three things that business leaders can learn from Crockett’s communication style:\n\nCommand With Candor\n\n“Crockett communicates hard truths without shrinking. In corporate settings, leaders often water down bold messaging for the sake of comfort. Crockett proves you can lead with candor and earn credibility.”\n\nStrategic Disruption\n\n“She’s not chaotic; she’s calculated. Her responses are often grounded in data, constitutional knowledge, and emotional intelligence—essential tools in today’s climate of rapid change and polarized environments.”\n\nAuthenticity AsStrategy\n\n“Crockett’s hair, fashion, and tone are part of her brand—and that authenticity builds trust, especially among younger and more diverse audiences. Business leaders must recognize that visibility and relatability are no longer optional.”\n\nA Leadership Style Driven By Conviction And Values\n\nThe Texas legislator demonstrates how a leader’s values can be reflected in their actions and words “As a leader, she is very clear about her values and doesn’t sit in polite silence. She is changing the game by modeling what it looks like to lead by using your identity, your expertise, and your voice. This is extraordinary because in corporate America, there is a lot of pressure felt by Black women to conform and be silent,” Tamica Sears, an executive coach and HR consultant at Sears Coaching, noted in an email interview with me.\n\nWhile some politicians are more comfortable following the crowds, Crockett shows that she prefers to lead, rather than follow. Her leadership style is “unapologetically clear, anchored in truth, and driven by conviction—and that’s exactly the kind of leadership we need more of. She doesn’t lead to please; she leads to shift. She’s not here for pageantry or politicking—she’s here to push boundaries and speak for people who’ve been shut out of rooms for too long,” Angela Solomon, a leadership coach, observed via an email message to me.\n\nExecutives who aspire to lead companies and organizations would be well-served to closely study the character and characteristics of rising stars in different industries and professions, including politics. “Business leaders should be paying attention [to Crockett]. Her rise shows that clarity, courage, and cultural competence are not ‘nice-to-haves’—they’re leadership requirements in today’s world. When leaders show up as their full selves and speak with both heart and spine, they build trust, not just teams. They inspire followership rooted in authenticity, not fear,” Solomon concluded.\n\n“As a leader, Rep. Crockett is the embodiment of the shift that leadership has needed in politics and corporate America. She teaches at least three great leadership lessons that would help every business leader.” Sears of Sears Coaching noted.\n\n“Being a true leader is about advocating for people, speaking the truth, and leading with clarity.”\n\n“Leaders should hold each other accountable, as she does every time she speaks out about people on either side not staying true to their election promises.”\n\n“For true leaders, visibility is about being willing to take the heat for standing firm in your values, not just being seen providing lip service.”\n\n“As someone who doesn’t play it safe to maintain the [status] quo, Rep. Cockett proves that remaining true to yourself is true leadership. Her leadership style could be summed up as intelligence with integrity and intention,” Sears concluded.\n\nWhile it’s too soon to predict who will be the new face or faces of the Democratic Party, it’s not too early for company executives to start paying attention to the potential contenders and learning from their communication and leadership styles.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Right now, those people get a 32-pound box filled with items like cereal, canned soup and peanut butter each month. It’s unclear how or if those boxes will be delivered under the administration’s proposed replacement plan.\n\nOther proposed cuts to federal housing programs could affect all of the estimated 45,000 people in Orange County who currently tap federal dollars to help pay their monthly rent. About half of those people are 60 or older.\n\nAnd an initiative that aims to help lower-income seniors earn money so they rely less on the government – the Senior Community Service Employment Program – would be eliminated entirely. That program, according to the Trump plan, “is effectively an earmark to leftist DEI promoting entities like the National Urban League, the Center for Workforce Inclusion and Easter Seals.”\n\nNone of the proposed changes are set. The White House memo is a wish list, and details of the budget will need to be passed in the GOP-controlled Congress, probably this summer.\n\nBut political experts, nonprofit workers – even an older voter who describes himself as a Trump supporter – all say the White House and its supporters should be wary about that wish list. They say local politicians who support those cuts, and politicians who don’t do much to stave them off, risk walking into a political trap that’s snared others in the past: the ire of voters of a certain age.\n\n“Older people might be ready to get fired up,” said Jimmy Camp, a longtime political consultant in Orange who has worked with candidates across the political spectrum.\n\n“The conditions for it are there, for sure.”\n\nWhile the White House budget would trim everything from school lunches to clean water projects, many of the groups linked to those programs have little influence in GOP politics. Young children can’t vote, and their parents tend to vote for Democrats. Homeless people are infrequent voters. Climate scientists, physicists, entrepreneurs seeking federal health or research grants – all are relatively tiny voting blocs.\n\nBut seniors?\n\n“People my age, we vote,” said John Deal, an 81-year-old retired steel industry executive in Irvine.\n\n“And we don’t forget.”\n\nTribal politics\n\nOlder voters aren’t monolithic.\n\nIn November, nationally, voters ages 50 to 64 were far more likely to back Trump than were voters ages 65 and up, according to a post-election survey by AARP. The middle-age cohort chose Trump (56%) over Kamala Harris (43%), while the 65-and-up crowd split their vote, with 49% going to each candidate.\n\nIt’s unclear if that pattern held in Orange County, where 2024 vote results by age group aren’t yet publicly available.\n\nWhat is clear is that, politically speaking, local older voters tend to punch above their weight. Though people older than 65 account for about 17% of the county’s population, they’ve accounted for closer to 25%, or more, of all votes cast in recent elections.\n\nIt’s part of a long-term pattern. About 41% of county voters age 65 and up are so-called high-propensity voters, meaning they routinely turn out for most elections, according to Political Data Inc., which tracks voting trends in California. By comparison, about 27% of local voters ages 50 to 64 qualify as high propensity, something that’s true of 18% of voters age 35 to 49 and only 13% of voters 18 to 34.\n\nAll that means one thing: Older voters have the ability – and, according to Camp and others, the propensity – to respond to any perceived political slight by punching back.\n\n“(Older voters) are more affected personally by the things that affect their whole group,” Camp said.\n\nDeal, an older voter who identifies as a Trump supporter, agrees. He believes proposed spending cuts that touch lower-income older people could prompt a political response from local seniors of all economic means.\n\n“Look, I voted for Trump. I don’t necessarily love him, personally, but I support his ideas,” said Deal, who noted that he doesn’t tap into federal programs targeted by the White House but does use Social Security and Medicare.\n\nTaxes, Deal said, “should be lower.” And, in his view, federal spending “goes too far” on social programs.\n\n“But I play cards with people who feel differently. And I can see they’re already getting active, going to their (anti-Trump) marches and whatnot.\n\n“I bet these issues about federal programs will be pretty important for all the people running for Congress or even mayor.”\n\nIf federal programs are cut, and if there is a political backlash, it might be sparked more by facts on the ground than by age-oriented identity politics, say people who work with seniors and locals who work on the programs targeted by the White House.\n\n“The (Commodity Supplement Food Program) is used by people 60 or older, who qualify income-wise. It’s for everybody. And it’s in every community, from La Habra to San Clemente, and it largely follows Orange County demographics, with the exception that recipients are slightly more likely to be Asian and Pacific Islander than the county as a whole,” said Mark Lowry, director of Orange County Food Bank, which administers the Commodity Supplemental Food Program in Orange County.\n\n“But all of the people who get those boxes need to get them,” Lowry added.\n\n“It’s income-vetted and, I can tell you, it isn’t a luxury item.”\n\nThe 55-year-old program, initially launched as a way to boost agricultural interests, is now only for people 60 and older whose income is 150% or less of the local poverty rate. In Orange County, the monthly income thresholds to qualify for a food box are $1,957 for one person and $2,644 for a couple. About 109,000 people in California and roughly 707,000 around the country get food each month through the program.\n\nThough the White House wants to end the current food box program – saying it has been “misused for DEI and logrolling,” using terms that refer to diversity programs and political favor-swapping – it also hints at replacing it. The memo pitches the idea of using somebody other than nonprofits to deliver “MAHA food boxes,” referring to the federal “Make America Healthy Again” moniker. The memo adds that the boxes should go directly from farms to needy seniors.\n\nBut the White House memo also claims the switch would result in a $425 million savings for taxpayers. That number doesn’t include any cost that might be needed to come with a new distribution network for a new type of food box.\n\nIn a letter he wrote to other food bank operators who administer the food box program in counties around the country, Lowry suggested the White House proposal – if the administration is sincere about wanting to keep issuing food boxes – might actually result in taxpayers paying more in order to feed needy seniors.\n\n“The Administration claims a $425 million savings by eliminating CSFP,” Lowry wrote. “They provide no cost, however, related to their alternative for MAHA food boxes. The Administration proposes to substitute non-profits who engage volunteers who assemble CSFP food boxes with for-profit companies who will pay employees to package MAHA food boxes. It is reasonable to assume that the Administration is proposing a more costly model that will provide no savings for taxpayers.”\n\nThat pattern holds in other safety net changes suggested by the White House. Though the memo says taxpayers would save $163 billion, overall – even when mixing in spending increases for defense and immigration enforcement – there are no cost estimates for proposed replacements mentioned for at least some of the safety net programs.\n\n“The numbers don’t necessarily make sense,” Lowry said.\n\n“Some of this seems like it might backfire.”\n\nSurviving scrutiny\n\nThe backfire argument – the idea that budget cuts to social programs might actually mean a bigger tax bill rather than a smaller one, and that cuts to social spending would be a drag on the overall economy – is already part of the pushback that’s emerged in the days since the White House posted its budget memo.\n\n“Safety-net programs do much more than just alleviate individual hardships. They are economic engines… ” wrote Orange County Supervisor Doug Chaffee, chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, in a May 7 letter to Rep. Young Kim, R-Anaheim Hills, whose CA-40 district includes parts of Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties.\n\nIn the letter, Chaffee urged Kim to vote against any cuts to the federal food program SNAP (which was once known as Food Stamps and in California is known as CalFresh), and school-based nutrition programs. He referenced federal research that shows every $1 spent in SNAP benefits generates $1.80 in economic activity, and that every $1 billion spent by taxpayers to boost the SNAP program supports more than 13,000 jobs.\n\nKim also nudged further into the political pushback against White House budget priorities. Last month, she was one of a dozen GOP House members who signed a letter saying they won’t back steep cuts to Medicaid, an issue that could hamstring the push to reduce taxes and lower the budget, or risk taking health care and health insurance away from millions of lower-income Americans.\n\nAnd on May 8, Kim’s office issued a video showing her (gently) grilling Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent over proposed cuts to the Community Development Financial Institution, a program that provides credit and financial services to underserved communities.\n\nPart of their exchange went like this:\n\nRep. Kim: “I’d like to urge you to continue your support for CDFI. CDFI Fund programs are statutory, as you know, and this has been critical in promoting the local economy in Orange County. Do you still agree that the CDFI plan has a critical role to play in fostering economic opportunity?”\n\nSecretary Bessent: “We believe that if CDFI officials follow their statutory obligations and do not digress into more ideological boundaries, they can be important institutions.”\n\nWhat went unmentioned was the fact that the White House wants the program cut.\n\nIn its budget memo, the administration said it would end the CDFI program, in part because it believes that past CDFI grants “may have made race determinant of access to loan programs … and framed American society as inherently oppressive rather than fostering unity.”\n\nBut the biggest financial argument against the cuts might be about federal housing programs, particularly in Orange County and particularly as they relate to older people.\n\nThe White House projects that taxpayers would save around $34 billion if the federal government ended or trimmed a variety of federal housing programs. That’s a huge number. But senior advocates say those cuts almost certainly would mean more homelessness, and that numerous economic studies have shown that homelessness is, among other things, far more expensive than housing assistance.\n\n“The programs that they’re talking about cutting were set up for a reason. And even though there’s a lot of talk about how they’re wasteful or ineffective, when you look closely at what they do, you usually see something different. They work,” said Trinh Phan, director of state income security issues for Justice in Aging, a nonprofit that offers legal help to senior organizations.\n\n“Cutting rent subsidies will result in more people on the streets. It’s simple,” she added.\n\nAlready, the fastest growing demographic in Southern California homeless shelters is people ages 50 and older. And if housing vouchers go away, homeless retirees, as they’re often known, could become common in Orange County.\n\nThat, Phan said, will inspire a political response from older voters.\n\n“We’re already seeing a rise in senior homelessness. And that’s a very public issue; people see the homeless and it affects them,” Phan said. “And, beyond the morality of it, it’s much more expensive to try to help someone who is unhoused than it is to make sure they don’t become unhoused in the first place.\n\n“That could wake a lot of people up.”","summary":"Tens of thousands of lower-income people of a certain age rely on federal help for food and housing, among other things.

Officials in those traditionally four early-voting states are now positioning themselves to get top billing nearly two years before the Democratic National Committee solidifies the order. Others may make a play, too.\n\nIt’s a fraught choice for a party already wrestling with questions about its direction after losing November’s White House election to Republican Donald Trump. Each state offers advantages to different candidates and elevates or diminishes different parts of the Democratic base. \n\nFor now, 2028 prospects are making early-state visits, giving a glimpse into what they may see as their own path to the nomination.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker was the keynote speaker at a dinner last month for New Hampshire Democrats, visiting a majority white state known for its engaged electorate and independent streak. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the state’s first Black governor, will appear later this month at a similar party event in South Carolina, where Black voters are the party’s most influential voting group.\n\nPete Buttigieg will join a VoteVets Action Fund gathering in Iowa on Tuesday, marking the former presidential candidate’s first public in-person event since leaving his post as Biden’s transportation secretary. Buttigieg performed well in the 2020 caucuses, which were marred by technical glitches that prevented the declaration of a winner. \n\nIowa looks past snub for ‘fair’ shot in 2028\n\nBiden and others pushed to open the 2024 cycle with a more diverse state than traditional leadoff Iowa, which is 90% white, according to census data. \n\nGone was a five-decade institution of Iowa Democrats engaging in a one-night spectacle where community members publicly signaled their support for a candidate. Last year, they held caucuses eight days before any other state’s contest, as is required by Iowa law. But Democratic voters had cast their 2024 presidential preference ballots by mail, with results released that March on Super Tuesday alongside other states.\n\nBiden “picked the calendar that worked for him,” said Scott Brennan, who serves on the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee and previously chaired the Iowa Democratic Party. “When you’re the president, you can do those things. But I don’t know that people in Iowa thought it was very fair.”\n\nFor now, Iowa Democratic leaders emphasize that their focus is on the 2026 election, when two of Iowa’s four congressional districts will be competitive opportunities to unseat Republicans. Democrats have recently struggled on all electoral fronts in Iowa and have significantly diminished party registration numbers, which some blamed on the loss of the caucuses. \n\nBut Brennan said many Iowa Democrats continue to believe that the presidential nominating process is well served by Iowa’s early role in it, even if the 2028 format is up in the air.\n\n“We took everyone at their word that all bets are off for 2028,” Brennan said. “We expect that there will be a fair process and that we will be given every consideration to be an early state.”\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle was more blunt in proposing that the state party commit to first-in-the-nation status regardless, as he did as chair in 1984 when the national party threatened to upend Iowa and New Hampshire’s delegate selection process over noncompliance with timing rules. The two states formed an alliance, getting six of the presidential candidates on their side.\n\n“All we have to do is look at the Democratic National Committee and say, ‘Sorry, we’re going first,’” Nagle said. “It’s ours if we have the courage.”\n\nNew Hampshire survives threats after rebellion\n\nNew Hampshire rebelled in 2024, holding an unsanctioned primary in January. Biden did not put his name on the ballot or campaign there but won as a write-in.\n\nThree months later, the DNC dropped its threat to not seat the state’s national convention delegates.\n\nUntil Biden’s formal request of the DNC to approve his proposed calendar, New Hampshire Democrats thought they were in a good place with work behind the scenes, said the state party chairman, Ray Buckley. He said that effort will continue heading into 2028.\n\n“This is going to be much more of a level playing field,” Buckley said. “There’s no reason to come in with a two-ton thumb and put it on the scale.”\n\nIt does not hurt their case that New Hampshire law requires the primary to be scheduled before any other similar contest.\n\nKathy Sullivan, formerly a state party chair and member of the DNC’s rulemaking arm, said it is possible that the “train has left the station” for Iowa’s hope of returning to its first-place position, given the 2020 problems and the fact that it gave in to the DNC in 2024.\n\n“I don’t know if that helps them in terms of goodwill or hurts them in that they basically gave up the caucuses,” she said. “New Hampshire took the opposite tack, we had our primary despite what the DNC said, and our delegates ended up being seated despite the threats.”\n\nNever-first Nevada wants top billing\n\nDemocratic leaders in Nevada, which held its 2024 Democratic primary just days after South Carolina’s, have also been pushing to keep their state early in the nominating conversation, although the state’s location in the West has traditionally made it less-visited by White House hopefuls.\n\nIn a December statement, the state party chair, Daniele Monroe-Moreno, pointed to the state’s nonwhite population, union representation and education-level diversity as reasons for Nevada to kick off the 2028 calendar. Nevada is 30% Latino, census data shows, and has significant Black and Asian populations.\n\n“If Democrats want to win back working class voters and rebuild our broad coalition of voters of color, we should elevate the most working class and most diverse battleground state in the nation to be the first presidential preference primary for the 2028 cycle,” Monroe-Moreno said. \n\n“Nevada is the battleground state that best reflects our growing nation,” she said, and the party “cannot afford to let overwhelmingly college-educated, white or less competitive states start the process of winnowing the field again in 2028.”\n\nSouth Carolina seeks another go at No. 1\n\nAs the first-in-the-South primary state, where Black voters play a significant role in Democratic voting, South Carolina long promoted its role in picking a nominee after the first set of contests winnowed the field.\n\nBut Christale Spain, who is expected to win her second term as state party chair, said she will make the argument to national Democratic leaders that South Carolina should stay in the No. 1 slot.\n\n“It’s our plan to really work to stay first in the nation,” Spain said.\n\nAt the end of May, Moore is set to headline the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Dinner, a signature fundraiser that has recently hosted Democratic stars as its keynote speakers, including Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor and Biden energy secretary, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Raphael Warnock of Georgia. \n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris used her 2022 speech as an official “thank you” to South Carolina for providing the key primary support that revived Biden’s flagging 2020 presidential campaign after a series of losses in other early-voting states. \n\nSpain will have to make her argument anew without Biden in the White House and Jaime Harrison, a South Carolina native who recently ended his term as national Democratic chair, helming the party.\n\n“I think you get what you need from an electorate in South Carolina,” Spain said. “All those things matter the stuff that’s happening with the veterans, all our colleges and institutions, the role of Black folks in a Democratic primary.\n\n“We have more to offer than other states do,” she said.\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and Ramer from Concord, New Hampshire.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) Before they can name their next presidential nominee,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrats Must Select the First State to Vote Before Choosing Their 2028 Nominee first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democrats-must-select-the-first-state-to-vote-before-choosing-their-2028-nominee/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-Before-they-name-a-2028-nominee-Democrats.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 14:00:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.188},{"id":320185832,"title":"The insidious doublespeak of Trump’s freedom of ‘choice’","text":"Freedom of choice is a venerable American value. Donald Trump’s attachment to it is, however, highly selective.\n\nOver the first four months of his administration, Trump has been eagerly promoting the expansion of choice in our economic lives. That’s especially the case when it comes to our role as consumers. Think kitchens, baths and automobiles; the stated goal every time he talks about commodities has been increasing the number of options so we can select and buy what we like best – environmental effects notwithstanding. Even his tariffs are only supposed to bring temporary pain, as in emptier toy shelves, before American-made abundance starts to rule the day once again.\n\nIn our political lives, though, it’s a different story: the president and his administration have been busy instituting new restrictions on both the possibilities on offer and the picking itself. As citizens rather than consumers, we’ve been explicitly told our options are permanently contracting to “save our country”. No longer, for example, should it be possible to share “radical, anti-American ideologies” in our classrooms or decide how we want to be addressed.\n\nAs a result, our economic and political existences are now on rapidly diverging paths – with questions about what choice is good for, where it counts, and who is in charge of the menu at the core. What we are seeing is the emergence of a new kind of authoritarianism that still pays homage to libertarianism, but only in the realm of consumer choice.\n\nA choice explosion\n\nThere is a long backstory here. Ordinary people, wherever they found themselves in the world, once had many fewer choices to make than we typically do today – and they didn’t attach as much meaning to the act of choosing either. One of the things that made one free prior to the modern era was not having to make a lot of decisions about where to live, how to make money, whom to marry, what to own or which political philosophy to back.\n\nBut over the last two and a half centuries, the range of both options and opportunities for choice-making – from determining what to eat for lunch to deciding with whom to spend one’s days and nights – has increased exponentially. The categories of people given the formal power to exercise this kind of self-determination have expanded, too, even as the possibility of being able to use this power has remained wildly unevenly distributed. This isn’t just an American story either. Something similar has happened in countries around the globe that consider themselves capitalist democracies.\n\nThe roots of this choice explosion extend all the way to the 17th and 18th centuries. The expansion of global commerce in the first age of empire is one major source. That’s when advertisements and displays of new products in western European cities made use of increasing variety in goods, such as colored and patterned fabrics from south Asia, to develop the idea of consumer choice. The Reformation is another point of origin insofar as it shattered the unity of European Christendom, eventually putting religious and then intellectual choice on the table as well.\n\nShopkeepers, auctioneers, itinerant preachers and printers helped lead the way, alongside philosophers and novelists. We might think of all of those figures as early versions of what behavioral economists today call “choice architects”: people whose job is to construct the menus of options and, often without calling much attention to themselves, establish the rules for the game of selection. Their power, even when limited, stemmed from creating the conditions for the flourishing of what we have come to experience as the “freedom of choice”.\n\nBut it was the late 19th and 20th centuries that truly sped the process along, turning choice-making into a habitual part of life. Along with more to choose with every passing year came a mass movement towards imagining ones’ life story as constructed out of free choices made in our free time. Democracies were a final piece of the puzzle. Though the era of the American and French Revolutions had already established elections as vital to self-rule, after about 1870, one nation after another began instituting and standardizing technologies like the secret ballot that brought political determinations into line with a range of other individualized, preference-based activities.\n\nToday – at least in theory – we shop for goods, entertainments, courses of study and vacations. We pick our friends, lovers and life partners. We vote for our favorite candidates. We select where we want to live, what we want to do for a profession (though, exceptionally, not what we do when we are actually on the job), whether to have children, and even insurance plans to hedge our bets when facing situations beyond our control. Whole sciences explain how and why we choose what we do and with what consequences. The promise is that, with our own choices, we can get what we personally prefer. And we can be the autonomous people that we yearn to be.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that the proliferation of choice has been an unmitigated boon for humanity, as critics have pointed out repeatedly along the way. Voices on the right of the political spectrum have long bemoaned the way an emphasis on choice upends tradition, especially in the moral sphere – making almost every decision into a form of marketplace transaction in which individual taste rules the day. Many on the left have agreed to an extent, suggesting that modeling life on a shop window or bazaar – in which a product, human or otherwise, exists for every desire – leads to the obfuscation of deep inequalities of opportunity and the neglect of our obligations to each other along with the planet itself. They have also complained (quite rightly) that choice is always a lot less free, in the sense of unconstrained, than we might think.\n\nStill, “choice” has long been a favorite word on both sides of the aisle in US politics (and not least when the issue is contentious, like the future of healthcare). That helps explain why “the right to choose” seemed like a promising slogan in the early 1970s to abortion rights defenders who were eager to find an uncontroversial framing device for their advocacy work in the aftermath of Roe v Wade. Who could object to simply having more choices, especially when the promise was that one could pick in accord with one’s personal values and desires? From billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions, choice has come to stand for freedom itself. It is even a marker now on global happiness indexes; more of one means more of the other. Ever since the end of the second world war, this assumption has made our economic and political lives seem intrinsically linked.\n\nA shrinking political menu\n\nBut that isn’t where we are now. Despite its sporadic and often misleading appeal to the language of choice, the Trump administration is intent on undoing this historical pact between consumer and political choice and thus of a key element of the liberal paradigm. While expanding consumer options, or at least giving the impression this is the plan, this presidency is working hard to limit options in almost all other spheres.\n\nSomething similar is being attempted by many of Trump’s counterparts in other increasingly illiberal capitalist democracies, from Hungary to India, around the globe. (And perhaps this is not just a story about capitalist democracies – even China could now be understood as a nation in thrall to consumer choice at the expense of other forms of freedom.) But this disjunction is becoming especially pronounced in the US, where choice is continuing its ascent in one sphere (albeit within the constraints of an ever-changing policy on tariffs), just as it is being rapidly circumscribed, in both practice and lingo, in most others.\n\nWhen it comes to freedom of choice for consumers, which has long been offered up as the flip side of deregulation for industries, Trump and his minions are all in – at least rhetorically. They borrow cliches that are recognizable from 18th-century sales pitches promising “the greatest choices” in fabrics all the way to Milton and Rose Friedman’s bestselling 1980 book and TV series, Free to Choose. The argument is as much about personal liberty as economic benefit.\n\nRight off the bat, in his inaugural address this January, Trump promised Americans that he was ending the electric vehicle mandate, as well as the rest of Joe Biden’s environmental initiatives, not just to save the auto industry but also so “you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.” Consecutive executive orders have extended that same logic to appliances, lightbulbs, plumbing and even K-12 education. Undoing regulations that save water and energy and reduce global warming will “safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances”. Getting rid of “federal meddling” will also restore “shower freedom”, which depends upon Americans being “free to choose their showerheads”. As for schools, in which the right has long supported a voucher system so that families can select the educational approach they prefer in a marketplace that includes religious and for-profit along with public options, the executive order states: “Pres. Trump will provide every available opportunity for parents to enrich the education of their children through individual choice.”\n\n“Making America Great Again” thus turns out to be largely a promise about an odd kind of consumer paradise. It is not competitive pricing and affordability Trump is after. Nor is it safer or improved goods that would lead to better health and welfare. Rather, just having more options from which to pick is the new holy grail, whether we are talking about dishwashers or elementary schools. Never mind that high tariffs and protectionism will likely make everything more expensive or constrict the field of choice itself at least for a while, forcing parents to buy, in Trump’s words, “two dolls instead of 30”. In fact, under pressure from the business wing of his party, he’s already backed away from the most dramatic of these measures. In the Maga utopia, the deregulation of businesses, especially when it comes to abandoning rules about environmental concerns or racial equity or even corrupt practices, ultimately creates a cornucopia of possibilities for purchasers, who are going to be newly empowered to vote with their wallets for whatever products they like best. Consumer choice is recast as a fundamental right and freedom.\n\nYet apart from the arena of consumption, Trump is little invested in expanding individual, preference-based selection making. On the contrary, in the political sphere, the president seems to be looking to move the US in precisely the opposite direction. Even with falling approval ratings, he is still counting on considerable popular support for a vision of the world in which Amazon offers up thousands of potential possibilities, from movies to toasters, for our pleasure, but nativist chauvinism and a limited repertoire of Christian values curtail options and opportunities for choice in most other domains. He and his fans view it as the function of a strong executive to make both our reality.\n\nWhen it comes to things that don’t take the form of sellable commodities, the parallel framing around freedom as choice has all but disappeared from the vocabulary of this administration. It’s also fast disappearing from policy itself, as representatives of Trump’s brand of Republicanism challenge both the traditional understandings of executive power and constitutional protections around civil and political rights. The latter are precisely those rights outside the consumer sphere – such as religious rights, marriage rights, and rights to determine political representatives – that have been redefined as matters of choice ever since the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the aftermath of the second world war. This isn’t how they are being defined by the US government now.\n\nThe ability to make one’s own determinations in ideas, expression and ideology, despite some early Trump administration bromides about the importance of freedom of speech, is on the chopping block as a result of yet another set of executive orders and agency moves. That includes bans, wherever federal dollars or other forms of federal patronage are at stake, on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, the investigation of the climate crisis, the expression of pro-Palestinian sentiments, or the promotion of history, art or literature that runs counter to so-called “patriotic” education, among other topics. Such menu limitations are already being felt from classrooms and laboratories to federal agencies and cultural institutions, even as court challenges are growing in number. Restrictions on people’s choice of residency or travel are also more visible by the day, not least in the actions of Ice. Let’s not forget, either, new limits on options in our sexual and familial lives – such as efforts to further reduce abortion rights at the federal level and refusals to allow people to determine their own identities – especially when it comes to gender.\n\nThen there are efforts to curtail voting itself, which is the primary form of political choice. Kamala Harris tried during her brief presidential campaign last year to tie support for voting rights to abortion rights as similarly threatened “fundamental freedoms”, though the idea never gained much traction. This administration sees things differently.\n\nElections themselves are not likely to disappear entirely any time soon; almost every nation state in the world, no matter how dictatorial, continues to enable some form of voting by citizens. That’s because voting is so closely associated today with the idea that, in any legitimate state, the people’s interests need representation. Trump, moreover, likes to claim a popular mandate for his actions, even as he sometimes flirts with the idea that he is a “king” who is unbeholden to anyone but himself.\n\nStill, the Trump administration is already eagerly suggesting that elections won’t be happening in the same way as they once did, after long insisting that any Trump defeat would be a sure sign of election fraud, thus delegitimizing in advance all but one predetermined result. Indeed, as a slate of proposed new rules designed to actually discourage voting in future federal elections makes clear, much of his administration’s energy in these first months has gone into trying to find new ways to limit who has access to political or intellectual or even cultural choices; to take off the table or reduce rather than increase the set of options available; and to narrow the parameters within which choices can be made and registered. What other purpose could, say, new restrictions on the due dates for mail-in ballots in federal elections serve?\n\nEven the study of choice-making, one of the great developments of 20th-century social science including psychology and economics, is now being reduced by every means possible, from cuts to whole research-funding programs to the blockage of grants for projects making use of certain prohibited words.\n\nChoice architect in chief\n\nWhat Trump is doing is not so much abandoning the idea or practice of choice as making himself our nation’s premier “choice architect”. And he’s doing it – at the expense of both the other branches of government and much of the private sector – as part and parcel of the expansion of executive power. That is, he is using the authority of his position to grant the rest of us sets of approved options, from ideas to identities, but also continually reminding us that it is he, as the nation’s chief executive, who determines who gets to choose and how and when and where. Even threats of high tariffs are meant as leverage – pressure tools in a competitive environment, so that the president can tilt the field the way he likes and remake the set of options on behalf of the US consumer. (Artificial intelligence will surely help.)\n\nThis is a new, 21st-century form of authoritarianism marked by an enduring quasi-libertarian streak when it comes to consumption rather than citizenship. Of course, the freedom of the shopper has never been total freedom. It has always been shaped and bounded by multiple forces, from the interests of business owners and for-profit taste makers to the “nudges” characteristic of anonymous, technocratic policy making, such as using incentives to get people to willingly choose to save more for retirement. But over the last 75 years, much of this choice architecture has become both ubiquitous and invisible, with the promise that personal choice meant personal liberty and that freedom in one sphere would be matched by a similar form of freedom in another.\n\nThe age of choice isn’t fully going away any time in the near future. It is both too entrenched and too profitable. But in a sharp break from much of recent history, our political and economic lives seem to be heading in opposite directions: investment in consumer choice (even if tempered for now by tariffs) is expanding in the Trump era in part as cover for the fact that political choice, along with choice in how to think and live, is on a steep decline.\n\nSophia Rosenfeld is Annenberg professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Age of Choice: A History of Freedom in Modern Life (2025).","summary":"From showerheads to plastic straws, the president brags that he’s expanding options for consumers – while drastically restricting choices in almost all other spheres\n\nFreedom of choice is a venerable American value.

So there’s a lot of people that are like, you know what? Like, let’s go find the safest white boy we can find. I mean, I’m just saying.’\n\nWhile she did not say who ‘the safest white boy’ is, the Texas Democrat shared that the donors are backing one specific person.\n\n‘I can tell you that there is one specific candidate. I had a donor on the phones with me telling me that all the donors are lining up behind that candidate.

Officials in those traditionally four early-voting states are now positioning themselves to get top billing nearly two years before the Democratic National Committee solidifies the order. Others may make a play, too.\n\nIt's a fraught choice for a party already wrestling with questions about its direction after losing November's White House election to Republican Donald Trump. Each state offers advantages to different candidates and elevates — or diminishes — different parts of the Democratic base. \n\nFor now, 2028 prospects are making early-state visits, giving a glimpse into what they may see as their own path to the nomination.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker was the keynote speaker at adinner last month for New Hampshire Democrats, visiting a majority white state known for its engaged electorate and independent streak. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the state's first Black governor, will appear later this month at a similar party event in South Carolina, where Black voters are the party's most influential voting group.\n\nPete Buttigieg will join a VoteVets Action Fund gathering in Iowa on Tuesday, marking the former presidential candidate's first public in-person event since leaving his post as Biden's transportation secretary. Buttigieg performed well in the 2020 caucuses, which were marred by technical glitches that prevented the declaration of a winner. \n\nBiden and others pushed to open the 2024 cycle with a more diverse state than traditional leadoff Iowa, which is 90% white, according to census data. \n\nGone was a five-decade institution of Iowa Democrats engaging in a one-night spectacle where community members publicly signaled their support for a candidate. Last year, they held caucuses eight days before any other state's contest, as is required by Iowa law. But Democratic voters had cast their 2024 presidential preference ballots by mail, with results released that March on Super Tuesday alongside other states.\n\nBiden “picked the calendar that worked for him,” said Scott Brennan, who serves on the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee and previously chaired the Iowa Democratic Party. “When you’re the president, you can do those things. But I don’t know that people in Iowa thought it was very fair.”\n\nFor now, Iowa Democratic leaders emphasize that their focus is on the 2026 election, when two of Iowa’s four congressional districts will be competitive opportunities to unseat Republicans. Democrats have recently struggled on all electoral fronts in Iowa and have significantly diminished party registration numbers, which some blamed on the loss of the caucuses. \n\nBut Brennan said many Iowa Democrats continue to believe that the presidential nominating process is well served by Iowa’s early role in it, even if the 2028 format is up in the air.\n\n“We took everyone at their word that all bets are off for 2028,” Brennan said. “We expect that there will be a fair process and that we will be given every consideration to be an early state.”\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle was more blunt in proposing that the state party commit to first-in-the-nation status regardless, as he did as chair in 1984 when the national party threatened to upend Iowa and New Hampshire's delegate selection process over noncompliance with timing rules. The two states formed an alliance, getting six of the presidential candidates on their side.\n\n\"All we have to do is look at the Democratic National Committee and say, ‘Sorry, we’re going first,’\" Nagle said. “It’s ours if we have the courage.”\n\nNew Hampshire rebelled in 2024, holding an unsanctioned primary in January. Biden did not put his name on the ballot or campaign there but won as a write-in.\n\nThree months later, the DNC dropped its threat to not seat the state’s national convention delegates.\n\nUntil Biden’s formal request of the DNC to approve his proposed calendar, New Hampshire Democrats thought they were in a good place with work behind the scenes, said the state party chairman, Ray Buckley. He said that effort will continue heading into 2028.\n\n“This is going to be much more of a level playing field,” Buckley said. “There’s no reason to come in with a two-ton thumb and put it on the scale.”\n\nIt does not hurt their case that New Hampshire law requires the primary to be scheduled before any other similar contest.\n\nKathy Sullivan, formerly a state party chair and member of the DNC's rulemaking arm, said it is possible that the “train has left the station” for Iowa’s hope of returning to its first-place position, given the 2020 problems and the fact that it gave in to the DNC in 2024.\n\n“I don’t know if that helps them in terms of goodwill or hurts them in that they basically gave up the caucuses,” she said. “New Hampshire took the opposite tack, we had our primary despite what the DNC said, and our delegates ended up being seated despite the threats.”\n\nDemocratic leaders in Nevada, which held its 2024 Democratic primary just days after South Carolina's, have also been pushing to keep their state early in the nominating conversation, although the state’s location in the West has traditionally made it less-visited by White House hopefuls.\n\nIn a December statement, the state party chair, Daniele Monroe-Moreno, pointed to the state’s nonwhite population, union representation and education-level diversity as reasons for Nevada to kick off the 2028 calendar. Nevada is 30% Latino, census data shows, and has significant Black and Asian populations.\n\n“If Democrats want to win back working class voters and rebuild our broad coalition of voters of color, we should elevate the most working class and most diverse battleground state in the nation to be the first presidential preference primary for the 2028 cycle,” Monroe-Moreno said. \n\n“Nevada is the battleground state that best reflects our growing nation,\" she said, and the party \"cannot afford to let overwhelmingly college-educated, white or less competitive states start the process of winnowing the field again in 2028.”\n\nAs the first-in-the-South primary state, where Black voters play a significant role in Democratic voting, South Carolina long promoted its role in picking a nominee after the first set of contests winnowed the field.\n\nBut Christale Spain, who is expected to win her second term as state party chair, said she will make the argument to national Democratic leaders that South Carolina should stay in the No. 1 slot.\n\n“It’s our plan to really work to stay first in the nation,” Spain said.\n\nAt the end of May, Moore is set to headline the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Dinner, a signature fundraiser that has recently hosted Democratic stars as its keynote speakers, including Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor and Biden energy secretary, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Raphael Warnock of Georgia. \n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris used her 2022 speech as an official “thank you” to South Carolina for providing the key primary support that revived Biden's flagging 2020 presidential campaign after a series of losses in other early-voting states. \n\nSpain will have to make her argument anew without Biden in the White House and Jaime Harrison, a South Carolina native who recently ended his term as national Democratic chair, helming the party.\n\n“I think you get what you need from an electorate in South Carolina,\" Spain said. \"All those things matter — the stuff that’s happening with the veterans, all our colleges and institutions, the role of Black folks — in a Democratic primary.\n\n“We have more to offer than other states do,” she said.\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and Ramer from Concord, New Hampshire.","summary":"Democrats will pick their next presidential nominee in 2028, but before that happens, the party will have to decide which state gets to go first on the nominating calendar","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/2028-nominee-democrats-decide-state-weigh-121683990","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/35be26a9-5c4d-454b-ac85-ad6ddc33a6b2/wirestory_f4173356e5d79d32080271cfd5f5b353_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 12:41:21","author":"Hannah Fingerhut Associated Press,Holly Ramer Associated Press,Meg Kinnard Associated Press","authors":["Hannah Fingerhut Associated Press","Holly Ramer Associated Press","Meg Kinnard Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.221},{"id":320152150,"title":"Beyoncé’s Latest Album Soars As Her Tour Kicks Off","text":"Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter surges on the Billboard 200, Top Country Albums, and Americana/Folk charts ...

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nBeyoncé kicked off her Cowboy Carter Tour on April 28 in Inglewood, just outside of Los Angeles, CA. The superstar is scheduled to perform to massive crowds across the United States, with a few stops in Europe, throughout the summer. In each location, she's headlining more than one date — and in cities like New York, London, and Atlanta, she's playing four or more nights as hundreds of thousands turn out for the concert trek\n\nAs excitement around the Cowboy Carter Tour grows, the singer herself, as well as the Cowboy Carter album, are both gaining ground on the Billboard charts.\n\nCowboy Carter Surges on Three Billboard Charts\n\nCowboy Carter is present on three Billboard charts this week, and it is rising on each and every one of them. In some instances, the project moves up just a few spots, while in other cases, it leaps more than 100 spaces.\n\nThe full-length returns to the top 10 on the Top Americana/Folk Albums chart, jumping from No. 15 to No. 8. It also nears that region on the Top Country Albums list, galloping from No. 35 to No. 14.\n\nBeyoncé’s latest studio effort enjoys its greatest gain on the Billboard 200, the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed albums in America. On that roster, Cowboy Carter rockets from No. 193 to No. 64.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMicrosoft Confirms New Free Update Deadline For Windows Users\n\nWWE Backlash 2025 Results, Winners And Grades On May 10\n\nWWE Backlash 2025 Results: John Cena Topples Randy Orton In St. Louis\n\nSales and Streams of Cowboy Carter Grow\n\nLuminate reports that total consumption of Cowboy Carter is up dramatically from the prior frame, which makes sense, thanks to the beginning of the Cowboy Carter Tour. Last week, Beyoncé’s full-length shifted a little more than 8,300 equivalent units. During the most recent tracking stretch, it moved nearly 14,500 units between sales and streaming activity. That’s a 70-plus-percent gain from one frame to the next. Almost 1,000 of those 14,000-plus units were pure sales.\n\nBeyoncé’s Year-Plus on the Billboard Charts\n\nCowboy Carter has now spent 57 weeks on both the Top Country Albums and Top Americana/Folk Albums charts. It hasn’t racked up quite as much time on the Billboard 200, which is a much more competitive ranking. This time around, the title celebrates its forty-fourth turn on that list. It has previously reigned on all three rankings, as Queen Bey almost always conquers a Billboard list when she has a new project to share.\n\nBeyoncé’s Renaissance Also Rises\n\nThe Cowboy Carter tour setlist is, of course, centered largely around the album with which it shares its name. But Beyoncé also incorporates a number of songs from her last album, Renaissance. That project is also growing, although it only appears on one Billboard list. Renaissance steps up from No. 8 to No. 5 on the Top Dance Albums chart this frame.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter surges on the Billboard 200, Top Country Albums, and Americana/Folk charts after her tour kicks off.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2025/05/11/beyoncs-latest-album-soars-as-her-tour-kicks-off/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67f7d14477ede58317ae01a9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 12:00:00","author":"Hugh McIntyre,Justin Sullivan,Senior Contributor","authors":["Hugh McIntyre","Justin Sullivan","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.222},{"id":320121636,"title":"Media can blur faces, but not the effects of illegal immigration","text":"That’s why Texas’s efforts to bus illegal immigrants to the blue “sanctuary” cities in recent years were so successful. For New York, Denver, and the District of Columbia, the immigration issue was no longer about faceless abstractions in far-off flyover country. Suddenly, the problems that come with mass migration were both very clear and very present to them.\n\nIt worked — illegal immigration leapt to the top of voters’ concerns in the 2024 presidential election. And throughout the chaos of that time, with the Pelosi coup and then-Vice President Kamala Harris’s repeated reinventions, former and future President Donald Trump never wavered. He pledged to remove the criminal illegal immigrants who are terrorizing U.S. communities.\n\nNow he’s keeping his promises — and keeping the focus on the real criminal illegal immigrants and their real victims.\n\nThe Trump administration is right to adopt this strategy as its own. The more the public knows about the criminals being deported, the more they support the deportations.\n\nStill, CBS was outraged.\n\n“The booking photos, which the White House says show noncitizens in the country illegally, are displayed in a way that they will show up in television appearances by White House journalists and administration officials from the North Lawn,” the outlet reported. “CBS News has not been able to independently verify the White House statements about the individuals in the photos.”\n\nIn fact, the White House made sure that enough information was available on each of the cases it highlighted with those signs to confirm the details.\n\nMSNBC had a full-on meltdown.\n\n“They put them up on the driveway of the White House,” one anchor said. “… It’s right directly behind the positions where TV correspondents do their hits from the White House lawn. So no matter what network you’re on, that includes MSNBC, those pictures will be behind you.”\n\nWe need this same reminder with sheriffs and local law enforcement across Texas.\n\nThree months ago, the Florida Sheriffs Association announced that every county jail throughout the state had signed a written agreement with ICE to ensure compliance with 287(g) program requirements. The 287(g) program, also known as the Immigrant Enforcement Program, allows local law enforcement to partner with ICE to enforce federal immigration laws. In Florida, every county is working with ICE to ensure there are ICE-deputized sheriffs’ deputies and correctional officers in all county jails.\n\nIn Texas, not so much. A month after Florida had statewide participation, the legislative chairman of the Sheriffs’ Association of Texas gave excuses as to why Texas sheriffs had not done the same, claiming budget constraints and other reasons for not voluntarily participating. Apparently, many Texas law enforcement officers are only willing to do their jobs when tied to more state funding.\n\nThis has caused the Texas legislature to propose legislation intended to force sheriffs to participate in the ICE 287(g) program, which law enforcement already has the authority to do voluntarily.\n\nMaybe instead, we should post signs depicting dangerous serial offenders, repeatedly released back into the community, next to sheriffs’ offices and on the local courthouse lawn. We can name and shame the judges and sheriffs in the nation who refuse to cooperate with ICE to keep our country safe.\n\nNOT ALL IMMIGRATION IS EQUAL\n\nICE cannot do this job alone — it needs the cooperation of local and state law enforcement, including, and especially, in Texas.\n\nThose signs on the White House lawn forced the media to confront the reality of illegal immigration. Texas Senate Bill 8 could force recalcitrant law enforcement agencies to do the same. And we’ll all be safer for it.\n\nRobert Henneke is the executive director and general counsel at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.","summary":"Producers at CBS, CNN and MSNBC took the time to blur the faces of child rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals whose details were posted on signs lining the lawn at the White House last week.

I want to see her boobs.” The AI chatbot then appeared to respond to the request, generating an edit depicting the woman in a bra, and shared the edited image within the same thread.\n\nBy sharing the edited image within the thread, the Grok ethics loophole didn’t just allow nefarious users to see the images, but appeared to show them publicly to anyone digging through the responses to a post.\n\nX’s AI tool is known for its more lax restrictions, initially designed to give the bot a sense of humor. And the “undress” prompts are not the first time the chatbot has come under fire.\n\nPreviously, for example, the AI was criticized for responding to requests to create depictions of politicians wearing bikinis. While many AI platforms refuse to generate images of recognizable people or copyrighted characters, Grok has fewer restrictions in place.\n\nFollowing the report of the bot responding to requests to undress, however, it appears that Grok has at least one more guardrail in place. On images posted after May 07, the AI now responds to similar requests with “I can’t help with that.”\n\nWhile X appears to have added “undress” prompts to Grok’s list of restrictions, the loophole highlights one of the dangers with generative AI: users will probably find ways around restrictions to use AI in unethical ways.\n\nEarlier versions of Grok, for example, reportedly generated images of former US Vice President Kamala Harris wearing a bikini, an ethics loophole that Grok had reportedly fixed.\n\nBut if the AI already added a loophole not to show presidential candidates and celebrities in bikinis, why didn’t those same restrictions apply to editing an image of any recognizable person?\n\nOutside of the AI responding to inappropriate requests to create nonconsensual sexual imagery, the incidents also highlight a potential pitfall for Grok’s recent ability to respond in threads to questions tagged with @grok.\n\nThe social platform started rolling out the ability to ask Grok questions in comments in March. The AI doesn’t always respond (and won’t with certain privacy settings). But, when it does, the AI posts publicly viewable posts in the threads.\n\nNefarious users will probably always find a way around AI restrictions, but giving an AI autonomy to respond to posts publicly opens up the possibility that those unethical images will reach beyond just the user who typed in the prompt.\n\nThe feature is perhaps a funny tool when asking an AI if the moon is really made out of cheese, but in the case of the “undress” fiasco, it also allowed the ethically lax AI to publicly post an edited image it shouldn’t have generated in the first place.\n\nYou may also like…\n\nRead up on how to spot an AI-generated image.","summary":"X's AI bot didn't just respond to a request it shouldn't have –it shared the resulting image","url":"https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/social-media/remove-her-clothes-groks-latest-ai-fiasco-illustrates-one-of-the-key-dangers-of-an-autonomous-ai","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Feu6teFXPkiRwMTSpSmX6i.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 09:15:00","author":"Hillary K.

Charlie Baker who is running for governor as a Republican, has faced backlash for telling a local Republican town committee earlier this year that he did not vote for Trump or Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nBut on the flip side, he was quickly labeled “MAGA Mike Kennealy” by the Massachusetts Democratic Party as part of a strategy to tie any Republican running for office in 2026 to the president in the hopes that left-leaning independent voters will walk away from them.\n\nInside the Massachusetts Republican Party, voters are arguing about just how close they want their candidate to be to Trump. Some say that Republicans running for office must at least acknowledge what they consider to be accomplishments by the Trump administration this year.\n\nOthers counter that sidestepping Trump — or ignoring him completely — is the only way to draw in unenrolled voters who are no fans of Trump but are also not happy with Democrats’ iron-clad grip on the Legislature, Congressional seats, and constitutional offices in Massachusetts.\n\nJohn Deaton, who ran last year as a Republican against U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said there are many moderate Democrats who feel disenfranchised in Massachusetts because the party is “too far left.”\n\nRepublicans, he said, should be working to convince them to vote for their candidates.\n\nDeaton faced pushback during his campaign last year for holding some stances that the right wing of the Republican Party disliked. He also admitted during the course of his run against Warren that he has “never been a Trump voter.”\n\nBut he still considers himself a “center-right person.”\n\n“We live in Massachusetts, and are you really going to take the position that because you think I’m not conservative enough, that there’s no difference between me and Ed Markey or me and Elizabeth Warren? That is a foolish, quite frankly idiotic position to take,” Deaton told the Herald in an interview this past week.\n\nDeaton earned 40% of the 3.5 million votes cast in his race against Warren, or 114,137 more than Trump earned in his matchup against former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to certified election data from Secretary of State William Galvin’s office.\n\nRepublicans who want candidates to acknowledge or further embrace Trump’s ideology often point to the gains that he made in Massachusetts last year compared to his election in 2020.\n\nHe won 87 cities and towns in the state last year, including 33 that had gone for President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nBut conservative candidates in Massachusetts, especially those running for governor or other statewide offices, are expected to face a difficult road.\n\nThe Trump factor poses only one hurdle — political hopefuls are also dealing with fundraising and name recognition challenges, according to experts who previously spoke to the Herald.\n\nWendy Wakeman, a veteran Republican political strategist, said she agrees that the “never Trumpers” and the “MAGA MAGAs” of the Massachusetts Republican Party need to unify.\n\nShe also said a candidate does not necessarily need to swear loyalty to Trump, but they must be able to talk about him without fear.\n\n“They tend to pull us apart, and that’s not good,” she said of the two wings of the MassGOP. “… I’m not saying that you have to be a Trump loyalist in order to carry the banner for our party in 2026, but you must be able to acknowledge that the national Republican leader of the party is doing a heck of a job.”\n\nDeaton, who is weighing another challenge to U.S. Sen. Ed Markey in 2026, said a Republican candidate should not run against Trump but should run on the same principles as the president.\n\n“Here in Massachusetts, you have to thread the needle,” he said.","summary":"To MAGA or not to MAGA?

Mungkin juga jika tercetus kerjasama UMNO dan PH pada pilihan raya negeri (PRN) Sabah tidak lama lagi adalah bayangan bentuk kerjasama menjelang PRU16 nanti. \n\n Namun, ramai juga penyokong UMNO kurang berpuas hati senario bersama dengan PH, walaupun Ahli Parlimen UMNO diberi portfolio penting jawatan Kabinet kerana didakwa sentiasa dibayangi keegoan DAP. \n\n Pikat pengundi bukan Melayu\n\n Perikatan Nasional (PN), iaitu seteru utama UMNO sudah memulakan langkah menempuh PRU16 dengan Presiden BERSATU, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin dengan kenyataan mengetepikan perjuangannya untuk Melayu sahaja. Strateginya adalah untuk memikat pengundi bukan Melayu yang gagal dilaksana GERAKAN.\n\n Begitu juga kenyataan supaya UMNO dan BERSATU bergabung adalah usaha memerangkap UMNO dengan naratif pemimpin UMNO tidak berminat bergabung demi kepentingan Melayu.\n\n Namun, hakikatnya kenyataan BERSATU tidak lagi mengutamakan Melayu sahaja dan mahu pula bergabung dengan UMNO adalah bertentangan antara satu sama lain.\n\n Jika ditinjau salah satu acara sambutan Hari UMNO Ke-79 ialah konvokesyen kumpulan pertama pelajar dari Sekolah Patriotik UMNO (SPU) yang digelar sebagai Pelajar Patriot Kohort 1 merangkumi 49 anak muda berumur dari 16 hingga 33 tahun.\n\n Melalui pembelajaran SPU, UMNO menabur pelaburan terhadap masa depan demi melahirkan ahli setia kepada perjuangan parti dan berani berjuang dengan gaya lebih intelek.\n\n Hakikatnya, bagaimana UMNO bangkit daripada kekalahan PRU14 melalui MN dan selepas PRU15 menubuhkan Kerajaan Perpaduan serta menjadi tunggak utama kerajaan ia semua melalui strategi pemimpin UMNO, bukannya datang bergolek. \n\n Sebab itu sudah dijangkakan pemimpin UMNO pasti siap merangka strategi menghadapi PRU16 kerana matlamat akhir parti ini adalah untuk menjadi parti dominan pascapilihan raya seperti kedudukan PH selepas PRU15.\n\n Kritikal bagi UMNO untuk menjadi parti dominan kerana ia memberi peluang mewarnai bentuk kerajaan bakal dibentuk.\n\n UMNO belajar daripada strategi PAP yang sering melakukan perubahan mengikut kehendak selera pengundi. PAP tidak mahu menjadi seperti Golkar dan Demokrat yang kuat satu ketika tetapi enggan berubah, akhirnya dihukum pengundi.\n\n Latih pemimpin lebih awal\n\n Perdana Menteri Singapura, Lawrence Wong adalah daripada kumpulan pemimpin generasi keempat (4G) dilatih dari awal untuk mengambil alih apabila penyandang sebelumnya, Lee Hsien Loong berundur. \n\n Sebab itu dikaitkan hala tuju UMNO pasca-79 tahun dengan kewujudan SPU yang bukan sahaja menumpukan perkaderan ahli muda UMNO, bahkan landasan latihan untuk melahirkan pemimpin generasi baharu terutama sekali daripada sayap Pemuda dan Puteri. \n\n Seperti PAP melatih pemimpin pelapis secara sistematik, UMNO juga menjurus ke arah itu melalui landasan latihan dan menyiap pemimpin akan datang secara holistik.\n\n Bukan sahaja pemimpin UMNO diasuh mengenai sejarah perjuangan UMNO pra dan pasca-Persekutuan Tanah Melayu merdeka, bahkan perihal mencakupi semua bidang termasuk geopolitik, teknologi, alam sekitar, perundangan dan sosial budaya.\n\n Contoh mudah bagaimana UMNO melalui SPU mahu mendidik pemimpin mereka adalah apabila penyokong tegar Donald Trump, iaitu Tucker Carlson menuduh Kamala Harris secara semberono kononnya mempunyai darah kacukan Malaysia dan Samoa, jawapan sinis Menteri Luar, Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan yang berseloroh jika Harris melawat Malaysia, nasi goreng USA akan dihidangkan. \n\n Begitu juga apabila pengulas politik Bill O'Riley mempersenda lawatan Presiden Xi Jinping ke Malaysia, pemimpin politik tidak boleh melenting, tetapi membuat komen balas sinis kerana O'Riley sebenarnya tidak mampu membezakan antara maksud 'Malays' dan 'Malaysian'. \n\n Umur 79 tahun bagi sebuah organisasi adalah usia matang yang seharusnya selari dengan kematangan ahli organisasi berkenaan. Pemimpin UMNO bukan sahaja merancang strategi menghadapi PRU16, tetapi lebih kritikal ialah UMNO memandang jauh ke hadapan bagaimana untuk menjadi dominan sekali lagi. \n\n Penulis adalah Felo Majlis Profesor Negara dan Akademi Penyelidikan Nusantara NASR\n\n Semua artikel penulis tamu adalah pendapat peribadi, bukan pendirian rasmi BH","summary":"Antara empat parti politik tertua Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapura dan Thailand, UMNO dan Demokrat Thailand dianggap parti tertua jiran terdekat ASEAN kerana sudah menjangkau 79 tahun.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/rencana/lain-lain/2025/05/1394718/umno-perlu-bina-barisan-pelapis-untuk-kembali-jadi-parti-dominan","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/umnopelapis_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1746947005.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 07:03:33","author":"Azmi Hassan","authors":["Azmi Hassan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.763},{"id":320150278,"title":"‘Put portraits of Trinidad and Tobago’s first PM in every school’","text":"REGINALD VIDALE, chairman of the Dr Eric Williams Memorial Committee, wants portraits of Trinidad and Tobago’s first prime minister Dr Eric Williams to be placed in every school in the country.\n\nHe was delivering remarks at the committee’s 44th anniversary wreath-laying ceremony to commemorate Dr Williams’ passing at the Milford Road Esplanade, Scarborough, Tobago, on May 10.\n\nWilliams, who was also Trinidad and Tobago’s first chief minister and premier, died on March 29, 1981.

Dismissing the reports, Biden said, “They are wrong,” and insisted his final months in office were effective. “I think I did a pretty damn good job the last six months,” he added.Reflecting on the 2024 election, Biden expressed disappointment over Kamala Harris’ defeat to Trump and claimed that sexism and racism played a significant role in the outcome. “They went the sexist route,” Biden remarked, criticizing what he described as a persistent effort to undermine the idea of a multiracial woman leading the country.Despite not running, Biden asserted that he could have beaten Trump had he stayed in the race, noting that the election was not a guaranteed win for either side. Trump secured victory through tight margins in critical swing states like Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Biden’s decision to bow out came after months of mounting concerns over his age and a widely panned debate performance in June 2024.

You can help by going back to sleep!” \n\nBut wait, there’s more: The former president said he’s writing a book. \n\nWe’ve heard it all before, so here are likely chapter headings: \n\n“My son did nothing wrong.” \n\n“I beat Corn Pop, a really bad dude.” \n\n“Did you know I grew up in Scranton and we had a kitchen table?” \n\nTo complete the nightmare, the TV segment featured another unwelcome reminder of the last four years: Jill Biden grabbing the microphone to defend him when the former president couldn’t defend himself. \n\nAsked about coming books that promise to reveal how aides hid his cognitive decline, she insisted the authors “didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day.” \n\n“I mean, he’d get up, he put in a full day, and then at night he would, I’d be in bed, you know, reading my book, and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff,” she said.\n\n“I mean, it was nonstop.” \n\nNobody alive believes that, or another dishonest claim he offered. \n\n“The only reason I got out of the race was because I didn’t want to have a divided Democratic Party,” Biden said. \n\n“It’s a simple proposition. I thought it was better to put the country ahead of my interest, my personal interest.” \n\nThe segment did succeed in one sense: It illustrated how unfit Biden was and why Donald Trump swept the election. \n\nBut Biden wouldn’t concede anything, saying he wasn’t surprised that Vice President Kamala Harris lost because, he falsely claimed, Trump “went the sexist route” against her and suggested “a woman of mixed race” couldn’t lead the country. \n\nThere you have it: We’re back to racist, sexist “deplorables” again. \n\nBiden’s pathetic effort to rewrite history is a grim reminder that, six months after the election, Democrats are manically searching for someone to lead the resistance to Trump. \n\nWith no obvious savior among blue-state governors or in Congress, their desperation is leading them to grabsp at straws. \n\nWho will lead Dems? \n\nCould Bernie Sanders, who isn’t even a Democrat, be the answer? \n\nHow about his traveling companion, AOC? \n\nNot a chance. \n\nThey are relishing their private jet rides too much to concede they are living like the oligarchs they claim to hate. \n\nHow about Harvard University, which is suing the Trump administration over its withholding of federal grants? \n\nThe suit captured the attention of The New York Times, which declared it was inspiring other colleges to fight back. \n\nBut that bubble quickly burst as Harvard released a report documenting widespread anti-semitism on its campus and its president said he agreed with Trump that the Ivy League school has a serious culture problem. \n\nSo the Times quickly moved on to hoping the new pope will be the antidote to the president it hates. \n\n“Pontiff May Provide Contrast to Trump on U.S. Values,” a recent headline said. \n\nTalk about strange bedfellows. \n\nThe Times and its progressive staff routinely scorn Catholicism and religion in general, so that marriage can’t last. \n\nIn truth, the problem is not who will lead the party, but what does the party stand for. \n\nAlthough there’s obvious appeal to finding a star headliner, no one person can pull the Dems out of the ditch. \n\nBiden didn’t get them there alone, and, given his brain fog, wasn’t even the leader of his administration. \n\nThe real culprits are the Obama-era activists who pushed to open the border, created the wildly expensive green new scams and force-fed the nation a diet of racial and gender hogwash. \n\nNone of those things enjoyed broad public support, yet backing them without reservation became a litmus test for Dems across America. \n\nThe only consistency to the Biden regime was the dictum to “shut up and vote” for whatever garbage it proposed. \n\nAnd the party saluted and did. \n\nRemember when the Georgia law requiring voter ID was the new Jim Crow? \n\nOddly, that sordid history points the way to the future. \n\nAnyone who aims to be a Dem leader must concede the party lost its way and egregiously overreached. \n\nHe or she must also disavow the suspicion it aims to become a full socialist party, which is the path former liberal parties in Europe are following. \n\nParty of elites \n\nThe leader who dares to take those positions may or may not become the boss, but such moves could begin a chain reaction that will allow center-left reformers to set a realistic agenda for America’s working and middle classes. \n\nTrump’s genius was that he remade the GOP to represent those forgotten Americans. \n\nIt is now the nation’s Main Street party, with an America First agenda, while the Dems are the party controlled by coastal and global elites. \n\nEven freed from Biden, its agenda is dominated by embracing criminal illegal migrants, protecting a bloated government workforce and refusing to consider tax cuts or reductions in federal spending. \n\nNone of that makes a whit of sense to most Americans. \n\nAs an example of how the parties have switched priorities and identities, think back to last year’s conventions. \n\nTeamsters President Sean O’Brien gave a long, passionate speech at the Republican gathering in Milwaukee in which he criticized many of the corporate leaders backing Trump. \n\nHe said later that while some in Trump’s camp wanted him to soften his remarks, Trump told him to say whatever he wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, O’Brien did not speak at the Dem convention in Chicago and said he wasn’t even invited. \n\nHe told Tucker Carlson in an interview that in his meeting with Kamala Harris, she refused to answer many of his policy questions, left after just 15 minutes and said angrily she would win with or without his union’s support. \n\nNone of this means the GOP has a glide path to the next election, let alone the next generation. \n\nTrump is being tested by events and has admitted frustration over being unable to stop Russia’s war with Ukraine and make headway on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\nMuch of the global economy is slowing as he implements tariffs and an unusual level of staff turnover and leaks are undercutting the image of an efficient White House. \n\nStill, he’s setting the table for big economic and culture gains while Dems still don’t know what they stand for — or even where the table is.","summary":"Many Democrats are no doubt convinced they ha’ve suffered enough, but fate seems to believe otherwise.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/10/opinion/michael-goodwin-biden-defending-his-presidency-even-has-the-dems-wanting-him-to-go-away/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/former-u-s-president-joe-102795134_11a8fb-e1746923904522.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 01:38:55","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.614},{"id":320018804,"title":"Trump is already playing with fire with his tariff plan— adding a tax hike could mean GOP civil war","text":"Donald Trump was already playing with economic fire with his tariff plan, something that is all but certain to stoke some degree of inflation, and slow the economy at least in the short term. \n\nSo why would he threaten to throw gasoline on the blaze over his weird flirtation with a millionaire’s tax, something that will divide the slim GOP majorities in the House and Senate, and imperil his big beautiful budget that includes much-needed tax-cut extensions to counter the economic drag of his tariff plan? \n\nIt’s a question I keep hearing from my GOP donor sources in the aftermath of some Trump weirdness in recent days, including pushing House Speaker Mike Johnson to include something in his budget increasing the top rate to 39.6% from 37% on individuals earning $2.5 million and above. \n\nThe culprits of this machination, they say, are the people in the MAGA wing of the party. \n\nThose include the Wall Streeter-turned-populist Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, trade hawk Peter Navarro and even JD Vance, the VP who was once a Silicon Valley financier but has remade himself into a champion of the working man.\n\n(People close to Vance say he’s not involved in this debate.) \n\nThese are the people who are said to be hawks on trade that upended the markets and signaled economic gloom before cooler heads like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent started to cut deals. \n\nBut don’t blame the so-called messengers on trade or taxes. \n\nIf you hate this stuff, remember it’s Trump who gives them their marching orders. \n\nAs a person close to Trump told me: “To pay for middle- and working-class tax cuts, this is reasonable populism given it only affects individuals making $2.5 million-plus.” \n\nI know it’s hard to feel sorry for these GOP donor fat cats, but truth be told, they’re not complaining about their own personal finances. \n\nYes, they make a lot of money and can afford one less nanny. \n\nRepublican civil war \n\nTheir worry is the potential of a gut-wrenching intraparty fight if Trump keeps pushing the tax increases on top of his tariffs that many Republicans can’t stand. \n\nIt would spark a GOP civil war on a matter that seemed to be settled science for the party for decades. \n\nThat would be tax increases on the rich don’t help anyone, even the intended beneficiaries. \n\nIn fact, they even hurt. \n\nVeteran investor and market maven Doug Kass did a quick, back-of-the-envelope analysis, explaining it this way: “There are 70,000 US households that make over $2.5 million annually.” The proposed increase of 2.5% translates into maybe tens of billions of extra tax revenues for the US Treasury “assuming each family makes $2.5 million.” \n\nKass added that “obviously there are much higher earners, but not that many.” \n\nPlus what’s a few billion dollars compared to an annual deficit of $2 trillion? \n\nThat’s right. \n\nTaxing the fat-cat class doesn’t generate enough revenue to pay for the stuff Trump intends to fund. \n\n(No tax on tips, etc.) \n\nIt also screws with successful small businesses that file taxes as individuals. \n\nThese taxes hurt growth because rich people and small businesses will spend less. \n\nAnd they make a mockery of what nearly every Republican and their vaunted supply-side punditry on cable news has preached since Ron-ald Reagan. \n\nRecall what happened to George H.W. Bush, who ran on a no-new-taxes pledge, reneged on his promise, then lost to Bill Clinton in 1992. \n\nHere’s why this is now even more dangerous for the Republicans and Trump himself. \n\nThey need the new budget to include the tax cut because without it, the American people will face two tax increases. \n\nTariffs on all imported goods that are going to get more expensive no matter what deals are cut is the first tax increase. \n\nThen throw in the expiration of the Trump 1 tax cuts if the GOP is distracted by a messy civil war over its Trump-forced inclusion of the millionaire’s tax. \n\nThat’s when you get your double-tax whammy. \n\nBased on everything I’m hearing from my sources in DC, such division is exactly what will happen since so many GOP lawmakers including most of the Senate Republicans just won’t vote for a budget that includes this stuff. \n\nThen the fun begins for the Dems, as many are now predicting. \n\nThe GOP could lose its majorities in the midterms — and a Dem majority in the House will mean Trump gets impeached again. \n\nThe Trump policies that involve cultural and security issues will be placed on the back burner; you could see the return of DEI, maybe open borders. \n\nPlus, nothing gets done, while a Republican president gets blamed for the economic hit that two tax increases will likely create. \n\nA DeSantis 2nd act? \n\nPresident JD Vance? \n\nNot a prayer. \n\nThe Trump-Vance coalition just squeaked by the bumbling Kamala Harris, who was left with the noxious economic baggage of Joe Biden to defend, namely inflated prices and low -wages for average Americans. \n\nThe GOP better hope for a return of Ron DeSantis, who if you haven’t noticed, has been quiet through all the nonsense of tariffs and taxes, or Gavin Newsom might be our next president. \n\nThe good news: It seems unlikely at press time if Speaker Johnson will include the millionaire’s tax in the House budget proposal; it’s not in the early draft of his “big beautiful bill.” \n\nThe bad news: What I just outlined is something that Trump apparently doesn’t appreciate. Even after pushback from allies like Ted Cruz, he posted on Truth Social on Friday the following mess of contradictions about the tax hike: “In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!” \n\nTalk about leadership!","summary":"Donald Trump was already playing with economic fire with his tariff plan, something that is all but certain to stoke some degree of inflation, and slow the economy at least in the short term.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/10/business/trump-is-already-playing-with-fire-with-his-tariff-plan-adding-a-tax-hike-could-mean-gop-civil-war/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/trump-robin-hood-peter-navarro-104190165.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 01:28:04","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":320021484,"title":"Sen. Ruben Gallego Boasts About Using Filibuster To Block Trump Agenda After Campaigning To Abolish It","text":"BUCKS COUNTY, Pennsylvania — Democratic Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego reassured a crowd of left-wing voters at a Pennsylvania Democratic-party sponsored town hall Saturday afternoon that Senate Democrats are using the filibuster to block GOP legislation whenever possible.\n\nGallego, who is viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party due to winning a competitive race in a state President Donald Trump won last November, traveled to another crucial battleground state with a message of broadening the party’s tent in order to win back power in Washington. He boasted about using the filibuster to tank GOP legislation when asked by an attendee what Senate Democrats had in their toolkit to fight President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. (RELATED: ‘The Hypocrisy Is The Point’: Kyrsten Sinema Is Having The Last Laugh On The Filibuster)\n\n“Some of the things that are pissing you guys off the most aren’t even going through the Senate,” Gallego said regarding cuts by the president’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Normally … DOGE would actually run their cuts through the Senate, through the House, and then we’d actually use procedures, like to stop that: voting procedures, holding procedures, filibusters. They’re literally going around all that because they know that we will do that. That’s the frustrating thing out of this.”\n\n“What I have within my power are certain things like … I’m holding every political appointee from the VA [Department of Veterans Affairs],” Gallego said referring to Senate Democrats’ various holds on the president’s nominees. “We’ve used the filibuster whenever we can, but again they’re not running through this [the Senate].”\n\nGallego’s apparent embrace of the filibuster to block Trump-backed legislation is a stark departure for the Arizona Democrat who used his support for eliminating the Senate procedural tool as a wedge issue against his predecessor Democrat-turned-independent Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nGallego entered the Arizona 2024 Senate race to challenge Sinema on a platform to eliminate the filibuster.\n\n“My position is that the filibuster has to get reformed,” Gallego told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell in January 2023 the day after he launched his bid. “It’s not a tool of compromise, it’s a tool of obstruction … At the end of the day, this [the filibuster] is actually really used to stop real moral movement and actual laws actually help people in this country.”\n\n“Unlike Kyrsten Sinema, Ruben Gallego will vote to abolish the filibuster in order to be on the right side of the issues that matter,” Gallego’s personal campaign account X account posted in June 2023.\n\n Unlike Kyrsten Sinema, Ruben Gallego will vote to abolish the filibuster in order to be on the right side of the issues that matter. Add your name today to endorse Ruben and send a clear message to Senator Sinema that her days in the Senate are numbered. — Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) June 14, 2023 \n\nSinema fiercely defended the filibuster during her single term in the Senate, calling the procedural requirement to get 60 votes to pass most legislation a “guardrail” for democracy. Her support for the upper chamber’s procedural rule made her ripe for criticism by Gallego and national Democrats and earned the former senator a censure by the state Democratic Party. She left the party and registered as an independent in 2022.\n\nAfter Sinema decided not to seek reelection in 2024, Gallego narrowly won the race to replace her in the Senate, defeating Republican nominee Kari Lake by just over two percentage points. On the same ballot, Trump carried Arizona by 5.5 points over failed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nGallego’s campaign platform called for waiving the filibuster for Democratic Party-favored legislation, such as so-called “voting rights” bills.\n\nHe characterized the filibuster as “a relic of the Jim Crow era” primarily used to obstruct progress in a December 2021 tweet.\n\n The filibuster is a relic of the Jim Crow era that has been used to stifle progress for generations now. Abolish it. — Senator Ruben Gallego (@SenRubenGallego) December 30, 2021 \n\nSenate Republicans have taken note of Gallego and other Senate Democrats’ apparent flip-flops on the filibuster since losing their majority and former President Joe Biden in the White House.\n\n“I’m forgetting … the rules are different for Democrats,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the Senate floor in February. “If you’re a Democrat, it’s perfectly fine – and not at all hypocritical – to plan to abolish the filibuster should you gain a majority in the Senate, but to use it regularly when you do not.”\n\nSenate Democrats have filibustered four pieces of legislation since Republicans took control of the Senate in January.\n\nDemocrats led in part by Gallego killed a motion to proceed on bipartisan crypto legislation Thursday.\n\nLess than two days later the Arizona senator defended the practice in a room full of anxious Democratic voters who implored him to fight harder against the GOP-controlled Congress.\n\n“Be mad, stay mad and we fight,” Gallego said to the town hall attendees. “How do we fight? We fight them in the courts, everywhere we can.”\n\nOne Arizona political observer predicted that Gallego would “realize he loves the legislative filibuster” in a scenario where he would serve in the upper chamber’s minority. Democrats held a majority in the Senate at the time.\n\n“[It] is not inconceivable that one day Ruben Gallego will end up defending what he called a ‘Jim Crow’ relic – the legislative filibuster — and that all those progressive Democrats who hate Kyrsten Sinema will tomorrow view her intransigence as her crowning virtue,” Arizona Republic editorial columnist Phil Boas wrote in April 2023 shortly after Gallego launched his Senate campaign. “We should know what Gallego would do if Republicans win the Senate. Was his opposition to the filibuster a matter of principle or merely a raw play for power?”\n\nGallego’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAndi Shae Napier contributed to this report. \n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jon Ossoff and Democratic Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens, who voted against legislation to bar biological males from women’s sports earlier this year, are backing the Equality Act, a bill that would make “gender identity” a protected class under federal anti-discrimination law. The candidates’ decision to support the far-reaching legislation comes as Republicans accuse the two lawmakers of catering to left-wing gender ideology that is at odds with their own voters. (RELATED: It Appears Democrats Have Finally Picked A Hill To Die On)\n\nNearly 70% of Democrats or participants who “lean Democrat” oppose biological males participating in women’s sports, according to a New York Times survey conducted between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10.\n\nOssoff, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent seeking reelection, is currently running unopposed in Georgia’s Democratic primary. Stevens entered a contested Democratic primary field in April to vie for an open Michigan Senate seat following Democratic Michigan Sen. Gary Peters’ decision to not seek reelection.\n\nIn Georgia, 73% of voters told a pollster in January they would support the state government banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed legislation, dubbed the Riley Gaines Act, to protect women’s sports in April.\n\nDespite a majority of voters appearing to reject the Democratic Party’s stance on transgender issues, Ossoff and Stevens appear to be toeing the party line.\n\nOssoff and Stevens are among the 47 Senate Democrats and 214 House Democrats supporting the latest rollout of the Equality Act, which congressional Democrats introduced for the fifth time on April 29. The legislation passed the House in May 2019 and February 2021 under the leadership of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but did not clear the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.\n\nThe Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent discrimination on the basis of “sexual orientation and gender identity.” The legislation would force schools to open female-only spaces to biological males who identify as transgender girls, including sports teams, according to analysis from the Heritage Foundation.\n\n“As Republicans across the country continue their assault on LGBTQ+ Americans – particularly the trans community – the fight against bigotry and discrimination remains as urgent as ever,” Pelosi said in a April 29 statement marking the Equality Act’s reintroduction.\n\nGeorgia and Michigan are seen as top pick-up opportunities for Senate Republicans during the midterms. Early analysis from the Cook Political Report rates both contests as “toss-ups.”\n\nTrump bested former Vice President Kamala Harris in both swing states in November.\n\nStevens called on Congress to take up the Equality Act again in February two months prior to her Senate campaign announcement.\n\n“As a member of the @EqualityCaucus, I’m celebrating 4 years since we last passed the Equality Act — the 119th Congress needs to bring it to a vote, it must become law,” Stevens wrote in a post on X.\n\nStevens also slammed legislation seeking to bar transgender athletes from women’s sports during a speech on the House floor in April 2023, characterizing the bill as “hateful.”\n\nFormer Republican Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who is viewed as the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination, criticized Stevens for repeatedly failing to protect women’s sports and female-only spaces.\n\n“Michiganders see Haley Stevens’ In-Equality Act for what it is: the radical left’s latest scheme to force boys into girls’ bathrooms and sports teams,” Rogers campaign spokesperson Alyssa Brouillet told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Meanwhile, Mike Rogers and President Trump are fighting to defend girls’ safety, privacy, and opportunity. Protecting girls’ sports and spaces is not only fair, it’s common sense.”\n\nOssoff, who ran on passing the Equality Act into law during his successful 2020 Senate campaign, has continued to oppose efforts to restrict transgender athletes from participating in girls and women’s sports.\n\nThe senator joined Senate Democrats in filibustering Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in March despite pressure from Georgia Republicans to support the bill.\n\nRepublican Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, the first Republican candidate to jump into Georgia’s 2026 GOP primary following Kemp’s decision to pass on a run, came out swinging against Ossoff’s left-wing positions on transgender issues in his campaign announcement video.\n\n“Last November Georgia spoke, but Jon Ossoff doesn’t care,” the video’s narrator states. “He fought against President Trump securing our border and voted for men in girls sports. Jon Ossoff is on the wrong side.”\n\nSenate Leadership Fund, a Senate Majority Leader John Thune-aligned super PAC, has also targeted Ossoff for his votes against legislation to protect women’s sports. SLF’s issue advocacy arm, One Nation, ran a seven-figure ad buy to highlight Ossoff’s left-wing stance on women’s sports in April. The ad aired during several high-profile sports events, including the Masters tournament and the Final Four college men and women’s basketball games.\n\n“Man-to-man defense isn’t woke enough for Ossoff. He’s for they/them,” the ad’s narrator says while a man purporting to be Ossoff dunks over a female basketball player.\n\nSpokespeople for Ossoff and Stevens did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The administration said it was threatening to garnish wages even as borrowers and advocates expressed concerns about the ripple effect of a new financial obligation weighing down on Americans already grappling with Trump’s tariffs.\n\nThe decision was just one of many in which Team Trump has targeted current and former college attendees, along with the schools themselves.\n\nTrump has authorized law enforcement agencies to abduct and detain college students expressing opinions he disagrees with. He has also cut federal funding for schools like Harvard and Columbia University and affiliated institutions while pressuring them to get rid of diversity programs and admissions, and he has pressured schools to exclude transgender athletes.\n\nRelated | Trump holds federal funding hostage as war on Harvard escalates\n\nColleges are also set to be punished as part of the administration’s plan to destroy the entire Department of Education, which has existed in America since 1980.\n\nAmerica doesn’t like Trump’s posture toward college and universities.\n\nAn Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released on Friday found that 56% of those surveyed disapproved of Trump’s actions on higher education. Majorities of those surveyed said colleges are a positive for medical and scientific research and as a source of new ideas and technological innovation. Additionally, pluralities said colleges are a positive for the U.S. workforce and for defense and military research.\n\nTrump isn’t alone in his disdain for college and making it accessible to everyone. Republicans in Congress fought against efforts by the Biden administration to relieve student debt, and the conservative majority on the Supreme Court significantly scaled back Biden’s relief program.\n\nMajor Republican donor and multimillionaire Peter Thiel even set up a fund to pay students not to attend or to drop out of college.\n\nWhy is conservatism so dead set against colleges and universities despite the public’s position?\n\nThe right-wing movement has long seen college as a source of left-wing indoctrination. Conservatives have forwarded the notion that previously apolitical students are somehow brainwashed when they go off to college, returning to their families as left-wing radicals.\n\nThis is of course, absurd, because if this were truly the case few people who attend college would become conservatives or Republicans—but millions of people who vote for the Republican Party are also college attendees or graduates.\n\nConservatives are so concerned about this purported brainwashing that they have created groups like Turning Point USA, conservative pundit Charlie Kirk’s college activism group. The right has also created entire colleges devoted to cranking out right-wing thinkers at institutions like Hillsdale College.\n\nWhat is really going on isn’t indoctrination, but a failure of conservatism to win the war of ideas. And as is so often the case with the right, when they can’t win a fair fight, they try to rig the system from the inside. Republicans fail to enlist those who go through a college education to their side of the aisle, so they undermine student loan programs, try to bully colleges, and even attempt to turn college sports into another casualty of the bigoted “culture war.”\n\nEven when Republicans decisively win an election this is a battle they overwhelmingly lose. In the 2024 election Vice President Kamala Harris lost the popular vote and the electoral college, but among college graduates she crushed Trump 56% to 42%. Among voters of color with a college degree she won by even more, 65% to 32%.\n\nTrump infamously said in 2016 “I love the poorly educated,” because it was the voter demographic most inclined to support him. And despite his policies negatively affecting this group, he has continued to garner their support while blaming colleges for all manner of negative things. It is a useful boogeyman for demagogues like Trump, even though college for most is a positive experience that opens their minds to different perspectives.\n\nRepublicans are using their power to bend colleges to their whims, and unfortunately in some instances these schools have given in to Trump—only to be pushed to give him more control and power. The right wants to break the will of schools, which they believe will eventually lead to more Republican votes.\n\nComplex issues like taxes and tariffs and climate science require an educated populace to make informed decisions not only for themselves but for future generations. The right perceives a college education as another target they must attack and conquer. That’s why Trump is fighting so hard to destroy them and tear down some of the brightest lights in American education.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nThis past week, the Trump administration continued to squeeze middle-class families with its decision to restart the process of collecting on student loans that had been paused during the pandemic.

The ladies of The View — part of ABC News, which is run by Kamala's best friend — lauded Joe as a conquering hero.\n\nYes, this reanimated corpse, who seemed to recognize only two of his five gushing hosts, who needed direction to sit in the lone empty chair waiting for him, and was caked in about five layers of flesh-toned make-up — fielded this tough question, from co-host Sara Haines, right off the bat:\n\n'Mr. President… you had made the selfless and very difficult decision, I'm sure, to step aside.'\n\nHaines — and her producers, and ABC News execs — have clearly memory-holed George Stephanopoulos, of ABC News, interviewing Biden in the wake of that disastrous TV debate, asking the president repeatedly if he really thought he could, and should, continue running?\n\nTo which Biden retorted that only 'the Lord Almighty' could convince him to do the right thing — and guess what?\n\n'The Lord Almighty's not coming down,' Joe said.\n\nOkay. So the mainstream media, the Democratic Party and the Bidens themselves still refuse to take the memo.\n\nThey remain defiant in their beliefs that Joe Biden was an incredible president, that there were zero cover-ups about his declining faculties, and that he and Dr. Jill — the wife-slash-nursemaid who, of course, joined him for this interview — remain party leaders who should be heard and seen as much as possible.\n\nThe delusion is astounding.\n\nBiden was essentially fired by his party and country.

And speaking of Trump, Biden was asked, in this interview, what he thinks of his successor's first 100 days.\n\nBiden, ever on brand, said that like every former living president, the protocol is never to criticize a sitting president — and then proceeded to do just that.\n\n'I think he's done a very poor job,' said Biden — who ordered, against all best military advice, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan that cost 13 US service members their lives.\n\nSaid the president who worked just a few hours each day, who fell asleep in meetings and wandered off stages worldwide, whose cognitive decline and the resulting cover-up has been told in multiple news accounts and now a spate of books.\n\nA president who was so unreachable, so shielded from the press and fellow politicians, that Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said his multiple requests to meet with Biden had been summarily denied.\n\n'If the Speaker of the House can't meet with the president of the United States, that's a problem,' Johnson said in February 2024, four months before that debate.

However, Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as one of the most prominent Democrats pushing back on the current administration.The New York Democrat has been traveling around the country with progressive Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, as part of his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. The rallies consistently draw thousands of attendees, including in red districts and states.Many political analysts have started touting Ocasio-Cortez as a strong contender for the party's 2028 presidential nomination. Separately, some party activists have urged her to primary Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York in 2028 instead.What to KnowLawler appeared as a panelist on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher on Friday. In the show's \"Overtime\" segment, the New York Republican said Ocasio-Cortez would easily defeat Schumer in a primary challenge.\"AOC will absolutely kick his a** in a primary,\" Lawler said, noting that the New York senator has held elected office for 50 years. He went on to describe the congresswoman as the \"leader of the Democratic Party in this moment.\"He predicted that she will \"continue to be the biggest driver of where the party goes from a governmental policy standpoint, and that drives many of my colleagues crazy.\"\"The fact is, she has tapped into the base of support within the Democratic Party, and you see the juxtaposition between her and Chuck Schumer,\" he said.Democrats' Criticism of Chuck SchumerSchumer's support for moving forward with a Republican Trump-backed stopgap funding bill in mid-March drew widespread Democratic criticism, including from his longtime ally, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.The top Senate Democrat's support for the bill moving forward, in which he was joined by nine other members of the chamber's Democratic Caucus, prevented a government shutdown, but was seen by many in his party as a betrayal. Democrats saw the pending shutdown as a point of leverage against Trump and Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress.Schumer said at the time that his support would prevent worse damage to the federal government from Trump and billionaire Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) adviser Elon Musk. Schumer said a shutdown would allow them to ramp up their efforts to make cuts across federal agencies.Will AOC Run in 2028?Some recent polls have shown Ocasio-Cortez in second place for the Democratic Party's 2028 presidential nomination after former Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's unsuccessful 2024 contender. A survey by Quantus Insights carried out among 1,000 registered voters from April 21 to 23 showed Harris with 30 percent support and Ocasio-Cortez in second place at 14 percent.The New York Democrat was asked about her 2028 plans by Fox News last month. She responded by saying her current focus is not about politics.\"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights. We're getting 2-year-olds that are getting deported into cells in Honduras. We're getting people that are about to get kicked off of Medicaid. That, to me, is most important,\" she said.What People Are SayingDemocratic operative Charlotte Clymer to Newsweek in March about the party's failure to pushback on Trump: \"This is not a problem of our party; it's a problem of our party leadership. There is so much outstanding potential in the Democratic Party. What we need is fresh leadership.\"Patricia Crouse, political scientist in residence at the University of New Haven, to Newsweek last month: \"I think people see her [AOC] as the face of the Democratic Party right now because she seems to be the only one (along with Sanders) willing to stand up for the party and stand against Trump... But many within the party, both members and voters, view her as too progressive or even extreme left.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Latino USA podcast in February: \"I have a weird relationship with the Democratic Party. I don't believe in a two-party system, but I also understand the Democratic Party is a coalition and if we want the party to change, the balance of the coalition has to change. But right now, you open the hood on the Democratic Party, what you have is, I think, a bit of a power struggle over the last couple of years.\"Monica Crowley, a former official in the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration, told Fox News last November: \"Just a word of warning to the Republicans, to my party: Do not underestimate AOC. She's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive.\"What Happens Next?Speculation about Ocasio-Cortez's 2028 plans will likely continue, especially if she continues to draw large crowds at rallies. The \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour does not currently have any upcoming scheduled events but is expected to announce more in the coming months.","summary":"Representative Mike Lawler of New York said his progressive colleague is now the \"leader\" of the Democratic Party.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-gets-unexpected-praise-republican-colleague-2070588","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2642370/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 20:14:17","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":319982824,"title":"The issue that could tear Trump's base apart... and why the president hasn't made up his mind","text":"EXCLUSIVEThe issue that could tear Trump's base apart... and why the president hasn't made up his mind\n\nRepublicans in Congress are looking for areas to cut waste, fraud and abuse \n\nBy JON MICHAEL RAASCH, U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 20:49 BST, 10 May 2025 | Updated: 20:49 BST, 10 May 2025\n\nRepublicans are viciously fighting over how dramatically they should cut Medicaid in Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' as they are trying to provide the tax cuts the president promised.\n\nThe massive measure, which is expected to cost trillions of dollars, is expected to renew Trump's 2017 tax cuts, cut taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security.\n\n'In the coming weeks and months, we will pass the largest tax cuts in American history - and that will include no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, and no tax on overtime. It's called the one big beautiful bill,' Trump promised at a rally in April.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are now deliberating over how to make good on that promise, and they must find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the income lost due to the tax cuts. \n\nHowever, negotiations over just how much to cut and where are proving tricky as Medicaid is popular in many GOP-controlled districts, potentially exposing the lawmakers to challenges in the midterms next year. \n\nAttacking the government health program that provides healthcare for close to 80 million Americans, about 25 percent of the U.S. population, including children, the elderly and the sick, has been an unpopular position for any lawmakers. \n\nUnderstanding that slashing a program that provides practically free healthcare is politically perilous for his party heading into the midterms, the president has remained opaque about what may happen. \n\n'We want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable, for our kids, our pregnant women, the poor and disabled,' he told a rally in Michigan last week. He also said in February that the program 'isn't going to be touched.' \n\nDonald Trump has waffled on Medicaid cuts as Congress wrangles with how much of the subsidized healthcare program they want to slash as they search for savings to make good on the president's promise of sweeping tax cuts \n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (L) and Trump have been in near constant contact as the House leader works to craft the president's massive, multi-trillion dollar legislative agenda\n\nCare advocates attend 24-hour vigil at U.S. Capitol to share stories and urge lawmakers to protect Medicaid on May 07, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe program costs about $880 billion annually, as each enrollee spends a median $7,000 to $9,000, according to Medicaid data. \n\nRepublicans must find $880 billion in cuts over 10 years to finance the tax cuts this year. That $88 billion in savings annually will come, in part, from Medicaid reform, party leadership has said. \n\nAnd though some in the GOP see the program as a piggy bank to pull from, others are warning the situation is much more treacherous. \n\nLeaving Washington on Thursday after the last votes of the week, GOP lawmakers were perplexed on how to appropriately filet the program to every member's liking. \n\n'There's a lot, there's 20 plus issues, I think, that are still major variables on whether any of this can come together,' Conservative House Freedom Caucus (HFC) member Chip Roy told reporters on Thursday.\n\nHe and other conservatives are pushing to reform the program and whittle down how many individuals can enroll in the subsidized healthcare. \n\nRequiring Medicaid recipients to work to receive benefits and cutting the amount of federal dollars flowing to the program are on the table for the GOP. \n\n'Work Requirements are important,' Roy told reporters. 'You shouldn't be having the people who should work, can work, getting benefits without working.'\n\nGOP members differ on how much Medicaid shut be slashed. Roy, a conservative House Freedom Caucus member is advocating for deep cuts while Bacon, who was elected in a district Kamala Harris won, has expressed doubts over major reform to the program\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., speaks at a Medicaid rally in front of the Capitol. Democrats have been fighting back against GOP reforms\n\nDoctors do an ultrasound on a pregnant woman during a pop-up health clinic in Alabama last year. The pop-up was sponsored by a state program, which receives federal funding\n\n'You shouldn't have the ineligible getting benefits if they're, in fact, ineligible,' the Texas Republican continued, adding the reforms need to be 'transformative' to root out those 'gaming' the system. \n\nThough cuts are also majorly unpopular for some in the party, too. \n\n'I'll hopefully get to talk to leadership about it a little later,' House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., told reporters on Wednesday after a private meeting with Democrats on what portions of Medicaid to cut. 'So we'll see.'\n\nCentrist Republican Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said after the meeting that if Republicans vote on a bill that reforms federal financing of state Medicaid programs, they might not succeed. \n\n'I don't think these measures will pass the House, let alone the Senate,' he said about the current proposal. \n\nDemocrats see the GOP's Medicaid cuts as risky too. \n\nTrump poses with Mehmet Oz after being sworn-in as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Oval Office of the White House, April 18, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\n\nDOGE goes after Medicare and Medicaid as Elon Musk calls it source of 'big money fraud'\n\n'You see the fight playing out right there because people understand Medicaid is extremely popular,' progressive caucus leader Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told reporters on Thursday. \n\nShe noted how the program 'covers nursing home care, covers births, including a significant portion of births in Mike Johnson's home state of Louisiana.' \n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has said repeatedly that Medicaid reform is a critical component of the 'big, beautiful bill,' though the question of how much is seemingly dividing his narrow majority. \n\nWhenever Johnson and Republicans finalize their work on the trillion dollar legislative package they will only be able to lose a handful of votes to advance the bill to the Senate. \n\nCurrently, the GOP majority is 220 - 213, which means they can only lose three votes and still have Trump's agenda pass. \n\n'As far as Medicaid goes, when you have six out of 10 individuals on Medicaid, able bodied and not working, there's got to be some reforms,' HFAC member Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., told the Daily Mail. \n\n'It's intended for, you know, at risk children, single moms, the at risk population. So get your butt to work and contribute to the process.'\n\nWhen asked about the appetite for major cuts with narrow margins in the House, Ogles admitted he would personally want to make even deeper cuts to Medicaid.\n\n'But obviously we've got a slim majority,' he added. \n\nPoliticsRepublicansDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nThe issue that could tear Trump's base apart... and why the president hasn't made up his mind\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Republicans are viciously fighting over how dramatically they should cut Medicaid in Donald Trump 's 'big, beautiful bill' as they are trying to provide the tax cuts the president promised.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14695783/trump-decision-medicaid-divide-maga-voters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/09/18/98224247-0-image-m-43_1746812984886.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/18/8888645641725627653/1024x576_MP4_8888645641725627653.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-10 19:49:32","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.055},{"id":320003218,"title":"Brazile on Biden Blaming Bigotry for Harris Loss: We Elected Obama Twice, I'm 'Proud' of U.S.","text":"On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” ABC News Contributor and former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile responded to former President Joe Biden blaming Kamala Harris’ defeat in the 2024 race on racism and sexism by saying that while “America may have problems with race,” the country did elect Barack Obama twice and she’s “proud” to live in a country that did so.\n\nBrazile said, “Kamala Harris, there were many reasons for her defeat, but I think among the first was the fact that the six or seven million Americans who voted for Biden-Harris in 2020 did not come out because they didn’t feel that the administration was doing enough.

She voted to impeach Trump, along with nine other House Republicans, afterward.The prominent Republican, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, endorsed and campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Trump has frequently slammed Cheney as a result of her opposition, even saying she should be jailed.What to KnowPope Leo XIV was officially elected by the Conclave of Cardinals at the Vatican on Thursday. The new pope, formerly known as Cardinal Robert Prevost, is the first U.S. citizen to be elected to be the head of the Catholic Church.Cheney offered her praise of the new pope on X, while using the post to rebuke Trump as well.\"In an era that looked as if it might be defined by an American man of depraved cruelty, corruption, and shame, what a magnificent thing the Catholic Church has done. The elevation of an American man of goodness, grace, humility, mercy, and faith to the Throne of St. Peter is moving and momentous for us all,\" she wrote.Liz Cheney's Opposition to Donald TrumpWhile Cheney was largely aligned and supportive of Trump throughout his first term, she turned against him in the wake of his 2020 election defeat as he promoted unfounded claims that the results were \"rigged\" due to widespread voter fraud.On January 6, 2021, hundreds of Trump's supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol, believing, as the president claimed, that the election was stolen. While the riot temporarily delayed the 2020 election's formal certification, Joe Biden was inevitably confirmed as the winner in a joint session of Congress.During his first term, Trump was impeached on January 13, 2021, by the House, with Cheney backing the effort. The Senate ultimately acquitted Trump, falling short of the two-thirds majority required for a conviction. However, a majority of senators, including five Republicans, voted to convict, with the final tally 57-43.Cheney went on to be one of two Republicans who served on the House select committee that carried out an investigation of the events of January 6, as well as Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In response, Trump backed a primary challenger, to whom Cheney lost in the 2022 midterms.The president previously said Cheney should be jailed for her stand against him. He has threatened to target her and others involved with the January 6 investigation, but former President Biden issued a preemptive pardon for her and the other involved lawmakers right before leaving office in January.\"We have been pardoned today not for breaking the law but for upholding it,\" Cheney said in a joint statement with other January 6 committee members after she was pardoned.New Pope Appears to Be at Odds With Trump AdminAs a cardinal, Leo XIV maintained an X account that sometimes reshared content critical of Trump administration policies.In April, he reposted a commentary that criticized a Trump meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele about deportation logistics.Prior to that, in February, Leo XIV reposted an article headlined, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\"The article, an opinion piece from the National Catholic Reporter, focused on a comment the vice president made during a Fox News interview on January 29.At the time, Vance said: \"There's this old school—and I think it's a very Christian concept, by the way—that you love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens and your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"Pope Leo XIV's brother, John Prevost, told The New York Times that he is \"not happy with what's going on with immigration.\"Describing his brother, Prevost told the Times: \"The best way I could describe him right now is that he will be following in Francis' footsteps. They were very good friends. They knew each other before he was pope, before my brother even was bishop.\"Pope Francis clashed with Trump and Vance, particularly over immigration.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump's response to new pope's election on Truth Social on Thursday: \"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!\"Trump to NBC News' Meet the Press in December on Cheney and the other January 6 committee members: \"Honestly, they should go to jail.\"Vice President JD Vance's response to new pope's election on X: \"Congratulations to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election! I'm sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!\"What Happens Next?Cheney continues to appear as a speaker at various events, sharing her views on Trump and other political issues.

However, you can only participate if you vote for one of the two candidates nominated by the Alumni Fellow Nominating Committee, a group of university officials and graduates. There’s no way to write in a name or, if you don’t favor either candidate, to cast a blank ballot. You must vote for one of the insiders’ choices or not vote at all.\n\nNow Yale is a private institution, and no one is obliged to have anything to do with it (except perhaps the governor and lieutenant governor of Connecticut, who are ex officio members of the corporation). However, the Yale example has a certain similarity to the way governmental elites restrict the choice of voters in European nations, even while deeming themselves guardians of “democracy.”\n\nOn March 11, Romania’s constitutional court removed presidential candidate Calin Georgescu, who finished first in the first round of voting last year, from the May 4 runoff ballot. It was alleged that he benefited from TikTok accounts paid for by Russia and that he “violated the very obligation to defend democracy.”\n\nOn March 30, a court in Paris convicted National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen of embezzling European Union funds and barred her from running for office for five years. She finished second, with 41% of the vote, in the 2022 presidential election and was leading in the polls for the 2027 contest, which incumbent Emmanuel Macron is constitutionally barred from running in.\n\nOn May 2, Germany’s Verfassungsschutz (Office for the Protection of the Constitution) designated the Alternative for Germany party as a right-wing extremist group, which could lead to it being banned from participating in elections. The AfD finished second in the Feb. 23 election, with 21% of popular votes, behind the Christian Democrats’ 29%.\n\nThe excuse for excluding Georgescu, Le Pen and the AfD from the political process is that they threatened to shut down democracy. Which brings to mind the communist playwright Bertolt Brecht’s comment in 1953 when his fellow East Germans rioted and demanded a new government.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?” he asked.\n\nIt brings to mind Vice President JD Vance’s Feb. 14 speech at the Munich Security Forum, which shocked many European elites.\n\n“I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns, or, worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy,” he said.\n\nGerman elites would ask you to understand that their nation’s history imposes special burdens. The postwar Bundesrepublik banned publication of Nazi propaganda and Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” for obvious reasons—measures forbidden by our First Amendment.\n\nThe AfD has had some unsavory leaders and spokespeople, and it’s unfortunate that Vance met with its leader in Munich, just as it’s unfortunate that former Chancellor Olaf Scholz endorsed former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nHowever, there’s no serious argument that Georgescu or Le Pen or the AfD wants a second Holocaust. Their support comes from opposition to mass immigration.\n\nVance referenced this in Munich.\n\n“No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants,” he said to no applause. “And more and more, all over Europe, they’re voting for political leaders who promise to put an end to out-of-control migration.”\n\nHowever, barring immigrants from coming into a country is not another Holocaust. It is not morally equivalent to slaughtering fellow citizens who are Jews, Roma, homosexual or mentally impaired.\n\nIt’s a puzzle why so many highly educated Europeans—and highly educated Americans—feel that limiting the number of immigrants entering their countries is morally akin to mass murder.\n\nThis seems less like generosity—a solicitude for people with unfamiliar cultural attitudes and behavior patterns—and more like snobbery: disdain for ordinary citizens who are uncomfortable with such people.\n\nThe itinerant author and photographer Chris Arnade said it would be easy for European elites “to simply change their policy positions on immigration—not dramatically even.”\n\n“We had to destroy the village in order to save it,” an American was supposed to have said during the Vietnam War.\n\nEuropean elites seem to have convinced themselves that they must destroy democracy in order to save it.\n\nHowever, this may not work. Last Sunday’s winner in Romania was a political ally of Georgescu; Marine Le Pen’s young deputy, Jordan Bardella, is polling nearly as well as she was; and Germany may yet hesitate to ban the AfD.\n\nWe have seen echoes of the European elites among some of their American counterparts, who sought to use kangaroo court verdicts and dubious constitutional arguments to bar President Donald Trump from the ballot and who seem to regard any attempt to enforce immigration laws as morally equivalent to genocide.\n\nNot all of the Trump administration’s immigration actions are, in my view, defensible. However, the cries that the United States is closing its gates to immigrants ignore the fact that it welcomes around 800,000 individuals to become American citizens every year.\n\nThe U.S. has never had a fully open-borders immigration policy. Even during the supposedly “give me your tired, your poor” Ellis Island period, immigrants had to be free of communicable disease and capable of supporting themselves economically. These standards were enforced mainly by the steamship companies, which had to ship back people rejected by immigration station inspectors.\n\nAmericans have also had a habit of assimilation and encouraging non-adversarial attitudes toward American institutions.

His show often throws jabs on both sides of the aisle, taking aim at President Donald Trump and Republican figures as well.The scale of the Republican Party's triumph in November—taking the White House, flipping the Senate, and maintaining control of the House—has sparked widespread soul-searching within the Democratic Party over what went wrong and how to rebuild. Democratic leaders have come under criticism from within, some for pushing the party too far left, and others for appearing too conciliatory toward Trump.What To Know In a Friday segment of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedian echoed Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin's April call for Democrats to \"retake the flag,\" referencing prepared remarks the Michigan lawmaker was set to deliver, which were obtained by Politico.Maher said this idea of lack of patriotism and American identity \"is a serious problem for Democrats,\" citing polling that shows \"less than 1 in 4 Democrats under 30 say they are proud to be an American, 54 percent say they are embarrassed by it.\"A national poll of 2,098 adults ages 18 to 29, conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics from March 14 to 25, found that 76 percent of young Republicans said they are proud to be American, compared to 24 percent of Democrats. Just 8 percent of Republicans said they are embarrassed to be American, while 54 percent of Democrats expressed the same sentiment. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.21 percentage points.After citing the polling data, Maher acknowledged, \"Is America perfect? No, of course not.\" He went on to say that the United States is \"leagues ahead of the rest of the world on most of the progressive issues that are important to young people,\" citing statistics on women-owned businesses, same-sex marriage rights and more.He stated that the \"dilemma\" for Democrats, is that young members are backingthe \"wrong ones\" citing support for Hamas and the Houthis. He added that they are \"looking for love in all the wrong countries,\" rather than appreciating the U.S. His comments are largelyin reference to various pro-Palestinian protests across the country that have happened since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October 2023.\"If the thoughtleaders in the Democratic Party keep encouraging and not rebuking the idea that America is cringe, and the people who run Gaza are great, the Democrats are doomed,\" Maher concluded.What People Are SayingFormer Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said on the FLAGRANT podcast that aired in April: \"I do think my party needs to do a much better job, especially with the kind of finger-wagging that you're talking about; I think we are like very prone to that.\"Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said in February: \"I think the Democrats' brand is really bad, and I think this was an election based on culture. And the Democrats' failure to connect on a cultural basis with a wide swath of Americans is hugely problematic. I think the majority of the party realizes that the ideological purity of some of the groups is a recipe for disaster and that, candidly, the attack on over-the-top wokeism was a valid attack.\"Former Democratic Ohio Representative Tim Ryan said in an MSNBC interview in late November 2024: \"Our brand is toxic in so many places, and it is like, 'you are a Democrat?' That's the stuff we get in Ohio. We need a complete reboot. We need a complete reboot with the DNC. We need a complete rebranding.\"Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, wrote in a statement in the wake of the 2024 election: \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\"What Happens Next?The 2026 midterm elections are expected to be a bellwether of the Trump administration and the Democratic Party.It's unclear who the party will eventually support in the 2028 presidential election, with some early polling showing former Vice President Kamala Harris leading the pack of potential presidential candidates, followed by New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Buttigieg.","summary":"The comedian says the lack of patriotism among young Democrats is a \"serious problem\" for the party.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bill-maher-issues-warning-about-serious-problem-democrats-2070543","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2642321/bill-maher.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 15:50:48","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":319952264,"title":"It’s fascinating to watch Trump supporters realize they screwed up","text":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes. Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nToday we’ll look at how some of the people who helped elect President Donald Trump are rationalizing the trouble he’s caused them since taking office. \n\nFirst, this Facebook post from Derin, who lives in Missouri:\n\nHello Facebook friends. I want to clarify my position on some things. Yes, I am still a Republican. Yes, I am still against what the Biden-Harris administration was doing. Yes, I still do not support Kamala Harris. However, just because I disagree with the Democratic political position does not mean I have to agree with, what I am seeing from many news sources, what Donald Trump is doing to this country. I deeply regret voting for Donald Trump. I made my decision to vote for him based on my desire to keep Harris from becoming President and based on Trump's performance during his first term. He has changed and is not the same President we had during his first term. With what I am seeing, Americans, and I mean U.S.-natural-born citizens whose families have been in this nation for generations, need to be afraid. Trump is beginning to deport actual American citizens to torturous prisons in Venezuela just because they disagree with him. I have studied a little about the rise of Adolph Hitler in Nazi Germany and I am seeing the same thing with Trump. I personally believe Trump could be the Antichrist. He fits some of the traits of this \"man of sin.\" I am afraid we went from the frying pan into the fire and I don't know if there is anyway back from the flames.\n\nI won’t link to his (or anyone else’s) Facebook page in this article because I don’t want anyone harassing these people. That said, his page has become explicitly anti-Trump. In other posts, Derin wonders where the “2nd Amendment people” are as the administration espouses tyrannical beliefs. He approvingly reposted Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s criticisms of the arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan in Milwaukee. And he even posted a video titled “From a constitutional government to a dictator (a 2.5 minute history lesson).”\n\nBut even though he now thinks Trump is the Antichrist (and Derin appears to be a devout evangelical), he still wouldn’t have voted for Harris. And from what I can gather, that’s all because he hates the LGBTQ+ people and abortion—i.e., he’s the cliche of a God-and-guns conservative. \n\nIt’s a tough slog for Democrats if people would rather vote for the Antichrist than the candidate with the (D) next to their name. \n\nNext up is Stephanie, also on Facebook:\n\nI'll admit it—| voted last election after years of saying my vote wouldn't matter. Between the choices we were given, I chose Trump. And now... I regret it. My husband and I worked our whole lives, paid into the system like we were supposed to. Now we're both disabled, can't work, and we're struggling just to survive. Our home is paid off (thankfully), but we're behind on land taxes because they don't take payments. Our power bill is through the roof. We get SNAP, but now I'm reading Trump wants to ban processed foods and sugar on SNAP. If that happens, we won't even be able to afford food for the month. Let's be real-healthy, non-processed food costs more than what we get in benefits for the entire month. And on top of that, they're trying to force everyone to pay back student loans, while foreigners come here and get free education. Other countries help their citizens. We get punished for getting sick, for needing help, for trying to survive.\nSo did I make the wrong choice voting for Trump?\n\n100% yes. But looking at the other option... was there ever really a right one? #DisabledAndForgotten #PoorAndPunished\n\n#WeDeserveBetter #RegretMyVote\n\n#Struggling ToSurvive\n\nLet’s see: Vote for the party that vows to kill all programs to help the poor, or vote for the party that created, supports, and wants to expand those programs?\n\nIt’s apparently a tough call for Stephanie, even if she depends on those programs to survive. \n\nA teacher engages with two students in Carbondale, Illinois, in March 2015.\n\nOf course, “foreigners” aren’t coming to the U.S. for free education. In fact, they subsidize our university systems since they don’t qualify for in-state tuition. If she’s talking about K-12 schooling, yeah, that’s also not the main reason immigrants come to the U.S. Beyond that, even undocumented immigrants pay taxes while also generally being ineligible for government benefits, like food assistance and regular Medicaid. \n\nThat said, Stephanie does get one thing right: It’s true that “other countries help their citizens”! But why do they, Stephanie? Why? \n\nIt’s because they vote for the parties that want to help their citizens. So what was wrong with “the other option”? \n\nAnd in case you’re wondering, Stephanie does not appear to be evangelical, and she lives in upstate New York. She’s in a rural area, and we know that codes as conservative, but there’s no obvious reason why she should culturally stay that way. \n\nLet’s check on Kaylee in Pennsylvania, who posted on Facebook:\n\nI'm actually appalled that Trump is cutting funding for Early Childhood Education. Bucks IU Head Start was amazing for Tanner to prepare him for kindergarten. Please click the link and send a message to our senators and congressman. I'm genuinely starting to regret my vote if Trumps presidency affects my child's education and it's extremely upsetting that some teachers may lose their jobs without the Head Start Program.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s agenda for a second Trump administration, specifically called for the elimination of Head Start, an early childhood education program that primarily serves low-income families. \n\nBut once again, we see that conservatives are happy to vote for Republicans as long as it’s other people getting harmed. They get the vapors only when they themselves end up in the crosshairs. \n\nLucky for Kaylee—and the rest of America—the Trump administration seems to be backing off its threat to kill Head Start. For now.\n\nThis is a fun one: \n\nIt’s fun how we go from FUCK YEAH DONALD TRUMP SUCK IT LIBS to some amorphous “government” destroying his business and livelihood. \n\nAnyway, I do feel owned, so at least he has that going for him. \n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2.\n\nMeanwhile, over on this Reddit thread, a user is upset at getting slammed by tariffs. It’s fair— tariffs suck. They make things more expensive. As we’ve said over and over again, tariffs are a tax on American consumers—and Trump’s tariffs could be one of the largest tax increases ever. \n\nThis user posted his DHL receipt with the outrageous tariff-related fees itemized, and asked, “Is this correct? Why would I be charged so much?“\n\nWhen told it was because he voted for Trump—and his Reddit history makes clear he did—he angrily shot back, in a now-deleted comment, “I don't want to get political.”\n\nConservatives are happy to parade around with their stupid red hats, telling people “fuck your feelings,” but they sure are full of feels once they get hurt, imploring everyone around them to “not get political.” \n\nWell, bud, everything is political. And you chose wrong. Welcome to the hell that you helped build.\n\nOne more? Here’s Micayla, from Texas, on Facebook: \n\ni voted for trump because, morally, biden & kamala was the wrong choice. but if i'm being honest, the choices backed us into a corner where someone said \"QUICK! Choose one!\"\nI actually hate the government as a whole. I think RFK Jr is the only one worth anything in that entire administration. all that to say.... we have actual real problems in the world, and the Trump Administration is worried about PBS KIDS?!?! are you f--king kidding me? Something that was created to help children in poverty be able to be somewhat educated?? Where TF are all these promises that they made during campaigning season? Nah F Those right????? We gotta defund PBS kids!!\n\nIm so sad to see where our priorities lie. I can't believe my kids won't know PBS kids like I knew them. Mr. Rogers? Arthur? Zoobamafoo? Yall are whack as hell for this.\n\nIf i've said it once, I'll say it again.\n\nF THE GOVERNMENT, F THE POLITICIANS. They don't care about you. They don't care about me. They don't care about anything except that big stack of cash they sit on.\n\nShe clearly didn’t take Mister Rogers’ lessons to heart if she voted for Trump for his morals. And … no one rushed the decision, for Chrissake. She had nine years to learn about Trump’s morality, and even if she wasn’t paying attention to Harris—the vice president, mind you—for the previous four years, three months of direct campaigning for the top job should’ve been enough time to make the right decision. \n\nMeanwhile, Project 2025, which we implored everyone to look at, specifically called for the elimination of public support for NPR and PBS. \n\nAs Trump recently said, he’s doing what he campaigned on. Every one of his voters signed up for this. \n\nCampaign Action","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

The state Democratic leadership and implementation of draconian coronavirus restrictions also hurt their support with voters.\n\nRepublicans have been reaping the benefits of the realignment.\n\nThe Republican Party gained Hispanic, Black, Asian-American voters as suburbanites and working class voters responded to their message of tougher enforcement of crime and immigration, and promising to address the cost of living and inflation.\n\nTrump shocked the state after he only lost by 13 points to Kamala Harris, increasing his voter share in 2024 by 11 points. \n\nTrump gained more than 600,000 votes in New York between the 2016 and 2024 elections. Harris’ margin of victory was the narrowest of Democratic presidential candidates since 1992.\n\nIn 2022, Republicans flipped all four congressional seats away from Democrats, helping give House Republicans the majority in Washington, DC.\n\nRepublican candidate for governor Rep. Lee Zeldin came within 6 points of defeating Hochul as the final tally was 47 percent to 53 percent.\n\nRepublicans are anticipating a rematch with Hochul as her approval ratings are weaker than ever.\n\n‘The rightward shift of New York in particular New York City has been happening since 2006,’ GrayHouse pollster Landon Wall told the Daily Mail.\n\nWall indicated that Trump’s gains in New York City could even help a potential future Republican candidate. \n\nBut the newfound excitement from Republicans in the state is bigger than just Donald Trump.\n\n‘There’s this energy and this desire for something counter to the one party rule in New York that is separate from the Trump effect,’ Wall said.\n\nSixty percent of voters statewide say it’s “time for someone new,” including 75 percent of Independents and even 34 percent of Democrats.\n\nThe poll shows that Rep. Elise Stefanik is within striking distance of Hochul if she decides to run a campaign for governor.\n\nForty-six percent of voters said they would vote for Hohul, while Stefanik would earn 40 percent of the vote. Fourteen percent of voters were undecided.\n\nThat’s a strong start for Stefanik to consider the race, as she has not even announced a campaign. \n\nStefanik has a clear lead with Republicans in the state as 44 percent of primary voters signaled their support for a potential run for governor. Only seven percent chose Rep. Mike Lawler and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Stefanik indicated she was seriously considering a run for governor. \n\n‘If you look at the past few election cycles, New York is moving toward the Republican direction and I believe that's a result of single party failed Democrat rule led by Kathy Hochul,' she said. \n\n Originally selected by Trump to serve as his Ambassador to the U.N., the president withdrew her nomination so that she could remain in the House of Representatives where Republicans are clinging to a slim majority. \n\nBut that did not stop her political momentum. Stefanik is stepping up the number of events in the state and getting strong support for a run.\n\n'I'm gonna fight for New Yorkers like I always do. We are crisscrossing the state ... we are hearing an outpouring of support importantly not just from Republicans but from Independents and Democrats as well. It has been overwhelming. Clearly New Yorkers want to fire Kathy Hochul,' she said. \n\nTrump's performance in the state, his rallies, and events only helped increase the number of Republican supporters, she said. \n\n'The trends are only continuing. You look at President Donald Trump's outcome on Election Day in New York, he did better in some parts of the city than any Republican in decades,' she said.","summary":"A new poll shows that the state of New York could be competitive for Republicans as candidates eye challenging Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14697517/new-york-right-republican-poll-kathy-hochul-elise-stefanik.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/10/15/98249639-0-image-a-30_1746888711209.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 14:52:12","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":319928382,"title":"Trump’s first 100 days were ‘worst ever’ – Biden","text":"Former US President Joe Biden has criticized the first 100 days in office of his successor, Donald Trump, while dismissing widespread speculation about his own cognitive decline, which was widely seen as the key reason behind his decision to drop out of the race.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Biden gave his take on Trump’s performance, saying “He’s had the worst 100 days any president’s ever had. And I would not say honesty has been his strong point.” His comments come after the end of the three-month period during which political opponents of sitting US presidents typically limit their public criticism.\n\nBiden also noted that he was “disappointed but not surprised” by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump, claiming that her race and gender played a role. “They went the sexist route,” he said. “I’ve never seen quite as successful and consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country – and a woman of mixed race.”\n\nAsked whether he believes he could have beaten Trump in 2024, the former president replied, “I do.” He argued that the 2024 presidential race “wasn’t a slam dunk.” Trump secured narrow victories in several key battlegrounds, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin.\n\nResponding to reports alleging cognitive decline in the final year of his presidency, Biden strongly denied the claims. “They are wrong,” Biden said. “There is nothing to sustain that… I said when I got out of the race, I was still going to be president. I think I did a pretty damn good job the last six months.”\n\nSpeculation about whether Biden was fit for office swirled around him months before the November election, fueled by recurring gaffes. Concerns peaked, however, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June 2024.\n\nDespite his initial defiance, Biden withdrew from the presidential race under reported pressure from the Democratic leadership, allowing Vice President Harris to become the nominee.

And these days, it is entirely bad form in the newsroom to cozy up to a politician, whether that pres is a liberal Barack Obama or a conservative George W. Bush.\n\nThe current president, Donald Trump, is neither a liberal nor a conservative. He’s a one-of-a-kind narcissist who, in a former life, made a business career out of cozying up to various journalists in the pursuit of furthering his Queens dreams of New York real estate domination. He would literally telephone any number of scribes pretending to be someone else with a hot tip about something, anything, that would further his up-and-down fortune.\n\nAnd now, more’s the pity, he is again the president, pretending for the time being to see the journos who formerly made his bacon as the Enemy of the People.\n\nIt’s been 65 years since a president was elected who had cordial relations with the American press. From today’s rather prim perspective, matters were nuttily chummy.\n\nDonald Trump does not drink. Joe Biden does not drink.\n\nBut Jack Kennedy would have any number of drinks, often, with his Georgetown neighbor Ben Bradlee — Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee — who was two years the junior of the blue-blooded politician at Harvard and served as he did with high distinction in World War II naval battles in the South Pacific. Their relationship continued though the 1950s as Bradlee took on senior positions at Newsweek and the Washington Post and Kennedy progressed from senator to president. Couldn’t, wouldn’t, doesn’t happen today.\n\nI just finished “Fierce Ambition,” a fascinating biography of Maggie Higgins, the first American woman journalist to win a Pulitzer Prize for war reporting. She was on the front lines with our troops in Germany, in Korea — where she won the Pulitzer and very nearly died in battle — and in Vietnam. A great beauty, she was also a Kennedy neighbor in Georgetown, and a drinker of many drinks with him. In the end she went native, as we say in the newspaper business, so much so that she married an Army general, and died at 45 from a tropical disease picked up in the Vietnamese jungle. While still a great reporter, she also endlessly lobbied JFK in letters and cables to expand the American fight against Ho Chi Minh.\n\nDonald Trump, formerly almost equally chummy with liberals such as Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, in his ancient age has gone on a ballistic rampage against the media. He bans the Associated Press from covering him because it won’t rename the Gulf of Mexico, after 400 years, the Gulf of America. While he clearly loves Fox News and has, way beyond any Kennedyesque chumminess, nominated 19 current and former Fox folks to work in his administration — oftentimes because he thinks they look the telegenic part — he sued CBS for literally $20 billion for what he considers misleading edits of an interview with then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. He sued the pollster for The Des Moines Register for predicting that Trump would lose the race in Iowa last November, which he very much did not lose. The pollster was wrong. But what kind of president in a non-Stalinist nation thinks that being wrong is a federal offense?\n\nLet’s pause for a moment to consider the dangerously insane situation this presents in the one nation in the world that considers freedom of speech and the freedom of the press fundamental to its existence, in its Constitution. Brendan Carr, Trump’s FCC chair, after opening investigations into NPR and PBS underwriters, last week said in an interview that he is considering pulling CBS’s broadcast license.\n\nMaybe it’s too chummy — I think it is — for a president to have a lot of drinks with people who cover him. But that’s nothing compared to suing them for $20B and trying to put them out of business. Calling them “human scum.” You know what’s scummy? An American president baldly trying to throw the First Amendment to the Constitution in the trash.\n\nWhy, Americans of all political stripes, are you letting him do it?\n\nLarry Wilson is on the Southern California News Group editorial board. lwilson@scng.com.","summary":"All — all! — American presidents have problems with the press.

They went in another direction.\n\nThe Pulitzer for “public service,” for instance, went to the leftist propaganda site ProPublica for “exposing the fatal consequences of abortion bans.” ProPublica is perhaps the nation’s leading purveyor of Potemkin journalism, which entails dressing up political propaganda with neutral-sounding journalistic verbiage to create the impression that you’ve done genuine reporting.\n\nIts abortion stories are perhaps the sloppiest and sleaziest of its catalog, even worse than its string of pitiful smears against Supreme Court justices. In a healthy environment, journalism schools would use them as prime examples of hackery and conjecture.\n\nTake their award-winning story on Amber Thurman. In August 2022, the 28-year-old Georgia woman checked herself into a suburban Atlanta hospital emergency room, complaining of severe pain. She was suffering from an infection caused by the remains of twin fetuses she had aborted by pill five days earlier.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice when reading ProPublica’s Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters is that they fail to offer a single on-the-record source who maintains that abortion laws slowed or stopped doctors from providing medical help for Thurman.\n\nIndeed, a reader must plow through to the 57th paragraph of the article to find this throwaway line: “It is not clear from the records available why doctors waited to provide (emergency help).”\n\nNot clear? That’s a remarkable concession to make deep into a story. The headline, after all, promises to prove that “Abortion Bans Have Delayed Emergency Medical Care.” Have, not may have.\n\nAnyway, by “not clear,” the reporters mean no testimony exists to support the implication that a dilation and curettage procedure, in which the lining of the uterus is scraped to remove tissue, was delayed because doctors were nervous about Georgia’s abortion law.\n\nWhenever the story hits a juncture at which any real reporter would feel compelled to offer corroboration, ProPublica switches to interviewing nameless “OB-GYNs in states that outlawed abortion” or pro-abortion activists who offer politically motivated guesswork.\n\nWe call that a “column” in the business.\n\nTo confuse readers, ProPublica regularly conflates miscarriages with elective abortions. And here’s the thing: The fetuses had already been destroyed. There was absolutely no legal basis for any doctor, not even one confused about the supposed ambiguities of abortion laws, to fail to give Thurman all the care she needed. That seems like a vital fact that should have been mentioned somewhere in a 3,400-word investigative piece.\n\nI don’t care where you stand on abortion, that’s not journalism. Yet, this is the type of hackery that wins you a Pulitzer these days.\n\nThe only inarguable truth in the Thurman case is that she died from complications caused by abortion pills. That’s the headline. That’s the buried lede. Knowing this, ProPublica feels compelled to assure readers that there are only “rare complications” from abortion pills—“extremely rare” even.\n\nIndeed, there is now mounting evidence that mifepristone is less safe than the Food and Drug Administration has led women to believe. When two pro-life researchers at the Ethics and Public Policy Center reviewed health insurance claims from over 800,000 chemical abortions, they found that complications occurred in about 1 in 10 cases.\n\nMaybe they should have won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nBut ProPublica, funded by a deep-pocketed progressive group, exists to create fake stories for politicians to use as oppo material. You may remember when many political experts assured us that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision and resulting state-level abortion limitations would forever sink the entire GOP?\n\nWell, less than a week after the Thurman story hit, Axios reported that Senate Democrats would launch a “blitz on emergency abortion care this week after ProPublica reporting on death of Georgia woman.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned Thurman on many occasions.\n\nIt should be said that ideological bias doesn’t prevent a journalist from making arguments that rely on facts. It is implausible, however, that any genuine journalist could possibly believe ProPublica’s Thurman story was well reported or that Abu Toha’s essays enlightened anyone.\n\nAnd the fact that Pulitzers reward this kind of transparent hackery only further destroys their already battered credibility.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Do we really need this? | Arwa Mahdawi","text":"It’s (not just) the sexism, stupid\n\nRaise your hand if you’ve been desperate for Joe Biden to pop up and tell us all, yet again, how he would have handily beaten Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nObviously, I’m not the National Security Agency so I have no idea how many hands are up right now but I’d wager it’s not too many. Still, Biden seems to think we all want to relitigate the November election and has returned to the spotlight to explain exactly what went wrong.\n\nIn an interview on ABC’s The View on Thursday, the former president took a tiny bit of accountability for the hellscape we are currently living in, noting: “I was in charge and [Trump] won. So, you know, I take responsibility.”\n\nBiden should have left it there, but he also explained that he thinks he would have beaten Trump if he hadn’t dropped out of the race due to the entire world seeing evidence of his cognitive decline during that disastrous debate. I don’t know what proof he has to support this idea – not poll numbers, anyway – but it’s always good to believe in yourself!\n\nAnother thing Biden believes: that Kamala Harris lost the election because of sexism. “I was disappointed but not surprised,” Biden said of Harris’s defeat. “They [Trump voters] went the sexist route.”\n\nTrump’s campaign was full of sexist and racist attacks against Harris. Bigotry and misogyny clearly played a part in her defeat.\n\nStill, to blame Harris’s defeat on sexism, as Biden does, is a massive cop-out. Harris didn’t lose because she was a mixed-race woman. She lost because Biden’s hubris meant she had very little time to put together a campaign and because, once she was the nominee, she refused to put any distance between herself and Biden’s unpopular policies. To refresh your memory, when Harris went on The View last October, the co-host Sunny Hostin asked her if there was anything the then vice-president would have done differently from Biden, and Harris said “not a thing comes to mind”. A new book by the reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes claims that Biden pressured Harris to ensure there was “no daylight” between the two of them. Biden denied saying this during his appearance on The View – but whoever decided on this strategy, it was disastrous.\n\nIt’s also disastrous, I think, to keep pushing the narrative, as Biden is doing, that Harris lost because of sexism. Saying that the US isn’t ready to elect a female president is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It makes it more likely that white male candidates, seen as a safer bet, are favoured over women.\n\nYes, there’s plenty of misogyny in the US, but the lesson to take from 2024 isn’t that the country isn’t ready for a female president, it’s that the country is desperately ready for change. A recent poll found that 50% of Democrats want the party to “become more progressive”. Another poll found that “a 58% majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that the Democratic party needs major changes, or to be completely reformed”. Instead of relitigating the past, Democrats need to aggressively rethink their future.\n\nForget the new US pope – check out Mexico’s ‘weed nuns’\n\nThis is an old article but since religion is in the news this week I am resurfacing it because the pictures are brilliant.\n\nDid Dora the Explorer join the manosphere?\n\nEven your favourite cartoon characters are getting red-pilled. 404 Media reports that a video recently uploaded to the official Dora the Explorer Instagram account featured Dora explaining what “sigma” means. While sigma has gone through various linguistic shifts, it has been used in the manosphere to talk about an extreme form of masculinity. It’s a very weird thing for Dora to be explaining to kids. “Dora that’s not even Spanish you’re losing the PLOT,” one user said, in response. The video has been deleted now and Dora is exploring other things.\n\nIsraeli soldiers blow up Gaza building and joke about ‘gender reveal’\n\n“It’s a boy!” they joked as blue smoke rose from the ashes of a neighborhood that kids used to play in.\n\nDoes Donald Trump think Stockholm is part of the US?\n\nA city official in Stockholm has said they received a letter from the US ordering them to scrap the city’s diversity initiatives. “It’s quite unique,” one city official told the Guardian. Which is a polite way of saying Trump and his cronies are completely delulu.\n\nMelania is so MIA that Donald Trump has taken on first lady duties\n\nA woman’s work is never done. Unless you are Melania Trump, that is, in which case you are done working. According to the New York Times, Melania has spent fewer than 14 days at the White House during Trump’s second term. That means Trump “has taken to performing some duties that typically would fall to a first lady. She’s not the one carefully selecting light fixtures for the White House residence, redesigning the Rose Garden, greeting tour groups in the East Wing or hosting receptions for Women’s History Month. He is.”\n\nA trip to the restroom now involves ‘proving’ your gender\n\nA male security guard stormed into a woman’s bathroom in a Boston hotel and told a woman with short hair to leave because she “was a man”. Your regular reminder that anti-trans policies and rhetoric that reinforce rigid and regressive gender policing ultimately hurt all women.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection rescinds protections for pregnant women, infants and other vulnerable groups\n\n“It’s appalling and it’s just an extension of the culture of cruelty that the administration is trying to perpetrate,” a deputy director at the ACLU told Wired.\n\nWho killed the Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh?\n\nA harrowing and important piece.\n\nThere’s still a disturbing gender gap in medical trials\n\nA review of UK clinical trial data by the Guardian found that male-only trials (6.1%) were nearly twice as common as female-only studies (3.7%). “This under-representation means there is a lack of evidence on the safety and effectiveness of many interventions in women,” one expert told the Guardian.\n\nThe week in pawtriarchy\n\nMove over, Cocaine Bear, hello, Methamphetamine Raccoon. Police in Ohio conducting a traffic stop were recently surprised to find a pet raccoon called Chewy with a meth pipe in its mouth. Seems that the world is so bleak even animals are turning to drugs. Their owner is in all sorts of trouble now but Chewy is fine. “No raccoons were hurt or injured in this incident,” the police said. Now the question is whether Chewy the trash panda can turn their viral moment into a lucrative career as a binfluencer.\n\n Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist","summary":"The former president points to sexism as the reason for Kamala Harris’s election loss.
