In an interview with OK! Magazine, Joey claims the pair have already started thinking about their future despite not the 'L' word to each other yet. He told the publication: 'We've already spoken about kids.' Joey Essex, 34, has insisted that his Love Island romance with Jessy Potts,25, is the 'real deal' after exiting the villa and revealed he wants to have eight children with his new flame Despite being labelled as the 'pantomime villain' the TV personality, well known for his bachelor antics, now claims to have settled down with his 'exclusive girlfriend' Jessy 'We both want a big family. But we're having a bit of a tiff at the moment. She wants four, I want eight. 'Imagine how great that would be? I'm ready. I'd do it tomorrow. Maybe even tonight!'. But while the couple are ready to start a family of their own, others are less convinced especially after the couple were booted off the Island after being voted the 'least compatible' couple by their fellow islanders. Joey was slammed by viewers and accused of playing games during his stint on the reality show. The TV personality defended his actions by claiming contestants were 'encouraged' to stir the pot during an appearance on Thursday's edition of This Morning. He said: 'Everyone is encouraged to pot stir, the difference with me is that I don't hesitate… I know what the producers want! 'Some didn't want to go out there and upset people and I respect that, but the difference with me and 13 years experience, I know what to do and that's what I did.' Admitting he played the 'pantomime villain', Joey added: 'I have no regrets, you know what it's like, and I played the pantomime villain. I did what I had to do, I wanted to have fun and find love and I found Jessy.' Making their romance Instagram official, they shared a joint post and wrote: 'exclusive era' In an interview with OK! Magazine, Joey claims the pair have already started thinking about their future despite not the 'L' word to each other yet and are ignoring criticism The couple were sent packing just one day before the series final after being voted the 'least compatible' couple by their fellow islands After being asked if they've said the 'love' word to each other yet. Jessy said, 'We don't want to rush things.' Despite the criticism, Joey said he wanted people to focus on him and his new flame as a couple and ignore all the noise around them, insisting he was 'genuine' during his time in the villa.

He said: 'We took our time, had fun and enjoyed each other's company. We weren't jumping to make decisions because the next bombshell was coming in, or because it was Casa Amor, we did things our way. We played it correctly. We weren't in it to win it. We just wanted to be together.' Model and influencer Jessy told the magazine the she isn't phased by the scepticism around Joey's actions and is fully supported by her friends and family. She revealed that her family trust her to see beyond the headlines and chose someone nice adding that they already really like the Essex-born reality star.

Despite the criticism, Joey said he wanted people to focus on him and Jessy as a couple and ignore all the noise around them, insisting he was 'genuine' during his time in the villa The media personality cut a casual figure as he sported a white jacket with a matching T-shirt and blue jeans. Jessy looked radiant for the day in a black short-sleeved midi dress with a plunging neckline that highlighted her incredible figure. The garment featured a polka dot print while the beauty also wore a pair of white trainers and styled her blonde locks into a ponytail. The reality star's revelations about settling down come after he hinted that his time on television might be over. He has said that he might take a step back from the limelight now that he's done every reality show out there. He said: 'I'm taking a huge break from reality TV, I have done every show possible.' He added: 'I wouldn't want to do Strictly. It wasn't hard to see the headlines, not everyone is going to love you all the time. I am strong-minded and very resilient.''

Following the assassination attempt last month on the Republican presidential candidate, Modi condemned the attack on “my friend, former President Donald Trump” in a comment posted on social media platform X. The remark by Modi, who is the most followed head of government on the social media platform with more than 100 million followers, grabbed headlines, particularly since the two leaders have made several public appearances supporting each other. Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley for his star appeal at a joint rally in Houston in September 2019 that drew about 50,000 people. The two leaders more than doubled that crowd about five months later at a cricket stadium in the western Indian state of Ahmedabad, where they praised each other. Modi has widespread support among the Indian diaspora in the US, with a recent study by the Carnegie Endowment finding that around 50 per cent of Indian Americans approve of the prime minister. But even those who are diehard Modi supporters may not gravitate to Trump over fears that his regime will not be friendly to ethnic minorities, analysts say. “Traditionally, Indian Americans vote overwhelmingly for the Democrats. However, this changed slightly in 2016 and 2020 with some shifting allegiances to Trump. Some Indian Americans may vote for Trump this time, but I can’t see it as a dominant trend,” said Uday Chandra, an assistant professor of government at Georgetown University. Trump’s recent remarks casting doubt on Democrat rival Harris’ ethnic origins may again not have won him many followers from the minority Asian-American community, analysts say. The Republican leader said at a Black Journalists Conference in Chicago at the end of last month that Harris was “Indian all the way” before pivoting to a black identity for political gains. “So, I don’t know – Is she Indian? Or is she black?” he said. Harris brushed off Trump’s remarks as “the same old show” of “divisiveness … and disrespect”. “We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us – they are an essential source of our strength,” she told a meeting in Houston on Wednesday. Harris, 59, is the first female vice-president in US history and the daughter of immigrants. Her Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father were both academics and activists. As a child, Harris went to both a black Baptist church and a Hindu temple – embracing both her South Asian and black identities. Some Republicans – even from within Trump’s campaign – seem to have distanced themselves from Trump’s remarks. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who has endorsed Trump, said on Thursday that the rhetoric around race and identity was not “helpful to anyone” this election cycle, according to an Associated Press report. Trump’s attacks on Harris came as latest polls suggest a dead heat between the two in swing states since Joe Biden decided to exit the US presidential election last month, forcing the 78-year-old Republican leader to rejig his strategy that had previously made his rival’s age as a centrepiece. Diaspora’s dilemma “It is possible that a small section of Indian-origin Hindu [Americans] may cross over from Democrats to Trump because of the imagery painted by Trump of Kamala Harris, but the majority will not,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a New Delhi-based independent political commentator. Trump’s tactics of tarnishing the image of political opponents were similar to that of Modi, he said. Modi’s government has maintained robust ties with the Biden administration and has advanced military and business cooperation. Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance has an Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, whose origin could have helped him gain support from the Indian-American community. “The Republican Party is shedding its racial exclusivity from the past to become a broad tent party akin to the UK Tories. However, this will take time to work out,” Chandra said. “Even wealthy and successful Hindu Americans have personal stories of racism and discrimination in the US. There is plenty of distrust. It will take more than Usha Vance or Trump’s statements to win over the majority of right-wing Hindu Americans,’ he said. Indian Americans who are Hindus have rallied behind Modi as they see him capable of bringing economic development and providing a stable administration regime in the South Asian country. Under a decade of Modi’s rule, India has emerged as a darling of global investors and the country is set to remain the fastest-growing major economy in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook. In its outlook in July, the IMF raised India’s growth projection for 2024 to 7 per cent from the previous estimate of 6.8 per cent in April. The government has been gradually steering the economy from the services sector towards manufacturing. While Hindus are the dominant religious community in India, they are a minority in the US that could make them vulnerable to Trump’s policies, according to Mukhopadhyay. Another analyst, however, said a section of the diaspora was likely to support Trump because of his relationship with Modi. High-ranking executives and businessmen, especially from the tech sector, believed “Trump will be a better and natural ally to Modi”, said Priyajit Debsarkar, a London-based Indian author. Harris would need to rely on the vote of the American public in general and not on the diaspora, he said.","summary":"Even diehard Modi supporters may not gravitate to Trump over fears his administration will not be friendly to ethnic minorities, observers note.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3273049/plenty-distrust-indian-diaspora-unlikely-warm-modis-friend-trump-analysts-say","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/03/f6e22097-1230-46b7-bdb0-8daea0e2725e_2c8f4c03.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/03/05/Trump%20win%20-%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-05 00:00:13","author":"Biman Mukherji","authors":["Biman Mukherji"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.325},{"id":253375404,"title":"David Axelrod says 2024 race is still ‘absolutely’ Trump’s to lose","text":"Former Obama adviser David Axelrod cautioned Democrats not to overly celebrate Vice President Kamala Harris’s newfound support, as he predicted the election is currently still former President Donald Trump’s to lose. Harris has seen an uptick in support since becoming the presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic Party, with recent polling data indicating she has a slight lead over Trump. However, Axelrod has contended that it is “still a really tight race” and that both sides will have to put up “a hard fight” to claim victory. “It’s absolutely Trump’s race to lose right now,” Axelrod said on CNN Newsroom. “He is ahead. And he is ahead in most of the battleground states. They’re close; they can be won by either candidate.” Axelrod argued that Harris’s spike in support stems from “irrational exuberance,” and he stated that the vice president has “a lot of momentum” since entering the 2024 race. He suggested that Democrats were initially feeling despair over the election with President Joe Biden as their nominee. “Now people feel like there’s a chance,” Axelrod said. The Democratic adviser’s caution that Trump could still emerge as the victor comes after some have suggested that Harris’s jump in support is merely a “honeymoon” period, which could wear off after a time. Gov. Chris Sununu (R-NH), for example, predicted it will last about 30 days. Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison announced Friday that Harris has received the delegates needed to become the new 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. She is expected to accept the nomination during the party’s convention in Chicago later this month. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER While Biden dropped out of the 2024 race after his first debate with Trump, the former president has questioned if he should debate Harris at all ahead of the election, as “everybody knows her, everybody knows me.” Despite this, he stated on Friday evening that he would meet Harris in Pennsylvania next month for a debate hosted by Fox News. Harris has rejected the idea of debating Trump on Fox, and is instead sticking with a previous plan to have ABC News host the debate. Harris for President communications director Michael Tyler has contended that Trump “needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10.”","summary":"Former Obama adviser David Axelrod cautioned Democrats not to overly celebrate Vice President Kamala Harris’s newfound support, as he predicted the election is currently still former President Donald Trump’s to lose.

Her shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters. Harris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests. Shapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza. \"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\" His handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Some labour groups have also criticised Kelly for not supporting proposed legislation they argue would boost union organising. Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate. Walz has become a favourite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump. At 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age. Walz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair. Trust me\".","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/kamala-harris-interviews-walz-kelly-shapiro-vice-president-pick-4526451","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--fwMWBPX5--/c_crop,h_450,w_800,x_0,y_11/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-08-02t173056z_1_lynxmpek710qs_","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 23:42:11","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.14},{"id":253374282,"title":"Supreme Court Justice criticizes Biden’s extensive reform proposal","text":"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch sent a stern warning toward Joe Biden after the president recently laid out extreme reforms to the nation’s highest court. Last week, Biden called for sweeping reforms to the Supreme Court, including term limits, a binding code of conduct for its nine justices and a constitutional amendment that would limit presidential immunity. In an interview to promote his new book, Gorsuch requested the president exercise caution in how he goes forward, because the judiciary is meant to be an independent check on Biden’s office. ‘It’s there for the moments when the spotlight’s on you, when the government’s coming after you. And don’t you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn’t that your right as an American?’ Gorsuch asked. The Donald Trump-appointed justice then added: ‘And so I just say, be careful.’ Gorsuch, a part of the Republican majority on the 6-3 Supreme Court, also has expressed worry that Americans don’t appreciate what the court represents. ‘I´m not saying that there aren’t ways to improve what we have. I´m simply saying that we´ve been given something very special. It´s the envy of the world, the United States judiciary,’ he said. Gorsuch is currently promoting his new book, ‘Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law. ‘Too little law and we´re not safe, and our liberties aren´t protected. But too much law and you actually impair those same things.’ The 56-year-old justice was the first of three Supreme Court nominees of Trump, and they have combined to entrench a conservative majority that has overturned Roe v. Wade, ended affirmative action in college admissions, expanded gun rights and clipped environmental regulations aimed at climate change, as well as air and water pollution more generally. Biden, citing ‘recent ethics scandals’ involving justices and high court rulings that ‘overturned long-established legal precedents protecting fundamental rights’, has called on Congress to pass three major reforms in a bid to ‘restore trust and accountability’ in America’s democratic institutions. The White House last week detailed the contours of Biden’s court proposal, noting how the Democrat believes ‘no one – neither the President nor the Supreme Court – is above the law’. The President will officially propose the changes today during a speech in Austin, Texas, however his proposals appears to have little chance of being approved by a deeply-divided Congress with under 100 days to go before Election Day. Regardless, Democrats hope Biden’s proposal will help to focus voters as they consider their choices in the tight presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has sought to frame her race against Republican former President Donald Trump as ‘a choice between freedom and chaos’. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and adds a measure of predictability to the nomination process. He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a code of ethics for justices that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden has also urged Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. It comes after the Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump cannot be prosecuted for actions that were within his constitutional powers as president in a landmark decision recognizing for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution. The decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. Biden’s push for reforms comes a week after Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris to square off against Republican presidential candidate Trump in November. It also follows the Supreme Court’s ruling that there is no Constitutional right to abortion and other decisions that blocked Biden’s agenda on immigration, student loans, vaccine mandates and climate change.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSupreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch sent a stern warning toward Joe Biden&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Supreme Court Justice criticizes Biden&#8217;s extensive reform proposal first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/supreme-court-justice-criticizes-bidens-extensive-reform-proposal/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Supreme-Court-Justice-issues-stern-words-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 23:26:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":253374484,"title":"Harris has slight polling edge over Trump as VP pick announcement looms","text":"Harris has slight polling edge over Trump as VP pick announcement looms A new CBS News poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump nationally by one point with the two tied in battleground states.

Sunday, on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Sen. Cotton called out the legacy media on the fact that, since her no-votes-held coronation as the Democratic nominee for president, Kamala Harris has yet to answer any direct, unscripted questions. There’s a good reason for that, he said – she can’t. “When the American people get a better look at her and her radical positions, I think you’re gonna see that they don’t want her to continue the Biden-Harris legacy,” Cotton said on “Face the Nation” on Sunday.The Arkansas Republican criticized Harris for being the presumptive nominee for two weeks without providing any opportunity for unscripted moments or questions from the press. He said when she does encounter the media, she’ll have to answer for her positions on issues like energy and gun policy.

There will be, after all, some kind of presidential debate, and we all know how well Kamala Harris does in debates – or in any situation where she has to speak without a script or a teleprompter. Remember, as I’ve said before: They kept Joe Biden away from these situations because he is senile. They are keeping Kamala Harris away from them because she is incompetent. But they can’t keep doing it forever.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNever let it be said that Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) doesn&#8217;t know&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Tom Cotton Criticizes Media for Treating Kamala Harris With Preferential Treatment: She Has Avoided Answering Questions first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/tom-cotton-criticizes-media-for-treating-kamala-harris-with-preferential-treatment-she-has-avoided-answering-questions/","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/59/9075f11c-48f1-4c4c-9bbb-bcebdee0f5b0.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 23:15:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":253375006,"title":"Jack Grealish's pregnant girlfriend Sasha Attwood shows off her baby bump in a striped co-ord as she prepares to welcome her first child with Manchester City ace","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys My Profile Logout Login Discounts TUI Booking.com ASOS Just Eat Deliveroo boohoo Very Nike Virgin Media Uber Eats Boots B&Q Amazon John Lewis My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Aug 4th 2024 1AM 15°C 4AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Shock moment rioters demand drivers reveal if they are 'white and English' while stopping traffic during violent protests - as disorder erupts across England and police chiefs struggle to regain control On-the-run Tommy Robinson suns himself at an all-inclusive five-star hotel in Cyprus while his foot soldiers run riot in violent protests across Britain - as Keir Starmer takes aim at those 'whipping up action online and then running away' SECOND migrant hotel is set ablaze: Tamworth Holiday Inn burns after Rotherham attack Police charge more than a dozen people after violent riots with scores arrested following overnight clashes that saw migrant hotels mobbed and police attacked as CPS vows to take 'immediate' action against lawbreakers DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Taking on the thugs is Sir Keir Starmer's first big test Tory Police and Crime Commissioner claims far-right protesters who have brought chaos onto the streets are trying to 'protect Britain's sovereignty and identity' and that arresting rioters is 'treating the symptom and not the cause' Teenager accused of raping 13-year-old girl in Cyprus is fighting extradition to the island nation from the UK claiming 'his life will be in danger' from its Turkish community Meghan Markle was seeking 'seeking for support and strength' from Prince Harry while talking about suicide by reaching for his knee in new interview, body language expert claims Labour's tax attack could leave you tens of thousands of pounds worse off.

Sasha was at home with 10 family members when the break-in occurred, and quickly raised the alarm at the property. A massive search was initiated involving helicopters and dogs, and according to reports, the burglary gang attempted to raid the mansion one month before the attack but were scared off when they spotted a police car nearby.

Gorsuch was asked by Shannon Bream of Fox News Sunday about Biden’s stated suggestions. “You’re not going to be surprised that I’m not going to get into what is now a political issue during a presidential election year. I don’t think that would be helpful,” the justice said at first. He then emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, saying it “means that when you’re unpopular, you can get a fair hearing under the law and under the Constitution.” In defending the Supreme Court in its current state, the justice added that they are there “for the moments when the spotlight’s on you, when the government’s coming after you, and don’t you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions?” “And so I just say, be careful,” he concluded. Biden laid out his Supreme Court reform agenda last Monday with a “bold” three-part proposal: A “No One Is Above the Law” constitutional amendment to state a former president does not have immunity for crimes carried out in office; term limits for Supreme Court justices; and a “binding” code of conduct for the high court. Vice President and presumptive 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris endorsed the plan. While many Democrats have accused the Supreme Court and its conservative justices, particularly Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, of undermining democracy by being partisan, Republicans have countered by arguing that Democrats only seek change because they are in the minority. Republicans have a 6-3 majority on the high court. Thomas and Alito have denied having any bias.

He, at 56 years old, is one of three conservative justices in their 50s. Gorsuch spent most of the interview with Bream speaking about his book being released on Tuesday, Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law. In it, he argues everyday citizens are overburdened by too many laws and regulations.","summary":"Justice Neil Gorsuch had a firm response to Joe Biden&#8217;s proposals to reform the Supreme Court, telling the president to &#8220;be careful&#8221; with his plans.

After more than four years of nurturing, growing and operating sports talk radio station XEPRS 1090-AM, the life of The Mightier 1090 ESPN Radio is over. In a statement to Times of San Diego, Hagen said the frequency owner, Interamercana de Radio SA de CV, decided to partner with a new operator and launch a new format. Monte Maria Radio, a Tijuana-based Catholic media ministry, began airing Spanish-language Catholic Church programming on Aug. 1. “I’m not disappointed at all,” Hagen told Times of San Diego. Instead, Hagen said he was proud of what happened with The Mightier 1090, which benefited from a 50,000-watt signal that reached throughout Southern California. “Absolutely,” he said. “We accomplished something that had never been done before and during a very challenging time in the economy and broadcasting.” Beginning in August 2020, Hagen, a passionate fan of sports talk radio since his youth in Phoenix, led the re-launch of The Mightier 1090. Hagen said he grew up listing to KTAR, a Phoenix news-talk-sports radio station featuring sportscaster Lee “Hacksaw” Hamilton, who relocated to San Diego in the 1980s. Hagan said his first job after college was at KTAR. The 1090-AM station, previously billed as “The Mighty 1090,” was a fixture in the San Diego radio market since its founding in 2003 by Broadcasting Company of the Americas. The station went off the air in April 2019 due to a dispute over leasing fees between BCA and Interamericana de Radio, the Mexican-based signal transmitter provider. At the time, Hagen said he had signed a local marketing agreement, including a five-year lease of the 1090-AM frequency, with Andreas Bichara Assad of Interamericana del Radio in Rosarito, the signal tower operator who previously battled with the now-defunct BCA. Since 1998, Hagen has owned and operated Out The Window Advertising, a Flagstaff, AZ-based advertising agency. But, he also has loads of experience in the radio industry. Hagen was involved with launching KMVP-FM 98.7 in Phoenix. Today, the station is the flagship station for the MLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks, NFL’s Arizona Cardinals, NBA’s Phoenix Suns and Arizona State University’s Sun Devils’ football games. “It was a daunting task to launch a radio station from scratch in 2020 during the pandemic when there were virtually no live sports taking place,” Hagen said. “I knew what it takes to launch a radio station and a tireless amount of work from a number of great people made it happen. The station had an iconic history in sports radio in San Diego.” Scott Kaplan, who had spent 16 years at The Mighty 1090, was the headline talk-show host during the four years of The Mightier 1090, although some of his shows were prerecorded. Today, Kaplan is the afternoon drive co-host at KSPN-AM ESPN 710 in Los Angeles. “I want to thank Andres Bichara and Scott Kaplan for their partnership in making all this happen,” Hagen said. “I know I can say that I certainly learned a lot with this endeavor and am better for it.” Lee “Hacksaw” Hamilton’s 26 years in the San Diego radio market included stints at XTRA Sports 690-AM (1987-2008) and The Mighty 1090-AM (2011-2017), two stations that preceded The Mightier 1090 ESPN Radio. “The Mexican ownership charged excessive licensing fees to program sports, an expensive talent-based format. Those fees sank 1090,” Hamilton told Times of San Diego. “Makes your heart ache what the hosts gave their stations and poured into the community, only to see decision makers in Tijuana do this to the signal and their hosts.” Creative Agency 62ABOVE Hires New Team Members San Diego creative marketing agency 62ABOVE has announced two new hires, including Jomary Jimenez as social media manager and Shanley Honarvar as public relations and social media coordinator. Jimenez, with 10 years of marketing experience, was previously with Orlando-based MayCom Interactive, a marketing consulting agency, and BCV Social, a Chicago-based social media marketing agency for hotels, resorts and hospitality clients. She also has worked with Retro Fitness in West Palm Beach, FL, Hotel Bennett in Charleston, South Carolina, Salamander Hospitality of Middleburg, VA, and Eden Roc Hotel in Miami Beach. A statement said Jiminez with work with 62ABOVE clients Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association, Go Lake Havasu and Qualcomm. Honarvar, who graduated from Loyola University Maryland in May 2023, was previously with Baltimore integrated marketing agency GKV as an assistant account executive during the past year. She also has worked with Savor Public Relations in Washington, DC and Butin PR in Charlotte, NC. The agency said Honarvar will work with Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort, San Diego Museum of Art, Love Catalina and The Viv Hotel. “Jomary and Shanley each bring a deep passion for tourism and hospitality with their impressive skill-sets in public relations and social media,” said Indra Gardiner Bowers, 62ABOVE’s chief communications officer. TV Reporter’s Foundation Offer Free Back-to-School Haircuts The Larry Himmel Neighborhood Foundation, named after the late San Diego TV personality and humorist Larry Himmel, is offering free haircuts and school supplies to boys and girls, ages 5 to 18, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, at Skyline Church, 11330 Campo Road, La Mesa. More than 600 children are expected to attend, according to Miles Himmel, foundation founder and Larry’s son. It’s the eighth annual back-to-school haircut day, he said. Barbers and hair stylists, including students and trainers, from the California Barber & Beauty College will volunteer their time and talents. The kids also will be treated to breakfast or lunch and given backpacks stuffed with school supplies, including notebooks, pens and rulers, along with tickets to various San Diego attractions, including sporting events, San Diego Zoo and San Diego Air & Space museum. The foundation is accepting donations to cover costs at larryhimmelfoundation.org. “A fresh haircut and essential school supplies can significantly boost a child’s self-esteem and readiness to learn,” said Himmel. “However, to make this event a success, we need the community’s support. Your generous donation will help us provide backpacks to children in need. Together, we can ensure that every child starts the school year with confidence and the necessary resources.” Over the years, the foundation has paid for Christmas gifts for homeless families, a new sandbox for special education students, new uniforms for cheerleaders, equipment and uniforms for Pop Warner players after their storage shed was vandalized, and financial aid to restaurants struggling during the COVID-19 crisis. Also, the foundation has paid for marriage license fees, roses and gifts for couples who get married on Valentine’s Day at the San Diego County Assessor-Recorder-County Clerk office at the County Administration Center. Larry Himmel, a feature reporter for 35 years with KFMB-TV, passed away in November 2014 from pancreatic cancer. He was 68. Shortly after Larry’s passing, Miles established the foundation in his father’s name that exists to help ordinary San Diegans in need. Larry Himmel, who grew up in Chicago, moved to San Diego in the 1970s and worked at bartending in Ocean Beach and stand-up at the Comedy Store in La Jolla. In 1979, he was hired at KFMB-TV’s Channel 8 news to host “Larry Himmel At Large” commentaries. Biden’s Final Ad Spending Tally Tops $300 Million Until the very end, before he dropped out, President Biden’s reelection campaign continued to spend money on advertising. According to AdImpact, an ad tracking firm, in the weeks leading up to Biden’s July 21 announcement to end his presidential re-election campaign, millions of Biden ad dollars were spent on ads in battleground states, including Pennsylvania ($35.3 million), Michigan ($26.3 million), Georgia ($21.4 million), Arizona ($16.2 million), Wisconsin ($15.5 million), North Carolina ($137.7 million) and Nevada ($11.4 million). As reported by Inside Radio, a trade publication, AdImpact’s analysis shows Biden aired more than three times as many broadcast TV ads as Trump in June. The vast majority of those ads (88%) were attacks on former President Donald Trump. Other top topics were abortion rights, character, healthcare, crime, abortion and Medicare. Also, AdImpact has tabulated how much President Biden spent on his re-election effort before dropping out. It says the Biden campaign spent $207 million, with 56% of those dollars targeting Facebook and Google ads. However, not all of Biden’s ad spending came from the campaign. When outside group spending is factored in, AdImpact says pro-Biden ad spending reached $301 million. Meanwhile, AdImpact says the Trump campaign is planning to run ads valued at $12.2 million in six swing states through mid-August. Also, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has reserved $50 million in ads through the Democratic National Convention, to be held Aug. 19 to 22.

Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.” While not explicit, the emphasis on serving the people of Arizona seemed to indicate to many that he intended to serve out his term and would not be joining the Harris ticket as she seeks the presidency and replaces President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate. However, the tweet he subsequently shared seemed to leave things more open for those looking to read between the lines. Kelly wrote, “Whether it was from my time in the Navy and at NASA, serving in the United States Senate, or visiting our troops overseas: I’ve learned that when your country asks you to serve, you always answer the call.” Kelly’s impressive resume has led to many supporting him as a potential candidate given his background as an elected representative from a swing state, serving as an astronaut and in the Navy, as well as being the husband of former representative Gabby Giffords. Giffords rose to national attention when she was shot in the face and ultimately resigned due to a severe brain injury, but has gone on to become an advocate for gun control alongside her husband. Harris is set to hold a rally with her vice presidential pick on Tuesday and reportedly reviewed vetting presentations about the candidates on Saturday. She is also reported to have been conducting interviews with potential VPs on Sunday. There had been concern within the Democratic Party about Kelly leaving the Senate, as it could have put his Senate seat at risk in the swing state. If Kelly were to leave to become vice president, while the Democratic governor could appoint a temporary replacement, the seat would go up in a special election in 2026. If Kelly were to remain in office, his next election isn’t until 2028. Others seen as frontrunners for the pick include Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.","summary":"The post continues to fuel speculation about who will join the current vice president on the Democratic ticket\n\n\nThe post Mark Kelly Appears to Exit Race for Kamala Harris&#8217; VP, Then Deletes Tweet: &#8216;My Mission Is Serving Arizonans&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/mark-kelly-drops-out-kamala-harris-vp/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1454058196.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 23:05:05","author":"Mike Roe","authors":["Mike Roe"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.104},{"id":253373954,"title":"'Veep' star Julia Louis-Dreyfus will be 'extra-involved' in the Kamala Harris campaign","text":"\"Veep\" actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus will likely attend the Democratic National Convention and be \"extra-involved\" to help elect Kamala Harris president, a new interview revealed Sunday. The Times of London spoke to Louis-Dreyfus about her upcoming projects as well as the renewed popularity of her comedy series \"Veep\" since Vice President Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. \"Veep,\" which aired on HBO from 2012 to 2019, starred Louis-Dreyfus as a comically inept fictional female vice president, Selina Meyer. In recent years, comparisons between the titular character and Harris went viral with detractors calling out the VP's so-called \"word salads.\" The comparisons may likely continue as the report showed Louis-Dreyfus will be campaigning for Harris. JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS IS 'DELIGHTED' BY 'VEEP' RESURGENCE AFTER HARRIS BID, HOPES IT HELPS HER CAMPAIGN \"Yet surely there will be even more confusion between Meyer and Harris because Louis-Dreyfus says she ‘will be extra-involved’ in the Harris campaign. Immediately after our interview she is recording an advert telling Americans abroad how to vote. Will she be at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this month? She hesitates, wary of revealing a spoiler. ‘I probably will be, yes,’ she says eventually,\" The Times of London wrote. Fox News Digital reached out to the DNC for a comment. Louis-Dreyfus was previously a host during the final night of the 2020 DNC, which was virtual. Her performance was panned by conservative commentators. Though she appreciated being linked to Harris, Louis-Dreyfus sought to distance the vice president from her fictional character, claiming many comparisons are motivated by sexism. \"Let me just say this,\" Louis-Dreyfus said. \"If Selina had any advice for Kamala, she had best not take it. I think Kamala is so intelligent she wouldn’t take the call.\" \"Female candidates are more scrutinized,\" she added. \"That is the reality, and we played into it and used it to our comedic advantage. There is an episode in which a character suggests Selina open a speech with ‘As a woman’ and she said, ‘I can’t identify as a woman! People can’t know that! Men hate that and women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women.’ So we used that for a lot of fodder.\" However, Veep series creator Armando Iannucci similarly rejected comparisons between Louis-Dreyfus' character and Harris. ‘VEEP’ PRODUCER ASSAILS ‘A—HOLES’ WHO COMPARE KAMALA HARRIS TO HAPLESS VP ON THE SHOW \"Selina Meyer is not Kamala Harris,\" Iannucci told The Hollywood Reporter. \"When we were making Veep, we didn’t have anyone in specific in mind…it really is not based on anyone.\" \"It’s nice that Veep has been watched again, but I wouldn’t want people to think that Kamala Harris is like Selina Meyer,\" he added. On the day after President Biden bowed out of the race, the television show gained a 353% increase in viewership for its first season on HBO Max, according to Luminate’s Streaming Viewership data.

So, I don't know. Is she Indian or is she Black?\" Heinrich asked Graham about Trump’s comments and asked if it alienated millions of Black voters, including from his state of South Carolina.

The troubled pop star, whose memoir The Woman in Me is set to become a major motion picture, is estranged from her 72-year-old dad due to the controversial conservatorship he presided over for 13 years. However, Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17, reportedly want to visit their grandfather after not seeing him for the past two years, according to TMZ. Dailymail.com has contacted representatives for Britney Spears, 42, and ex-husband Kevin Federline, 44, for comment. The outlet reported that the relationship between the boys, their dad and the elder Spears has softened over the years following the restraining order issued against Jamie in 2019 following his alleged altercation with Sean. The boys were also reportedly moved by their grandfather's ill health, which in 2023 resulted in his leg being amputated after doctors could not heal a massive infection. Britney Spears' sons Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17, reportedly want to visit their grandfather Jamie Spears at his home in Louisiana (Pictured in Los Angeles in July 2013) According to sources, the teens speak with their grandfather, who is now living in Louisiana, at least once every two weeks.

Their aunt, Jamie Lynn Spears, 33, lives in nearby Tennessee. She is mom to their cousins, Ivey, six, whom she shares with her husband James Watson, and Maddie, 16, whom the Sweet Magnolias actress shares with ex-fiancé, Casey Aldridge. No timetable has been set for the proposed visit and it's unclear if Britney is aware of the potential trip, according to TMZ. Both Sean and Jayden are reportedly open to a reconciliation with their mother as well, after they reconnected with her earlier this year. The Lucky singer spoke with her sons on Mother's Day, but are taking it slowly, according to Page Six. 'Obviously a reconciliation/reunification is somewhat complex and can be a process that takes some time,' Federline’s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan told the outlet in May. Jamie Spears, 72, has reportedly been in poor health, and had his leg amputated in 2023, following a massive infection in the limb.

'I’ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years,' she declared on social media in January. 'I’m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way!'

Byron Donalds (R-FL) on Sunday repeatedly questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity during an interview on ABC News, leading host George Stephanopoulos to chastise him for repeating Donald Trump’s “slur.” Appearing on Sunday interview show ‘ABC This Week,’ Donalds continued to run interference for the former president, who has so far refused to back down after his controversial remarks at the National Association of Black Journalists conference last week. Donalds told Stephanopoulos that Trump was only “responding to a question” and called the scandal a “phony controversy.” “If we’re going to be accurate, when Kamala Harris went into the United States Senate, it was AP that said she was the first Indian-American United States senator. It was actually played up a lot when she came into the Senate. Now she’s running nationally, obviously the campaign has shifted—they’re talking much more about her father’s heritage and her Black identity. It doesn’t really matter,” Donalds said, before trying to shift the conversation to the Trump campaign’s typical lines of attack against the vice president—her role as the “border czar,” the Biden administration’s foreign policy, and rising inflation. But Stephanopoulos repeatedly dogged the Florida congressman about repeating Trump’s questioning over her racial identity. “You just repeated the slur again. If it doesn’t matter, why do you all keep questioning her identity? She’s always identified as a Black woman, she’s biracial. She has a Jamaican father and Indian mother, she’s always identified as both. Why are you questioning that?” In response, Donalds claimed that Harris’ racial identity was “a conversation throughout social media right now” and told Stephanopoulos “lots of people are trying to figure this out. But that’s a side issue, not the main issue. Stephanopoulos cut the Florida congressman off before he could redirect the conversation. “You just did it again! Why do you insist on questioning her racial identity?” Donalds then claimed that Trump only “brought it up” at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday, while the original Associated Press story questioned her racial identity. “AP is the one that wrote the headline when she first came in to the United States Senate. It didn’t talk about her being black, it talked about her being the first Indian-American senator.” AP published a short news brief immediately after Harris won the election in 2016. The news agency quickly followed the brief up with a longer story, which refers to her biracial identity in the second sentence. “Now you’re saying that AP is the one that slurred Kamala Harris? Cause those are the facts. You can go to the internet and look at the clips George if you want to,” Donalds told the ABC host. “AP did not say that Kamala Harris is not Black,” Stephanopoulos said before moving on. “She is biracial. She is Indian, she is Black. You continue to repeat the slur, I don’t understand why you and the president do it, but it’s clear that you’re not going to say that it’s wrong. You’ve now established that for our audience.”","summary":"ABC NewsRep.

Harris, 59, is officially in the ‘Baby Boomer’ generation, even though she’s trying to mask her age and fit in with younger generations, including Gen Zers born after 1997. ‘Sorry, she’s a boomer. Rules are rules, slackers,’ wrote Washingtonian journalist Andrew Beaujon in 2020. ‘Kamala Harris was born October 20, 1964. It’s the very tail end of the Baby Boomer generation.’ Harris was recently was mocked after she was repeatedly filmed with a smartphone on speaker mode, holding it up to her ear, despite the audio blaring from the device during calls with former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, and with the widow of Alexei Navalny. It’s the kind of activity that screams ‘boomer,’ even as the vice president tries to emphasize her youthful persona as she runs her own campaign for president. Last fall, Harris launched a tour of American colleges, in an effort to shift her brand away from the aging President Joe Biden and toward Generation Z. ‘I love Gen Z,’ she said repeatedly as she made her way across the country. ‘Let me just tell you, I love Gen Z. I don’t know, something about — I love Gen Z,’ she said with a laugh at an event in July. ‘So, okay, for the older adults, this is going to be a humbling thing I’m about to share with you. If someone is 18 years old today, they were born in 2005. Oh, yeah, check that out. Think about that for a minute.’ At another event, she urged adults to have patience with their Gen-Z kids. ‘I love Gen Z. I really do. I — you know, I know it’s complicated if you have a Gen Z member in your family. But they’re so spectacular,’ she said during another event. Although she typically wears professional pantsuits a Vice President, Harris frequently talks about her love of Chuck Taylor tennis shoes and casual clothing when she’s not on the job on when she ran her first campaign. ‘I have a whole collection of Chuck Taylors: a black leather pair, a white pair, I have the kind that don’t lace, the kind that do lace, the kind I wear in the hot weather, the kind I wear in the cold weather, and the platform kind for when I’m wearing a pantsuit,’ she once explained to the Cut. As a presidential candidate, Harris frequently danced with young people, with marching bands, and even on her campaign stage as she expressed her love of music and dancing. She famously was caught on camera breaking it down to the song Q-Tip’s ‘Vivrant Thing’ in September when she hosted a party celebrating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop at the vice president’s residence. But even Harris admitted that despite her love of watching shows with her husband Doug she struggles to stay awake sometime. ‘We will sit on the couch in front of the TV with the switcher, for like 45 minutes debating which Netflix show we start streaming, and we weigh the pros and the cons of each and by the time we’re done we are ready to go for bed,’ she said. She also likes to brag about her language being ‘uncensored’ despite her office. ‘I am sure I’m the first Vice President to in front of the press to use the word ‘uterus,’ and then I didn’t stop there either, I said the f-word, I said fibroids,’ she said laughing. ‘I’m pretty sure, I mean we could do a fact check but I’m pretty sure no other Vice President has done that in public.’ Harris repeatedly used the actual f-word on stage, in an attempt to click with young people struggling to get ahead. ‘Sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open, and sometimes they won’t— and then you need to kick that f***ing door down,’ Harris said during a roundtable discussion with comedian Jimmy O. Yang in May. Harris made headlines after she joked about smoking pot in college and also her about love of ‘Snoop Dogg’, ‘Tupac’ and ‘Cardi B,’ in college with the crew at the Breakfast Club radio show. ‘I did inhale. It was a long time ago,’ she said, endorsing the legalization of marijuana. ‘I think it gives a lot of people joy. We need more joy in the world,’ she argued. Harris was ridiculed after she recorded an appearance with host Taraji P. Henson, where she made reference to popular rap songs for the July 2024 BET award show. ‘Yeah girl, I’m out here in these streets. And let me tell you, you’re right, Taraji. There is so much at stake in this moment. The majority of us believe in freedom and equality. But these extremists, as they say, they not like us,’ Harris said, referring to Kendrick Lamar song ‘Not Like Us.’ During the campaign trail, Harris frequently referred to her love of Marvel movies, and even compared her opponent Donald Trump to the Marvel villain Thanos. When asked about which Marvel superhero she would like to be she hesitated but ultimately chose the character Shuri from the Black Panther. Harris also once performed the Wakanda salute on television, announcing her run for ‘Senate’ of the fictional African nation as a joke with the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. As she runs for president again, Harris has toned down some of the Millennial-themed attempts to go viral. But her campaign still appears eager to recruit the boomer generation as she tries to rally the Democratic party. ‘It’s happening!!’ wrote Harris’ husband’s ex-wife Kerstin Emhoff on social media, sharing details of a campaign event with ‘Seniors for Harris.’ ‘Barb and Mike are excited to meet the Boomers!’ she concluded.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSince her first failed campaign for president, Vice President Kamala Harris has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Attempting to Connect with a Younger Audience: Kamala Harris, 59, Seeks to Relate to Gen Z and Youth Despite Age Gap first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/attempting-to-connect-with-a-younger-audience-kamala-harris-59-seeks-to-relate-to-gen-z-and-youth-despite-age-gap/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/02/23/87884097-13703821-U_S_Vice_President_Kamala_Harris_speaks_on_the_phone_with_former-a-9_1722638215976.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 22:32:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.326},{"id":253372966,"title":"Chris Murphy says 2024 election shows ‘a contrast’ between Harris and Trump","text":"Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) argued the 2024 presidential election, which is expected to be between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, will showcase “a contrast” to voters. Murphy was asked about how Harris’s campaign has changed her position on previously-held views, such as no longer wanting to ban fracking and wanting additional funding for border security. The Connecticut senator contended that the vice president “has always been for border security” and that this is part of the contrast voters can expect at the polls come November. “Today, border crossings are lower at the southwest border than they were at the end of the Trump presidency,” Murphy said on Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream. “There is a contrast between Democrats, Kamala Harris who’s serious about border security, and Republicans, who are not.” Murphy also said that democracy is about the majority of residents voting for a policy, and predicted that Harris will campaign on several reforms “to make democracy work better.” He argued this would compare well against Trump at the election, saying that the Republican nominee has “promised on day one to become a dictator.” The senator’s claim on Trump relates to comments the former president made last year, during which he said he would not be a dictator “except for day one.” Trump also vowed to secure the border and increase oil drilling during his interview should he become president again. In the wake of the interview, Trump waived off his dictator comment, claiming that it was made “in jest.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Since President Joe Biden bowed out of his 2024 reelection bid, many high-profile Democrats have endorsed Harris as his replacement for the candidacy, such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Biden himself. Murphy stated last month that these endorsements were not pre-organized and that none of them were aware of Biden dropping out until he announced it. Recent polling data found that Harris and Trump are statistically tied nationally and across the collective battleground states, with Harris having a 1-point edge nationally. Trump previously enjoyed a 5-point national head-to-head lead when the data was conducted with Biden before he dropped out.","summary":"Sen.

The multi-Grammy winner, 42, has already given the vice president permission to use her songs in her presidential campaign, but is set to go far further by donating to and endorsing Harris because she believes the ‘stakes are too high’ to remain silent. ‘Beyoncé has cleared her schedule to attend a Kamala Harris fundraiser,’ an insider claimed to DailyMail.com. The source said the singer had deliberately taken a step back from politics after hosting a fundraising campaign with her husband Jay-Z for Barack Obama in 2012. ‘Beyoncé decided to step back in after people close to her showed her Project 25.’ The radical Project 2025 plan was developed by allies and former officials as a blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration. However, Trump and his campaign have worked to distance themselves from Project 2025, with the former president going so far as to call some of the proposals ‘extreme’. DailyMail.com has contacted representatives of Beyoncé and Kamala Harris for comment. The source added that Beyoncé and Harris first met when Obama was campaigning in 2008, ‘but became close friends’ during the Joe Biden election. However, the pair have never been publicly seen together to date. In 2020, Beyoncé made a smaller show of support for Biden and Harris a day before the presidential election as she rocked a Biden-Harris face mask in an Instagram post. Now, the singer is ready to officially add her star power to Harris’ ongoing campaign – which began after Biden, 81, dropped out of the race for the White House on July 19. ‘She feels the stakes are too high and believes in Kamala’s vision for America,’ the insider stated, adding that the singer is even set to donate funds towards the campaign. The source explained: ‘She has set aside $4 million dollars to donate to the campaign, with plans to donate more if she sees the need to.’ Indeed, Beyoncé has already shown her support for Harris by authorizing the Vice President to use her song Freedom as the anthem for her campaign trail. The hitmaker is known to maintain strict clearance guidelines when it comes to her music, but was quick to grant Harris permission for the song, a source close to the Democrat’s campaign told CNN. It was claimed that the campaign team asked for consent just hours before Harris made her debut at her election headquarters. The move came after Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, revealed her excitement for a Harris run, calling her ‘new, youthful, sharp’ in an Instagram post. Knowles, alongside a photo of her with Harris, wrote: ‘You asked for it and our President Biden did what was best for the country! ‘Putting personal Ego, power and fame aside. That is the definition of a great leader. Thank you, President Biden for your service and your leadership. Go Vice President Kamala Harris for President. Let’s Go’. Over the years, Harris has been open about being a fan of Beyoncé and even accepted two tickets to enjoy the singer’s Renaissance concert last year – which were valued at $1,655.92. The Vice President and her husband Doug Emhoff went to the concert at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland in August 2023. She marked the occasion with an Instagram that read: ‘To the one of one, the number one, the only one, Beyoncé, thank you for a fun date night.’ So far, Harris has been publicly supported by a slew of famous names including Cardi B, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Legend, Cher, Barbra Streisand, Katy Perry, Spike Lee, Questlove, and Demi Lovato.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBeyoncé is set to make a sharp U-turn after years of political caution&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Beyoncé considering surprising change in her political stance after allowing Kamala Harris to use her music first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/beyonce-considering-surprising-change-in-her-political-stance-after-allowing-kamala-harris-to-use-her-music/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Beyonce-planning-shock-political-U-turn-after-letting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 22:24:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":253374342,"title":"Chris Christie Credits Donald Trump for Potential Democratic VP: He ‘Created Josh Shapiro’ | Video","text":"The GOP only has Donald Trump to blame if Kamala Harris chooses Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate, Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos and Donna Brazile on Sunday’s “This Week.” “And I’ll tell you this, if she picks Shapiro on Tuesday, Donald Trump created Josh Shapiro,” Christie began. “He endorsed [Doug] Mastriano, the weakest Republican candidate in that field,” he continued, explaining the 2022 campaign for governor in Pennsylvania. “What it allowed Josh Shapiro to do was instead of playing to his base to try to win a narrow election, he saw an opportunity for a coalition-building election. And that’s what he did.” Shapiro is on the shortlist of potential vice presidential picks for Vice President Kamala Harris, seen as a strong candidate due to his immense popularity in Pennsylvania, a key tipping point state in the 2024 presidential election. “So now [Shapiro’s] seen as a coalition builder because he did it,” Christie added. “But the only reason he could do it is because Trump made another ridiculously stupid endorsement by endorsing Mastriano, who was a flawed, weak, bad candidate.” Christie also addressed the former president’s claim that he will pardon those who were convicted of assaulting police officers during the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. “Trump’s been consistent, he says he’s going to pardon them, and what people need to understand about Donald Trump is what I’ve learned over 22 years,” Christie said. “When he says something, he’s going to do it. And so if he says he’s going to pardon those folks, if he’s elected, you could take to the bank that he will.” Christie’s comments contradicted those of Rep. Byron Donalds, who spoke with Stephanopoulos just before his conversation with Christie. Donalds insisted Trump would instead review the charges against the convicted on a case-by-case basis. Brazile commented on the racism inherent in Trump’s questioning of Harris’ racial identity earlier this week, as Donalds had also defended. The move is from “the playbook of the late ’60s and the ’70s,” she said, and reminiscent of Trump’s own questioning of President Barack Obama’s place of birth in 2011. “America is tired of this playbook,” she continued. “We’re tired of questioning people’s background simply because they don’t look like something or someone else. Donald Trump wants to be the arbitrator of who is an American, and he’s not. Is this strategy or impulse? Impulse.” You can watch the George Stephanopoulos interview on ABC’s “This Week” with Chris Christie and Donna Brazile in the video above.","summary":"New Jersey’s former governor says Trump’s \"ridiculously stupid endorsement\" of a weak Republican let Pennsylvania’s Shapiro build his coalition\n\n\nThe post Chris Christie Credits Donald Trump for Potential Democratic VP: He ‘Created Josh Shapiro’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/chris-christie-donald-trump-created-josh-shapiro/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chris-christie-shapiro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 22:20:56","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.626},{"id":253373388,"title":"Trump embraces MAGA activist at Atlanta rally who repeats his offensive claims about Harris’ heritage","text":"Donald Trump embraced conservative activist Michaelah Montgomery on stage at his Georgia rally before awkwardly quipping that he considered “never going back home to the First Lady”, when they first met at a Chick-fil-A restaurant in April. Montgomery spoke on stage on Saturday evening at a rally for the former president in the battleground state. She was featured in a video in April where she hugged Trump in the fast food restaurant, where he bought food for his supporters. Trump later took the stage and called Montgomery back up the stage as he recalled walking into the Atlanta Chick-fil-A in April, where she was behind the counter. Trump recalled Montgomery saying: “It’s president Trump. You saved my college.” “And I said: ‘How the hell do you know that?’” Trump added. He then said “this one,” pointing to Montgomery, is “so smart so sharp. She grabbed me she gave me a kiss. I said: ‘I think I’m never going back home to the First Lady!’” Montgomery then cut in, jokingly: “Shh, you were supposed to keep that quiet!” “For the average politician that’s death. For me, I don’t care,” Trump noted. Melania Trump has been notably absent from the campaign trail, although she did attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month. The former first lady wrote a touching tribute to Trump after he survived the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania last month. Before the attack, the Slovenian former model reportedly cut a deal with her husband: if he takes back the White House in November, she would not have to be constantly on first lady duty. Earlier at the Atlanta rally on Saturday, Montgomery defended Trump over the offensive remarks he made earlier this week about Kamala Harris’ racial background. “A few days ago president Trump said he didn’t know vice president Harris was a Black woman,” Montgomery said. “I’m trying to figure out what all the outrage is about because she’s only Black when it’s time to get elected.” Last week, Trump claimed at a conference of Black journalists that Harris “happened to turn Black” only recently, to groans from the audience. The former president then said: “Is she Indian or is she Black?” Harris was born in California. Her father, Donald Harris, was born in Jamaica and her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. Trump’s latest offensive remarks on race come as the former president has insisted in recent weeks that he and his running mate JD Vance are not “the weird ones” - despite Democratic messaging to the contrary. JD Vance shot back at Harris’ remark that he and Trump were “weird” at the rally on Saturday. He told the crowd that he thought a number of Democratic stances - like getting rid of conservative book bans and allowing trans-athletes to compete in sports - were “weird.” It’s “weird” that Harris “sounded like a Southern belle even though she grew up in Vancouver,” he also claimed.","summary":"Trump considered ‘never going back home to the First Lady’ after Michaelah Montgomery gave him a kiss at fast-food restaurant in April, he says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rally-melania-harris-birther-b2591032.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/04/18/SEI215739114.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 22:14:07","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":253374142,"title":"VP’s campaign launches ‘Republicans for Harris’ in push to win over GOP voters put off by Trump","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign on Sunday was launching “Republicans for Harris” as she looks to win over Republican voters put off by Donald Trump’s candidacy. The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” according to Harris’ team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said. The Harris campaign shared the details of the program first with The Associated Press before the official announcement. Her team is trying to create “a permission structure” for GOP voters who would otherwise have a difficult time voting for Harris. The effort will rely heavily on Republican-to-Republican voter contact, with the belief that the best way to get a Republican to vote for Harris is to hear directly from another Republican making the same choice. Trump’s “extremism is toxic to the millions of Republicans who no longer believe the party of Donald Trump represents their values” and will vote against him again in November, said Harris’ national director of Republican outreach, Austin Weatherford. He said the campaign would be “showing up and taking the time every single day to earn the vote of Republicans who believe in putting country over party and know that every American deserves a president who will protect their freedoms and a commander in chief who will put the best interests of the American people above their own.” Weatherford is a onetime chief of staff to former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who had endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket before President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump. Kinzinger is backing Harris once more as part of the launch. “As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,” he said in a statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House.” Kinzinger developed a national profile as one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The committee highlighted a number of Trump’s transgressions before and during the deadly attack as Congress tried to certify the results of the 2020 election that Biden won over Trump. Trump has done little to try to win over moderate Republican voters and on Saturday criticized anew Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who rebuffed Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election in the battleground state. Last month, when Biden was still at the top of the ticket, the campaign went out with an ad highlighting former Trump staffers’ criticism of their onetime boss.

The programme will be a “campaign within a campaign”, according to Harris’ team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. The programme kicked off with events in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said. The Harris campaign shared the details of the programme first with The Associated Press before the official announcement. Biden’s team is trying to create “a permission structure” for GOP voters who would otherwise have a difficult time voting for Harris. The effort will rely heavily on Republican-to-Republican voter contact, with the belief that the best way to get a Republican to vote for Harris is to hear directly from another Republican making the same choice. Trump’s “extremism is toxic to the millions of Republicans who no longer believe the party of Donald Trump represents their values” and will vote against him again in November, said Harris’ national director of Republican outreach, Austin Weatherford. He said the campaign would be “showing up and taking the time every single day to earn the vote of Republicans who believe in putting country over party and know that every American deserves a president who will protect their freedoms and a commander in chief who will put the best interests of the American people above their own”. Weatherford is a onetime chief of staff to former Representative Adam Kinzinger R-Ill, who had endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket before President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump. Kinzinger is backing Harris once more as part of the launch. “As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,” he said in a statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House.” Kinzinger developed a national profile as one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The committee highlighted a number of Trump’s transgressions before and during the deadly attack as Congress tried to certify the results of the 2020 election that Biden won over Trump. Trump has done little to try to win over moderate Republican voters and on Saturday criticised anew Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who rebuffed Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election in the battleground state. Last month, when Biden was still at the top of the ticket, the campaign went out with an ad highlighting former Trump staffers’ criticism of their onetime boss. A separate ad highlighted Trump’s often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as “birdbrain” and suggestion that “she’s not presidential timber”. Hundreds of thousands of registered Republicans voted in primaries for Haley even after she ended her bid for the 2024 Republican nomination and as Trump trounced her in almost every contest. Haley in May announced she would vote for Trump and appeared at last month’s Republican National Convention. The Harris campaign’s effort includes former Governors Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and 16 former Republican members of Congress, including Kinzinger and Representatives Joe Walsh of Illinois and Susan Molinari of New York.

The attack required surgeons to remove part of his skull to save his life. Pelosi mentioned she and her husband have not discussed the incident, with doctors advising against revisiting the traumatic experience. The assailant had been targeting her, and Pelosi has expressed feelings of guilt about the event. In her book \"The Art of Power,\" she recalls her daughter suggesting she give up her political career following the attack, but Pelosi reflects on her family’s blame towards certain elements of the Republican Party for demonizing her over the years, reported CBS News.\"My husband and I have never talked about this,\" Pelosi said. \"The doctors have supported that, because they don't want him to revisit it.\" \"He was looking for me,\" she added. \"Imagine the guilt of all of that – it's just a horrible thing.\"Pelosi's daughter, Alexandra Pelosi, urged her mother to leave public life after the attack. Pelosi reflects on this in her book and discusses the family's perspective on who is to blame. \"Well, I blame me. I mean, not blame me. I was the target. My family, frankly, blames certain elements of the Republican Party who had been demonizing me for about 20 years, every election and the rest – cloven feet, horns on the head, a horrible person, in flames, a devil, and all of that. The sad thing about my husband's assault was that they just made a joke of it. They thought it was funny. And people laughed. So, [Trump] was an instigator of violence and then made light of it.\"In the interview with CBS News Correspondent, Pelosi addressed rumors about pressuring President Joe Biden to drop out of his re-election campaign. She denied leading any such effort, expressing confidence in Biden’s ability to make the right decision.\"Well, I've never shared any conversations with a President of the United States publicly, no,\" Pelosi replied. \"Well, he knows that I love him very much,\" she said when asked if Biden was furious at her. \"No, I wasn't a leader of any pressure party. Well, let me say things that I didn't do. I didn't call one person. I did not call one person. I could always say to him, 'I never called anybody.' What I'm saying is, I had confidence that the president would make the proper choice for our country, whatever that would be, and I said that. 'Whatever that is, we'll go with.'\"When asked about Biden’s performance, Pelosi emphasized the importance of a more vigorous campaign and highlighted his accomplishments, such as leading the Nato Summit. \"My whole point was, whatever he decides, but we have to have a more aggressive campaign.\" \"He was in a good place to make whatever decision – the top of his game,\" Pelosi said. \"Such a consequential President of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of President of the United States.\"Pelosi's legacy as a leader in Congress spans 20 years, and she looks back on pivotal moments in her new book, \"The Art of Power\". \"There's certain episodes of our history that I played a major role in. So, I wanted to write about that just to show my side of it, what happened in the room where it happened, where I was,\" she said.Pelosi recounted pivotal events such as the financial bailout, Covid relief, the Affordable Care Act, and the attack on the Capitol on January 6. She vividly remembers hearing the mob targeting her during the insurrection and saying, \"Nancy, we're coming for you, b****.\"\"It was an insurrection instigated by the President of the United States. He now tries to disassociate himself from it, blaming it on me and everybody else. But that's the way he is. This was instigated by him,\" said Pelosi.She also recalled her reaction to Trump's statement about marching to the Capitol, expressing her willingness to confront him. \"If he comes, I'm gonna punch him out for trespassing on the Capitol grounds. I'm gonna punch him out, and I'm gonna go to jail, and I'm going to be happy.\" \"I knew that I would have to pay a price, to go to jail,\" Pelosi said, \"but I would be happy to do that.\"Pelosi remains determined to prevent Donald Trump from returning to the White House, considering him a motivator for Democratic organization and fundraising. \"He should never set foot again in the White House – never should have, and shouldn't again.\"When asked about Trump’s choice of Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, Pelosi responded with amusement. \"I think it was a great choice!\"Pelosi also offered advice to Kamala Harris on how to handle the campaign against Trump. She said, \"Just be yourself. It's the same advice I give to women – be yourself.\" She then dismissed attempts to portray Harris negatively, suggesting a focus on everyday issues. \"The opposition – the Trump people and he and JD Vance – are trying to portray Kamala Harris as being 'weird.' 'She's a radical, left-wing, San Francisco crazy lady. She's weird and she's nuts.'\" \"Well, the thing is, there's no question that they understand I make people laugh at them. And that's what they don't like, is to be laughed at. On the other hand, what I have always said about Trump and now – I don't know that much about Vance, but what we do know is menacing.\" \"So, what should Harris say? Just talk about kitchen-table issues – ignore him,\" said Pelosi.Though no longer in House leadership, Pelosi is running for re-election to her Congressional seat from San Francisco. On being asked if she had ever been asked to run for President, Pelosi said, \"I haven't been asked, but I was encouraged to put my name in there sometime for vice president. I said, 'Why would I want to be vice president?' I'm a legislator. I love legislating. People have to understand it's serious work. I mean, you really have to listen. What is the judgment you bring as to what priorities can prevail? What is your strategy to get it done? It's constant. It's constant. And it's being respectful of all kinds of points of view – inside maneuvering, outside mobilization. It's great. I love being a legislator.\"","summary":"Nancy Pelosi discussed the traumatic attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, in which he was severely injured.

Tim Walz, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — at her Washington, D.C., residence on Sunday ahead of a final decision on her running mate. Harris is expected to announce her choice as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Reuters was first to report. The Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters. Harris met with her vetting team on Saturday, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to sources familiar with the process. She met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday and is also meeting candidates virtually, the sources said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are the other candidates in contention for the job. The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said. The choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris’ political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month. Her shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters. Harris’ decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests. Shapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza. “There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,” said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. “Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.” His handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Some labor groups have also criticized Kelly for not supporting proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate. Walz has become a favorite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump. At 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden’s departure over concerns about his age. Walz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and “supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair. Trust me.”","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Vice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Sen.

Dreyfus, who played the fictional vice president Selina Meyer on HBO’s Veep, told London’s Sunday Times this week that comparisons between her character and the current vice president are “inevitable.” But, she said, “If Selina had any advice for Kamala, she had best not take it. I think Kamala is so intelligent she wouldn’t take the call.” Though Veep ended in 2019, the show recently celebrated a resurgence in popularity following Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 election (in season three, Meyer became the first female president after the sitting POTUS stepped aside, which prompted many memes comparing the situations to real life). Louis-Dreyfus met Harris in 2022, where the actress said they talked about “How much Veep got right in terms of the culture of Washington, both behind the curtain and in front of the curtain,” adding that the now-Democratic nominee “was a big fan of the show.” Now preparing to support Harris in the 2024 general election, Louis-Dreyfus reflected on the similarities between the fictional character and the nonfictional potential future president. “Female candidates are more scrutinized,” she said. “That is the reality and we played into it and used it to our comedic advantage. There is an episode in which a character suggests Selina open a speech with ‘As a woman’ and she said, ‘I can’t identify as a woman! People can’t know that! Men hate that and women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women.’ So we used that for a lot of fodder.” Louis-Dreyfus also spoke about her reaction to Donald Trump’s running mate, J.D. Vance, who recently came under fire for resurfaced comments in which he referred to Harris as a “childless cat lady.” Harris is stepmother to two adult children with her husband Doug Emhoff, and many on the left responded to Vance’s perspective with outrage. “I thought, You poor fucking idiot,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “These guys can’t help it. They can’t help it!” The actress also said she sees similarities between Vance and Veep character Jonah Ryan. “I think in the last few years the culture of politics has become much more venal,” she said. “So when we started we were pushing against reality, but now less so, certainly in terms of the nastiness of the communication.” Creator Armando Iannucci recently told The Hollywood Reporter he wasn’t sure if he could make a show like Veep today because “there are no rules anymore. If something happens, you just say, ‘Oh well, it didn’t happen.’ You just flip it around and just say, ‘No. The opposite happened.’ So, there are no rules.” Showrunner David Mandel echoed part of Iannucci’s comments when he told THR, “We need things to calm down and heal before Veep’s sort of horrible outlook on the world returns. I think it’s funnier when things are going well and we joke about how bad things are, then when things are going badly. But boy, it makes me think a lot about the show in a really good way. I love people taking about the show and sharing it.”","summary":"Though the real world&#8217;s political similarities to Veep may seem increasingly dramatic, show star Julia Louis-Dreyfus is sure Kamala Harris has it more under control than any fictional counterpart ever did.

While the three leaders appear likely to be Harris’s final three contenders, it is unknown whether other names that have reportedly spoken with Harris, such as Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY), are still being considered. The meetings on Sunday are being described as a “chemistry test,” according to the New York Times, as Harris is set to campaign with her running mate this week in various key swing states. Kelly, Shapiro, and Walz have all received significant encouragement from their supporters, but a post by Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker on Friday raised eyebrows as to who the front-runner may be. The post appeared to be showing Shapiro would be picked as Harris’s running mate, although others had suggested that it could be campaigning for Shapiro to get the spot.

While betting markets are not definitive indicators of political outcomes, they often reflect insider information and public sentiment, making them a closely watched barometer in political circles.Other notable contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, whose odds have improved to +900, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear at +1400. Both have been touted for their ability to win in traditionally Republican-leaning states, a quality that could prove valuable in a national campaign.The surge in odds for Shapiro and Walz has overshadowed other potential candidates who were once considered strong contenders. Former presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg now stands at +3500, while Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's odds have lengthened to +15000.These shifts in betting odds come on the heels of comments made by renowned election predictor Allan Lichtman, who recently identified Shapiro and Kelly as favorable choices for Harris. Lichtman, known for his accurate predictions in nine of the past ten presidential elections, emphasized the importance of selecting a running mate who could be trusted to assume the presidency if necessary.Lichtman's focus on Pennsylvania's importance in the electoral map aligns with Shapiro's strong position in the betting odds. Pennsylvania counts for 19 Electoral College votes and no Democratic candidate has won the election without the Keystone State since Harry Truman in 1948. Pennsylvania has voted Democrat in every election since 1992, save 2016, when Donald Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Separately, for the first time since launching her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris is predicted to win the 2024 election, according to the online prediction market PredictIt. The platform shows Harris as the favorite to win in November, with shares of a Harris victory being sold for 52 cents, while shares for a Donald Trump victory are being sold at 50 cents.However, other betting platforms show that Trump maintains a lead over Harris. On the Polymarket betting platform, Trump has 55 percent odds compared to Harris' 43 percent, though his lead has shrunk since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.Recent polls have shown Harris reducing Trump's lead compared to when Biden was on the ticket. A Morning Consult poll conducted after Biden ended his campaign showed the former president only 2 points ahead of Harris, a narrower margin than the 4-point lead he held over Biden in a previous survey.","summary":"Shapiro and Walz emerge as frontrunners in betting markets on eve of Harris' VP pick, with dramatic shifts in odds reflecting last-minute speculation.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-josh-shapiro-tim-walz-vice-president-1934413","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442580/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 21:40:51","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"sports","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.054},{"id":253370978,"title":"Which Kamala Harris are we getting, if recession hits we’re screwed and other commentary","text":"From the Right: Which Kamala Are We Getting? Vice President Kamala Harris “owes it to the country to confirm, out loud, in person, and on the record,” whether she has “abandoned the positions she held when running for Senate” or in a Democratic presidential primary, demands the Washington Examiner’s Timothy P. Carney. For more than a decade, she’s “staked out extreme and destructive policy proposals.” Some of those positions included “socializing America’s health insurance industry,” “defunding ICE” and “banning fracking.” Essentially, “on immigration, fracking and socialized medicine, we have no idea what Harris believes.” The presumptive Democratic nominee has touted “far-left stuff when she needed to win far-left votes,” but “now her priority is winning moderate votes.” Which raises the question: “Was she lying back then, or is she lying now?” Libertarian: If Recession Hits, We’re Screwed “A bummer of a jobs report” Friday triggered “a sharp drop in the stock market” and stoked fears of recession — “thanks to something known as the ‘Sahm Rule,’ ” flags Reason’s Eric Boehm. That rule, named for economist Claudia Sahm, says, basically, when unemployment is significantly higher than the previous year’s low-point, recession is likely to follow, based on the record for the past 50 years. Yet if a recession hits now, “there’s literally no money for stimulus checks.” Sahm doesn’t think we’re on the cusp of recession, but is worried. But “the outlook is certainly darker after Friday’s jobs report.” And “if a recession is coming,” the governments ability to respond “will be severely limited by the poor fiscal and monetary decisions that have left the Treasury deeply in debt and the central bank’s balance sheets overstretched.” Conservative: Dems’ Vote-Buying Blitz “To gild Kamala Harris’s path to the White House,” the Biden administration will be “buying . . . constituencies,” warns The Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley A. Strassel. “The ‘Biden-Harris administration’ this week announced ‘the next step’ in its sweeping student-loan giveaway,” and, among other goodies, “federal departments in recent weeks larded out millions in new grants for women’s health, state climate programs, tribal fisheries, youth ‘skills’ development,” plus goodies for other “core Democratic demographics.” “These White House gifts and promises are designed to smooth over cracks in the base and to tantalize activists and donors . . . Republicans can’t stop this grifting, but they commit political malpractice by continuing to ignore it — allowing Mr. Biden, his unpopular agenda, and these latest expressions of far-left pandering to recede to an afterthought.” Liberal: Harris Voters Are Nothing Like Obama’s “The Harris coalition bears more resemblance to the Biden coalition” than it does to Barack Obama’s, notes The Liberal Patriot’s Ruy Teixera — except “without as many working-class voters.” Or “the Hillary Clinton coalition . . . but with far fewer white working-class voters.” Harris, per a New York Times poll, is losing working-class voters by 15 points; Obama won them by 4 points. “Obama’s massive 67-point margin” with nonwhite, working-class voters dwarfs Harris’ 29-point margin. “It is difficult to look at these data and not see profound differences between the Obama coalition and the emerging Harris coalition.” “None of this means Harris can’t win.” But now she and her team are “on a narrow, polarized path to November and their reckoning with Donald Trump.” Fiscal Watchdog: FDNY Pensions Burn Taxpayers Recently retired NYC firefighters and fire officers “were entitled to average annual pension benefits of $151,676, up six percent from the prior year,” reports the Empire Center on Public Policy. “Among the 470 new retirees with at least 20 years of service, nearly eight out of ten (399) were eligible for six-figure pensions; 79 were eligible for pensions over $200,000.” And though “the total number of retirees remained consistent over the last decade, the share of retirees eligible for six-figure pensions has soared,” nearly tripling. Who got the highest pension?

After they emerged from the four-day meeting held behind closed doors, which ended on July 18, they put a glowing stamp of approval on Xi’s core views and vision for how the party should build the world’s second largest economy into a modern socialist nation by 2035, with more than 300 reform measures to be completed by 2029. China’s cheerleading state media have since fired on all cylinders, praising Xi as a visionary leader committed to reform and opening up, showing the way forward not only for China but the rest of the world. Behind closed doors, however, Chinese leaders are believed to have spent quite some time talking about another man who could throw a spanner in the works, more than 10,000km away. Donald Trump’s likely election to the White House for a second time in November and its ramifications for China was a hotly discussed and debated topic, according to one source familiar with the thinking of the Chinese leadership. After all, US-China relations took a decisive turn for the worse in 2018 when the then American president launched a trade war against China as part of his administration’s efforts to ramp up geopolitical rivalry with Beijing. Chinese officials had been eyeing the rising chance of Trump’s return with great interest even before the third plenum – so-called because it was the third meeting of the party’s five-year cycle – after US President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance on June 27 and the assassination attempt on Trump on July 13, two days before the meeting started. They may not acknowledge this publicly but Trump 2.0 could have profound ramifications for how China will carry out Xi’s vision of reform and opening up. Trump may not be the reason that the sweeping 22,000-word reform blueprint released after the meeting is heavy on high-sounding slogans and light on details. It has been the party tradition that a key meeting like the third plenum focuses on long-term commitments, leaving the specifics to be sorted out by the relevant departments in the coming months. But it may just fit the thinking of the Chinese leadership as they need to wait and see if Trump wins. The prevailing sentiment among China watchers is that Trump 2.0 will worsen bilateral ties between the world’s two largest economies, already at a historic low. Trump has declared in recent interviews that he would consider even higher tariffs on Chinese imports if elected. The concern is understandable, but a potential Trump presidency may not be all gloom and doom for bilateral ties, from a Chinese point of view. First of all, the Chinese leadership has long concluded that whoever enters the White House next, Trump or Kamala Harris, it is unlikely to lead to any notable improvement in ties. The best they can hope for is to stabilise the relationship when China wants to focus on growing the economy at home. In many ways, Trump’s signature transactional approach to US leadership in international affairs could work in China’s favour geopolitically. In a recent interview, Trump reaffirmed his long-held scepticism over defending Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese mainland. Trump 2.0 could help dial down the temperature over the Taiwan issue, which Beijing considers the most important red line in bilateral ties. Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports could deal a major blow to China’s exports and manufacturing, but it should be read in the global context that he would go after everyone that runs a trade surplus with the US, including the European Union. Furthermore, his repeated warnings to Nato allies to increase their defence spending – Trump advisers have reportedly floated the idea of demanding an increase in spending to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, a higher target than they had agreed to – would heighten tensions between Washington and these European nations. All this could provide a much-needed opportunity for China to disrupt the united Western front that Washington has cobbled together to resist the perceived rising and assertive influence of Beijing. China’s foreign policy priority is thus expected to focus on repairing and restoring ties with European countries, which have been hit by Beijing’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising trade tensions. To improve its fraught ties with Europe, Beijing must be seen doing more to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. It seems to be starting to do just that. Late last month, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi hosted his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Guangzhou, the first time a Ukrainian foreign minister has visited China since Russia’s invasion. On the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Laos late last month, Wang also met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss the Ukraine situation, among other topics. This has given rise to speculation that China is stepping up efforts to mediate in the Ukraine crisis. This has come as J.D. Vance, Trump’s running mate for the US vice presidency, said a second Trump administration would try to quickly negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine so that Washington can focus on China. Whether Vance plans to use China as an excuse to swiftly end the Ukraine war, or even whether that is Trump’s real intention, remains to be seen but a potential Trump presidency has provided an urgent catalyst for China to recalibrate its foreign policies.

Like all federal judges, Supreme Court justices serve lifetime appointments on the court.\"The United States is the only major constitutional democracy that gives lifetime seats to its high court Justices,\" a fact sheet from the White House reads. \"Term limits would help ensure that the Court's membership changes with some regularity; make timing for Court nominations more predictable and less arbitrary; and reduce the chance that any single Presidency imposes undue influence for generations to come.\"The White House said Biden would support reform in which presidents appoint justices every two years and justices spend only 18 years of active service on the Court—a timeline that aligns with what many critics of the Supreme Court have called for.During an interview appearance on Fox News Sunday, anchor Shannon Bream spoke about Biden's reform and asked Gorsuch, a conservative justice, \"How does the Court feel about potential changes to term limits?\"In response, Gorsuch said he would not \"get into what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.\"Gorsuch continued: \"I have one thought to add. The independent judiciary...what does it mean to you as an American? It means when you are unpopular, you can get a fair hearing under the law and under the constitution. If you're in the majority, you don't need judges and juries to hear you and protect your rights, you're popular. It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you. When the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.\"Newsweek has reached out to the White House via email and the Supreme Court via online form for comment.Biden's effort to reform the Highest Court comes after conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the Court, faced criticism for accepting undisclosed gifts and holding perceived biases in cases involving Trump and Thomas' wealthy benefactors. In addition, Samuel Alito faced recent criticism over a photograph of an upside-down American flag being flown outside his home just days before Biden's inauguration and days after the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.Thomas has defended the relationship between the donor of the undisclosed gifts as he previously said in a statement, in reference to a 2019 trip, which involved flying to Indonesia on the donor's private jet that he was \"advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable.\"In a statement previously emailed to The New York Times, Alito placed all the responsibility of flying the inverted American flag, a symbol often referred to as \"Stop the Steal\" that has been used by supporters of Trump, on his wife, Martha-Ann Alito. The justice wrote he \"had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag\" and that it was \"briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"Both justices have declined to recuse themselves from Trump-related cases, prompting Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, to file articles of impeachment against them last month. However, the impeachment attempt is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House.In addition, the conservative majority, which has three justices who were appointed by Trump, has also faced backlash after a series of controversial rulings issued just before the end of its term in July.\"These scandals involving the justices have caused public opinion to question the court's fairness and independence that are essential to basically carrying its mission of equal justice under the law,\" Biden said during an event commemorating the Civil Rights Act last month.Biden is also said to be considering whether to back a constitutional amendment that would eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other top officials—a way to counter the 6-3 Supreme Court decision on July 1 that granted broad presidential immunity in a ruling connected to Trump's federal election interference case. He has pleaded not guilty in the case.While the Supreme Court adopted its first code of conduct in November 2023, it was immediately met with criticism as it lacked a means of enforcement.However, Biden's efforts come as he has six months left in office as they have little chance of being approved with less than 100 days to go before Election Day, but experts say it's an effort that could become a key campaign issue.Legal analyst and senior legal affairs columnist at The Los Angeles Times, Harry Litman wrote in an op-ed piece on Tuesday that Biden's proposals were more than \"a mere political gesture\" in the last 100 days or so of the election.\"Biden and the Democrats are also playing the long game, looking in particular to make the court a campaign issue,\" he wrote. \"Then if they win control of both chambers and the White House, they can portray their election as a mandate for substantial reforms.\"","summary":"Biden last month released a new three-part plan to reform the nation's Highest Court, calling for there to be term limits on justices, among other plans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/neil-gorsuch-two-word-warning-joe-bidens-supreme-court-plan-1934399","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442553/neil-gorsuch.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 21:26:52","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":253371858,"title":"Pelosi claims Biden’s face should be added to Mount Rushmore","text":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argued in a new interview that President Joe Biden is a “Mount Rushmore kind of president” and indicated his face should be included as part of the iconic monument.

She has become the only candidate in half a century to become the presidential nominee without winning a single primary vote. Biden’s vice got enough delegate votes in the virtual roll call process to become the official Democratic nominee. Interesting how not winning votes has had an uncanny way of getting this severely unqualified woman one cackle closer to the Oval Office. But the shock and awe does not stop there, so be advised to have a seat. The absolutely, positively 100% legitimate corporate media monstrosity with blood-soaked hand to its heart reports: Harris is now more popular than Joe Biden or Donald Trump have been at any point in the 2024 election cycle. Yes, a Morning Consult poll of 11,538 registered voters between July 26 and 28 found 50 percent have a favorable opinion of the sitting vice president, while 46 percent have an unfavorable opinion. According to the pollster, “Harris’s 4-point net favorability is a higher rating than Biden or Trump have posted all cycle.” Is anyone really buying any of this, aside from those people who would rather see Donald Duck, for example, as commander-in-chief than Donald J. Trump? Incidentally, let’s not forget that this is the same unbelievable, super-sensational candidate who had her presidential dreams (temporarily) demolished in less than five minutes by a tenacious Tulsi Gabbard during the 2020 Democratic primary debates. The problem, however, had nothing to do with the deeply unlikeable Deep State darling, of course, but rather with a little problem known in the world of politics as cash flow, the primary grease responsible for slipping the most despicable people into positions of power over the years. As CNBC reported shortly after the debate debacle, “[w]ith Harris falling behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, among others, some of Harris’ lead bundlers have struggled to convince members of their networks to write checks to her campaign. In some cases, many of her supporters have told the campaign that they will not host events for her.” Now, just four lackluster years later, without a serious signature project to call her own, cash is no longer a problem for female, Black and Asian-American Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s ultimate DEI hire. The Harris campaign announced over the weekend it had raised $310 million in July, more than double Trump’s take last month, thereby strongly pointing to the obvious: for whatever reason, the money and media machine is churning in high gear for the political left, as it has since time immemorial, and woe to the mortal who thinks this has anything to do with power-hungry vultures perched on Capitol Hill, waiting for their next feeding time. And this is where Trump has all the reason in the world to distrust the merchants of media – even if they happen to be the notorious backstabbers at Fox News – as it plays ‘neutral’ arbitrator in the upcoming debates. As proof, as if proof were needed, here is something that Harris and not some AI-generated body double uttered just a few days ago during a rally: “Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself,” the invisible border czar told a crowd of worshipful supporters. “And when I am president, I will actually work to solve the problem.” The fact that Kamala Harris is able to utter such inanities without any pushback or laugh track shows that the media is seriously gas-lighting the American people, and not playing fair with Trump. But in the perennial fight against left-wing media forces, Trump has a knack for being his personal Darth Vader, namely due to his willingness to speak his mind, and occasionally the truth, no matter who it hurts. In a less moronic age that was known and welcomed as candidness. Consider, for example, the extremely hostile interview the former president had during a conference of the National Association of Black Journalists last week. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly,” Trump said with regards to his political opponent. “And she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” “I respect either one,” he added, “but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and… she became Black... Somebody should look into that, too.” “Is she Indian or is she Black?” he asked totally unfazed despite the hisses from the crowd. In these maddeningly diverse times, this is not the first time a politician was called out for not being Indian, Black, Sequoia, or what have you. In 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren went through the embarrassment of a DNA test to prove that she was, as many suspected all along, a very White Democrat from Massachusetts and not a member of the Cherokee Nation tribe. The question of race, however, was not so obvious when it came to Harris. Here, Trump provided his opponent – and the vexatious media – with an unnecessary box of free ammunition by questioning Harris’ Black identity as the wagons were circling. And as much as it would be entertaining to run with the line that Harris has concealed 50% of her racial lineage for most of her lifetime, that would be twisting the facts. Harris, 59, is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother – both legal immigrants. And although her parents went their separate ways when Harris was just seven years old, and she went on to live with her mother, that did not prompt an alienation from Black culture. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, she was brought up in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Berkeley, Calif., because, she said, “her mother thought her daughters would one day be seen as Black women and wanted them to have strong role models around them.” Harris went on to attend Howard University, a historically Black institution in Washington, D.C., and is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a Black sorority. Needless to say, the White House had a field day with Trump’s reckless foray into such foreign affairs. “What he just said, what you just read out to me, is repulsive, is insulting,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify.” While it is questionable as to whether Trump was actually telling Harris who she was, how millions of Black Americans will interpret Trump’s comments is another matter. Regardless, he has set himself up for what could be a very uncomfortable – even disastrous – exchange with Harris, who, as a far less accomplished speaker than The Donald, will jump on any opportunity to play the victim card. And Trump may have just unwittingly handed her the ace of spades. On top of the race card, Trump will also be entering the lion’s den as a climate-change-denying “convicted felon,” misogynist, and an anti-abortion supporter – quaint little sound bites that Harris is certainly remembering by heart. However this tragicomedy plays out, expect lots of handwringing and lecturing from the female (check), Black (check), Indian (check) candidate as she attempts to portray herself as the deserving underdog in a white man’s game.","summary":"The former president should be cautious about challenging the VP on her gender and race credentials \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/602112-kamala-harris-trump-debate/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.08/article/66af850985f5401ffa6f3882.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 21:11:58","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":253370230,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Husband Doug Emhoff Confirms Affair During First Marriage: 'I Went Through Some Tough Times'","text":"Doug Emhoff is speaking out about an extramarital affair that occurred during his first marriage to Kerstin Emhoff.

Harris began to lead the former president on July 31, according to the data published on Sunday. Harris now leads Trump with 45.5% of the expected vote, compared to Trump’s 44.1%. According to Silver’s calculations, Harris now has 50.5% chance to win the general election, compared to Trump’s 48.8%. Harris also now has a 65.9% chance to win the popular vote—but the predicted elector share remains close, with the vice president only beating Trump by about 18 votes in the Electoral College. The same model had independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. polling at about 5% in the general election. Silver founded the popular polling blog FiveThirtyEight in 2008, but left the website in May 2023. FiveThirtyEight’s most recent polling averages are almost identical to Silver’s. In a model published on Friday, the blog now published by ABC News had Harris slightly leading Trump with 45% of the vote, compared to the former president’s 43.5%. The election is too close to predict, FiveThirtyEight concluded. Silver has a mixed record with calling elections. FiveThirtyEight gave Biden an 89% chance at defeating Trump in the 2020 presidential election—a bold prediction that eventually proved accurate. However, he also gave Hilary Clinton a 71% chance of winning on the eve of the 2016 general election. Silver’s newsletter was published after a week of promising polls for the vice president showed Harris gaining an advantage in key swing states. A Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll published last Tuesday showed Harris gaining leading Trump by single-digits in Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada, and leading by a staggering 11 points in Michigan. The same survey showed Trump ahead in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and the two candidates tied in Georgia. However, other models have not shown Harris taking the lead over the last week. The New York Times’ poll tracker still has Trump leading the vice president in Pennsylvania and Michigan, with the pair tied in Wisconsin. The Times’ model has Trump ahead by one point in the general election—but that lead shrinks to a draw if you include Kennedy.","summary":"ELIJAH NOUVELAGE/Getty ImagesVice President Kamala Harris has overtaken former President Donald Trump in the race for the presidency for the first time in the calculations of one of the nation’s most popular poll watchers.\n\nAccording to a model published by Nate Silver’s substack on Sunday, Harris has now taken a slight lead against Trump for the presidential election in November.\n\nSilver’s model, which compiles the results of statewide polls and weights them based on reliability, showed Trump polling ahead of the Democratic candidate for most of July—including during the weeks immediately after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.

There is no evidence to support widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election or Arizona's 2022 gubernatorial election.On Sunday, Gallego's campaign launched \"Republicans and Independents for Ruben,\" a coalition of 40 Arizona Republicans and independents—which include current and former elected officials as well as industry experts, business owners and community leaders—who have endorsed the congressman.\"I am running for the U.S. Senate to represent all Arizonans, regardless of where they live or what political party they align themselves with. We may not agree on everything, but we can find common ground on one essential goal: building a better Arizona. And as a Marine combat veteran, a Congressman, and a dad of two, that is one fight I will never give up on,\" Gallego said in the press release announcing the coalition on Sunday.He continued: \"I am honored to have the support of so many local elected officials, business leaders, and community members who contribute so much to our state and look forward to continuing to work with Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike to deliver for Arizona.\"Newsweek has reached out to Gallego's campaign via email and Lake's campaign via online form for comment on Sunday afternoon.Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, is among the members of the coalition.\"I am a lifelong Republican. But I cannot in good conscience stand on the sidelines while extremists like Kari Lake, who have hijacked our party for the sake of personal gain, undermine the very fabric of what makes America exceptional. Ruben Gallego is a Marine, a strong leader, and a good man, and in this election, the health of our democracy matters more than party affiliation. I am proud to endorse Ruben because Arizona needs him as our next U.S. Senator,\" he said in the press release.Randy Hartless, the mayor of Parker, Arizona, has also endorsed Gallego.\"I am proud to endorse Ruben Gallego for the U.S. Senate because he embodies the leadership we need to navigate the challenges facing Arizona, especially for our rural communities. Ruben's commitment to tackling housing affordability and job opportunities for hardworking families, investing in education, and protecting our water future align with those we hold dear in Parker. This is a pivotal moment for the future of rural Arizona, and I am confident that Ruben Gallego is the right choice to represent all of us in the Senate,\" Hartless said in the press release.Gallego, who ran unopposed, won his state's Democratic primary election with 497,510 votes. Lake, meanwhile, won the GOP primary in Arizona with 408,217, which was 55.3 percent of the vote. Her primary opponent Mark Lamb, Pinal County sheriff, put up a good fight, winning 39.6 percent of the vote (292,226 votes). This means that there is a chance for Gallego to try and reel in voters who did not choose Lake in the primary.The other members of the \"Republicans and Independents for Ruben\" coalition include: Councilwoman Julie Spilsbury of Mesa Pete Hershberger, former Arizona state representative Chris Herstam, former Republican majority whip of the Arizona state House Steve May, former Arizona state representative Robin Shaw, former Arizona state representative Roberta Voss, former Arizona state representative Karen Bonds, former mayor of Parker Neil Giuliano, former mayor of Tempe, Arizona Robin Arredondo-Savage, former Tempe city councilmember David Luna, former Mesa city councilmember Paul Charlton, former U.S. attorney under President George W.

Emhoff, who is now married to Vice President Kamala Harris, responded on Saturday to claims that he had an extra-marital affair, first reported by the Daily Mail. “During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,” he said in statement to CNN. He was married to film producer Kerstin from 1992 to 2008 and the pair have two children, Ella and Cole, who are now young adults. The Mail reported that the couple split after Kerstin discovered the affair. She did not respond to that allegation in her statement. “Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago,” she told the Washington Post. “He is a great father to our kids, continues to be a great friend to me and I am really proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala, and I have built together.” The affair allegedly happened over 15 years ago with a former teacher at a private school where both Emhoff children attended and who also worked as a nanny for the family, the Daily Mail first reported. A source told the outlet that she became pregnant by Emhoff but did not keep the child. The Independent is not naming the woman but has contacted her for comment on the claims. The tryst ended years before Emhoff and Harris began dating, CNN reported, and Emhoff had told the vice president about the affair long before they got married. The affair had come to light during the vice presidential vetting process in 2020, the outlet added. The revelation comes weeks before the Democratic National Convention and one day after Harris secured enough delegate votes to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. This isn’t the first time Kerstin Emhoff has come out in support of her ex-husband and Harris. After a clip resurfaced of Trump’s running mate JD Vance calling Harris a “childless cat lady”, Kerstin came to the vice president’s defense. She told CNN: “These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.”","summary":"Doug Emhoff was married to film producer Kerstin from 1992 to 2008","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/doug-emhoff-kerstin-harris-affair-b2591072.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/26/21/2162454713.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EVw9u5MS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-04 20:59:57","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.442},{"id":253369612,"title":"RFK Jr says he dumped dead bear in Central Park after ditching plan to skin it in bizarre video","text":"He had a bear-y unique experience. Independent Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy appeared to fess up to being one of the culprits who dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park a decade ago — after abandoning a plan to skin it. Simmingly trying to preempt a forthcoming story from the New Yorker magazine, Kennedy, 70, bizarrely recounted in a video posted to social media how some of his buddies were drinking and thought it would be a good idea to dump the dead bear off in the park and “make it look like he got hit by a bike.” The Kennedy scion insisted that he wasn’t drinking when he opted to put an “old bike in his car” — that someone asked him to throw away — next to the deceased animal. There had been a spate of local biking accidents that were making headlines at the time. “Everybody thought that’s a great idea. So we went and did that and thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,” Kennedy recounted in a video posted on X that featured sitcom actress Roseanne Barr. A media frenzy quickly ensued in 2014 after a woman discovered the dead bear under some bushes concealed in part by a bike. The bear was described in reports at the time as a cub, though Kennedy simply called it “a young bear.” “I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were like helicopters flying over it. And I was like ‘Oh, my God, what did I do?'” he said. “I was worried because my [finger]prints were all over that bike. Luckily the story died after a while.” Locals were puzzled by the sudden appearance of the dead bear at the time and many people were horrified. Kennedy claimed in the video that he stumbled upon the dead bear while trekking through New York state for a falconing trip in Goshen, New York. During his ride up there in the wee hours of the morning, Kennedy claims that a woman in front of her hit a bear with her vehicle and killed it. “So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear and it was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,” he recalled. The environmental lawyer explained that he planned to obtain a bear tag for a road kill bear and put the meat in his refrigerator later. But the falconing trip ran late. He then had to dash over to New York City instead of heading back to his home in Westchester County due to a dinner that he needed to attend. At that point, he realized he needed to go to the airport, but had the dead bear in his car. All of this prompted his decision to dump the dead bear in Central Park. “This was the little bit of the redneck in me,” Kennedy quipped. Kennedy predicted that the forthcoming reporting about his handling of the dead bear would be negative. Kennedy is averaging 5.5% in presidential polls compared to former President Donald Trump’s 44.6% and Vice President Kamala Harris’ 44.8% support in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of a five-way national race. For context, the RCP aggregate had him at 8.7%, President Biden at 39.2% and Trump at 43.4%.","summary":"Independent President hopeful Robert F.

Inside the center’s large ballroom and exhibit space, thousands of attendees dressed in costumes or wore cat ears, furry tails and shirts with hiss-terical puns as they strolled and gawked at hundreds of exhibition stands selling cat-related merchandise and products. But amid the sea of feline aficionados, 43-year-old Shannon Peace stood out for a different reason — her shirt. Printed on the front, it read: “Childless Cat Ladies for Kamala.” “I had a different shirt picked out for today; it had several cats and it said: ‘Ew, people,’” she said, chuckling. “But then he made those comments.” Peace was referring to Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who made headlines last week when a video clip of a 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson resurfaced in which Vance likened Democrat leaders to “childless cat ladies.” \"We are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,” he said. “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.” Harris has two stepdaughters and Buttigieg was in the process of adopting twins at the time. But the clip, along with others in which Vance described people without children as “sociopathic,” “psychotic” and \"deranged,” went viral on social media and sparked widespread backlash, including from celebrities such as comedian Chelsea Handler and actor Jennifer Aniston. “All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” she posted on her Instagram story. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Vance later addressed his remarks on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" and said they were a sarcastic comment toward the Democratic Party. “It’s not a criticism of people who don’t have children. … This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child,” he said. But for Peace, the senator’s remarks felt like an attack on her. “You're talking about me, this is who I am: I'm child-free by choice, I have cats by choice. It’s like he pointed a finger at me, and I didn't appreciate it,” she said. “I’m someone who never misses a chance to vote, and I do have a stake in the future of this country, so I was very offended by it.” At the convention, she said many people were complimenting her on the shirt. “The feedback that I'm getting is not so much about him, which I love, nobody is saying his name, nobody cares about him, it's this idea that we need to stop marginalizing people,” she said. “I think people are over it … and to act like anybody has less stakes in this country or is a lesser person because of the choices they made is repugnant to most of us.” Cat conventions are anything but political. That much was noticeable at Saturday’s event, where guest speakers and panelists never brought up Vance or his remarks. Instead, they focused on informing the public about research studies and improving the health of cats. Elsewhere at the convention, families, couples and single men and women stood in line to adopt kittens. More than 100 would be adopted by the end of the day. Some people stood in line to take photos with cat celebrities or members of the Australian Firefighters Calendar. Among them was Virginia Sambrano, 72, of Lawndale, who was attending the convention for the first time with her daughter. She said she was interested in meeting the firemen after seeing them on the TV. She said she took a photo with them and purchased their calendar. “I’m a Gemini, so I’m sure I’ll enjoy June,” she said, laughing. Asked if Mr. June had signed her calendar, Sambrano paused. “Oh, I need to go back.” Susan Michals, founder and organizer of the convention, said the two-day event — now in its ninth year — serves as a gathering place for people to celebrate cat culture together while also receiving information on the latest trends and products. But CatCon, which attendees have described as the Comic-Con for cat people, is also trying to debunk the “cat lady” myth. “Frankly, ‘cat lady’ used negatively is sexist,” Michals said. “It implies the opposite of a fulfilled woman, but this isn’t the 1900s anymore,” As for Vance, Michals said his remarks were simply divisive. “I don’t really think about him, but he obviously thinks a lot about cat people.” It was a few minutes past 11 a.m. when Melissa Bell, 36, arrived at the Felinious vintage clothing booth. Bell said that since hearing the remarks made by Vance, she had been hoping someone had designed a T-shirt taking a dig at the senator. Dangling on a hanger at the booth that morning, Bell said she spotted a black shirt that read, “Childless cat lady ready to force my misery on conservatives.” She immediately purchased it. Dug Rusinek, 39, owner of Felinious, a clothing brand based in Florida, said the idea for the shirt originated from an Instagram post he made shortly after hearing the senator’s remarks. He said people were telling him to create a T-shirt out of it, so he did. “We’re just guys in a cat ladies’ world,” he said. “We’re just out here to support the ladies.” Rusinek said he didn’t agree with Vance’s remarks. “I don’t understand people who have issues with pets, or cat ladies,” he added. “Women shouldn’t be birthing machines.” He said people who don’t have children can still care about the world and questioned why global warming wasn’t more concerning to conservatives if they cared about families and children. Nearby, Bell took a photo holding her new shirt. It was the first time she and her roommate had attended the convention. They had learned about it on social media. “So far we’re having a good time,” she said. “I love that so many people love cats this much.” Bell said she and her roommate planned to look at various knickknacks and make a stop by the adoption center. She said that she recently lost her two cats — Boogers and Shy Guy — and that both were more than 10 years old when they died. “They lived a long, happy life,” she said. Bell said that until now she’s always had a cat, adding that she felt pretty certain a kitten would be adopted by the end of the day. “I’m pushing for the cat,” she said, chuckling. “[My roommate] doesn’t know it but we’re buying a cat today.” By the end of the day, she would successfully adopt a kitten, naming it Homer.","summary":"The ninth annual CatCon was held at the Pasadena Convention Center, where some cat owners shared their opinions about JD Vance's 'childless cat ladies' remark.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-04/at-cat-con-some-pounce-at-jd-vance-over-childless-cat-ladies-remark","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/09f96b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7719x4052+0+396/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F77%2F128d266d4a599194a4e2a6605932%2F1469664-me-0803-catc","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 20:53:52","author":"Ruben Vives","authors":["Ruben Vives"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":253372230,"title":"Elon Musk’s X Is Spreading Deepfakes of Kamala Harris","text":"For the second time in less than two weeks, a doctored video of Vice President Kamala Harris has spread widely on Elon Musk’s social media platform X. A video known as a “deepfake” that was posted on X on Saturday appears to show Harris repeating herself over and over again, using a crude audio rendering made to seem like Harris is struggling to finish a complete sentence. The altered video uses footage from an appearance by Harris and President Joe Biden following Friday’s historic prisoner swap that freed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and others. The video is obviously manipulated and easily debunked by viewing the unaltered footage (you can watch that here at about the 1:30 mark), which shows Harris speaking smoothly, without repeating the same words and phrases as portrayed in the doctored video. The video, whose origin is unclear, was posted by Trump himself on Truth Social on Saturday, accompanied by a rant in which he calls Harris “DUMB!” and “extremely Low IQ.” The video was soon re-shared on X by an account that posts content verbatim from Trump’s feed on Truth Social. That account on X has more than 800,000 followers, and, as of late Sunday, the post containing the Harris deepfake had drawn more than 620,000 views. The video appears to be in violation of X’s terms of service, which prohibit the sharing of “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm.” (It also appears to violate Truth Social’s terms of service, which requires that posts “are not false, inaccurate, or misleading”—a tall order, perhaps, given that platform’s owner.) This latest deepfake comes after one shared by Musk himself eight days earlier, which doctored a high-profile Harris political ad titled “Freedom.” In that one, the fake audio using Harris’s voice depicted her calling herself “the ultimate diversity hire” and degrading President Biden. “This is amazing,” Musk wrote in his post sharing the video, accompanied by a laughing emoji. Musk’s post, still online, has received more than 134 million views. When asked for comment about the latest video falsely showing Harris garbling her words, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung doubled down on the content, claiming that the obviously phony video was authentic. (“Your phone or computer must be fucked up,” he said.) Cheung did not respond to questions about who may have doctored the video and whether Trump’s post on Truth Social violates that platform’s terms of service. Spokespeople for X did not respond to emailed questions about these videos violating the site’s terms of service, whether X is taking any steps to crack down on deepfakes, or why the one posted by Musk on July 26 remains online. Other forms of disinformation targeting Harris, including racist and misogynistic content, have proliferated across social media. But the reach personally enjoyed by Musk and Trump through the platforms they own is bigger than that of most. As Harris has been steadily gaining on Trump in recent polls, the spread of deepfakes targeting her on X seems no coincidence alongside Musk’s evolving views about Trump. He once declared the ex-president too old to hold office again. Now Trump has Musk’s “full endorsement.”","summary":"For the second time in less than two weeks, a doctored video of Vice President Kamala Harris has spread widely on Elon Musk&#8217;s social media platform X.

It is a campaign to make Vice President Kamala Harris look like she could be -President. Even a few weeks ago all of this would have seemed impossible. Joe Biden was clearly unable to run for re-election this year. But he and his family insisted otherwise. Eventually the Democratic Party came to their senses and gave him the heave-ho anyway. But as they did that, they knew they had one big problem still ahead. What to do about Kamala? After all, Harris had been appointed as Vice President in 2020 for a very specific reason. Despite the party condemning anyone who says this now, she really was a diversity hire. In 2020 the left-wing media and Democratic Party insisted that old Joe had to choose a black woman as his running mate. He said that he was down to a list of four black women and then chose Kamala. He did so despite the fact that she had used her time on the 2020 Democratic debate stage to call him a racist. Having been a prosecutor and then a senator, Kamala just kept falling upwards. But to fall as high up as she might be about to is still quite something. Even until this past month the idea that Kamala might actually be the candidate was fantastical. The Democrats knew they had to put their best fighter out there against Donald Trump in the election this year. And anyone who thinks Kamala is their best fighter needs their head examined. Except that the Democrats knew one thing above all — they couldn’t move her aside. Once Joe Biden exited the race for the White House this year, they always knew there would be the problem of Harris. Weird speeches How could a party dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion disregard not only Joe Biden but also the first Black female Vice President, Kamala Harris? The answer is that they couldn’t. So they didn’t. Some people clearly had reservations. Former President Barack Obama was reported to be among them. But Kamala and her team ended up securing her nomination in super-quick time. Eventually even the reluctant Obamas fell in behind her. And now the November election is set to be between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Republicans may have been pleased with this idea just a few months ago, as many believed Harris was a weaker candidate compared to Biden. She had too many faults to list. Where even to begin? She had failed at the few tasks she had been given as Vice President. Soon after coming to office, Biden gave Harris the task of trying to control the inflow of illegal migrants at the southern border. Not only did she fail to do that, but illegal migration actually rocketed upwards during the Biden-Harris years. Then there were the almost uniquely weird speeches. Clips of Harris speaking have been a viral phenomenon for the past four years. She tends to repeat phrases that she believes are profound, such as discussing the distinctions between the past and the future. Or how great yellow school buses are. Or something about falling out of a coconut tree. And then there are the mannerisms. Not least the bizarre laughter which she would break into on occasions. She even did it early on when an interviewer asked how she could be the running mate of someone she had called a racist just a few weeks earlier. “It was a debate,” she replied. “It was literally a debate.” And she laughed like a drain all the time she was saying this — as though it was a universally agreed joke to smear someone and then work with them. All the time she actually gave the strange impression that she realised she had been promoted way above her capabilities and was doing what she could to cope with it. But now all of this has been forgotten. Now that she is the candidate, the American Left has swung behind her. It is the Kamala reboot. And strangely enough it seems to be working. The media is in full swoon mode. “Kamala-lot” is just one headline of recent days — making a link between Kamala and the “Camelot” era of JFK and Jackie Kennedy. Some polls even show it is working. Young women seem to have swung behind her. Real problem As does a significant share of the black vote. And she does actually present a real problem for Trump. We don’t yet know if they will do a TV debate. But if they do, she may well bring out his worse instincts. And if he talks over her, bullies her or insults her, a significant number of swing voters will see him as disrespecting not just a woman, but a black woman at that. Republicans used to think Kamala would simply be the worst candidate for their rivals to run. Turns out she may well be the worst. But she could also win.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nONE of the most fake ­election campaigns of all time is currently&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris winning the US election is a major concern first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/kamala-harris-winning-the-us-election-is-a-major-concern/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-very-worst-thing-about-Kamala-Harris-is-that-she.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 20:38:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.608},{"id":253372590,"title":"Americans ‘Getting Whacked’ by Too Many Laws Says Justice Who Made It Possible for States to Ban Abortion","text":"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch opined that too many laws and regulations in America can impinge on fundamental liberties. It’s a rich statement coming from a man who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, thus allowing states to put women or their doctors in jail for endangering or aborting a fetus. “Too little law and we’re not safe, and our liberties aren’t protected,” Gorsuch told The Associated Press in an interview about his forthcoming book, Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law. “But too much law and you actually impair those same things.” In the wake of the end of Roe, fourteen states have criminalized abortion, and another 14 states and territories have become “hostile” to abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, meaning lawmakers are moving toward an abortion ban. In Louisiana, lawmakers have made even possessing abortion pills without a valid prescription illegal, so those found with mifepristone and misoprostol who can’t present a prescription could face large fines and jail time. Earlier this year, a caucus representing House Republicans endorsed a national abortion ban — something Donald Trump and vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance have previously supported. But apparently those aren’t the kinds of laws Gorsuch meant when he said: “There were just so many cases that came to me in which I saw ordinary Americans, just everyday, regular people trying to go about their lives, not trying to hurt anybody or do anything wrong and just getting whacked, unexpectedly, by some legal rule they didn’t know about.” Gorsuch also spoke on Fox News about the proposed Supreme Court reforms put forth by the Biden Administration. “I just say: Be careful,” Gorsuch warned. He added that an independent judiciary “means that when you’re unpopular, you can get a fair hearing.” President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris proposed court reform following stories of Justice Clarence Thomas’ undisclosed gifts and vacations funded by right-wing, Nazi-obsessed billionaire Harlan Crow as well as the court’s ruling that Donald Trump and other former presidents have immunity against prosecution for official acts committed while in office — a decision that shocked even the Trump team. Biden and Harris called for Congress to impose 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices and for a binding code of ethics “that require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.” Gorsuch declined to comment on the proposed reforms specifically, citing a desire to stay out of campaign issues during an election cycle. “I’m not going to get into what is now a political issue during a presidential election year,” he said. “I don’t think that would be helpful.” Last month, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan publicly supported the idea of an enforceable ethics code. “It’s a hard thing to do to figure out who exactly should be doing this and what kinds of sanctions would be appropriate for violations of the rules, but I feel as though we, however hard it is, that we could and should try to figure out some mechanism for doing this,” Kagan said.","summary":"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's forthcoming book argues that \"too much law\" can infringe on liberties","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/americans-whacked-too-many-laws-gorsuch-1235073913/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243792556.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 20:33:00","author":"Peter Wade","authors":["Peter Wade"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":253368704,"title":"Kamala Harris Now Leads Donald Trump in Three Different Polling Averages","text":"As of Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, leads former President Donald Trump in this year's tight election in three major national polling aggregators.The polls come two weeks after President Joe Biden's unprecedented decision to withdraw from the race and endorse Harris. Since then, she has garnered widespread support from the party and is poised to lead the Democratic ticket in November.With the biggest lead for Harris, FiveThirtyEight's national aggregator poll puts her 1.6 percentage points above Trump in the national election, with 45.3 percent to Trump's 43.7 percent.Aggregate polls are constantly updated as new polling data is added, shifting the averages in real time.Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin presidential forecast shows Harris with a slightly narrower lead, at 45.5 percent compared to Trump's 44.1 percent. According to the model, Harris pulled ahead of Trump on July 31, by 0.2 percent, and has been slowly increasing her lead since.Race to the WH, shows the smallest lead for Harris, just .2 percent above Trump. It shows Harris garnering 47.3 percent and Trump 47.1 percent. If third-party candidates are included, the forecast shows Harris pulling ahead at 44.7 percent, Trump at 43.7 percent, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 5.7 percent, and Cornel West at 0.7 percent.However, three other national aggregate polls show Trump leading Harris, such as The New York Times, which finds Trump ahead of Harris by 1 point, 48 to 47 percent. However, when third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is included in the poll, Harris and Trump drop to an even 44 percent.Similarly, The Hill's aggregation, based on 97 polls, shows Trump leading Harris by 1.1 percentage points, with 47.6 percent to her 46.5 percent, while RealClearPolitics shows Trump with a 0.8 percent lead, at 47.7 percent to Harris' 46.9 percent.All of the aggregate polls reveal a nail-biting presidential election where candidates are constantly inching up or down based on new poll inclusions.Newsweek reached out to Harris and Trump's campaign for comment.The presidential election is determined by Electoral College votes. Candidates must secure 270 electoral votes to win the presidency, which is not always accurately reflected in national aggregate polls, as state-specific victories are necessary to secure electoral votes.Individual polls of battleground states, which often carry a significant number of electoral votes, also show a tight race between Trump and Harris.A recent CBS News/YouGov survey of 3,102 registered voters, conducted between July 30 and August 2, shows Harris leading in one battleground state, Trump leading in three, and a tie in three other swing states.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in three national poll aggregators, while Trump leads her in three others.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-now-leads-donald-trump-three-different-polling-averages-1934405","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442564/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 20:28:35","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.022}]}
