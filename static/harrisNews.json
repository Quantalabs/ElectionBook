I decided to find out more about her.\n\nIn 2024, the European Parliament named a building after her, where German actress Julia Jentsch, who won two film awards in 2005 for playing her in the movie Sophie Scholl — The Final Days, spoke about her life and times.\n\nSophie joined the short-lived and non-violent White Rose student resistance to the Nazi regime. She and her brother Hans distributed pro-democracy and anti-Nazi leaflets. They were seen by a Nazi supporter and quickly arrested. It was the fourth year of the war and millions of Germans publicly supported Hitler and would be terrified to oppose him. It meant certain arrest and death.\n\nBefore she died on February 22, 1943, she said: “How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone willing to give himself individually to a righteous cause? Such a fine, sunny day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter if, through us, thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?”\n\nHer brother Hans was executed on the same day, and their friend Christoph Probst, within a few minutes of each other — 5pm, 5:02pm, and 5:05pm. Six seconds from when she was slid on a board under the guillotine to her death. Hans shouted in German: “Long live freedom.” \n\nThe three were buried side by side in a Munich cemetery. \n\nThere are still those who speak up for the imprisoned and oppressed by regimes. They sometimes are killed, as they were. Resisting and ending brutal regimes continues in our times.\n\n Mary Sullivan, College Rd, Cork\n\nSweet dreams\n\nIn her column about sleepless women, Esther McCarthy mentions Cpap machines. One in five women suffers from sleep apnoea. The best thing to do is get your sleep-deprived (and probably angry) other half to record you on their moby, take the recording to the GP, and ask to see the sleep specialist.\n\nIn my case, I borrowed the loan of a pulse oximeter and wore it for a week before showing the data to a GP, who dismissed it as “a gimmick”, to which I responded: “I don’t care. I want an appointment with the sleep consultant.”\n\nRather reluctantly, he agreed. Now I wear the Cpap machine’s ‘Hannibal Lecter’ mask at night but I sleep soundly.\n\nSome might think it is a passion killer but, on the other hand, if your sleep partner is getting an uninterrupted night’s sleep, they might be more amenable towards the kissy kissy stuff.\n\nOne in three men suffer from sleep apnoea. An additional problem for men post-andropause (the male version of the menopause that no one ever mentions) is prostate enlargement, which can mean many trips to the wee house during the night.\n\nThis can be alleviated somewhat by eating a handful of chopped sunflower seeds and a handful of chopped pumpkin seeds, and taking a Saw Palmetto capsule every day. Additionally, avoid drinking much after about 8pm because what goes in — a few hours later — is going to come out.\n\n Pascal Ó Deasmhumhnaigh, Inis Córthaidh, Co Loch gCarman\n\nTrump’s conspiracy\n\nAmongst the baskets full of executive orders signed by the recently inaugurated US president, I haven’t, despite my best efforts, found any order citing the protection of dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, from being eaten by illegal immigrants from Haiti.\n\nThis animal welfare issue was of serious concern to Mr Trump during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris on September 10, 2024, whereafter he was strongly supported by his vice president Mr Vance, a senator for Ohio, who confirmed that the Haitian community had “caused a lot of problems” in the area. “It’s led to animals disappearing,” he said.\n\nWith such engrossed concern from both the incoming president and vice-president, it defies logic that the matter wasn’t a leading choice on the Oval Office menu.\n\n Michael Gannon, St Thomas’ Sq, Kilkenny","summary":"The story of the anti-Nazi activist should remind us that there are still those who speak up for the oppressed","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/yourview/arid-41566912.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8973/4486894_8_seoimage1x1_696183.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:10:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":286415916,"title":"Kanye West issues bizarre apology to former US vice-president Kamala Harris","text":"The West Australian\n\nConfidential\n\nBest Short Film\n\nCompetitions\n\nCamera IconKanye West Credit: BANG - Entertainment News\n\nKanye West issues bizarre apology to former US vice-president Kamala Harris\n\nBANG - Entertainment NewsBang Showbiz\n\nFebruary 3, 2025 8:05AM\n\nYour Local News\n\nShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to InstagramShare to YoutubeEmail UsGet Digital Edition","summary":"After causing a storm by posting a sexually explicit comment about her on social media in a since-deleted message on X, Kanye West has issued a bizarre apology to former US vice-president Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/kanye-west-issues-bizarre-apology-to-former-us-vice-president-kamala-harris-c-17594616","image":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-17594616/ea73152d01f5643244ddcdc02145b51f3e432817-16x9-x0y192w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:05:35","author":"BANG - Entertainment News","authors":["BANG - Entertainment News"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.025},{"id":286413152,"title":"Bianca Censori goes completely naked at Grammys with fully dressed Kanye West","text":"Kanye West and Bianca Censori have made a statement at the 67th Grammy Awards (Picture: Jon Kopaloff/WireImage)\n\nBianca Censori has worn a completely sheer dress to the Grammy awards 2025.\n\nWhen arriving at the music event with husband Kanye West she was wearing a fluffy black jacket but quickly shredded it.\n\nThe 30-year-old architect dropped the coat to reveal the transparent garment beneath it, and as she was not wearing any underwear her body was completely exposed.\n\nThe sheer item was paired with perspex thong heels and her hair was slicked back, while her makeup was kept minimal.\n\nMeanwhile rapper Kanye, 47, was fully dressed in a black t-shirt and trousers as they walked into the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.

The DNC’s meetings included a land acknowledgement, multiple shrieking interruptions by angry protesters, and a general affirmation that its strategy had been sound, except perhaps insufficiently committed to legalistic race and gender essentialism.\n\nThe good news about the DNC, for those who prefer that the country have a politically viable alternative to the authoritarian personal cult currently running it, is that the official Democratic Party has little power. The DNC chair does not set the party’s message, nor will it determine its next presidential candidate.\n\nThe bad news is that the official party’s influence is so meager in part because it has largely ceded it to a collection of progressive activist groups. These groups, funded by liberal donors, seldom have a broad base of support among the voting public, but have managed to amass enormous influence over the party. They’ve done so by monopolizing the brand-value of various causes. The climate groups, for instance, define what good climate policy means, and then they judge candidates based on how well they affirm those positions. The same holds true for abortion, racial justice, and other issues that many Democrats deem important. The groups are particularly effective at spreading their ideas through the media, especially (but not exclusively) through the work of progressive-leaning journalists, who lean on both the expertise that groups provide and their ability to drive news (by, say, scolding Democratic candidates who fall short of their standards of ideological purity).\n\nThe 2020 Democratic primary represented the apogee, to that point, of the groups’ influence. The gigantic field of candidates slogged through a series of debates and interviews in which journalists asked if they would affirm various positions demanded by the groups. That is how large chunks of the field wound up endorsing decriminalization of the border, reparations, and other causes that are hardly consensus positions within the Democratic Party, let alone the broader electorate. It is also how Kamala Harris came out for providing free gender-reassignment surgery to prisoners and migrant detainees, which became the basis of the Trump campaign’s most effective ad against her.\n\nThe ongoing influence of the groups can be seen in a new New York Times poll. Asked to list their top priorities, respondents cited, in order, the economy, health care, immigration, taxes, and crime. Asked what they believed Democrats priorities were, they cited abortion, LGBT policy, climate change, the state of democracy, and health care. That perception of the party’s priorities may not be an accurate description of the views of its elected officials. But it is absolutely an accurate description of the priorities of progressive activist groups.\n\nThe poll is a testament to how well the groups have done their job. They have set out to raise public awareness of a series of issues their donors care about, and to commit the party to prioritizing them, and they have done so. Democrats in public office may be mostly engaged in fighting about the economy, health care, and other issues, but they lack the communications apparatus controlled by the groups, which have blotted out their poll-tested messages in favor of donor-approved ones.\n\nOver the last year or so, and especially since Harris’s defeat, some centrist-commentators have begun to question the groups’ influence. But the DNC meetings offered no evidence that their thinking has gone out of style.\n\nIf Democrats learned from Harris’s campaign that they should try to stop holding events that are easily repurposed as viral Republican attack ads, they showed no sign of it over the weekend. When activists repeatedly interrupted speakers, they were met supportively. “Rather than rebuff the interruptions,” observed the Wall Street Journal reporter Molly Ball, “those onstage largely celebrated them, straining to assure the activists they were actually on the same side and eagerly giving them the platform they broke the rules to demand.”\n\nNeither Harrison, nor his successor, Ken Martin, has questioned Joe Biden’s decision to run for a second term, nor any of the messaging or policy that contributed to his dismal approval ratings. When MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart asked one panel of candidates if they believed racism and misogyny contributed to Harris’s defeat, every panelist agreed. “That’s good, you all pass,” he said. (Note that this diagnosis of the election result has no actionable takeaway other than that perhaps the party should refrain from nominating a woman or person of color.)\n\nThe most sadly revealing outcome of the meeting may be the elevation of David Hogg as vice chair. Hogg, a 24-year-old activist, rose to prominence as a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and then quickly assimilated the full range of progressive stances—defund ICE, abolish the police, etc.—into his heavily online persona. And despite the horrific experience he endured, he does not seem to be notably wise beyond his years. After the far-right activist and pillow peddler Mike Lindell gained prominence as an election denier, I joked online that progressives needed their own pillow company. (The joke, of course, is that there is obviously no need for your pillow company to endorse your political views.) The next month, Hogg went ahead and turned this joke into reality, founding Good Pillow, before resigning a few months later.\n\nHogg’s takeaway from the 2024 presidential race is that Democrats lost because they failed to rally the youth vote with a rousing message on guns, climate, and other issues favored by progressive activists. Polling, in fact, showed that young voters had similar issue priorities as older voters, but Hogg’s elevation was a tribute to the wish masquerading as calculation that Democrats can gain vote share without compromising with the electorate.\n\nSome Democrats observed the events of the weekend with wry fatalism. At one point, a protester in a Sunrise Movement t-shirt interrupted by shouting, “I am terrified!”\n\nShe was not alone.","summary":"At a meeting of the DNC, the party seemed to be at pains to demonstrate it learned nothing from its 2024 defeat.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/dnc-meeting/681548/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/L1S9wK-Hl0zEDAaPFPJir04iz5A=/0x0:2000x1042/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/02/HR_AP25032620391618/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 23:40:12","author":"Jonathan Chait","authors":["Jonathan Chait"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":286414472,"title":"Ticker: CBS to hand over Harris transcripts","text":"CBS says it will turn over an unedited transcript of its October interview with Kamala Harris to the Federal Communications Commission, part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing fight with the network over how it handled a story about his opponent.\n\nTrump sued CBS for $10 billion over the “60 Minutes” interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good.

He claimed on stage that MTV had only wanted Swift at the event for ratings purposes, causing Swift’s stance on him once again to shift. \n\nThe next year, West released his song “Famous,” which featured the lyrics: “I feel like me and Taylor Swift might still have sex/ Why? I made that b**** famous.”\n\nAfterward, West and his then-wife Kim Kardashian leaked a phone call that appeared to show Swift approving to have her name used in the song. While she denied the claims, many still branded her a “snake,” prompting her to take a step back from the public eye. \n\nShe reflected on the backlash in a 2023 interview with Time magazine, admitting that it felt like “a career death.” “Make no mistake — my career was taken away from me,” Swift said. \n\nWest’s unhinged Instagram activity comes hours after he made equally baffling X/Twitter posts.\n\nIn a series of seemingly unrelated tweets, West claimed that he is a billionaire, praised Donald Trump and apologized to Kamala Harris, following an explicit comment about the former vice president in a since-deleted tweet.\n\n“Trump’s back in office. Ye’s back a billionaire. The world might just be ok,” wrote the controversial star. He later said, in reference to the infamous red MAGA hat: “I risked my life to wear a red hat then he turned it black.”\n\nWest then generated controversy after he made a sexual comment about Harris, which has since been removed, as per The Metro.\n\nHe addressed the removal of his post, writing: “The democrats made me take the loser post down. Naw I’m kidding. Dey don’t control black people no more. Trump 4 life.”\n\nWest then made an apology to the former presidential nominee, writing: “Kamala seems like a very nice human I just wanna say sorry to her kids.”","summary":"West briefly followed pop superstar with whom he has feuded for an unexplained reason","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/kanye-west-taylor-swift-instagram-feud-b2690810.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/02/17/41/Kanye-West-and-Taylor-Swift.png?trim=0,7,0,7&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YdvGwCpT-LkahLqdO.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-02 21:49:21","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":286393640,"title":"DNC lambasted for 'beyond parody' leadership vote that included singing, gender rules: 'Can’t stop laughing'","text":"Conservatives on social media are having a field day mocking the Democratic National Committee for featuring a handful of \"beyond parody\" moments during its leadership vote over the weekend, which critics say underscores that Democrats have \"learned absolutely nothing\" from their 2024 election losses. The DNC voted to elect Minnestota Democrat Party leader Ken Martin as its chair on Saturday, after eight candidates vied to succeed Jaime Harrison. Following the Democratic Party's losses in November, when Republicans reclaimed the White House and Senate and retained control of the House, the DNC's chair vote serves as a fresh slate for the party as they ramp up strategies and fundraising for the next election cycle. Conservatives and critics took to social media over the weekend to highlight what they viewed as the most out of touch speeches and comments from party leaders, including the election of left-wing activist David Hogg as one of its three co-chairs. Hogg is an outspoken gun control advocate and the co-founder of March for Our Lives, a gun control group that was formed after the Parkland school shooting in 2018.

Now it’s time to rebuild the party and to rethink the way we’ve been doing things.\" Amid the hours-long vote and gathering of Democrats on Saturday in Maryland, former DNC chief Harrison announced that the elections must be gender-balanced, including when a non-binary candidate is in the running, sparking condemnation from conservatives. DEMOCRATS RALLY AROUND LIGHTENING ROD ISSUE AT FINAL DNC CHAIR DEBATE \"We have an amazing group of new officers. So far, as you know, our three at large vice chair positions are used to ensure gender balance among seven offices: treasury secretary, national finance chair and vice chair for civic engagement and voter participation and the three at large vice chairs. Our rules specify that when we have a non-binary candidate or officer, the non-binary individual is counted as neither male nor female, and the remaining six offices must be gender balanced with the results of the previous four elections. Our elected officers are currently two male and two female. In order to be gender balanced… we must elect one male, one female, and one person of any gender.\" Before the election kicked off on Saturday, the eight candidates had traveled to Georgetown University for a forum co-hosted by MSNBC on Thursday, where they declared \"racism and misogyny\" compounded former Vice President Kamala Harris' election loss. \"So, I’m going to have a show of hands. How many of you believe that racism and misogyny played a role in Vice President Harris’ defeat?\" MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart asked the eight candidates. \"That’s good. You all passed,\" Capehart said after all candidates raised their hands in agreement. Republican lawmakers and pundits pounced on clips of the exchange, including Sen. Tommy Tubervile, R-Ala., who quipped that the GOP will expand its majority in the midterms. Singing also broke out both during the forum and the vote. Dr. Quintessa Hathaway was in the running for chair and belted out a song with the lyrics, \"You fight on, when the government is doing you wrong, you fight on\" during the Thursday forum. She also sang another song ahead of the vote on Saturday vowing, \"We shall overcome.\" FIRST ON FOX: AFTER 2024 ELECTION SETBACKS, DEMOCRATS EYE RURAL VOTERS Harrison was also spotted on camera singing on Saturday, delivering a rendition of Stevie Wonder's \"Happy Birthday.\" DEMOCRATS' HOUSE CAMPAIGN CHAIR TELLS FOX NEWS HER PLAN TO WIN BACK MAJORITY DNC members also \"acknowledged\" during the vote that the U.S. was \"built on indigenous lands.\" Ken Martin, who previously slammed Trump as a \"traitor\" who should be prosecuted for treason, celebrated his win on Saturday, vowing to combat Trump and the Republican Party. \"We have one team, one team, the Democratic Party,\" Martin said following his victory. \"The fight is for our values.

Vance’s first interview since taking office, a sit-down with Margaret Brennan of CBS News. The anchor pressed him on the White House pause of refugee resettlement operations, reminding Vance of his past support for admitting into the country those who were “properly vetted.” The vice president replied that the efficacy of the entire screening process was in doubt, pointing to an Afghan national recently arrested for plotting a terror attack in Oklahoma as an example.\n\nThe subsequent crescendo launched a thousand memes and highlight reels on the right that one giddy conservative pundit compared to the coverage Michael Jordan got on ESPN during his prime.\n\n“It wasn’t clear if he was radicalized when he got here,” Brennan started to say of the terror suspect who came to the United States after the Afghanistan withdrawal and several rounds of vetting. “I don’t really care, Margaret,” interrupted Vance. This was the mic drop moment the White House wanted.\n\nHe was sworn in earlier last week, but during the CBS News interview, if Vance hadn’t already, the vice president cemented himself within MAGA hearts. A cult of personality is now emerging around President Trump’s ascendant Hillbilly Apprentice.\n\nConservative columnist Salena Zito likened the exchange with Brennan to Rhett Butler’s famous line from “Gone With the Wind,” explaining that it gave “‘Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn’ vibes.” The conservative corners of the internet agreed and shared the exchange far and wide. “At what point,” asked a gleeful Donald Trump Jr, “will these leftwing media hacks figure out that they’re no match for JD?” The interview attracted more than 1.3 million views on YouTube, where it was number one on trending the next day.\n\nThis was the kind of rollout that the Trump campaign imagined when the president picked him last summer, making him the heir-apparent of the MAGA movement overnight. Vance, then the junior senator from Ohio, had barely been in office for 18 months. He didn’t appeal to constituencies that Trump didn’t already have. Out of the gate, Democrats launched a campaign to label him “weird,” his favorability numbers went negative, and the press had a field day amplifying private comments rather than his public arguments. In private, some Republicans were left with buyer’s remorse.\n\nAt the time, Charlie Kirk did not make much of the congealing conventional wisdom. The political activist endorsed Vance first for Senate, then lobbied Trump to make him his running mate. “Many people didn’t understand why,” Kirk told RealClearPolitics, “but they’re seeing it very clearly now.”\n\nA confidant of the first family, Kirk calls Vance “the most powerful weapon” conservatives have in defending Trump’s mandate: “He is smarter than them. He’s more likable than them. And he will not back down to their smug, coastal elitist tone.”\n\nAnother exchange between Vance and Brennan, this one on birthright citizenship, had Republicans applauding. He said that no other country has the practice. She countered that America is “a unique country” and one “founded by immigrants.”\n\nReplied the vice president, “This is a very unique country, and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers,” Vance responded. “But just because we were founded by immigrants doesn’t mean that, 240 years later, that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world.”\n\nWatching from home, Rep. Chip Roy cheered how Vance reframed the question and identified modern immigration as “a very different construct.” The two worked closely in Congress, and while Roy has at times found himself crossways with Trump, the Texas Republican was a public and early advocate of Vance as the number two on the ticket. Going forward, he expects Vance to be front and center.\n\n“When you’ve got someone with that much horsepower,” Roy told RCP, “you want to use it. You want them to take it for a spin.”\n\nVance will likely reprise the role of attack dog, but conservative economist and longtime friend of the new vice president, Oren Cass, cautioned that “it is so much more sophisticated.” Vance didn’t climb the traditional ladder in politics, Cass told RCP. Instead, “he was a founding member of the intellectual movement to build the new right.” It is true the vice president, like his boss, loves the tariff and the union, loathes the corporate tax cut and the global corporation, and is very “anti-woke.”\n\nHe served as a vanguard of the New Right, a codification of a Trumpism defined by its rejection of libertarian economics and a rejection of neoconservative policy. This produced in Vance “a depth of understanding,” Cass said, as opposed to the “typical politician” in the Trump era who is “good at learning the talking points really well.”\n\nBut even the most talented politicians can languish as understudies when thrust into a job without a clearly delineated policy mandate. Former Vice President Mike Pence faithfully executed the role only to be excommunicated by his old boss. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was left on a policy island until she was summoned to replace her boss in a doomed bid to keep the White House under Democratic control. Cass sees a brighter future for Vance, specifically “at the center of the Venn diagram of all the different elements of the Trump coalition.”\n\nHe comes from a blue-collar background but worked in Silicon Valley. He is a millennial but harkens back to the economic nationalism of the 20th century. One thing all those disparate groups agree on: the need to re-industrialize.\n\nThis also makes Vance very different than the conservative old guard. When asked during his CBS News interview about criticism of Tulsi Gabbard from the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal and National Review, for instance, the vice president defended the nominee by saying the president, not publications that have “lost relevance,” ought to determine who serves as his director of national intelligence.\n\nEveryday voters outside the conservative ecosystem are much less interested in those internecine ideological conflicts. They are more likely to identify with a vice president still awestruck by his new position. With shaky camera work, Speaker Mike Johnson captured the moment Vance walked into the Oval Office for the first time. And the man a heartbeat away from the presidency has developed a sort of parasocial presence with voters, giving followers less than choreographed insights into his day job.\n\nWhen called on to cast the tie-breaking vote for Defense Sec. Pete Hegseth, Vance wrote on social media, “I thought I was done voting in the Senate.” After moving into the vice president’s official residence earlier last week, he wrote a thank you note. “While we don’t own this property, it is a beautiful home for our three little kids,” Vance said on X, adding that his family was “grateful and will take good care of it.” And when an Episcopal bishop pled with the new administration to soften its stance on immigration, Vance was caught on camera at the National Cathedral with an incredulous smirk. His fans likened it to the expression of Jim Halpert, a character from the comedy, “The Office.”\n\nThe right was tickled pink by all of it, but Kevin Roberts emphasized the ability of the vice president to break through politics and into the cultural zeitgeist. “His sense of humor, the fact that he’s intentionally a smart ass sometimes,” said Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation and a longtime friend of Vance, “meets the moment because he says with so few words, sometimes with no words just his facial expression, what we’re all thinking.”\n\nThe job is still new. Controversy will inevitably follow. But the early reviews are positive on the right, Roberts said, noting the many “obvious contrasts” in age, style, and demeanor between Vance and Trump, differences which he described as “complementary contrasts.” Added Roberts, “The real crux of this, the real reason for Vance’s success thus far, is he’s not trying to make it about himself.”\n\nAlumni of the first Trump administration had to learn that lesson on the fly. Some flew too close to the sun, like former White House strategist Steve Bannon, who courted the press at every turn, obscuring the president and thus sealing his own fate.\n\n“I’m not sure if anybody can ever outshine Trump,” said a former senior White House official looking back, “but that is the challenge.” Looking back at the first four years of Trump, the official cautioned that so long as the vice president is pushing Trump’s agenda and promoting Trump’s administration, there would be no trouble.\n\n“As long as you do not ever cross that line into what you are doing,” the source added, “then you’re fine.”\n\nThis playbook is easier said than done, of course, and easier to follow when the president is not in his final term. Conversations about the next election are premature one week after Inauguration Day. But the subtext of being the MAGA heir-apparent is succession, and the former official noted that if Vance has his own White House ambitions, he doesn’t have the same four-to-six-year runway that other vice presidents normally enjoy: “He only has two years to get ready.”","summary":"Likened to famed 'Gone With the Wind' line delivered by Rhett Butler","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/jd-vance-delivers-maga-mic-drop-moment-during-interview/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/jd-vance-20240818-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 20:39:20","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":286411836,"title":"\"Seventh-string QB\": Carville calls Harris a benchwarmer trotted out for \"Super Bowl\" election","text":"James Carville has heard all the muttered \"good games\" of Democrats following their November loss and wants to swap out their unearned Gatorade baths for eye-opening, ice-cold water. \n\nThe long-time Democratic strategist and talking head said that the Democratic Party fumbled the 2024 election, leveling particular sharp criticism at the coronation of Kamala Harris without a primary.

How disappointed we should be, too. First ABC News made the baffling decision to settle a $15 million defamation lawsuit Trump filed against the network, outraging the company’s employees. Then Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg settled another baseless Trump lawsuit, this time handing the president a cool $25 million.\n\nThe latest domino fell on Thursday evening when Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, indicated it would settle yet another Trump defamation suit. That decision comes despite legal experts dismissing Trump’s suit as baseless and intended solely to intimidate. It’s working. \n\nCorporate news outlets are abandoning the American people at the very moment we most need a free, fearless, and independent media. Most of those once venerable institutions are giving up without so much as a fight. What a loss for democracy. \n\nA $15 million settlement may be a rounding error against ABC News parent company Disney’s $91 billion annual revenue, but Trump now has powerful new resources to wage his war on the media from inside the federal government. \n\nChief among Trump’s new batch of enforcers is Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr. On Jan. 22, just two days after Trump was inaugurated, Carr threatened investigations into ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News for their perceived unfair coverage of Trump’s 2024 campaign. \n\nThose investigations stem from three complaints filed by the right-wing legal advocacy organization the Center for American Rights, which has been open about its goal of having the news networks’ broadcast licenses revoked. Those complaints also serve as a roadmap for Trump’s prospective FBI Director Kash Patel, who has repeatedly pledged to “come after” media outlets who hurt the president’s feelings. \n\nA less consolidated, more nimble news media might have joined together in coalition to push back against Trump’s authoritarian attacks on press freedom. Instead, today’s billionaire executives view their news properties as just one piece of a much broader corporate quilt. \n\nSome, including new Los Angeles Times owner and avowed MAGA booster Patrick Soon-Shiong, even regard their own newsrooms with open contempt. As Trump is discovering, there’s no reason to threaten outlets that are only too eager to sew their own mouths shut.\n\nAmazon tycoon Jeff Bezos’ transformation of the Washington Post into a Trump-curious newspaper may be the most high-profile step in the media’s subjugation, but Soon-Shiong’s tenure at the LA Times is what Americans should expect going forward. \n\nLast year Soon-Shiong sparked controversy after gutting his paper’s editorial team and replacing key voices with polarizing, Trump-aligned pundits like Scott Jennings. He also publicly spiked the paper’s planned presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris, driving a round of senior staff resignations. The decisions were intended to send a clear message to Mar-a-Lago: Go easy on us, you have friends here. \n\nThe media’s cascading surrender is yet another bitter symbol of America’s institutional decay. News outlets are no longer operations where management inhabits the same office building as their journalists. Their owners are now many layers of corporate bureaucracy separated from the journalism they produce. That makes it easier than ever for media outlets’ mega-rich owners to strangle and pillage news operations in a way that simply did not happen when those outlets were run by journalists. \n\nThe fact that media outlets have always served as a safeguard of our democracy doesn’t matter to the Disney Corporation. They see their acquisition of ABC News as a loss-leading enterprise. It’s just a means to more effectively serve you ads for Whirlpool dishwashers—the official appliance brand of Walt Disney World™. That they sometimes break news is a bonus.\n\nVenture capital firms like Alden Global Capital have been hollowing out the media industry for decades by buying independent outlets and stripping their assets. Veteran journalists face unceremonious layoffs, replaced by either inexperienced young journalists, artificial intelligence or, for more than half of the country, by nothing at all. \n\nThe result is a media industry so hollow and starved of institutional knowledge that it can no longer carry out its fundamental accountability role. Trump simply came along and delivered the killing blow.\n\nMedia industry veterans seem to understand their industry is trapped in a death spiral. CNN’s Jim Acosta implied as much when he abruptly quit the network last week, a decision driven by CNN’s desire to muzzle one of their network’s most pointed Trump questioners. Trump greeted the news with glee.\n\n“Jim is a major loser,” the president posted on Truth Social. “[He] will fail no matter where he ends up.” That may sound like bravado, but it’s actually Trump breathing a sigh of relief over CNN’s decision to censor itself.\n\nLike the dozens of veteran reporters who have resigned from the Washington Post after Bezos’ MAGA pivot, Acosta understands that real journalism is impossible if your bosses have more in common with Trump than they do with their own reporters. Acosta and the journalists who have fought their own corporate structures to hold Trump accountable recognize when the deck has been impossibly stacked against them. After all, investigating corruption is their job. \n\nIs there a way forward for the media’s role as the watchdog of power? It’s tough to say. That return to legitimacy won’t come in the consolidated and Trump-loyalist corporate media landscape we have now. \n\nTo continue serving the people, more journalists will need to follow the lead of Acosta at CNN and the Washington Post’s fleeing editors. The corporate media failed us. It’s up to the nation’s exiled journalists and underserved news consumers to reject that corruption and begin the long, difficult process of returning journalism to its core mission of holding power accountable. Because an America without a free and combative press is no America at all.","summary":"Writing in 1799, Vice President Thomas Jefferson defended his nation’s strong press freedoms with evangelical fervor. “To preserve the freedom of the human mind and freedom of the press, every spirit should be ready to devote itself to martyrdom,” Jefferson wrote. “For as long as we may think as we will and speak as we think, the condition of man will proceed in improvement.”\n\n\n\nHow disappointed our Founding Fathers would be in the craven, fearful way America’s corporate media has surrendered to Donald Trump in the months since his election.

The same may well happen in Australia","text":"The 2024 US presidential election saw a historic shift to the right, driven by the largest swing of young male voters in two decades. Analysts attribute this partly to podcasters like Joe Rogan, whose unfiltered, conversational content bypassed traditional media to mobilise this demographic. \n\nOur own research shows that Donald Trump’s podcast strategy during the election campaign boosted his support by 1% to 2.6%, with more than half of this linked to Rogan’s platform. In contrast, Kamala Harris’s reliance on traditional, curated media lacked the authenticity that resonated with Trump’s base.\n\nThis trend has clear parallels in Australia, where media strategy has long mirrored the US. In 1949, Robert Menzies used radio to reassure the public, much like Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “fireside chats”. In the 1980s, television brought Bob Hawke into voters’ homes, showcasing charisma akin that of John F. Kennedy in his earlier televised debates. Kevin Rudd’s 2007 “Kevin 07” campaign effectively mirrored Barack Obama’s use of social media to engage younger voters. Similarly, Scott Morrison’s 2019 campaign emulated Trump-style microtargeting on Facebook to connect with specific demographics.\n\nToday, podcasts have become the latest battleground for political influence. Their conversational, long-form format enables politicians to address complex issues in a direct, personal manner. This medium resonates particularly with younger voters, who are increasingly turning away from traditional media.\n\nThe 2025 federal election will likely see a turning point in the influence of podcasts on election campaigns, and even the outcome.\n\nThe Australian podcasting landscape\n\nPodcast consumption in Australia continues to rise, with listenership increasing by 8.7% in early 2024. This comes after reaching a record 43% in 2023, up from 17% in 2017. \n\nDubbed “the world’s most avid podcast listeners”, Australian men aged 18–34 dominate the audience, drawn to popular news and politics podcasts such as ABC News Top Stories and The Party Room, as well as global hits like The Joe Rogan Experience. \n\nPodcasts appeal through their intimacy and authenticity, fostering a “close-knit friend group” atmosphere. Younger voters increasingly use podcasts to explore issues such as housing affordability and climate change. \n\nRogan’s podcast exemplifies this appeal, particularly among young Australian men. With 80% of his audience male, and half aged 18–34, Rogan’s unapologetic masculinity and focus on topics such as combat sports, hunting and societal controversies position him as a counterbalance to identity politics. His “living room” style, seen during Trump’s three-hour appearance, makes polarising or extremist ideas more palatable. This reflects a broader cultural shift among young men toward what they see as “traditional values”.\n\nWhile podcasts often feature diverse viewpoints, their unregulated nature can expose listeners to harmful ideologies, fostering echo chambers or radicalisation. Misinformation spreads more easily in these spaces, as evidenced by the US, where fragmented media contributed to the rise of Trumpism. Although Australia’s stricter campaign finance laws and media regulations reduce such risks, they cannot eliminate them entirely.\n\nAs the 2025 election nears, understanding how podcasts shape voter behaviour is critical for balanced political discourse and social cohesion.\n\nAustralia’s political landscape\n\nRecent polls show the Liberal-National Coalition leading Labor 53.1% to 46.9% in two-party preferred voting, with 39% of voters preferring Peter Dutton as prime minister compared with Anthony Albanese’s 34%. While the Coalition uses Trump-style strategies, Albanese appears to have a problem with male voters.\n\nDutton emulates Trump in using podcasts to connect directly with young male voters and amplify culture war themes, anti-woke sentiment, and populist rhetoric. \n\nHis Elon Musk-inspired push for a “government efficiency” department mirrors Trump’s populist promises of cutting “wasteful spending”.\n\nThe Coalition has tapped into a broader cultural shift among young men. Many of these men have gravitated toward influencers like Andrew Tate – alleged rapist and human trafficker with ambitions to become UK prime minister – whose divisive rhetoric reinforces regressive ideals. \n\nSurveys reveal 28% of Australian teenage boys admire Tate, while 36% find him relatable. Moreover, half of surveyed schools link his influence to negative behavioural changes. \n\nThese strategies seem to work, with polls showing increased male voter support for the Coalition (52.7% to Labor’s 47.3%).\n\nAustralia’s compulsory voting and multi-party preferential system encourage broad-based appeals. But they also risk amplifying polarisation. \n\nAustralia’s concentrated media ownership, dominated by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, further shapes public discourse by amplifying conservative perspectives. \n\nAlthough younger Australians – especially women – remain a strong progressive base for Labor, the rise of right-wing podcasts and their impact on young male voters poses a significant challenge. The Coalition’s ability to connect with this demographic via podcasts, leveraging dissatisfaction and cultural shifts, could shape the election’s outcome.\n\nOpportunity and risk\n\nPodcasts present both opportunities and risks for Australian politics. They offer a powerful platform for politicians to engage younger voters on crucial issues, fostering deeper connections. However, their unregulated nature enables the spread of misinformation and the normalisation of polarising ideas.\n\nTo address this, voters should critically evaluate podcast content, fact-check claims using resources such as RMIT ABC Fact Check and AAP FactCheck, and seek diverse perspectives. Politicians, meanwhile, must use podcasts strategically, balancing authenticity with accountability. \n\nProgressive ideas could better resonate with young male audiences by reframing topics such as climate action, housing affordability and workplace equity as opportunities for leadership, empowerment and responsibility. Partnering with relatable influencers and using accessible, conversational podcast formats can help progressives connect with this demographic.","summary":"Conservative politicians are making good use ot podcasts to swing the votes of young men in particular.

More moderate Democrats, however, say that Harris was perceived as too liberal by voters and that Democrats should move toward the center to achieve future election victories.Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive Democrat who has been an outspoken critic of Trump's, has positioned herself as the future of the party and a candidate for change.What To KnowIn a Sunday podcast episode on Latino USA with host Maria Hinojosa, Ocasio-Cortez spoke about the Democratic loss in last year's presidential election as well as the loss of the Senate and House majority as she pointed towards the Democratic Party's \"confused\" messaging.\"I think structurally, overall, the Democratic Party has this confused message,\" she told Latino USA. \"We're supposed to be a party of the working class, and I think working-class people have not been seeing government work for them, despite a lot of the things that the Biden administration did do.\"The congresswoman added: \"I have a weird relationship with the Democratic Party. I don't believe in a two-party system, but I also understand the Democratic Party is a coalition and if we want the party to change, the balance of the coalition has to change. But right now, you open the hood on the Democratic Party, what you have is, I think, a bit of a power struggle over the last couple of years.\"In addition, this comes as tensions around immigration and Trump's mass deportation efforts ramp up as Ocasio-Cortez spoke about how her party lost affluent Latino voters in the 2024 election.\"Especially when we talk about Latinos, I will tell you in our community the anger was less about we need to deport immigrants, the anger was actually how the Trump administration and the campaign was actually very surgical and very sophisticated about drawing a wedge between undocumented people and recent arrivals and asylum seekers,\" she said.Ocasio-Cortez continued: \"For all of the people who cast a vote based on grocery prices and inflation, if you think your groceries are expensive now, wait until the farms are empty. Understand the consequences of what this means because for America to not accept immigrants is the definition of cutting off your nose to spite your face.\"Trump has made immigration a central theme of his presidential campaign and Americans largely support his mass deportation plans.A New York Times/Ipsos poll, carried out from January 2 to 10, found 55 percent of voters strongly or somewhat supported such plans. Eighty-eight percent supported \"Deporting immigrants who are here illegally and have criminal records.\" Large majorities of both Democrats and Republicans agreed that the immigration system is broken.The Trump administration has vowed to conduct the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history targeting the estimated 11.7 million people who are in the country without legal status.Ocasio-Cortez's remarks come after she previously lost the race to become the next House Oversight Committee ranking Democrat to Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia.Her bid to become the top Democrat on the committee was one of progressives' first battles in the fight to shape the future of the party after their defeats last year.In addition, as the Democratic Party continues to rally after its loss, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced on Saturday afternoon that its members have elected Ken Martin as its new chairperson.What People Are Saying\nTJ Adams-Falconer, former White House senior media affairs manager during the Obama administration said in December: \"DC Democrats simply do not understand the nature of the work & fight ahead.\"Representative Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat, told NPR in December about joining the Republican-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) House caucus: \"On some issues I'm progressive. On other issues I'm conservative, and I think that's how most of my constituents are. We take it issue by issue.\"Yassamin Ansari, a Democrat who represents Arizona's 3rd Congressional District in the U.S. House has emerged as a vocal critic of the Trump administration's actions regarding immigration, previously told Newsweek: \"I find all of Trump's proposed policies on this topic to be outrageous. The reality of the matter is that Democrats, alongside Republicans, agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform and we need a secure border. None of the policies that Trump has proposed address these issues.\"What Happens NextAs the Trump administration continues its stance on immigration enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations will likely continue to escalate.Meanwhile, Martin will begin implementing his \"build\" framework immediately as the new DNC chair. His leadership, Martin says, will focus on holding the Trump administration accountable, uniting and charting a new path for the party and fighting for working families.","summary":"\"We're supposed to be a party of the working class, and I think working-class people have not been seeing government work for them,\" the congresswoman said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-warns-democrats-about-confused-messaging-2024852","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2579157/alexandria-ocasio-cortez.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 18:55:31","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":286375454,"title":"Young men are gravitating to Dutton. Will this win him the election?","text":"In recent weeks, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has increasingly talked up his \"anti-woke\" agenda across online platforms including podcasts.\n\nSo, is he trying to appeal to disenfranchised male voters?\n\nIn a podcast chat with entrepreneur Mark Bouris, Dutton outlined what he called an \"anti-woke revolution\" occurring globally. But he also said that young men have had enough of being overlooked for jobs and promotions, especially when they have female partners who have \"decided\" to stay home with the kids.\n\n\"I think a lot of young males feel disenfranchised and feel ostracised, and they're saying, 'Well, hang on, I have nothing but respect for women, and I would never treat my female friends differently than my male friends. But I'm being told that I'm some sort of ogre, or I have some belief structure which is true to that, which … [is] what I hold in my heart.'\n\n\"I think there's just a point where people are fed up.\n\n\"They're pushing back and saying, 'Well, why am I being overlooked at work for a job, you know, three jobs running when I've got, you know, a partner at home, and she's decided to stay at home with three young kids, and I want a promotion at work so that I can help pay the bills at home,' and so I think all of that has morphed.\"\n\nBad optics for Dutton?\n\nIt was the classic political play of repeating what is being felt by some men — giving it credence by showing sympathy with the sentiment. There is no doubt that some men feel this way, and smart politicians engage with the feelings of voters. For some time, men and boys have expressed annoyance and rejection of progressive language on \"toxic\" masculinity. What began as a vibe has accelerated, and now there are active conversations about what it means for elections around the world and here at home.\n\nThe danger for Dutton is that leaning into the \"manosphere\" too blatantly can entrench a broader optical problem for him. It wasn't that long ago that everyone was endlessly writing about the Coalition having a problem with women. That wasn't just commenters; the Coalition admitted to the problem and said it would address it. The dramatic shift we are now seeing in the cultural and political Zeitgeist is not unusual — it's often the case that backlashes occur when there's a perception that something has gone too far.\n\nWhile Dutton is clearly connecting with this cohort of men better than progressives, and Anthony Albanese, the risk of how it translates across the electorate is real. Let's not forget women vote, and it's compulsory in Australia.\n\nIn the US, as the Democrats lick their wounds and Donald Trump floods the zone with announcements, there's a realisation that progressive politicians are struggling to talk to men, and that it must be addressed to change their political fortunes. The endless fights about who does interviews with Joe Rogan have become a proxy for that conversation — why did Democrats shun him when millions of men listen to him and relate to him?\n\nIn a globalised world, political trends are often mirrored — even if they display their own nationalist flavour. Young men drifted towards Trump in the US while women were more interested in the Democrats and their candidate Kamala Harris. In Australia, the bloke vote is becoming increasingly important and fascinating.\n\nThis week, The Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported its polling had found a sharp gender divide among younger voters, with men far more disposed towards Dutton than women, and more optimistic about Australia's economic outlook. It also showed that women in the same age groups are more left-leaning. In the breakdown of aggregate data from the last three AFR/Freshwater Strategy opinion polls, 37 per cent of young male voters — aged between 18 and 34 — preferred Dutton as prime minister, compared with 27 per cent of women in the same age group.\n\nIt's similar to what pollsters Talbot Mills Research found when they asked Australians how they felt about Trump. While Trump was unpopular across the country, among young men he was more popular. In that survey, 43 per cent of young Australian men said they'd vote for Trump if they could, compared to 34 per cent who'd go for Harris. Younger men in both Australia and New Zealand preferred Trump to Harris, while support for Trump among young women was minuscule.\n\nLiberal vote among women recovers\n\nWhen the gender split question was put to Dutton this week at a press conference he bristled. Dutton may be quietly cultivating the votes of men on the back of a worldwide trend that's seen men move to the right — and some men join a crusade against \"wokeism\", but he doesn't want to be painted as a leader for blokes only. And there's a good reason for him to run from this image. In a country where compulsory voting is how we do democracy, Dutton needs women, and he needs them to start breaking his way in bigger numbers.\n\nOne of the Liberal Party's most respected strategists, Tony Barry, says while there is undoubtedly a bloke element going on, the quieter story is the recovery in the Liberal vote among female voters since 2022. Now a director at Melbourne-based apolitical research firm Redbridge Group, Barry says the reasons for this are two-fold. First, women are bearing more of the stress of the cost-of-living crisis, and Redbridge Group research shows they are prioritising the needs of others in their family over their own. \"But our research is also showing that Jane Hume and Anne Ruston have developed a significant name ID and have made connections with women voters in particular,\" he says.\n\nBarry, a former Liberal deputy state director and adviser to Malcolm Turnbull, says the other big story is the Coalition's improved vote share and competitiveness with those born overseas and those in homes where languages other than English are spoken. \"Labor strategists will be hoping that their voting memory muscle means they can be persuaded back into the Labor column over the coming months,\" he says.\n\nThen there's the style of leadership from both men. Sixteen months ago, Redbridge research started to detect voters branding Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as weak, describing him as \"bland\" and a \"beta male\". Barry says Albanese is doing a very good job of portraying himself as a beta male and he doesn't need any help from the Coalition. \"The contrast between Chris Minns calling the fire bombers 'bastards' and then Albanese's mealy-mouthed response talking about childcare centres and working mums was just another instance of Albanese reinforcing an existing prejudice about his character,\" he says.\n\nBarry is right that Albanese projects a vastly different style — a style that suited the times when he won the last election but has eroded with time as some voters have found strongman politicians more appealing.\n\nBy the end of last week, Albanese had strengthened his language considerably on the foiled caravan attack. He branded the perpetrators of antisemitic attacks \"cowards\" who would be \"hunted down and locked up\". It was a noticeable shift.\n\nVoting patterns by gender shift worldwide\n\nNicholas Biddle, Head of the School of Politics and International Relations at the Australian National University, says that over the past few decades, across the established high-income democracies, there has been a shift in voting patterns by gender, with females now tending to be relatively more likely to vote for left-of-centre parties, when previously females tended to be more likely to vote for parties of the right. Younger voters have continued to vote for left-of-centre parties, with these two trends interacting and younger females the most consistent left-of-centre voters.\n\nBiddle says one of the potential explanations for the gender differences in voting intentions is education. Historically, males were more likely to have obtained university qualifications than females. Since the last few decades of the 20th century, this disparity has flipped, and now females are far more likely to obtain higher education than males. And, he says, one of the other trends that we have seen over recent elections across the world is the university-educated voter being far more likely to vote for left-of-centre parties, and those without a degree being more likely to vote right-of-centre.\n\n\"What is interesting is how the gap in voting intentions by gender amongst the young relates to education. By the 25 to 34 age group, most of those who will obtain a degree over their lifetime have done so. For this age group, there is essentially no difference in voting intentions amongst those without a degree.\"\n\n\"For both males and females, around 34 to 35 per cent say they would vote for the Coalition first if an election was held in October 2024 — at the time of our survey. However, amongst those with a degree, there is a roughly 13 percentage point gap in voting intentions — 40 per cent of males saying they would vote for the Coalition, compared to 27 per cent of females. If we are looking for what is driving gender voting patterns amongst the young, then we need to look at the role of higher education and professional work,\" Biddle argues.\n\nPM reluctant to embrace gender divide\n\nWhich brings me to Albanese. Albanese has always been alive and alert to the backlash to \"wokeism\" and has consistently trodden carefully around it. You'll never see him put his pronouns on his Twitter handle for instance.\n\nAnd there is another stand-out example that makes my point.\n\nWhile politicians like Joe Biden didn't spend time talking to Rogan — something they are now being criticised for — in Australia, Albanese has befriended the FM radio hosts, including the controversial Kyle Sandilands, who makes Rogan look like a screaming feminist. The prime minister even attended Sandilands's wedding, and has done this despite left-wing and feminist criticism.\n\nI asked the prime minister last week what he made of the gender divide, and his answer was vastly different to Dutton who repeats the concerns of men. \"I'm not a sociologist. I'll leave that to them. What I believe is that we need to provide opportunities for people, whether they be young men or young women. That's what our Future Made in Australia [bill] is about. That's why we have, whether it be cheaper child care and the childcare reforms for our younger boys and girls, right through to schools, right through to the University Accord [bill].\"\n\n\"That's why taking 20 per cent off student debt will help young men and young women to engage. There is a feeling about inequity when it comes to the opportunity that that generation have compared with my generation. So, I understand that. And we want to engage and provide support for young men and young women,\" he told me.\n\nAlbanese's view is that talking to blue-collar men involves talking up his jobs and Future Made in Australia agenda — and no doubt jobs are part of the story. But he is reluctant to embrace the language of male disadvantage because it risks alienating the women he has been talking to, who are still doing the majority of the child rearing and domestic labour.\n\nMany of these women have worked their guts out at home and at work and don't see themselves as taking the jobs of men.\n\nPatricia Karvelas is the presenter of Q+A on Monday nights on ABC TV and the host of ABC News Afternoon Briefing at 4pm weekdays on ABC News channel.

After President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his first term in 2017, the festival was host to countless anti-Trump demonstrations and speeches. Chelsea Handler led a Women's March on Main Street Park City with over 8,000 people, and artists such as Mary J. Blige used their film premieres as an opportunity to denounce the new president. As noted by Variety, there has been a stark contrast between this year's Sundance Film Festival, and years prior. GLENN CLOSE GRAPPLES WITH AI THREAT IN HOLLYWOOD: 'WHAT IS GOING TO BE TRUTH?' \"Fast-forward eight years, and it’s a very different picture. Trump is back in power, but the resistance movement he sparked failed to show up in Park City,\" according to Variety. The media outlet claimed that the lack of political theater at this year's festival is partially by design, with publicists asking journalists to avoid asking their clients political questions. \"Publicists implored journalists to avoid asking their clients political questions, while celebrities who previously came out swinging against the MAGA movement were less eager to sound off,\" Variety said. Although there have been \"no major demonstrations against the new administration,\" so far this year, according to Variety, many of the films that premiered at the festival \"had unmistakable political undertones, highlighting communities under attack by Trump and his followers or offering alternative visions of the world.\" Christian Toto, host of The Hollywood in Toto Podcast and creator of the entertainment website Hollywood in Toto, weighed in on why he thinks this year's Sundance has been lacking its usual political stunts. LIBERAL 'SECRET' KAVANAUGH DOCUMENTARY AT SUNDANCE AIMS TO REOPEN SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS Toto told Fox News Digital that he believes there are many factors at play. \"Blame several factors for the weak Resistance sequel. The industry is in trouble thanks to the pandemic's fallout, the dueling 2023 industry strikes and, most recently, the devastating LA fires. Actors realize getting overtly political doesn't help their bottom line at such a challenging time,\" Toto said. Hollywood may be starting to realize that their influence over the public has been greatly diminished over the last four years, with the 2024 election giving this theory some legs. Toto pointed out that celebrities \"did all they could to drag Kamala Harris across the finish line and it failed. They recognize their influence is waning and MAGA is on the rise.\" Although irrational fears of retribution from the Trump administration against celebrities critical of the president may also be playing a part in their decisions to lay off politics at this year's festival, according to Toto. \"A few stars, and publicists, have an irrational fear that they'll be punished for being critical of all things Trump. That's more projection than anything else. Late-night hosts have been pummeling Trump for nearly a decade and no one is sitting in his gulag,\" said Toto.

As several journalists have opted to utilize Substack, others have used TikTok to share news or talk about news. Leavitt also suggested that podcasters apply to what she described as the \"new media\" seat. \"I very much hope, however, that the Trump White House doesn’t just (or mostly) approve only news creators who are predictably in favor of their partisan views. If they want to do a one and one as they did on Tuesday — one partisan news outlet (Breitbart) and one more nonpartisan outlet (Axios) — that would be fine with me. In fact that would be great — whether I was ever the representative for the nonpartisan media,\" Cilizza wrote. INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING DIRECT ASSISTANCE WON'T BE IMPACTED BY FEDERAL FUNDING FREEZE, PRESS SECRETARY SAYS Leavitt told reporters during her first briefing these changes were being made to keep in line with President Donald Trump's \"revolutionary media approach\" that he deployed during his campaign in speaking to popular podcast hosts and social media influencers. \"In keeping with this revolutionary media approach that President Trump deployed during the campaign, the Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities, not just the legacy media who are seated in this room,\" she explained. The Daily Wire reported that the White House had received over 7,000 applications for the new media seat after the announcement. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Democratic influencer Harry Sisson, a vocal supporter of former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, posted on TikTok that he was applying for a press pass, but had his doubts about whether he would be allowed in the briefing room. Sisson argued that independent media should have a seat at the table, but wondered how the White House would decide who would get the new media seat, and whether he, a Democrat, would be allowed to ask a question. Host of \"The Ruthless Podcast,\" Josh Ashbrook, became the first podcaster to ask a question in the briefing room. Ashbrook asked Leavitt if the media was out of touch. \"In your first briefing, the media went after this administration for deporting illegal immigrants they claimed were not criminals,\" Ashbrook began. \"The question is, do you think they're out of touch with Americans demanding action on our border crisis?\" Ashbook, a former campaign strategist to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., shed light on what it was like to be in the briefing room during an appearance on \"The Will Cain Show\" that afternoon. TRUMP WHITE HOUSE ROLLS OUT SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT TO HOLD ‘FAKE NEWS ACCOUNTABLE’ \"I've interacted with a lot of these same reporters as a press secretary back in the day. So, when I walked into the room, I saw a lot of eye rolls and a lot of smirks and that is exactly what I was hoping for, Will,\" Ashbrook told Fox News' Will Cain. Ashbrook also praised the White House's embrace of \"new media,\" saying Leavitt and her team are making sure that \"we the people have a voice inside that room.\" \"It's a brand-new day in the media,\" he said. Others also praised the move on social media. Other influencers, such as Ivan Gutierrez, a TikToker with 1.2 million followers who posts regularly about the news, also announced they would be applying to have a seat in the briefing room. Gutierrez said he was hopeful to post a video directly from the briefing room should his application get accepted. Another TikTok news account, UnderTheDeskNews, run by V Spehar, who has collaborated with Biden and former President Barack Obama on the social media app, also praised the seat, but announced they would not be applying for a pass. \"But what I will say is having a new media seat in that room is incredibly smart, and very clever and definitely needed,\" Spehar said in the post. \"And I think the White House Correspondence Association and their attempt to constantly stiff-arm new media missed an opportunity here, because that seat should have been overseen by the White House Correspondence Association.

How each of the nominees could make history if they win the coveted accolade tonight\n\nThe AOTY accolade revealed in Los Angeles tonight is sure to be historic\n\nREAD MORE: Beyonce drops MAJOR career announcement ahead of Grammy Awards\n\nBy ELLEN COUGHLAN FOR MAILONLINE\n\nPublished: 14:57 GMT, 2 February 2025 | Updated: 15:00 GMT, 2 February 2025\n\nThe 2025 Grammy Awards most anticipated win will make history tonight - no matter who walks away with the accolade.\n\nThe ceremony, which takes place at the Crypto.com Arena, in Los Angeles, on Sunday, might cause a stir as its main category, the revered Album of the Year accolade - will be a uniquely triumphant moment for each of the eight nominees. \n\nMusical legend Beyoncé could finally take home the award after years of being snubbed for the title - but she has got some fierce competition.\n\nTaylor Swift, who has for the last two years dominated the radio waves and social media with her Eras Tour, is also eyeing up what would be a record-breaking fifth AOTY win - and could also become the first female artist to win the prize in consecutive years.\n\nMeanwhile Billie Eilish could be a more obvious choice with her album Hit Me Hard and Soft, meaning she would be only the third woman ever to win Album of the Year twice. \n\nSwift, Beyonce’s and Eilish's albums will also square off against Charli XCX’s Brat - which was an online sensation that had even Kamala Harris jumpin on board - Sabrina Carpenter’s fan favourite Short N’ Sweet, and other impressive musicians.\n\nHere FEAMIL takes a look at each nominee and how it could make history for them... \n\nThe 2025 Grammy Awards album of the year win will make history- no matter who walks away with the accolade. Many fans are wondering if Beyoncé will finally win Album of the Year, after four previous losses in the category\n\nMany fans are wondering if Beyoncé will finally win Album of the Year, after four previous losses in the category.\n\nThe singer's eighth studio album Cowboy Carter is up for 11 awards at the Grammys on Sunday. \n\nThe Texas Hold 'Em hitmaker is the most decorated Grammy musician of all time after earning 32 statues from 99 nominations and leads with the highest number of nods this year.\n\nHowever the main focus on the night for the singer will be to finally land the covered AOTY.\n\nBeyoncé's latest album was a wildly ambitious attempt to contextualise and commemorate the black roots of country music. \n\nHowever the album's excessive length, including what some felt were a few weaker tracks in its latter half - could count against it. \n\nBeyoncé's latest album was a wildly ambitious attempt to contextualise and commemorate the black roots of country music. Pictured in 2023\n\nShould it win the top award, the LP would be Beyonce’s first record to win best album, having previously failed with 2008’s I Am… Sasha Fierce, 2013’s Beyonce, 2016’s Lemonade and 2022’s Renaissance. \n\nIronically, even if doesn't win, she'll still make history, as the person with the most nominations in that category without a win. \n\nDuring last year's ceremony, her husband Jay-Z addressed the oversight, telling the audience: 'I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.'\n\nThe Brooklyn-born rapper was honored with the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award for his contribution to the music industry.\n\nWith his 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy standing on stage beside him, and wife Beyonce looking on from their table in the audience, dressed in just-off-the-catwalk Louis Vuitton by Pharrell Williams, Jay-Z spoke about the importance of dreams, drive and ambition.\n\nHe said that there were more important things in life than winning Grammys, noting they were subjective - and pointing out his superstar wife had never won best album.\n\nThe camera cut to Beyonce, looking slightly apprehensive in the audience.\n\nJay-Z has been nominated for 88 competitive Grammy Awards, winning 24 of them. Six of his nominations have been for Album of the Year.\n\nBeyonce has also been nominated for 88 competitive Grammy Awards, winning 32 of them.\n\nIn 2015, when Beyonce lost out on Album of the Year to Beck, Kanye West pretended to storm the stage in protest.\n\nThe moment drew parallels to West's actions in 2009, when he famously interrupted Swift as she accepted the Best Female Video award at the MTV Video Music Awards, telling her: 'Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you. ... but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.'\n\nWest in 2015 mimed storming the stage again, protesting that her album 'Beyonce' lost out to Beck's 'Morning Phase.'\n\nRecording Academy voters choose who wins Album of the Year, and in 2015 the voter base was split between Pharrell, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith. Beck's support was united, leading to Beck's win.\n\nBeck said after the show: 'Absolutely I thought she was going to win. You can't please everybody.\n\n'I still love him and think he's genius. I aspire to what he does. How many great records has he put out in the last five years, right?'\n\nWest, a protégée of Jay-Z's, insisted in interviews in 2015 that Beyonce had been robbed.\n\n'All I know is if the Grammys want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. We ain't gonna play with them no more,' he said.\n\n'Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyoncé, and at this point, we tired of it.'\n\nTaylor Swift \n\nIf Taylor Swift bags the Album of the Year award, she will make history too, beating her own record as the person to have won the category the most times\n\nIf Swift bags the Album of the Year award, she will make history too, beating her own record as the person to have won the category the most times. \n\nLast year, the singer was nominated for six awards and made Grammy history as the first person to win Album of the Year four times after picking up the prize for Midnights, her 10th album. \n\nTherefore, if she takes home the accolade again this year she will be the only artist ever to win the award five times. \n\nHowever some believe Taylor's album, The Tortured Poets Department, may miss out this year due to such a strong category.\n\nThe singer's record-breaking concert film The Eras Tour was already snubbed in the Best Music Film category, despite being the highest-grossing concert film of all time.\n\nVery few awards show experts have tipped The Tortured Poets Department for an Album of the Year win - and even a prominent psychic has predicted a major loss for the record.\n\nIn an interview with Casino.org, celebrity psychic and astrology reader Inbaal Honigman said, 'Taylor Swift isn't shown as a big winner within the big four categories.'\n\nShe added: 'The calm Four of Swords Tarot card indicates that this specific awards ceremony yields modest results for the talented star.' \n\nLast year, the singer was nominated for six awards and made Grammy history as the first person to win Album of the Year four times after picking up the prize for Midnights, her 10th album\n\nAlong with being up for six nominations, Taylor will also present at the 67th annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the Recording Academy have confirmed that the billionaire singer, 35, will be among the ceremony's celebrity presenters.\n\nIt's unknown which category Swift will present, but the outlet hinted that it could be one of the 'Big Four' — which includes Album Of The Year, Song Of The Year, Record Of The Year and Best New Artist.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department, Swift's 11th studio album, is nominated for Album Of The Year and Best Pop Vocal album.\n\nFortnight featuring Post Malone — which was the lead single off TTPD — is nominated for Song Of The Year, Record Of The Year and Best Music Video.\n\nRounding out her 2025 nods, Swift and her Eras Tour opener Gracie Abrams' duet Us is up for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nOnly recordings commercially released in the U.S. between September 16, 2023 through August 30, 2024 were eligible for nominations.\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nIf Billie Eilish's album Hit Me Hard and Soft wins the award, it will mark the singers second time walking up on stage to accept that trophy, and that’s a feat that only two women have managed before\n\nThe much-decorated Eilish is up for seven Grammys this year, including Record, Album and Song of the Year. \n\nBillie is one of a small number of musicians who have seen all of their studio albums earn nominations for Album of the Year at the Grammys.\n\nIf her album Hit Me Hard and Soft wins the award, it will mark the singers second time walking up on stage to accept that trophy, and that’s a feat that only two women have managed before.\n\nIf she wins, she will join an elite group of women who have achieved this remarkable feat, alongside Beyoncé and Adele. \n\nThe singer songwriter became one of the youngest people to win a Grammy when her debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? won in 2020.\n\nLast year, the 22-year-old won Apple Music's Artist of the Year due to her 'extraordinary impact throughout 2024' which saw her bag an Academy Award and two Grammys for her contribution to the Barbie soundtrack.\n\nBillie penned the emotional song What Was I Made For Her for the award winning film by Greta Gerwig before releasing her third album Hit Me Hard and Soft.\n\nIt's been a busy year for the star who also performed her hit Birds of a Feather at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nShe also collaborated with Charli XCX for guess, the song of the summer from the star's Brat album and is already touring around the US.\n\nSabrina Carpenter \n\nFirst-time nominee and pop breakout Sabrina Carpenter boasts six nominations during the awards night\n\nFirst-time nominee and pop breakout Sabrina Carpenter boasts six nominations during the awards night. \n\nThe breakout star is up against strong contenders in the category for Album of the year.\n\nDespite the name of her album Short n’ Sweet, Sabrina achieved the second longest-running No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200 this year, following Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nSabrina and Chappell Roan are both first-time nominees, and will be competing for six awards including record of the year, album of the year, song of the year and best new artist. \n\nThe Espresso hitmaker, 25, took the world by storm in 2024 as she spent 21 weeks at the top of the singles chart.\n\nThe superstar also broke the record in the UK charts by becoming the youngest female artist to hold the No1 and No2 spot in the same week. \n\nSabrina previously joked that her recent hit Espresso was an 'overnight success 10 years in the making,'. \n\nThe 12-track pop sensation is the culmination of a whirlwind 18-months for the star - who saw her fame grow exponentially since opening for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, becoming embroiled in an alleged love triangle with fellow star Olivia Rodrigo - and of course going viral on TikTok.\n\nBut the 4ft11' singer's stardom is more than a decade in the making. She landed her first role aged 11, as a guest in NBC's Law & Order, before finding fame in the Disney Channel's Boy Meets World as Maya Hart.\n\nThe pint-sized popstar released four albums under Disney, without any singles cracking the Billboard Top 100 - before her fifth 'Emails I Can't Send' (with Universal's Island Records), finally pushed its way to the US Billboard charts at number 23 and gave her the limelight she deserved.\n\nCarpenter and Roan will be performing at the 67th Grammy Awards, as will Billie Eilish, Charli XCX, Shaboozey and many more. \n\nCharli XCX \n\nAfter not even being on the Grammys radar last year', Charli XCX is up for eight awards at this year’s awards\n\nAfter not even being on the Grammys radar last year', Charli XCX is up for eight awards at this year’s awards.\n\nFollowing the huge success of her album Brat, which kickstarted the global 'Brat Summer' trend the hitmaker, 32, has landed an impressive eight nods at this year's ceremony - including Album Of The Year, and Record Of The Year for her song 360.\n\nAnd while she's one of the success stories of this year, this is the first time the singer has received a nomination since 2014's Iggy Azalea collaboration Fancy, despite musical success over the years including a bagging a UK number one and US top-ten for her 2022 album Crash.\n\nCharli's 2025 Grammy nominations come after she previously spoke out after her hit album Crash failed to get nominated for a Grammy Award in 2023.\n\nBeyonce drops MAJOR career announcement ahead of Grammy Awards\n\nAs the ceremony took place in Los Angeles , Charli, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, took to Instagram to vent her frustrations.\n\nSharing a sultry selfie of herself showing off her cleavage in a white dress, she captioned it: 'Me not being nominated for a Grammy for crash is like Mia Goth not being nominated for an Oscar for Pearl and only further proves that people don’t wanna see hot evil girls thrive.'\n\nThe singer made history when her No1 album Brat became a cultural phenomenon last summer along with the colour slime green as millions of fans showed their support by posting clips of Charli's Apple Dance on TikTok.\n\nIf the singer walked away with the album of the year accolade it would be sure to top off her sensational year by finally securing her first Grammy. \n\nSpeaking in a new interview with W Magazine - of which Charli stars on their second-ever digital cover - the performer revealed how she plans to enjoy the ceremony this Sunday following her first solo recognition at the annual music ceremony.\n\nShe explained: 'My dream scenario would be getting a plus-10 so I could bring all my best friends, but, realistically, I’ll probably get a plus-one. Maybe Troye [Sivan] and I can share and make it a plus-two.'\n\nHaving only received a nomination twice before over a decade ago, the star told how she just wants have fun on the night amid her surprise at even being recognised following past snubs.\n\nShe went on: 'My vibe is just wanting to have a good time. Let’s be real, I wasn’t even on the Grammys’ radar last year, so it’s not something I ever expected.\n\n'The thing is, wherever I am becomes fun anyway, so I’m sure I’ll figure it out.'\n\nShe looked sensational as she graced the cover of the publication and pulled off a number of sultry poses for a new shoot.\n\nWhile she flaunts her figure in her underwear in some snaps, the stunner rocks a tiara and dons a T-shirt with the words 'Queen Charli' emblazoned across it, solidifying her status as the 'Brat Queen'.\n\nChappell Roan\n\nChappell Roan’s rise to the Grammy stage is nothing short of remarkable, marking her as one of the most exciting newcomers in recent years\n\nChappell Roan’s rise to the Grammy stage is nothing short of remarkable, marking her as one of the most exciting newcomers in recent years. \n\nShe has seemingly come out of nowhere and is already the overwhelming favorite to win Best New Artist. \n\nHowever the star is up for a whopping six nominations including best new artist, song of the year and record of the year for her viral track Good Luck, Babe!\n\nIt will the singers first time attending the Grammy Awards joined by industry powerhouses Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar and more in the prestigious event's most coveted categories.\n\nKayleigh Rose Amstutz, known professionally as Chappell Roan, is an American singer who has emerged as a chart-topping pop superstar. \n\nAfter years of honing her craft and releasing independent music, her album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess has caught the ears of critics and fans alike, earning her a well-deserved spot among the nominees.\n\nHowever it wasn't always roses for the singer, Atlantic Records dropped Chappell in August 2020 because her music was not profitable enough.\n\nFollowing the drop, Chappell Roan remained without a music contract for three years while she uploaded her music independently, before getting signed by Island Records in 2023. \n\nKayleigh Rose Amstutz, known professionally as Chappell Roan, is an American singer who has emerged as a chart-topping pop superstar\n\nIn a piece for the New York Times, Roan's producer and co-writer Dan Nigro shared how the 26-year-old's breakout hit Pink Pony Club was originally rejected by Atlantic Records.\n\nAccording to Nigro, 42, executives at the label 'were not impressed' when they heard the tune for the first time.\n\n'I was convinced the song was incredible and then they told me it wasn't,' he said.\n\nThe label suggested ditching the song's guitar solos - played by Dave Stewart's son Sam - but Nigro refused.\n\nPink Pony Club was eventually released by Atlantic, but it flopped and led to Roan being dropped by the label.\n\nRefusing to give up on Roan's talent, Nigro then launched his own independent label called Amusement Records and reunited with the singer to give her music another push.\n\nPink Pony Club was re-released in 2023 and quickly started climbing the charts, becoming Roan's breakout hit.\n\nShe followed it up with hits like Hot to Go and Good Luck Babe, and her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess - released on Nigro's Amusement Records - peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200.\n\n'Dan always believed in me,' Roan told the New York Times.\n\n'He has been there from the beginning, and brought me into realizing what makes me feel good to perform, what makes me feel good to sing, to write about.'\n\nAndré 3000, whose real name is André Lauren Benjamin, is up for album of the year, best alternative jazz album and best instrumental composition for New Blue Sun\n\nAndré 3000, whose real name is André Lauren Benjamin, is up for album of the year, best alternative jazz album and best instrumental composition for New Blue Sun.\n\nThe 49-year-old rapper and singer-songwriter has had an incredible year with his hit album which has been nominated for three awards; the best album of the year, the best alternative jazz album, and the song I Swear, I Really Wanted to Make a ‘Rap’ Album but This Is Literally the Way the Wind Blew Me This Time has been nominated for best instrumental composition. \n\nHowever the singer will be unable to attend Sunday night’s 2025 Grammy Awards ceremony, the Outkast member announced Saturday. \n\nThe artist announced in an Instagram post on Saturday that he was unfortunately unable to attend the event.\n\nHe wrote: 'Unfortunately I won't be able to attend the Grammys tomorrow but some of the New Blue Sun musicians, friends and supporters will be in attendance.\n\n'Our album was conceived and recorded in Los Angeles with spirit of openness and creative collaboration.\n\n'We hope that the rebound of Los Angeles is swift and renewing. Congrats to all the musicians and collaborators being acknowledged. Keep playing.'\n\nAndré is no stranger to the awards show, having already won nine awards previously and nominated for 28. \n\nHe was nominated for his first Grammy in 1999 for Rosa Parks, a song with his former signing partner Big Boi (Antwan Patton) when they formed the group Outkast. \n\nJacob Collier\n\nJacob would be a more controversial win should the Grammys decide to honour a male artist over the pop queens who dominated 2024\n\nJacob would be a more controversial win should the Grammys decide to honour a male artist over the pop queens who dominated 2024.\n\nThe English singer, songwriter is also up for the sought-after award despite a somewhat ambivalent critical reception to his contender Djesse Vol 4.\n\nTo date, Jacob Collier, who has been dubbed 'the Mozart of Gen Z', has been nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, and won six. \n\nHe won his first five awards between 2017 and 2021, following up with his latest win in 2024 for Best Arrangement, Instruments and Vocals for In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\n\nHe has even made history as the first British artist to win a Grammy Award for each of his first four albums.\n\nThe 30-year-old Londoner has been playing virtuoso-level jazz piano and singing opera since he has been 10-years-old. \n\nHis mother is renowned violinist-conductor Suzie Collier so musical talent definitely runs in the family. \n\nThe singer made a YouTube splash in 2011 with complex vocal and video panel arrangements of Pure Imagination and Don’t You Worry Bout a Thing, and racked up 4.6 million views.\n\nHe has also worked with British powerhouses Stormzy, and last December performed a version of Last Christmas at the Princess of Wales's Carol concert.\n\nHis latest album, Djesse Vol 4, came out in February, and is now competing among the ranks of Cowboy Carter, The Tortured Poets Department and Short 'n' Sweet.\n\nJacob, who grew up in Finchley, has said that he found music as a 'second language' and was experimenting with instruments from a very young age, thanks to his mother's work as a violinist, conductor and teacher at the Royal Academy of Music.\n\n'I've always believed that you don't need a lot to be creative, just a space where it's safe for the ideas to come to the surface, and time to mess about,' he told British Vogue.\n\n'Having Logic [a music software] and a piano and a microphone was just unbelievable. How I started my YouTube career was just by extending my musical limbs in a visual way.\n\n'My life really changed because those videos started to get picked up by people I thought of as the greatest musicians in the world, like Herbie Hancock and Quincy Jones, who has been this amazing godfather figure to me.'\n\nJacob - who in 2014 signed to Quincy Jones's company - recently penned a heartfelt post to his late mentor, promising the musician will be 'in every note he plays'.\n\nLos AngelesTaylor Swift\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWill Beyoncé finally get Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards?

It was an absurd situation. I briefly considered recycling an old joke of mine about merging all of the High Plains states into a single province of South Saskatchewan. But as I toyed with it, the joke soured. The president of the United States was bellowing aggression against fellow democracies. The situation was simultaneously too stupid for serious journalism and too shameful for wisecracks.\n\nIn this second Trump presidency, many of us are baffled by how to respond. The former Trump strategist Steve Bannon memorably described Trump’s method as “flood the zone with shit.” Try to screen all the flow, and you will rapidly exhaust yourself and desensitize your audience. Ignore the flood, and soon you’re immersed in the stuff neck-deep.\n\nThe first Trump term was very different.\n\nMore than a million people demonstrated against him on January 21, 2017, many more than had attended his inauguration the day before. On January 27, Trump issued an executive order purporting to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Thousands of people thronged airports across the nation to protest. About a hundred were arrested. In less formal ways, civic-minded Americans also rallied against the new administration. They read and viewed more news, and paid for it at record levels, too. Trump reviled one news organization more than any other: the “failing New York Times.” In 2017 alone, the company’s revenues from digital subscriptions climbed 46 percent, pushing total company revenues above $1 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration bumbled from fiasco to fiasco. Within the first week, Trump’s choice of national security adviser lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government, setting in motion his early resignation and then criminal indictment. Trump that same week summoned then–FBI Director James Comey to dinner to pressure him to end the bureau’s investigation of Trump-Russia connections. The demand would lead to Comey’s firing, the appointment of a special counsel, and the prosecution and conviction of important Trump allies such as Paul Manafort.\n\nFirst-term Trump knew what he wanted: unlimited personal power. But he did not know how to achieve it, and an insufficient number of those around him was willing and able to help him. The senior administration officials who supported Trump’s autocratic ambitions lacked bureaucratic competence; the officials who possessed the bureaucratic competence did not support his ambitions. That’s one reason it took Trump more than a year—until March 2018—to impose the first major round of the tariffs that he wanted but his top economic adviser opposed.\n\nFirst-term Trump also lacked reliable partners in Congress. Then–Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and then–Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struck devil’s bargains with Trump to achieve their own agendas: tax cuts, judicial appointments, the attempted repeal of Obamacare. But they were not his men. They overlooked his corruption, but also imposed limits on what he could do. In 2019, Trump tried to name two personal loyalists to the Federal Reserve Board. McConnell’s Senate rejected them.\n\nSecond-term Trump is very different. He has moved rapidly to consolidate power. Even before he took office, the Department of Justice preemptively stopped all legal actions against him for his attempted seizure of power on January 6, 2021. As soon as he was inaugurated, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of all of those convicted for the violent attack on Congress. He then announced investigations of the lawyers who had acted to enforce the law against him.\n\nTrump has moved rapidly to oust independent civil servants, beginning with 17 nonpartisan inspectors general. He moved fast to install loyalists atop the two most important federal management agencies, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. His administration is united in claiming power to refuse to spend funds already appropriated by Congress and to ignore laws that constrain the absolute power of the executive branch. The whole Trump team, not only the president personally, is testing another important tool of power: stopping congressionally approved grants to states, to ensure that he is funding supporters and punishing opponents. The Trump administration retreated from the test after two days of uproar—but how permanently, who can say?\n\nTrump’s administration has launched large-scale immigration raids in Democratic cities and commenced legal action against local officials who stand in the way. The administration has stopped all international humanitarian aid, cutting off Ukraine. Trump is backed, not undercut, by senior national-security officials in his threats of territorial aggression against Greenland, Panama, and Canada. The Republican platform and congressional budget-writers approve Trump’s musings about replacing tax revenues with hoped-for windfalls from tariffs. Even his seemingly juvenile move to rename the Gulf of Mexico was immediately endorsed by his Department of the Interior. The absurd act carries an underlying serious message: The Trump administration stands behind its president’s high-handed rewriting of rules, even the most established and uncontroversial.\n\nLooming ahead are even more crucial acts of consolidation, including the appointment of an FBI director who has proclaimed his willingness to use the federal police force as a tool of presidential personal power.\n\nTrump’s opponents seem dazed, disoriented, and defeated. Despite the GOP’s slender majorities in both chambers of Congress, and despite Trump’s own low approval rating, the new White House for the moment carries all before it. There have been no mass protests. The demand for news and information—so voracious in 2017—has diminished, if not vanished. Audiences have dwindled; once-mighty news organizations are dismissing hundreds of journalists and staff.\n\nCompared with eight years ago, Trump is winning more and his opponents are resisting less.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nFour major things.\n\nFirst, this time Trump is not arriving in power alone. He and the Republican mainstream have merged, a convergence symbolized by the highly detailed Project 2025 plan written for Trump by the Heritage Foundation. Trump disavowed the plan during the campaign. He was lying when he did so. Now its authors are his most effective henchmen, and unlike the situation he faced in 2017, Trump can now combine expertise and loyalty in the same body of staffers.\n\nSecond, this time Trump’s opponents feel beaten in a way that they did not after 2016. That year, Hillary Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump. Clinton’s popular-vote advantage had no legal meaning. The office of the president is won or lost according to the arcane rules of the Electoral College, not by direct vote-counting. Politically, though, the popular vote matters a lot—that’s why Trump confected all those silly lies about his supposedly historic victory in 2016 and his allegedly enormous crowd size at the 2017 Inauguration. Back then, Democrats felt outmaneuvered but not out-voted. By contrast, Kamala Harris’s unqualified loss in 2024 has crushed morale. Democrats are divided, criticizing one another for their loss, not yet uniting to sound the alarm about how Trump is using his victory.\n\nThird, Trump owes many of his early successes to previous Democratic mistakes. On issue after issue—immigration enforcement, crime and public order, race and gender—Democratic governments over the past eight years have drifted away from the mainstream of American public opinion. The drift is best symbolized by that notorious answer Harris gave to a 2019 questionnaire asking whether she favored taxpayer-funded gender-transition operations for undocumented immigrants and federal prisoners. Her related response in an interview with a progressive group was like some kind of smart-aleck word puzzle: How many unpopular hot-button issues can be crammed into a single sentence? Harris believed that punching every one of those buttons was necessary to be a viable progressive in the 2019–20 cycle. She, and America, paid the price in 2024.\n\nA real quandary arises here. The best-organized Democratic interest groups want to fight Trump on the worst possible issues; the Democrats who want to fight on smarter issues tend to be less organized to fight. Until that conundrum is solved, Democrats are disabled and Trump is empowered.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the workforce? Not popular.\n\nHundreds of thousands of asylum seekers entering the United States with little way to expel them if they are ultimately refused (as almost all of them will be)? Even less popular.\n\nCreate a rift between the United States and Israel? Very unpopular.\n\nTrans athletes competing in girls’ and women’s sports? Wildly unpopular.\n\nThese are bad fights for Democrats to have. For that very reason, they are the fights that Trump Republicans want to start. Dangerously and unfortunately, they are also the fights that some of the most active of Democratic factions seek to have.\n\nThe fourth difference between 2017 and 2025 is the difference in the information space in which American politics is conducted. In 2017, politically minded Americans used platforms like Facebook and Twitter to share links to news sources. Some of those sources were deceptive or outright fake, but even fake news at least replicated the form and style of actual news.\n\nSince then, new platforms have risen to dominance, especially among younger Americans and those less connected to politics. These new platforms are far more effective at detecting and manipulating user bias, fear, and anger. They are personality-powered, offering affirmation and bonding as their proofs of truth.\n\nFor pro-Trump Republicans, this new information space is marvelously congenial. They love and hate based on personal recommendations, and will flit from issue to issue as their preferred “influencers” command. Such a movement centered on celebrity and charismatic leadership has no problem with the fact that its favorite media spread disinformation and distrust. In fact, it’s useful. Trump has in effect adapted a slogan from Mussolini: “Trump is always right.” Its corollary is: “Only Trump is right.” Nothing important is lost from a Trump point of view if right-wing media encourage their users to despise science, law, and other forms of expertise.\n\nThe anti-Trump coalition, however, is all about institutions. It depends on media that promote understanding of, and respect for, the work that institutions do. The new-media age is inherently inhospitable to institutionalists, and deeply demoralizing for them. Before they can organize to resist Trump, they must build new ways of communicating that adapt to contemporary technology but do not succumb to that technology’s politically destructive tendencies.\n\nAll of the above takes time. But it all can be done and must be done.\n\nThe second Trump administration has opened purposeful and strong. Its opponents have opened confused and weak. But today’s brutal reality can be tomorrow’s fading memory.\n\nThe second-term Trump synthesis does not even pretend to have an economic agenda for middle-class people. The predictable next round of tax cuts will disfavor them. The ensuing deficits will keep mortgage rates high. The tariffs and immigration crackdowns will raise consumer prices. Trump is offering nothing to help with the cost of health care and college.\n\nTrump using James Brown’s “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” as his walk-on song, staffing his administration with accused abuser of women upon accused abuser of women, and relying heavily on reactionary anti-woman gender politics as his political message and messengers: All of that will exact a political price in weeks and months ahead.\n\nTrump himself will lead and epitomize an administration of rake-offs and graft. He may succeed in sabotaging laws designed to prevent and punish corruption in high offices. He won’t be able to suppress awareness of his corruption.\n\nThe second-term Trump world will bubble with threats to U.S. security. Trump is determined to make each of them worse by fracturing our alliances in both the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific regions. The worst threat of all is that Trump will be drawn into military action inside Mexico, without the cooperation of the Mexican authorities. Trump’s project to brand drug cartels as international terrorist organizations has legal implications that Trump supporters refuse to consider. Right now, the cartels have powerful incentives not to commit violence against U.S. citizens or on U.S. territory. Yet Trump is poised on the verge of actions that could change the cartels’ calculus and import Mexico’s criminal violence north of the border on a huge scale.\n\nTrump won the election of 2024, but still failed to break 50 percent of the vote. His hold on Congress could slip at any time. His plans to foster voter-ID laws and gerrymandering to disenfranchise Democrats will collide with the new reality of American politics that these measures will harm his prospects more than his opponents’: Trump does best among the most disaffiliated Americans, whereas Democrats are widening their lead among those Americans who follow politics closely and vote most often.\n\nThe most immediate task for the anti-Trump coalition in these early months of 2025 is to avoid more mistakes. President Joe Biden ended his presidency by listening to advice to grant clemency to thousands of drug offenders, including heinous murderers. Who offered that advice? Don’t listen to them anymore! Fight Trump where he’s most vulnerable, not where progressive interest groups are most isolated and most dogmatic. Build unity from the center, rather than indulge the factionalism of the ultra-left.\n\nA great many Americans despise Trump for the basic reason that he’s a very nasty person who speaks in demeaning ways and does cruel things. The movement to stop him should look and sound and act nice. If you get reprimanded for “respectability politics,” or caricatured as “cringe,” or scolded for appealing to suburban “wine moms,” that’s when you’ll know you’re doing it right.\n\nThe MAGA elite feels and fears the weight of American democracy. It knows that democratic accountability and action will grind down its authoritarian aspirations and corrupt schemes. The MAGA elite’s best plan for success is to persuade the American majority to abandon hope and surrender the fight. Its most useful allies are the extremists who have too often misled the great American center into doomed leftward detours.\n\nNovember 2024 was bad. January and February 2025 are worse. The story is not over yet—unless you agree to lay down in despair the pen that can write the remainder of the story.","summary":"Avoid progressive pieties and rebuild an effective democratic majority","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/trump-election-second-term/681514/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/c0t8-eMdrc82XsR9JPgy3FX_DE8=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/01/Anti_Trump/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 14:00:00","author":"David Frum","authors":["David Frum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":286324376,"title":"Kanye West shares how he became billionaire after being broke","text":"US rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, has opened up about how he feels after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the United States 47th presidentKanye said he was no longer broke and now a billionaire, and that the world is lucky to have himThe rapper and businessman also mentioned US's former vice president Kamala Harris in his post, which disturbed netizens\n\nAmerican rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, has said that the world is lucky to have him.

Now what?","text":"A majority of Colorado voters have a negative view of both the Democratic and Republican parties, according to a recent poll that also found they increasingly identify Republicans with the working class and solutions to economic problems.\n\nThe poll comes as the national Democratic Party searches for a path forward in the wake of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to now-President Donald Trump in November. The strength of Republicans’ identification with working-class issues is a warning shot for a party that’s lost ground across the country.\n\nIn Colorado, where Democrats backslid slightly but largely maintained their recent gains in November, the results — funded and trumpeted by a centrist group — also hammer upon now-familiar divisions between the party’s left and moderate wings over how to consolidate and exercise Democrats’ reliable position atop state government.\n\n“It is true that the Democratic Party in Colorado is not a monolith,” said Kyle Saunders, a political scientist at Colorado State University. “It is not an ideological monolith — it’s a very diverse set of groups in coalition to support the Democratic cause. And while progressives want to pull the party further to the left, the concern over maintaining the Democratic advantage in Colorado is genuine, and I think that’s what this poll is trying to establish.”\n\n“Whether it does so effectively,” he continued, “is up to the reader.”\n\nThe poll, conducted by Keating Research, found that 45% of respondents had a favorable view of the Democratic Party, against 51% who viewed the party negatively. Just 37% had a favorable view of the Republican Party, versus 56% who viewed it unfavorably.\n\nThe poll was conducted in mid-December on behalf of One Main Street, a centrist Democratic dark-money group that doesn’t reveal most of its donors. Keating surveyed 1,225 Colorado voters, and the margin of error was 3.5 percentage points. Keating is a Colorado-based firm that generally polls Democratic issues.\n\nThe vast majority of self-identified Democrats and Republicans in the survey said they supported the party to which they aligned. But unaffiliated voters — who make up a plurality of Colorado voters — had a negative view of both parties, though they were more favorable toward Democrats than Republicans.\n\nStill, a majority of unaffiliated voters — and a majority of voters overall — said Republicans better represented the working class and were better at addressing the economy and inflation than Democrats.\n\nVoters also said the economy and cost of living, housing and immigration were the top issues facing the state; Republican and suburban voters, though, said they were primarily focused on immigration.\n\nAs for what motivated voters in the Nov. 5 presidential election, the economy was the top issue, ahead of immigration and a three-way tie of anti-Trump sentiment, candidates’ character and women’s rights.\n\nThough the poll included some questions about Republicans and Trump, the bulk of its results were devoted to the Democratic Party, its November losses and voters’ views on where the party should go from here — an ongoing debate in which One Main Street has a well-established position.\n\n“What we really learned on this poll is it showed that Democrats really need to focus on kitchen-table, bread-and-butter economic issues,” said Andrew Short, the executive director of One Main Street. “That folks are looking for leaders to really come together and find collaborative solutions to the big issues that we’re facing, that they’re sick of the political theatrics and those focused more on their Twitter likes than actually crafting good policy.”\n\n“More work to do,” party chair says\n\nShad Murib, the chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, said Democrats had “more to work to do” on “putting its money where its mouth is” with voters on economic issues.\n\nHe pointed to a recent Quinnipiac University poll of American voters that found the national Democratic Party was deeply unpopular — even more so than among Colorado voters.\n\nIn that way, the Keating poll was something like good-ish news for Colorado Democrats, Murib said: The party’s brand in the state hasn’t suffered as much as it has nationally, even after six years of firm Democratic control, and November brought mixed results.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo lost her reelection bid to the House of Representatives, meaning Colorado’s eight congressional seats are now evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. But Democrats in the statehouse maintained their firm legislative majorities, though they lost their supermajority control in the House in a nail-biter contest in El Paso County.\n\nStill, Murib said he was concerned about Colorado voters’ identification of the Republican Party with the working class. A plurality of the poll’s participants also said Democrats lost in November because the party was out of touch with voters.\n\n“That’s something I’ve been really concerned with and (that) is the canary in the coal mine from the national election,” Murib said of the November results. “The public is seeing Republicans as best representing the working class and the poor, and Democrats as representing elites. That’s why we’re focused intensely on economic abundance for all.”\n\nAs much as the poll showed warning signs for the Democratic Party, it — and in particular the questions it posed to voters — also served as another shot in the ongoing fight among the party’s moderate and progressive factions. That fight isn’t new, but it’s become an existential struggle nationally as the party tries to gather itself after November’s losses.\n\nThe battle is also increasingly prominent in Colorado as gubernatorial candidates begin to jockey to replace Gov. Jared Polis in two years.\n\nThe poll asked voters, for instance, if they thought the Democratic Party should now tack “to the left,” “to the right” or toward “bridging the divide to find workable answers.” The last one is the position that One Main Street supports, and poll respondents overwhelmingly selected that option, too.\n\nIt also asked about general policy objectives like “building generational wealth” and creating “high-quality jobs,” versus specific left-wing policy goals, like rent control and “free health care.”\n\n“I think One Main Street has a financial interest in making sure that what they stand for appears to be popular — so, like any other poll, they’re trying to prove their value in the ecosphere,” Murib said.\n\nNew legislative caucus underlines fight\n\nOne Main Street is no stranger to the struggle for party influence: The group spent millions of dollars last summer to back the more moderate candidates in several Democratic primaries. It also recently helped launch the “Opportunity Caucus” in the legislature, composed of several Democratic members it supported last year.\n\nSince the launch, that caucus has started an accompanying group that allows it to raise money on its own — a move that raised eyebrows among other Democratic legislators.\n\nShort, One Main Street’s executive director, said the poll’s “language was fair and focused on economic opportunity.”\n\nMurib agreed that the Democratic Party needed to focus more on economic issues.\n\nBut there are more nuances to the Democratic coalition than were revealed in One Main Street’s poll, Saunders, the CSU political scientist, said. And “economic opportunity” means different things to different members of that coalition.\n\nCase in point: Short said that to address the housing concerns identified in the group’s poll, One Main Street supported policies like construction-defects reform, which would make it more difficult to sue developers over construction problems in a bid to spur more condominium development.\n\nHe also pointed to this year’s House Bill 1042, which would nudge state regulators to consider how air quality rules impact the workforces of the industries they regulate, like oil and gas. That measure, which is sponsored by the chair and co-chair of the “Opportunity Caucus,” is supported by the oil and gas industry and opposed by environmental groups.\n\nBut Short was more lukewarm on the cost-of-living and housing policies that legislative Democrats have backed as priorities: bills to limit price increases on groceries, to lower hidden fees in housing and to ban the use of rent algorithms that drive up housing costs.\n\nThose policies, Short said, needed to be “carefully reviewed” to ensure they don’t have “unintended consequences.”\n\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.","summary":"The strength of Republicans' identification with working-class issues is a warning shot for the Democratic Party that's lost ground across the country.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/02/colorado-democrats-republicans-one-main-street-poll-shifts-voters/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TDP-L-GABE-EVANSA03_1665x.jpg?w=1024&h=740","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 13:00:43","author":"Seth Klamann","authors":["Seth Klamann"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":286297272,"title":"Republicans ‘don’t really care, Margaret’ because Democratic attacks aren’t landing","text":"The early days of Trump’s second term could hardly be more different than when he first came to Washington in 2017. Back then, Trump was still learning how to pull the levers of power while relying on insiders to help direct him.\n\nBut in his triumphant return, he’s more sure of himself and what he can do. Weeks before his inauguration, he started announcing his Cabinet picks. He said he was going to take 200 executive actions on Day One, addressing core planks of a campaign that pulled nearly every locality in the country rightward with his message of taming chaos at the southern border and restoring the prepandemic economy.\n\nBouncing from his “golden age” inaugural address in the Capitol rotunda to the speech he said he wanted to give all along but had to be reined in by his advisers, Trump reminded the country what presidential vigor and energy look like.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) was one of the hosts for his inaugural luncheon, welcoming him back with smiles and jokes about the food options from her home state. It was an image that was hard to shake a week later when she stood at a podium blasting Trump for directing the Office of Management and Budget to freeze all federal loans and grants pending a review.\n\nIn the lead-up to his return, Trump has made allies out of the Silicon Valley billionaires who threw up nothing but roadblocks for him eight years ago. Besides their cash, he appears to have taken their mindset when it comes to starting something new — Trump is moving fast and breaking things.\n\nDemocratic doldrums\n\nBefore he started shaking up the way Washington runs, Trump shattered Democrats’ spirits.\n\nHis comeback for the ages sent Democrats to the sidelines to lick their wounds. Out of power and out of mind, they questioned how, four years after Trump was consigned to the political wilderness, he had roared back to win not only the Electoral College but the popular vote.\n\nRather than preparing to counter his well-telegraphed plans, Democrats proceeded to fight with themselves about whether their problem was messaging or if they had simply lost touch.\n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris had decamped to California after her defeat, and then-President Joe Biden had long since been ushered off the stage.\n\nA competitive primary might have given Democrats another leader to look to in this moment. It might have revealed Biden’s shortcomings earlier and forced him out of the contest in time for Harris, or another candidate, to run a campaign that lasted longer than 100 days.\n\nInstead, Democrats were left twisting in the wind. Facing a future in the minority in Washington, state and national leaders started talking about how they were willing to work with Trump and Republicans rather than try to replay the 2017 “resistance” playbook.\n\nDemocrats readily admit their messaging is a mess — their decision to make identity politics the core of their appeal has made it nearly impossible to connect with voters who care more about the cost of living.\n\nLosing support among Latino and Hispanic voters has been especially damaging.\n\nJavier Palomarez, the founder and CEO of the United States Hispanic Business Council, told the Washington Examiner that Trump’s unpopular proposals and actions aren’t bad enough to convince voters who are “visibly tired of empty promises and identity politics” to sign up for another four years of Democratic administration.\n\n“If the last four years and President Donald Trump’s second election to the White House have proved anything, it is that voters prefer common sense and results-driven approaches,” Palomarez said. “Many Democrats and certain social and news media personalities have spent months calling Trump a felon and a threat to democracy and the duo of Vice President JD Vance and Trump weird and unlikable. In the meantime, Trump has capitalized on presenting common sense and attractive policies. This is why he has made inroads with groups that previously may have felt alienated by the Republican Party.”\n\nRepublican revival\n\nRecruiting those disaffected voters has sent a bolt of enthusiasm through Republicans who are feeling more optimistic about their future than ever. The good vibes Harris tried to capture in the early days of her campaign drained away and were scooped up by the resurgent GOP.\n\nIn the two weeks since Trump and Vance took office, every attack leveled at the party has fallen flat. Questions about why Trump’s Day One promises haven’t been fulfilled landed with a thud because voters don’t expect everything to happen overnight.\n\nWhile Democrats deflect on addressing problems voters want answers to, Trump and Vance are stepping into the breach and speaking honestly about what they want to do, George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nDemocrats “often focus on topics like Jan. 6 pardons or diversity initiatives,” Carrillo said. “While those issues have their place, they don’t connect with the immediate struggles families face. This leaves a vacuum for Trump and Vance to step in, position themselves as problem-solvers, and tell voters that meaningful change takes time, an argument many are starting to believe.”\n\nVance acknowledged that change is a process in his first interview as vice president last weekend. When asked why grocery prices hadn’t come down, he reminded CBS’s Margaret Brennan that Trump “can’t undo all of the damage of Joe Biden’s presidency in four days.”\n\nDuring her first briefing with reporters, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that attempts to tie rising egg prices to Trump were missing the point that they haven’t been more expensive in the last three years than when Biden was running the country.\n\n“There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,” she told the Washington Examiner. “I would like to point out to each and every one of you that in 2024, when Joe Biden was in the Oval Office or upstairs in the residence sleeping — I’m not sure — egg prices increased 65% in this country. We also have seen the cost of everything, not just eggs, bacon, groceries, gasoline have increased because of the inflationary policies of the last administration.”\n\nWhile sparring with Brennan, Vance summed up the ethos the Trump administration has in its early days in five simple words — ”I don’t really care, Margaret.”\n\nBrennan was trying to catch Vance out when talking about how immigrants were being vetted. She pointed out that it wasn’t clear whether an Afghan national with a special immigrant visa after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan and was arrested after plotting a terrorist attack on Election Day was radicalized before or after he entered the country.\n\n“I don’t really care, Margaret,” Vance said. “I don’t want that person in my country. And I think most Americans agree with me.”\n\nIt isn’t new for the out-party in Washington to go through an identity crisis. Whenever there is a changing of the guard, the winners get to take a victory lap while the losers regroup.\n\nThe problem for Democrats, besides not having a clear leader to rally around and enthusiasm for a project or set of policies to excite voters, is that they are trying to rerun a playbook that has proven to be ineffective. They are sluggish to respond to the flurry of activity Trump and company can produce, and when they get around to acting, their counterattack looks powerless.\n\nLast week, Democrats tried out a line of attack that, one user on X pointed out, would have landed perfectly if Mitt Romney or Bob Dole were the objects of their fury instead of Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump is putting together an administration focused on Wall Street—not Main Street,” the party posted.\n\nWhen the Office of Management and Budget released a memorandum announcing a widespread freeze of loans and grants, Democrats responded by holding a press conference to talk about Trump’s decision to pardon more than 1,500 people who had been charged for actions related to Jan. 6 — something he did a week earlier.\n\nThe substance of that briefing eventually morphed to address the freeze, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) opened his attack on the memo by invoking its similarities to Project 2025, a molehill of an issue that Harris fruitlessly tried to turn into a mountain during her doomed campaign.\n\nDespite a lackluster opening attack, Democrats might have finally landed a glove on Trump with their opposition to the OMB funding freeze. A steady stream of criticism and the threat of legal action backed the White House into a corner and forced the administration to rescind the memo.\n\nNotching one victory might get lost in the flood of frustrations Democrats have felt in recent weeks. But it might have also given them hope and a plan for future counterattacks. \n\nTrying to keep pace with the frenetic Trump, who appears intent on highlighting how different he is than Biden by the sheer volume of his activity, hasn’t worked. However, waiting and “pouncing” when Trump’s flurry of attacks leaves him vulnerable, could be a replicable strategy. \n\n“We started Jan. 20 really down in the dumps,” Schumer said last week after the OMB victory. “Our constituency has really been given a lift by our example. … We knew that [Trump] had really screwed up. And we just pounced.”\n\nBacking down might be a sign of things to come, though the White House continued to project confidence that it will win future fights when it comes to restricting spending. \n\n“In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,” Leavitt said. “The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments.”\n\nWith multiple victories on the board outweighing a marginal defeat, Republicans aren’t cowering under attempts at cultural ostracism either.\n\nNew York magazine’s cover story this week was about the “cruel kids’ table,” a tale of being “out late with the young right as they contemplate cultural domination.”\n\nRather than a stinging rebuke, Vance said, “It’s like they’re trying to make us look cool.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIt was a sentiment Vance delivered earlier in the day when he spoke to House Republicans at their retreat in Florida, saying Republicans were “cool” in a way they hadn’t been for a long time and that their popularity wasn’t on tenterhooks.\n\n“It’s one thing to win an election but another thing to win this cultural moment we’ve been having where people see Republicans as the answer.”","summary":"Democrats have had years to prepare for a second Donald Trump presidency, but without a captain at the wheel, they look like they are listing into oblivion.

[+] September 13, 2023 in Washington, DC. Health advocates and community members gathered in Washington D.C. to push for action on medical debt in an event hosted by Community Catalyst, a national organization fighting for race equality and health justice. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for Community Catalyst)\nGetty Images for Community Catalyst\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule issued by the Biden administration in January that would bar medical debt from being included on credit reports. The agency estimates the step will remove $49 billion in debt from the credit reports of at least 15 million people. The rule would take effect in March. However, President Trump signed an executive order pausing for 60 days all pending rulemaking activity for federal agencies. This includes the CFPB medical debt rule. He also fired the head of the CFPB, Rohit Chopra. Consumer advocates are worried that Trump and legislators may upend action to reduce debt burdens.\n\nThe health policy organization KFF estimates that up to 100 million Americans have some form of medical debt, with over 40 million owing around $88 billion. In turn, this affects the credit reports of almost half of the people with medical debt, which can lower their ability to take out loans and be considered creditworthy by lenders.\n\nA last-minute effort by the Biden administration to ease the burden of medical debt includes guidance issued in January to curb improper medical debt collections and publish resources to help consumers navigate medical bill disputes.\n\nBut the rule now faces challenges from the new Trump administration. The guidance has also been criticized by Republican lawmakers, who have said that the CFPB lacks the statutory authority to issue its final rule prohibiting lenders from using medical debt data to inform their credit decisions. They’ve called it a threat to credit reporting accuracy. And, companies that issue credit have also threatened legal challenges, including a preliminary injunction to stop it from being implemented, arguing their members would suffer harm in the form of “unrecoverable compliance costs” if the rule is not enjoined.\n\nThus far, President Trump hasn’t taken action to rescind the rule. But given his desire to shrink government and reduce regulations, he’s expected to roll back certain rules. Moreover, Trump just ousted Chopra, the Biden-appointed Director of CFPB.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWWE Royal Rumble 2025 Results, Winners And Grades\n\nOne Ukrainian Brigade Lost Entire Companies In ‘Futile’ Attacks On Worthless Treelines\n\nWWE Royal Rumble 2025 Recap: Winners, Eliminations And Reaction\n\nThroughout his tenure, Chopra targeted the financial services industry by spearheading consumer protection regulations, such as capping overdraft and credit card fees on banks, mortgage lenders, credit card providers, payday lenders and others. He worked closely with former Vice President Kamala Harris to address the medical debt crisis, too.\n\nIn 2022, KFF reporters investigated the financial burdens families face when saddled with medical debt. At the time, it was reported that U.S. medical debt totaled $195 billion. Approximately half of adults didn’t have sufficient cash to cover an unexpected medical bill, while 50 million adults were paying off bills on an installment plan for their or a family member’s care.\n\nThe situation may have worsened since then, given the increase in the numbers of underinsured. Recent numbers suggest that approximately 43% of working-age adults are inadequately insured. These are individuals who are uninsured (9%), have a gap in coverage during the year (11%) or are insured year-round but have coverage that doesn’t provide them with affordable access to healthcare (23%).\n\nWhile the CFPB rule could provide immediate relief if it is not nixed by the Trump administration, the underlying causes of medical debt remain unresolved. Structural deficiencies in the healthcare system include the ongoing problems of un- and underinsurance and high out-of-pocket costs for patients. This raises the question of whether there will at some point be reform to the health insurance systems in America, so as to not just alleviate the current medical debt crisis but also prevent it from happening in future.\n\nFollow me on Twitter. \n\nJoshua P.

Ye’s back a billionaire. The world might just be ok,” wrote the controversial star. He later said, in reference to the infamous red MAGA hat: “I risked my life to wear a red hat then he turned it black.”\n\nWest’s posts also generated controversy after he made a sexual comment about Harris, which has since been removed, as per The Metro.\n\nHe later said: “The democrats made me take the loser post down. Naw I’m kidding. Dey don’t control black people no more. Trump 4 life.”\n\nHe then made an apology to the former presidential nominee, writing: “Kamala seems like a very nice human I just wanna say sorry to her kids.”\n\nTrump has previously associated himself with West, even inviting the star to the White House in 2018 but in more recent years has made efforts to distance himself from the musician.\n\nDespite numerous controversies and lawsuits, the embattled rapper has managed to remain relevant. Last November, it was revealed that a new documentary was being made about him.\n\nTitled In Whose Name?, the film promises to offer “a unique and cinematic perspective on Ye’s public transformation.” It is hoping for a release date sometime this year.\n\n“With a billion-dollar budget and a commitment to truth, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, invites 18-year-old Nicolas Ballesteros armed with an iPhone on a six-year journey revealing unfiltered aspects of celebrity life, which confront the provocative opinions, grand visions and bold contrarianism that defined him as the world’s most controversial artist,” reads an official synopsis.\n\n“The film follows Ye’s ascent to becoming the richest Black man in American history while uncovering why the superstar risked everything he had built in the name of freedom.”\n\nMeanwhile, West is nominated for Best Rap Song at this year’s Grammys for his song “Carnival”.

Lakers in a deal centered around 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis.\n\nThe deal, which also involved the Utah Jazz, was first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania. It reportedly bilnd-sided everyone involved, including LeBron James, who learned about the trade while at dinner in New York after he notched a triple-double in the Lakers’ 128-112 victory over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Davis didn’t play in the game due to an abdominal injury.\n\nIn the wake of the stunning move that resets the landscape in the Western Conference, some people on social media were quick to take shots at Mark Cuban, accusing him of making a disastrous trade and sometimes pointing out that he had supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nOf course, Cuban no longer owns a controlling interest in the Mavericks, having sold his controlling interest to billionaire and Donald Trump supporter Miriam Adelson in late 2023 -- more than a year ago. Cuban currently owns a 27% stake in the Mavericks.\n\nAs of 2024, according to Forbes, Adelson has an estimated net worth of $32 billion, making her the 53rd-richest person as well as the richest Israeli in the world. She reportedly donated $100 million to the Trump campaign last year.\n\nBut those facts didn’t stop Internet trolls from taking shots at Cuban. Some of those Tweets got Community-Noted for their inaccuracy.\n\nMavericks GM Nico Harrison reportedly dealt Doncic amid concerns over his conditioning and diet -- and because he wanted a defensive stopper in Davis.\n\n“I believe that defense wins championships,” Harrison told ESPN’s Tim MacMahon. “I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We’re built to win now and in the future.”\n\nCuban actually defended Doncic this week when he and teammate Kyrie Irving were snubbed for the All-Star Game, calling it “insane.”\n\nIn 2020, Cuban said per Courtside Buzz, “If I had to choose between my wife and keeping Luka, catch me at my lawyer’s office preparing for a divorce.”\n\nSo while some fans tried to score some cheap points on social media by taking shots at Cuban, it was them who ended up looking like clowns.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

I didn’t just mean that one journalist was interviewing another — about a book that is, itself, largely about the world of journalism — although that’s true enough. Or even that three articles that originally appeared in Salon (by way of Higgins’ previous gig at the Institute of Public Accuracy) now appear in his new book, \"Owned: How Tech Billionaires on the Right Bought the Loudest Voices on the Left,\" although that’s true too. (One such Salon article is linked below.)\n\nWhat I meant was that Higgins and I (who have never met in person, for the record) feel uncomfortably close in some ways to the subject of his book, which tells the story of how the semi-legendary crusading journalists Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi gradually drifted toward the MAGA-friendly right, and made lots of money in doing so. It’s not just the story of two cantankerous dudes becoming far more cantankerous — although, as Higgins himself suggests, that’s undeniably part of the story — but it’s also not some MSNBC propaganda narrative about dissident left-wingers actually being paid shills for Russia (as has been suggested, I believe, about both of those guys).\n\nWhere the discomfort comes in is that Higgins and I are both precisely the kind of civil-libertarian leftists who agreed, to a significant degree, with the scathing criticisms that Greenwald and Taibbi (among others) directed at the liberal-Democratic consensus during the Obama years and the first Trump term. Higgins was a friend and admirer of Greenwald’s in particular; I knew Greenwald less well (although I was a staff writer for Salon when he was a columnist here) but have defended his prickly perspective on several occasions and have avoided criticizing him in print. Neither of us knew Taibbi well, but his ferocious reporting on the George W. Bush administration and the financial crisis of 2008, for Rolling Stone and elsewhere, created a reputation that has now diminished nearly all the way to nothing.\n\nOnce it became impossible to follow these two into the lucrative tech-bro spaces of Substack and the so-called intellectual dark web — where they joined other media refugees like former New York Times columnist Bari Weiss — the painful question emerged of what had happened and why. Some answers were entirely too obvious (ka-ching); others seemed too painful. \n\nGreenwald became a regular guest on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show during its latter months on the air; Taibbi wrote up the \"Twitter Files,\" apparently convincing himself that a trove of internal corporate records personally curated and delivered by Elon Musk somehow qualified as a scoop. As Higgins tells the story in “Owned,” which at times feels like one of those thrillers where you can’t quite work out who the good guys are, all of this was part of a much larger pattern — a campaign by some of the richest men in the world to control the flow of information, especially when it was about them. With Donald Trump back in the White House and Musk apparently in control of the federal workforce, a sinister new chapter appears to have begun. Let’s let Eoin Higgins take it from here.\n\nThis interview transcript has been edited for clarity and length: For instance, I’ve placed our discussion of Substack at the top even though it occurred toward the end of our conversation.\n\nSubstack plays an important role in this story, and even to media professionals its appearance and prominence over the past few years were startling and unexpected. So tell us how that platform came into being and what it represents in your book. \n\nSure. Substack is a newsletter service. It was started, I think. in 2017. It's basically, like, a successor to Blogspot. It's where people can write whatever they want. And in this case, it has a great UX system. It looks great. It has streamlined subscription and revenue generation. It's a very slick, very good product. In 2019, I believe, tech billionaire Marc Andreessen led a funding round and put a lot of money into it. With that money, Substack was able to start giving paid deals to writers to entice them from their jobs, to come over to Substack and write there. Effectively, what happened is that they peeled off some mainstream writers, and they started to find that the politics of the people there began to tilt right, especially on some socially conservative topics like trans rights, which has been kind of the big one.\n\nI see the transphobia stuff as part of the story, but the bigger part of the story is the peeling off of these established writers from the publications that they wrote for previously, which devalues the publications with their departure. It decentralizes media in a way that is not inherently negative in a vacuum, but when it's being pushed by someone like Andreessen — someone who does not like the media, because the media can be critical of him — you have to wonder what the reasoning is. I believe that was the reason: an attempt to decentralize the media and kind of break it down.\n\nRight. So just to summarize that briefly, it was both an attempt to foreground more right-wing voices, accidentally or otherwise, and an attempt to disempower or undercut more traditional forms of media.\n\nYeah, I mean, that's totally my belief. \n\nWell, here you are, Eoin, with this book about this Big Tech attack on media hitting less than a month into the second Trump administration. You couldn't have planned that any better. Did you actually predict all this?\n\nHonestly, no. When Bold Type Books pitched me on doing this, they said, we want someone to write about Glenn and Matt, and you've been suggested by a number of people as the right person to do this. I was like, yes, of course, but I would also like to make it about how tech billionaires were investing all this money into alternative media. Not alternative media like Salon, but alternative media like Substack and Callin and and all this stuff, in order to create a media ecosystem that favored them, one that would act almost like a PR arm for them.\n\nAt the time, it wasn’t that explicit, but I said, I would also like to dig into these guys, I want to talk about where the money is coming from. They were like, yeah, that sounds great. So I wrote it pretty quickly, and we were going through the editing process. The draft was done in February 2024, and I was like, let's try and get it out before the election. They were like, OK, that’s not going to happen. That's not how publishing works.\n\nI complained about that, but they convinced me that this was the right way to go. So we set the publishing date, and Joe Biden was still the nominee. Then, when Kamala Harris came in, I was like, this is good for the world, but not necessarily good for my book, right? [Laughter.]\n\nI was really involved with pushing for an earlier date, and it turned out that I was completely wrong. I should have listened to them in the first place. I felt like there was no way that Trump would get elected again. I just didn't think there was any way that people would want to do that again. I think I just misjudged how bad things had been during Biden. I had a massive blind spot there. \n\nSo now the book is coming out — and look at what Elon Musk is doing, look at the Peter Thiel stuff. The tech stuff has started to become more important than the media stuff, although I think it’s really important to understand the media stuff, the information ecosystem that these people have created around them. So this is hitting at this time where, you know, a lefty, independent book focused on media criticism probably would not have the same buzz.\n\nYeah, and you somewhat anticipate my next question. Why write a book about two journalists who, as famous or notorious as they may be in our profession, are not widely known to the general public? The answer, in some ways, is that that’s not what your book is really about. But I’d like to hear your answer.\n\nWell, I think that Glenn and Matt are well known to a certain age cohort. I think people who were in college between about 2005 to 2015 definitely know who these guys are. Not because of their Twitter accounts and their punditry, but because of the work they did. Specifically, I mean, Glenn's reporting on Edward Snowden, that was world-changing stuff. That’s in the history books forever. No matter what else he ever does, he's always going to be known for that. It’s not a footnote. \n\nMatt Taibbi is less prominent, but certainly people who were in school or who were young in general during the financial crisis are aware of him. I have a lot of friends who are apolitical, you know, working people who don't have the same deranged interest in politics that I do, right? They’re just not interested. But they know who these guys are.\n\nThat’s interesting. I wouldn’t have guessed that. \n\nWell, because they're my age, they're in their mid 40s, right? Writing a book about the tech takeover of media — I mean, you could sell that book now, but when I was contracted to do this, there wasn't the same huge interest in it. So using the journeys of these two people who are highly influential was a good way of exploring the themes around tech and control of information in the media. So I would gently push back on the idea that they're not that well known, but maybe the point you're getting at is that they are not nearly so influential now, right? And that's definitely true.\n\nTheir influence was starting to wane a little when I started to write the book, but I've been surprised by how far they've fallen off the radar, over the last year-plus. With Taibbi, the big thing was the \"Twitter Files.\" He got some headlines out of that, but people aren't really paying a lot of attention to him anymore. Glenn is siloed off on Rumble, which is good for him money-wise, but his audience has to be shrinking at this point. I mean, there's not a lot of people who are interested in that platform. I don't want to say he doesn't have a large audience, but it’s no longer a hugely influential audience. I think The Intercept needed him. That’s undeniable, if you look at the way things have gone for them since he left. But the reverse is also true. He needed them as well, and I think they both are worse off now. \n\nYeah, I agree with most of that. I definitely agree with you on Greenwald's importance when it comes to the Snowden revelations, and that speaks to why you were the person to write this book. If you understand the metaphor, the call is coming from inside the house, right? You understand the worldview that these guys, at least at one time, appeared to represent. You’re not coming at them from the outside, from an MSNBC perspective or a mainstream Democratic perspective. You’re not going to accuse them of being Russian agents. You’re more closely aligned with these guys than a lot of their critics would be.\n\nYeah. I mean, totally. When I was in college — I went to college late — that was when Glenn had just started to write for Salon. And, like, immediately, he was speaking to me, I was a fan. And my good friend in college, who I used to talk about this stuff with a lot, he felt the same way about Taibbi. I was totally locked in. I think I describe myself in the book as a civil libertarian leftist, and I still am. The specifics of my political belief system are based in my reaction to the War on Terror under George W. Bush. For someone like that, for someone with my views, who better to express that, at that time, than a polemicist like Glenn Greenwald, who was able to put that stuff into words and take the fight to the people who were spreading the mainstream message of war and authoritarianism?\n\nYour book strikes me, in a way, as a companion piece to Spencer Ackerman’s \"Reign of Terror,\" which is probably the best single work on how the post-9/11 era and the War on Terror changed this country. Do you agree with that? \n\nIf you're gonna say that my book is a companion to Spencer's, that's a huge compliment. Yeah, a lot of the front half of the book is my response to the War on Terror, which was what Glenn was addressing at the time. I’m obviously not neutral, right? I'm being very clear that I agree with him. I still agree with him about a lot of this stuff. \n\nThere's a moment, and this is quoting Glenn, when he’s talking about how his friendship with Rachel Maddow fell apart, and he says, \"I thought we believed the same things, and then she just became this establishment voice for this kind of state power, War on Terror stuff, as long as as it was the Democrats doing it.\" I think there's a lot of truth to that. I understand that frustration, just as I understand Matt’s frustration in \"Hate Inc.\" when he talks about how Maddow and MSNBC are damaging to their audiences.\n\nBut where they both start to lose me is that if you're going to say that MSNBC is as damaging as Fox, I'm going to need to see more evidence for that. Because with Fox, I mean, it’s about the audience. If you're radicalizing the audience of Fox News, the results are going to be a lot worse than if you radicalize a liberal audience, quite frankly. So if you line those two up and make a parallel comparison, the way that Taibbi does explicitly in “Hate Inc.,” and like both Glenn and Matt did for a long time — before they both came to this conclusion that, actually, the big problem is the Democrats — I think you're kind of playing yourself at that point. You’re not really thinking clearly.\n\nIt was almost painful to me to read those early sections of your book, because the critique that both of those guys, and especially Glenn, have offered about mainstream Democrats capitulating to certain ideas about state power and mass surveillance — I mean, that's all true, right? I imagine you and I are in accord on that. And the unanswerable question that I have is, OK, if you make that critique, where does the loss of perspective come in? How do you decide that the enemy of your enemy has to be your friend now, and that somehow the Republican side is less guilty of, you know, truly noxious things? I don't get that part at all. \n\nYeah, I don't know how that really happens. I mean, I can talk about how I see it happening, and I will. But I think there's a more interesting question that you're asking, which is, like, how does that happen psychologically, right? My answer to that is also, I don't know. I wish I knew, because I can kind of lay out the facts on what happened.\n\nWith Glenn, I see somebody who aligned himself with liberals during the the latter Bush years and made a career for himself doing this, pushing back on the civil-liberties infringements and the authoritarianism of the Bush regime. Then he watched liberals, over eight years, just abandon all of that because of their partisan affiliation with Barack Obama. OK, so I'm with him on that 100 percent. Like, there's no question. That’s why, in most of my political writing, I'm so harsh on Democrats, because I just don't care about Republicans. I think they're a lost cause. I don't care, right? I mean, they can cause a lot of damage. They matter in that way, and should be criticized in that way. But I'm not criticizing them, because I don't expect anything else. \n\nAnd then Trump becomes president. I don’t think Glenn was a supporter of his, right? But what he didn't like, which was the same as me and the same as almost everybody I quote in the book favorably, was the Democrats becoming obsessed with Russia and refusing to address any of the things that got us the point where Trump got elected in the first place. They squandered two-plus years where they could have been fighting back against the Trump agenda on, you know, conspiracy theories and pretending that there was some vast overseas plot to overthrow the U.S. That was a massive, massive mistake. That was a disaster. \n\nBut Glenn took this and instead of having it become, hey, let's continue to resist state power irrespective of who's in power, he became completely obsessed with Democrats and liberals and the way that they were responding. He’s always had some right-winger to him, you know, some conservative beliefs. That's very American of him. Most Americans aren't one or the other, right? That's fine. But he basically decided that liberals were the problem, and I think the attention that he got from that, and the way that he got flattered and worked by the alt-right media machine, including Tucker Carlson and Fox News, and then the tech guys, I think that just solidified it. And then when he found that there was an opportunity, he took it.\n\nMeaning an opportunity to go to an independent platform — Substack, in this case — and make a lot of money doing so? \n\nYeah. I feel like that had been building for a while, and when it happened, it wasn't super surprising. Even then, I held out some hope. You know, I was still friendly with him on a superficial online level. But he just went too far in a direction that I couldn't follow, and then I started to see him as this character who was more interested in his own advancement than in any of the principles that he had built his career on. Maybe I was finally seeing him for who he really was, you know? A lot of people would probably argue that.\n\nAs far as Taibbi goes, I mean, he also rejected the Russiagate stuff in probably harsher terms than Glenn did, which earned him a lot of anger from liberals. Then the #metoo scandal hit [regarding allegations from Taibbi's earlier career in Russia] and I think he just slowly drifted to the right. You know, I think he was always regarded with suspicion by some people on the left. Liberals were eager to have a reason to be done with him anyway. So that was kind of a perfect storm and by 2020, COVID kind of drove him insane. Maybe that happened before COVID, but now the stuff he's saying, it's just completely out to lunch. He's just an anti-vax conspiracy theorist. He seems to be really flailing, trying to find any kind of audience that he can at this point, like with the “Twitter Files.” He obviously thought that was going to be his noted moment, and it just didn't hit. \n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nThat was so lame. I don't know how somebody who worked as a professional journalist for so long could think that was really going to work, or could fail to understand that he was being played, or was willfully playing himself. \n\nNo, I don't either. I've always maintained that while there wasn't much in there that was earth-shattering, it was really interesting to see how they made decisions. But it's not world-changing reporting, and then when you find out that Elon Musk cherry-picked this stuff, and there was other stuff Matt couldn't look at. I think it just wasn't there. That was another disappointment in a career that had increasingly become about disappointment. And you know, then the right was willing to support him and be friendly to him, so he just embraced their beliefs.\n\nOne thing your book winds up being about, maybe by accident, is the importance of ideology. You make the argument that neither of these guys was strongly motivated by ideology. Maybe Greenwald had an ideology, kind of, and people interpreted it in different ways at different times. But I think we can say that neither of these guys was a committed leftist for ideological reasons. I’m not the kind of person who thinks that's the most important thing in life, and I bet you’re not either. But that’s part of the story here, right? \n\nYeah. I mean, as it turned out, Glenn didn't really believe in a lot. I think he is committed to the cause of Palestine, or at least committed against Israel. I don't know if that's because of deep belief, but I don't see any reason to read him in bad faith on that. Similarly, I don't know if his belief in free speech is based on a belief that everybody should have the right to speak, or if he just likes fighting for people whose speech is seen as repulsive. But, you know, his rants are pretty fungible. He's very happy to turn on people and say the opposite thing that he said a few months or a year ago. I think he's just kind of self interested.\n\nAs far as Taibbi goes, I mean, I say this in the book, but they’re both Gen X, right? Like, they just have this kind of nihilism. Yeah, I can say that, because I'm on the cusp. [Laughter.] I'm not a millennial talking about Gen X from afar. I don’t want to make it sound totally self-important, but I do think there is something that's kind of nihilistic: “Don’t sell out, man,” even as you're selling out. That kind of thing.\n\nThere's a quote by Glenn in the epilogue. I gave him a whole block quote because I just thought it was so interesting. He was describing Taibbi, but he was kind of describing himself too, talking about getting more conservative as you get older. I really thought that was kind of a perfect way to describe a lot of what happened.\n\nWhen I was reading over the transcript, I was like, if this was just some guy, a lawyer or whoever, who had the same politics Glenn had during the Bush administration and was now in his mid-50s, who hadn’t had this history of being a big-time journalist and writing books that sold hundreds of thousands of copies — if this was just some guy saying this, it makes sense. You get more conservative as you get older, and maybe you decide that liberalism has gone too far once it starts to annoy you to the point that you start feeling uncomfortable. You know, there's nothing particularly unique about that. I think that does have something. I don't think it's everything. I think it’s something.\n\nIt's definitely something. Any final words?\n\nWhat I would like your readers to do, whether they are fans of Glenn from his days at Salon or after, or they are opponents of Glenn and Matt, whichever they are, I invite them to come into this with an open mind. I have a defined point of view that I think comes through in this book, but I also pride myself on being as fair as possible. Matt wouldn’t talk to me, but I gave Glenn every opportunity to push back on what people are saying. I don’t know whether Glenn comes off well, but we spoke for nearly three hours, and you definitely get his side of the story.","summary":"How did crusading journalists Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi become right-wing trolls?

Gabe Evans (R-CO), a police officer and Army combat veteran who defeated former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo by 0.8 percentage points of the vote. The chairman said Evans’s “interesting background” made him appealing to independent voters.\n\nThe 13 Democratic targets are Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-MI), Don Davis (D-NC), Susie Lee (D-NV), Gabe Vasquez (D-NM), Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Tom Suozzi (D-NY), Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Nellie Pou (D-NJ), Adam Gray (D-CA), and Josh Harder (D-CA).\n\nAll of the districts represented by the 13 Democrats voted for Trump. Some, such as Golden’s, Perez’s, and Kaptur’s, are unsurprising as Trump won them in 2020. But others, such as Vasquez’s, Gonzalez’s, and Suozzi’s, shifted red after voting for then-candidate Joe Biden by wide margins in the 2020 election.\n\nHudson said the NRCC’s top priority is to oust these 13 Democrats, which he calls the “real battleground.”\n\n“Any Republicans they try to put in play, I mean, those are real long shots,” Hudson said. “It’s going to be really expensive for them to make those into real races. So we’re going to stay on offense.”\n\nCandidate quality has been a sore subject for Republicans in recent cycles, especially after a “red wave” expected in the 2022 midterm elections hit a blue wall after several centrist Republicans were defeated in the primaries by more extreme, hard-line candidates. Those hard-liners, such as Mehmet Oz and Kari Lake, went on to lose to the Democrats in key gubernatorial or congressional races.\n\nIn the 2024 election, Republicans faced a similar dilemma in certain races — such as the contest in Virginia’s 7th District between GOP candidate Derrick Anderson and now-Rep. Eugene Vindman (D-VA). A “fake family” photo darkened Anderson’s campaign despite the former candidate insisting he never claimed the women in the photo were his family.\n\nWith every seat up for grabs in the House in 2026, and Democrats already showing signs of attacking the Republicans’ agenda with full force, Republicans will need to ensure they have the best candidates available to beat out Democrats who were able to siphon votes from independents who also voted for Trump.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Viet Shelton contended that House Democrats “overperformed” in the 2024 cycle, saying the conference held “Republicans to their smallest majority in nearly a century by running authentic battle-tested candidates who focused on pocketbook issues.”\n\n“Contrast that with the NRCC’s fixation on recruiting unlikable extremists with fake families who only fall in line behind the far-right’s efforts to raise costs on everyday families and defund law enforcement so they can pay for billionaire tax breaks,” Shelton said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “It all adds up to a toxic recipe that will cost House Republicans the majority in 2026.”\n\nRepublicans lean heavily into ‘mandate’ from voters as blueprint for success\n\nAt the GOP Issues Conference held in Doral, Florida, from Monday to Wednesday, Hudson presented 2024 results to the over 160 lawmakers in attendance, as well as instructed Republicans on how they can not only retain but also grow the majority in 2026.\n\nHistorically, the party that wins the White House sees the House flip to the opposing party in the midterm elections following the presidential win. House Republicans currently hold a one-seat majority due to a few vacancies and will only have a two-seat majority when all members are sat.\n\nHowever, Hudson thinks that the outcome of the 2024 election proves that this upcoming midterm cycle could be different from most traditional years — because Trump is only the second president in United States history to serve two nonconsecutive terms.\n\n“You have a president who served and then left office, and then you had a different president with completely different velocity, completely different policies, took the country in a completely 180-degree different direction, and then you had a test from the American people: Which one do they like better? And they chose overwhelmingly Donald Trump,” the chairman said.\n\nSince Trump’s inauguration, House Republicans have rallied around one word: “mandate.” Several are convinced that if they deliver on the agenda set by the president during his campaign and within his first week in the White House, they can prevent a majority loss in 2026.\n\nRep. Brian Babin (R-TX) has been in Congress for a decade and has seen administrations lose the House majority on both sides of the aisle. He told the Washington Examiner he thinks the worst thing Republicans, particularly those in “dicey districts,” can do is to kick the can down the road.\n\n“’Let’s wait until next time. Let’s wait till the next election before we do this.’ I’ve heard that so many times over the last decade,” said Babin, who serves as the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n\nWhile he hopes the GOP majority will grow, he thinks members should be willing to “sacrifice their seats” to deliver on Trump’s agenda.\n\nRep. Buddy Carter (R-GA), who has been in office since 2015, said “speed and efficiency” will be the keywords for the conference, believing they learned mistakes from Trump’s first presidency.\n\n“President Trump himself has said that during his [first] administration that it took too long to get them done,” Carter said, referring to agenda items. “And that’s one of the things that happened during the midterms of his first administration, is that they didn’t have time to have an impact.”\n\n“The things we need to stay away from, I think are really just self-inflicted,” Carter added.\n\n2026 priority: Keeping traditionally blue demographics trending red\n\nHouse Majority PAC, the Democrats’ super PAC, has released a list of its 2026 targets. Several include swing seats, such as those held by Reps. David Valadao (R-CA), Young Kim (R-CA), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), and Nick Begich (R-AK). \n\nBut other targets include Republicans like Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ) and Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), who won their races with over 9% of the vote, as well as Reps. John James (R-MI), Mike Lawler (R-NY), and Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ), who are listed as “potential open seats.”\n\nThe PAC also lists lawmakers such as Reps. Nancy Mace (R-SC), Stephanie Bice (R-OK), and Laurel Lee (R-FL) as possible grabs if Democrats can attract “quality candidates and strong campaigns.”\n\nSources familiar told the Washington Examiner that certain candidates who are not in competitive districts but on the House Majority PAC’s list expressed concerns to Hudson about their ability to keep their seats — but he says he’s not concerned.\n\n“We’ll keep an eye on it,” Hudson said, noting that the NRCC will help them with fundraising even though they are not front-line priorities.\n\nSurprisingly, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) is not on the House Majority PAC’s target list — despite him being only one of three Republicans representing a district that then-Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024. Hudson said that is a testament to Fitzpatrick being a “battle-tested warrior.”\n\n“That guy knows his district, communicates well, and he represents their views,” Hudson said. “They know him, they like him, they trust him.”\n\nDuring the Doral conference, Hudson presented data on House Republicans receiving the largest popular vote since 1928. He also reinforced the NRCC will “double down” on things such as keeping Hispanic, African American, and Asian American voters on the side of the Republicans.\n\nTrump picked up a small but significant number of black and Hispanic votes during the 2024 election. Exit data from the Associated Press found that 43% of Latino voters supported Trump compared to 55% of the same bloc voting for Harris. In 2020, Biden received 63% of the Hispanic vote compared to the 35% that voted for Trump.\n\nA Republican presidential candidate has not won more than 12% of the black vote in nearly 50 years. However, Trump broke yet another record in the 2024 election by siphoning off 16% of the black vote compared to Harris receiving 83%. Biden received 91% of the black vote in 2020.\n\nHudson said he thinks Republicans can keep Hispanic and black voters trending their way if they pitch on a “winning formula.”\n\n“I think they care about the same things every other voter cares about, which is the cost of things for their family, security, and safety in their neighborhoods, the southern border,” Hudson said. “These are all the issues that they care about. And so if we keep our promise in the election and deliver on those issues and then communicate with them about it, I think that’s the winning formula.”\n\nRepublicans will get their first taste of what races are like without Trump’s name on the ballot in 2026. The trick, Hudson said, is finding out what drove the “Trump coalition” and, in turn, making it a “Republican coalition.”\n\n“I think the answer is that we communicate with them,” the chairman said. \n\n“Trump’s personality drove him,” he added. “But also, the fact that he was talking about closing the southern border, the fact he was talking about their challenges with affordability — all these issues. And so I think part of it’s personality-driven, but I think a lot of it is what he was talking about: bringing common sense back to government. I mean, these are all core Republican messages.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEyes will be on the conference, especially over the next few months, to see how it handles reconciliation — one of the biggest challenges that the GOP trifecta will take on under the watchful eyes of Democrats and, more importantly, the voters.\n\n“I, as an American, expect we’re going to have our family feud, but in the end, we need to be unified to push this agenda,” Rep. Mike Haridopolos (R-FL) said. “And the verdict is going to come in, what, 22 months?”","summary":"DORAL, Florida — National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) is keeping one eye on the 2026 midterm elections, hoping they will draw in candidates with a “little something extra.”  Hudson has a tall order for the next two years: He must raise significant funds and attract quality candidates to challenge 13 Democrats he [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3307157/nrcc-chief-2026-house-majority-compelling-candidates/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP24200833066914.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 11:00:00","author":"Rachel Schilke","authors":["Rachel Schilke"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":286281070,"title":"Kanye West returns to X with lewd admission about Kamala Harris in explosive tirade","text":"Rapper Kanye West’s latest social media exploits have been condemned (Picture: Getty)\n\nKanye West has returned to social media platform X with a slew of tweets, including a now-deleted explicit comment about former US Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe controversial American rapper, 47, took to the website overnight on Saturday to post a string of seemingly disconnected thoughts.\n\nAmong his defiant statements, which included ‘Trump’s back in office. Ye’s back a billionaire.

I don’t f**k losers anymore.’\n\nThe post, seen and shared by The Shade Room on Instagram, was firmly condemned in the comments, with @feezyimhim responding: ‘Let’s not normalize disrespecting women of color and excellence.’\n\n‘The Kamala comments 😢 & this man has daughters 🤮,’ added @4bmoves.\n\n Ye returned to X to post a stream of seemingly disconnected thoughts, including one where he shared an explicit comment about former US VP Kamala Harris (Picture: Getty)\n\n He has since deleted the tweet and apologised to Harris’s family (Picture: Getty)\n\nAfter removing the tweet, Ye then posted: ‘The democrats made me take the loser post down. Naw I’m kidding. Dey don’t control black people no more. Trump 4 life.’\n\nHowever, his most recent post included a semi-apology, with Ye writing: ‘Kamala seems like a very nice human I [sic] just wanna say sorry to her kids.’\n\nHarris is step-mother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s adult children, son Cole, 30, and 25-year-old daughter Ella.\n\nKanye, who is nominated for best rap song with Carnival at the upcoming 2025 Grammy Awards, is no stranger to raising eyebrows on social media with his posts.\n\n Kanye failed to offer any apology to Harris herself, who lost her bid to become president to Donald Trump (Picture: X/@kanyewest)\n\nTo celebrate his wife Bianca Censori’s 30th birthday, he posted a video of her fully nude in the bathtub in what was merely one of the latest in a series of risqué images and clips they have each posted of her on social media.\n\nThe couple is well known for promoting her nearly naked outfits in public – while he remains fully clothed and often masked.\n\nLast month Ye also posted and then immediately deleted a very revealing picture of her body in a tiny string bikini, which left very little to the imagination.\n\nBianca and Kanye secretly tied the knot in December 2022, having been publicly linked since earlier that year.\n\n The chart-topper often courts controversy on social media, including by sharing naked images of his wife Bianca Censori (Picture: Instagram/@ye)\n\nShe’s worked at his brand Yeezy since 2020 as an architectural designer, and the music and fashion mogul finalised his divorce with ex-wife Kim Kardashian – with whom he shares four kids – in November 2022.\n\nAll of the Lights artist Ye has also recently been claiming he’s reached billionaire status once again, reportedly making him the richest rapper alive.\n\nOne of two posts on his Instagram is a picture of a report from valuation provider Eton Venture Services, seemingly confirming his net worth.\n\n Kanye has also recently celebrated his claim that he’s a billionaire once more (Picture: AFP via Getty

Yeezy mark.’\n\nReposting the screenshot to his 20.5million followers, Ye, 47, wrote in his caption: ‘LAA LA LA LA’.\n\nYe’s net worth of $2,770,000,000 is roughly equivalent to £2.22billion, meaning

more vital for rising stars. \n\nFor wannabe models, hearing tales of models like Jourdan Dunn being scouted by a top modelling agency in her local Primark or Kate Moss being discovered at an airport is a mere dream. \n\nA chance that their leggy teenager selves could be plucked from obscurity and thrust into the glittering fashion world. \n\nBut those young hopefuls will never get a look in as nepo babies have swept the industry. \n\nAt this week’s Couture Fashion Week in Paris attention has been pulled away from intricate, one of a kind pieces that take months to create by hand and the focus has been on the nepo children of A-List celebrities. \n\nThe fashion industry and its loyal followers have been enraged this week with the arrival of models and front row guests of elitist off

fashion week, in September 2024 her oldest son, David Banda, 18, strided down the catwalk at Off-Whites show in New York. \n\nAnother big name in showbiz, Kylie Jenner, shocked fashion lovers by managing to bag a front row seat at Chanel's fashion show this week. \n\nThe 27-year-old business mogul, reality star and daughter of Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner, who has also been seen this week dining in Paris with boyfriend Timothee Chalamet, wowed in a signature Chanel tweed two-piece paired with mini bag and cat-eye sunglasses. \n\nWhilst this isn’t her first appearance at Couture Week,

Lennox, daughter of singer Annie Lenoux. \n\nPlus Ava Phillippe, 25, who is daughter of Hollywood acting royalty Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe. \n\nIn September last year Romeo Beckham hit the

blocs Republicans are targeting ahead of 2026","text":"DORAL, Fla. — The lawmaker in charge of House Republicans’ elections arm is feeling confident that the GOP can buck historical precedent and hold onto their majority for the entirety of President Donald Trump’s term. The 2024 elections saw Republicans make significant inroads with Hispanic and Black voters. National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., said progress would continue heading into the 2026 midterm elections. BLACK CAUCUS CHAIR ACCUSES TRUMP OF 'PURGE' OF 'MINORITY' FEDERAL WORKERS \"We’ve done well with African Americans, comparatively,\" Hudson told Fox News Digital, referring to years prior. \"We've put a lot more effort in reaching out to that community as well and letting them know that we want your votes, and we want to represent you, and we care about the issues that matter to you and your family.\" \"I think we can do better, and we'll continue to attempt to do better. But, look, our message, our values, our principles are all universal.\" He said Republicans’ values also lined up with Hispanic and Latino voters, 42% of whom supported Trump, according to the Associated Press. \"We are focused on the issues you care about,\" Hudson said the pitch was. \"It's crime in your neighborhoods. It's education for your children. It's securing the borders. It's the price of things for your family. I mean, these are all things we campaigned on. But we deliberately went out into the Hispanic community and said, ‘We want your vote.’ And they responded.\" Earlier in the interview, he credited Trump with delivering on those values in 2024, and argued that Trump’s policies would get Republicans over the line again next year. Historically, the first midterm after a new presidential term serves as a rebuke of the party in power. Democrats won the House of Representatives in a \"blue wave\" in 2018 during Trump’s first term. Four years later, Republicans wrestled it back under former President Joe Biden. But the circumstances are somewhat different this time, something Hudson noted. \"We’re in a unique time in history, where you had a president serve four years with all his policies, and then he was replaced by another president who had completely different policies. . . . And then the two ran against each other,\" Hudson said. \"So the American people sort of had a referendum on which president they wanted, which policies they chose, and they overwhelmingly selected Donald Trump.\" NONCITIZEN VOTER CRACKDOWN LED BY HOUSE GOP AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS Trump is in his second term, and Hudson argued that the 2024 presidential race was a referendum between two clear White House records. \"He has a mandate that I think is unique in history. And so this isn't a first-term president going into his first midterm. I mean, this is someone the American people know, and they've chosen,\" Hudson said. Hudson also pointed out that Democrats will be defending 13 lawmakers whose districts Trump won, while Republicans only had to hold onto three seats that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. \"The battlefield out there for us going into 2026 favors Republicans,\" Hudson said.

Hudson was one of the senior Republicans who gave a presentation to fellow lawmakers during the event, where his message was: \"We’re on offense this cycle.\" \"We're going to lean in. We have a lot of opportunity in those Donald Trump seats,\" Hudson said he told colleagues. \"We're going to hold Democrats accountable for their voting against the policies the American people want.\"","summary":"NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson credited President Donald Trump for Republicans&apos; electoral success and predicted it will continue.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-elections-chair-reveals-which-voter-blocs-republicans-targeting-ahead-2026","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/01/931/523/hudson-interview.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 09:00:52","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":286248188,"title":"CBS to provide unedited version of Harris ‘word salad’ interview","text":"CBS News has agreed to provide the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with the unedited version of its controversial interview with former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The interview is at the center of US President Donald Trump’s $10 billion lawsuit alleging that the network deceptively edited the interview to benefit Harris in the run-up to the 2024 election.\n\nThe scandal erupted in October when CBS aired two versions of the interview with Harris. A preview version that aired on ‘Face the Nation’ included a question about the Middle East conflict, to which Harris gave a long and convoluted answer. The other full-length version shown on ‘60 Minutes’ featured a much clearer and more concise answer.\n\nJust days ahead of the election, Trump lodged a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS, calling the interview “word salad” and accusing the network of “deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news.” The action also claims that CBS tried “to tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party.”\n\nOn Wednesday, as part of the legal proceedings, the FCC, under Trump appointee Brendan Carr, sent a letter to CBS requesting the “full, unedited transcript and camera feeds” of the Harris interview.\n\nOn Friday, CBS agreed to hand over the data, stating, “We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do.”\n\nThe network has admitted that it edited the Harris interview, but dismissed claims that it attempted to doctor it. “Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point,” CBS said.\n\nHowever, the New York Times reported on Thursday, citing sources, that CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, is discussing a potential lawsuit settlement with Trump’s legal team. Some executives reportedly believe that the deal could improve the chances of obtaining regulatory approval for Paramount’s planned merger with Skydance Media, which falls under the FCC’s purview.\n\nThe potential deal has reportedly caused concern among CBS reporters, with one unnamed correspondent telling CNN that “Trump’s lawsuit was a joke, but if we settle, we become the laughingstock.”","summary":"CBS has agreed to provide the unedited Kamala Harris interview to the FCC in response to US President Donald Trump’s lawsuit \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/612050-cbs-unedited-version-harris-interview/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/679f299985f540244c79f5e9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 08:49:28","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":286198350,"title":"Heartwarming Reunion as American Hostage Held in Gaza for 15 Months Finally Returns Home to His Family","text":"American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel has been freed as part of the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. \n\nLooking frail but determined, Siegel, 65, was handed over to Red Cross officials in Gaza City on Saturday morning, marking a significant milestone in the truce negotiations.\n\nIsraelis in Tel Aviv cheered and shed tears as Siegel was handed to the Red Cross.\n\nHis release follows that of Yarden Bibas and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon in similar scenes in the town of Khan Younis earlier and comes amid growing international pressure to secure the freedom of remaining hostages and solidify a lasting peace agreement.\n\nSiegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. \n\nHis wife, Aviva, was released during a brief ceasefire in 2023, but his prolonged captivity left his family and supporters in agonizing uncertainty. \n\nAs kibbutz members gathered to witness his release, there were both tears of joy and lingering sorrow for those still held captive.\n\n‘You can see that he’s lost a lot of weight, but he’s walking and talking, and you can still see the Keith we know,’ said Siegel’s niece, Tal Wax. ‘One of the first things he told us is that he’s still vegan.’\n\nFormer U.S. President Joe Biden shared a message of hope following Siegel’s release: ‘I join Americans, Israelis, and people around the world in welcoming home Keith Siegel, an American held hostage by Hamas for 484 days, as part of the ceasefire deal my team and I negotiated. I look forward to the remaining hostages, including additional Americans, being reunited with their families soon \n\n‘I can only imagine the relief and joy that Keith’s family must be feeling today. For more than a year, my team and I met with his family, including his wife Aviva who was once a hostage herself,’ Biden said. \n\n‘I was continuously inspired by their strength and resilience as they did everything in their power to ensure he was not forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with them and with all the families of the hostages today, all of whom have suffered so much.’\n\nBiden’s former Vice-President Kamala Harris also shared her happiness at hearing the news.\n\n‘Doug and I are full of joy and relief to see American Keith Siegel reunited with his family. We join all those around the world who are celebrating his release and the release of other hostages in recent days and weeks,’ Harris wrote in statement. \n\n‘We continue to pray for the Americans and all of the remaining hostages held in captivity in Gaza by Hamas. We stand with them and their families. All the hostages must be brought home.’\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, which has facilitated multiple exchanges of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, is now entering a critical second phase. \n\nThere were sighs of relief and cheers in a living room where members of the kibbutz watched Siegel’s release. Many of those in the room were family friends, who applauded upon seeing his face, while some teared up.\n\nSiegel is one of the highest-profile hostages, now a household name in Israel after his wife Aviva Siegel, also captured in the Hamas attack, mounted a public campaign to bring him home after her own release from captivity in November 2023. \n\nSpeaking after his release, his wife Aviva said: ‘The great day has arrived. Yes. I am happy. I am happy. there is no one happier than me. I am ready with everything and I’m going to meet him!’\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House next week to discuss the future of the truce and the fate of remaining captives. \n\nWhile progress has been made, the fragile peace remains at risk, with the possibility of renewed conflict if further negotiations fail.\n\nOn the Palestinian side, more than two dozen prisoners were released from Ofer Military Prison and transported to the West Bank, where they were met with jubilant celebrations. \n\nMany former detainees appeared visibly weakened, their families tearfully welcoming them home.\n\n‘Certainly, it’s an indescribable feeling, both sad and joyful, as we leave behind so many still in captivity,’ said Mohammad Kaskus, a recently released prisoner.\n\nMeanwhile, international mediators, including officials from Qatar and Egypt, are working to extend the ceasefire beyond its initial timeline. \n\nThe reopening of the Rafah border crossing has allowed crucial humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, offering a brief respite for war-weary civilians.\n\n On Saturday, 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children were evacuated for urgent medical treatment, underscoring the dire humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nThe ceasefire’s six-week first phase has seen the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. \n\nHowever, challenges remain, as Israel insists on dismantling Hamas while the militant group refuses to free the remaining hostages without a complete cessation of hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nIsrael says it is committed to destroying Hamas. The terror group says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nAbout 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the attack that sparked the war.\n\nMore than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground offensive, over half women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants.\n\nThe Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.\n\nIt blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods using its population as human shields.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAmerican-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel has been freed as part of the ongoing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Heartwarming Reunion as American Hostage Held in Gaza for 15 Months Finally Returns Home to His Family first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/heartwarming-reunion-as-american-hostage-held-in-gaza-for-15-months-finally-returns-home-to-his-family/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/02/03/94766515-14351241-image-m-16_1738466960170.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 05:15:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":286192406,"title":"After 2024 presidential defeat, US Democrats anoint new leader, Ken Martin, to take on Trump","text":"After 2024 presidential defeat, US Democrats anoint new leader, Ken Martin, to take on Trump\n\nUS Democrats picked Ken Martin as their new leader on Saturday, who now takes on the task of rebuilding a party still reeling from last year’s crushing presidential defeat — and figuring out how best to oppose Republican Donald Trump.\n\n“The Democratic Party is the party of working people, and it’s time to roll up our sleeves and outcompete everywhere, in every election, and at every level of government,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe 51-year-old progressive activist, a relative unknown outside of the party, stressed the need to reconnect Democrats with blue collar voters, and to take the electoral fight to all 50 states — even bastions of conservative politics.\n\n“Today’s elections mark a new chapter in DNC leadership, and Donald Trump and his billionaire allies are put on notice — we will hold them accountable for ripping off working families, and we will beat them at the ballot box,” Martin said.\n\nParty grandees are meeting in a large hotel near Washington, where members of the Democratic National Committee, the party’s governing body, are carrying out a postmortem of their November loss.\n\nThey have elevated Martin, formerly the chair of the party’s Minnesota branch, to devise their national battle plan.\n\n“This is not a game of chess where everyone is moving their pieces back and forth in a respectful, timed manner. This is guerilla warfare in political form,” said Katherine Jeanes, deputy digital director of the North Carolina Democratic Party, ahead of the vote.\n\nMaryland Governor Wes Moore, a rising Democratic star, warned ahead of the vote that the party must “not to go into hiding until the next general election.”\n\nThe moment calls for boldness, added Shasti Conrad, chair of the party’s Washington state branch, warning that many Americans have lost the faith.\n\n“They don’t trust us to be able to make things better. They don’t trust that when we are given power, that we know how to use it,” Conrad said.\n\nAnd the fight starts now, she added — there can be no waiting until the next presidential election, set for 2028.\n\n‘Hemorrhaging’ young male voters –\n\nDemocratic candidate and former Vice President Kamala Harris defeated Trump in Martin’s Minnesota — but lost the majority of traditionally conservative states in the center of the country.\n\nFacing a Republican majority in Congress and a second term for Trump, who has roared back into the White House with all the provocative rhetoric of his first administration, Democrats say they must pick their battles.\n\n“We have to be able to decipher crazy rhetoric versus policy violence,” said Conrad, and not be like a “dog chasing the car.”\n\nAll the more so in a sharply polarized political landscape.\n\n“This Republican Party doesn’t care. It doesn’t care about the norms, doesn’t care about institutions,” Conrad said.\n\nWhile many are “exhausted” after the last election campaign, Jeanes said the party must learn to respond to the frantic pace of shock moves from the Trump administration.\n\nMuch of Democratic success going forward will be in how the party presents itself to an American public weary of politics.\n\nThat includes going into new spheres, often far from the traditional media — which will mean being “in places that have sometimes been uncomfortable” for Democrats, according to Conrad.\n\nLast year, Jeanes said, Democrats “didn’t realize until it was too late that we were in an echo chamber of our own making.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party was “hemorrhaging” young male voters who were being “fed part and parcel through the alt-right pipeline” to the Republican Party, according to Jeanes.\n\nAfter his victory in November, Trump credited a series of interviews on largely right-wing podcasts, including the popular “Joe Rogan Experience,” for aiding his return to the White House.\n\n“We need to be getting on sports podcasts and video games and trying to make sure that we’re reaching into apolitical spaces,” Jeanes said.","summary":"After 2024 presidential defeat, US Democrats anoint new leader, Ken Martin, to take on Trump US Democrats picked Ken Martin as their new leader on Saturday, who now takes on the task of rebuilding a party still reeling from last year’s crushing presidential defeat — and figuring out how best to oppose Republican Donald Trump.

Everything else is detail. \n\nThey were often out of touch with the nation and reality. \n\nOn many big stories, from the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax to the origins of COVID-19 and Joe Biden’s health and family corruption, they spread state propaganda and misinformation. \n\nBecause they were standard-issue Democrats in disguise, their fall from grace is something to cheer as Trump begins his second term. \n\nYet the vast majority of TV news continues to tilt so far left that three evictions must be just the first step if there is to be meaningful change. \n\nThe next step should include the networks imposing something of an informal fairness doctrine on their news programs. \n\nLet viewers draw their own conclusions instead of being force-fed progressive mush. \n\nAdvocates and partisans should be limited to separate segments or programs and clearly identified as such. \n\nChanging tides \n\nShort of that, it’s still possible the departures of O’Donnell, Acosta and Todd, along with related events at the major networks, are signs that more fairness is coming to a television screen near you. \n\nTo be clear, I’m under no illusion that we are entering a new golden age of TV news. \n\nWalter Cronkite is not coming back, and Trump Derangement Syndrome is contagious and deeply ingrained atin nearly all the legacy media outlets. \n\nYet a few rays of sunshine are emerging mostly because network bosses know they are paying a price for allowing their newsrooms to be dominated by radicals whose politics and values are estranged from those of most Americans. \n\nJust as in 2016, Trump’s second victory proved that the media still doesn’t understand the national mood and his appeal. \n\nAlthough he ran primarily on fixing border security and the economy, he also pledged to free government, academia and other sectors of contemporary culture from far-left dominance. \n\nThe size of his movement, at home and abroad, means he and his supporters can no longer be dismissed as temporary aberrations. \n\nWoke was the aberration, and it’s now dead. \n\nThat’s clear to network bosses, but there is also another factor that suddenly looms large in their decisions about coverage. \n\nThey and their corporate owners desperately want to avoid confrontations with Trump and his administration because that could be very, very bad for business. \n\nMuch as tech wizards, banks and others business sectors are making their peace with the new sheriff in town, networks are trying to do something similar. \n\nTrump’s leverage \n\nIn some cases, that means settling lawsuits Trump brought against them about their coverage. \n\nABC recently settled a defamation suit Trump filed by admitting error and paying $16 million to him for his legal fees and a presidential library. \n\nThe settlement came after the election and just days before depositions in a case sparked by rabid Democrat anchor George Stephanopoulos. \n\nHe had falsely claimed repeatedly that Trump was found liable for rape in a New York civil case. \n\nAlthough defamation is difficult to prove by any public figure, let alone the most famous person in the world, ABC’s parent, Disney, did not want to tangle with the new president and his regulatory agencies. \n\nIt demanded the network make a deal even as Stephanopoulos objected. \n\nCBS also has business reasons to tone down the anti-Trump fervor infecting its top programs. Network bosses fully supported O’Donnell’s snide, scolding tones of all things Republican — until she was moved out of the anchor chair days after Trump took office. \n\nEven her final show dripped with partisanship as Oprah Winfrey, a top supporter of Kamala Harris, led a cringe-inducing tribute to her. \n\nO’Donnell’s ratings have long been in the toilet, but her partisan tilt was the final straw after Trump’s victory. \n\nThe network’s corporate owner, Paramount Global, needs Federal Communications Commission approval for a planned merger with Skydance Media. \n\nConcerns about the merger almost certainly explain why CBS suddenly entered into settlement talks with Trump about a lawsuit he filed against “60 Minutes” over how it handled a campaign interview with Harris. \n\nPreviously the network insisted it did nothing wrong, even though it showed Harris giving one answer in a promo and a different answer to the same question on the program. \n\nDespite calls to explain the discrepancy, network officials stonewalled by refusing to release full video footage and transcript, which is why Trump sued even though success was a longshot. \n\nYet here we are, with Trump in the White House, settlement talks underway and his new head of the FCC demanding the same transcript and footage of the Harris interview. \n\nThis time the network complied after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr reportedly told Paramount that evidence of political bias would factor into the decision about whether to approve the merger, which would involve transferring broadcast licenses. \n\nFairing better \n\nCorporate ownership is also a big issue at NBC, which showed Todd the exit. \n\nParent company Comcast wants to sell its cable assets, including MSNBC, which will require regulatory approval by the administration. \n\nMSNBC’s anti-Trumpism is so disturbingly hateful that it often sounds like a fever swamp from another planet. \n\nComcast hasn’t made any effort to bring it back to Earth, but given that its audience has declined sharply and the regulation thicket ahead, that seems inevitable. \n\nThe business issues at CNN are different in that it faces a financial squeeze as it continues a long slide into oblivion. \n\nIts decline contrasts starkly with Trump’s standing, as he is enjoying the highest public approval marks of his career. \n\nAs a result, the nonstop barrage against him from Acosta and others is proving to be a dead end with viewers, most of whom, even those who didn’t vote for Trump, desperately want to see America succeed at a time of national and international turmoil. \n\nAcross the TV news business, it would be ideal if the bosses suddenly saw the light about America’s need for honest, nonpartisan journalism and made changes in their approach. \n\nBut we can at least be hopeful that the networks will move closer to where they should be, even if it’s only because they fear Trump and want to protect the bottom line.","summary":"Chuck Todd, Jim Acosta, and Norah O'Donnell are now without anchoring jobs each leaving their respective networks after criticizing President Donald Trump before he was sworn in for his second term last month.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/01/opinion/michael-goodwin-why-big-leftist-tv-anchors-biting-the-dust-is-a-gain-for-america/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/newspress-collage-ok5wwknk8-1738457764082.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1738440375&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 01:18:41","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.048}]}
