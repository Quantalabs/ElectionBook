He responded with a sincere defense of her. “Laura has been a supporter of mine. Just like a lot of people are supporters, and she’s been a supporter of mine,” shared Trump in comments to the press. “She speaks very positively of the campaign. I’m not sure why you asked that question.” However, the former president also noted that he wasn’t in control of her. “I don’t control Laura. Laura — she’s a, she’s a free spirit. Well, I don’t know. I mean, look, I can’t tell Laura what to do,” he added. Loomer, whose feed on X, formerly known as Twitter, is full of pro-Trump tweets, returned that favor on September 15 by supporting Trump’s takedown of Taylor Swift, who recently endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Taking to Truth Social, Trump wrote, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” in all caps, proving that he’s been triggered by her latest snub (Trump seemed desperate to keep Swifties on his side before). On X, Loomer reposted a screenshot of Trump’s tweet, alerting of followers of his dig. “President Trump just posted, ‘I hate Taylor Swift,'” she wrote, garnering thousands of likes.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; Mario Tama/Getty Images Laura Loomer, a far-right activist known for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Increasingly Strange Connection Between Donald Trump and Laura Loomer first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/the-increasingly-strange-connection-between-donald-trump-and-laura-loomer/","image":"https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/donald-trumps-relationship-with-laura-loomer-just-keeps-getting-weirder/intro-1726431437.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 00:13:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.068},{"id":256484030,"title":"Reckless rhetoric from Dems and media to blame for second Trump assassination attempt","text":"Donald Trump was targeted Sunday in a second apparent assassination attempt in as many months. An eagle-eyed Secret Service agent reportedly spotted the barrel of a gun in bushes a few hundred yards from where the former president was playing golf and shot at the would-be assassin, who was later arrested. It’s a frightening development that highlights the recklessness of the hateful rhetoric constantly aimed at Trump by his political opponents, even after he was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania in July. Last week Kamala Harris falsely accused Trump of calling Nazis “fine people”, promising a “bloodbath,” and being responsible for “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.” She and Biden and surrogates constantly exaggerate the J6 Capitol riot and use it to frame Trump as a “threat to democracy.” Joe Biden has labeled Trump and “MAGA Republicans” as “semi-fascists” and domestic terrorists. Tim Walz called Trump a “fascist” and “threat to Democracy” who will “put people’s lives in danger.” On Saturday Democratic Senator Chris Murphy described Trump as “a candidate explicitly running on the promise of political violence.” In Orwellian fashion they accuse Trump and his supporters of stoking violence, when the evidence is almost all the other way. Conveniently, whenever Democrats are feeling the heat on a damaging issue, there are always bomb threats or phony-looking racist leaflets to distract the media and get maximum publicity. In Springfield, Ohio, where Trump’s “They’re eating the pets” riff and a thousand memes focused attention on the plight of locals overwhelmed by a sudden 30 percent increase in their population due to thousands of Haitian migrants ushered in by “Border Tsar” Harris and Biden. Having ignored the border crisis for three years, the media is now demonizing long-suffering Springfield citizens and portraying anyone who highlights their plight as a violent bigot. CNN host Dana Bash even accused Trump’s running mate JD Vance on Sunday of “causing the hospitals, the schools, the government buildings to be evacuated because of bomb threats” in Springfield. What will it take for these demented partisans to lower the temperature?","summary":"The assassination plot on Donald Trump is a frightening development that highlights the recklessness of the hateful rhetoric constantly aimed at Trump by his political opponents, even after he was shot in July.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/opinion/reckless-rhetoric-from-dems-and-media-to-blame-for-second-trump-assassination-attempt/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-atllu5dja-1726444178375.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726429862&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/yVC96c51-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-16 00:08:58","author":"Miranda Devine","authors":["Miranda Devine"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":256483774,"title":"Trump safe after &quot;attempted assassination&quot; on Florida golf course","text":"Former U.S. President Donald Trump is safe after an apparent assassination attempt in Florida on Sunday, reports said, with the incident coming two months after the Republican presidential nominee was lightly injured in a shooting at a campaign rally.

The Secret Service said agents opened fire on a person who was on the perimeter of the premises before 2 p.m. The Associated Press said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation believes Trump was the subject of another \"attempted assassination\" and that the agents fired at a man who was pointing a rifle with a scope as Trump was on the course.

Trump said in a message to his supporters, \"I am safe and well, and no one was hurt.\" Local investigators in Florida said the suspect was some 370 to 460 meters from Trump when agents fired. The White House said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival in the presidential election, are relieved to hear Trump is safe.

Routh, 58 is in custody after the terrifying incident at Trump International Club almost exactly two months after a separate assassination attempt against Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The suspect was found unarmed, as a backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 style rifle that a gunman left behind when fleeing the scene have already been located. Martin County Sherriff William D. Snyder said Routh ‘was not displaying a lot of emotions’ when police arrested him. Snyder added that the suspected shooter was ‘relatively calm’ and ‘never asked’ why he was being detained. The car Routh was found in will be taken into FBI custody for further investigation, according to authorities. ‘I have a clear understanding from investigators that we actually do have the suspect that they’re looking for in Palm Beach County,’ Snyder said. Officials said U.S. Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of the bushes two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing on Sunday, prompting the agents to fire at the suspect. The individual ran into his vehicle from the trees, but was spotted by a witness who snapped a picture of his vehicle – a black Nissan – which included the license plate. Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters at a press conference hours after the incident that the witness was able to share the plate and later identify the suspect as the person he saw fleeing the scene. Trump confirmed in a statement about an hour after the shots were reported that he is ‘safe and well’ and didn’t want rumors to ‘start spiraling out of control.’ The suspect was able to get within 400-500 yards of Trump. The 2024 Republican nominee’s bulked up Secret Service advance team, however, spotted the shooter in the tree lines just two holes from where Trump was golfing. Special Agent Rafael Barros explained at the press conference on Sunday that Secret Service moves with Trump and is usually surveying one or two holes ahead of him when he goes for a round of golf. Asked if the security has changed around Trump since the first attempt on his life earlier this summer, Barros said: ‘Yes, the threat was high.’ ‘We have increased the amount of assets that we’ve supported,’ he continued. ‘We are living in dangerous times.’ Real estate investor and New York City landlord Steve Witkoff was Trump’s golfing buddy on Sunday, sources told DailyMail.com. The FBI released a statement two hours after the incident claiming the attack ‘appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.’ The armed suspect was posted up outside the club around the 5th and 6th hole, which is confirmed to be a more ‘vulnerable’ area of the course because it is closest to the road. Sheriff Bradshaw detailed that the suspected assassin was wielding an ‘AK-47 style weapon with a scope’, which was recovered at the scene. So was a backpack and GoPro camera, which Sheriff Bradshaw revealed in images of where the suspect was set-up in the bushes along the fencing of Trump’s golf club. The area where the suspect was first spotted by his security detail was two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing at the time of gunshots, causing the individual to flee. Undergrowth is cut back in this area every summer and is one of the parts of the course closest to the road. The incident comes as Trump’s security detail has been ramped up in the two months after the former president was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) is on the House Task Force on the assassination attempt and said Sunday that the latest proves the attack in Butler was not an ‘isolated incident.’ ‘As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,’ Waltz wrote on X. He added: ‘As a member of the Assassination Task Force, I expect the Secret Service to brief us this week.’ Trump’s golf club is just five miles from his residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach and is where the former president is often spotted golfing when he is not on the campaign trail. The Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department held a press conference Sunday afternoon to provide updates on the shooting and revealed images of the suspect’s backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 rifle left at the scene. ‘Nothing will slow me down,’ Trump wrote in a statement. ‘I will NEVER SURRENDER!’ President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are aware of the shooting and ‘relieved’ he is not harmed. ‘The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,’ according to the White House. ‘They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.’ Harris, who just met Trump for the first time in person at their debate on Tuesday, responded to the shooting with a statement sharing the platitude: ‘Violence has no place in America.’ ‘I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,’ she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. United States Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X: ‘The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m.’ ‘The former president is safe,’ he assured, adding that the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office will follow up with more details about the incident. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke with Trump moments after news broke. ‘He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known,’ the senator wrote on X. ‘He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.’ It is still unclear how many people were involved in Sunday’s shooting and whether they were targeting the former president. It is also still not known if the suspect ever fired his gun or if the gunshots came from the agents who took aim at the alleged threat. But just the report of shots near Trump raises eyebrows as multiple investigations are ongoing into the shooting in Pennsylvania earlier this summer that left two dead, including the shooter, and two critically injured. Trump walked away from the assassination attempt with just a bloody ear that could have been a fatal shot had it been a few millimeters different and struck his head. But would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service before he was able to get in another shot at the former president. Initial canvassing led to authorities discovering his car near the rally site in Butler with explosives and his parent’s home with even more bombs. Congressional and other local and federal investigations are ongoing to discover what led to the failures that allowed a shooter to get just a few hundred feet away from Trump with an AR-15 rifle.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRyan Wesley Routh, the man named as the suspect in a possible&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Suspect Arrested for Attempted Assassination at Trump Golf Course in Florida Identified as Ryan Wesley Routh first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/suspect-arrested-for-attempted-assassination-at-trump-golf-course-in-florida-identified-as-ryan-wesley-routh/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1726444328_rewrite-this-title-Trump-golf-course-shooter-named-as-Ryan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:53:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":256484164,"title":"Florida Man Arrested for Attempted Assassination at Trump Golf Course","text":"Ryan Wesley Routh, the man named as the suspect in a possible assassination attempt near Donald Trump’s Florida golf club, was calm and emotionless when he was arrested Sunday.

The former President was safe after the incident at his golf course in Florida, and a suspect is in custody. This is what we know. How it unfolded The incident played out at about 1:30pm Sunday, local time. Trump was playing golf at his course in Florida's West Palm Beach when a US Secret Service agent spotted a man with a firearm hiding in the shrubbery surrounding the property, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. The agents had been clearing the holes ahead of Trump when they saw a rifle barrel poking through the bushes. The gunman was about one or two holes away — approximately 400 metres — from where Trump was playing. Police have said that was \"not a long distance\" for an AK-47-style rifle fitted with a scope, which was retrieved from the scene. When the agents saw the muzzle of the rifle, one of them opened fire at the gunman. He fired at least four rounds, but the man managed to escape, fleeing the scene in a black Nissan car. He left behind the rifle, a GoPro, and two backpacks at the scene. Investigators have not confirmed whether the gunman was able to shoot before fleeing. Suspect seen fleeing the scene A witness saw the suspect drive off and was able to take a photo of the car and share it with law enforcement officials. The suspect was later stopped driving northbound on Interstate 95 after crossing into Martin County, about a 72-kilometre drive north of Trump's golf course. He did not identify the suspect or give details on a possible motive. The Martin County Sheriff's Office said the man taken into custody was \"relatively calm\" when detained. The FBI said it was investigating \"what appears to be an attempted assassination\". Trump was returned safely after the incident to his private Mar-a-Lago club, where he resides in neighbouring Palm Beach, according to a person familiar with the matter. In an email to supporters, Trump said: \"There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\" \"Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!\" The White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris had been briefed about the incident and were relieved to know that he was safe. \"Violence has no place in America,\" Ms Harris said in an X social media post. What security measures were in place? Trump's campaign confirmed he was safe after the incident but gave no further details. The former president was injured in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on July 13, raising questions about protection for candidates just months ahead of the November US presidential election. His right ear was grazed and one rally-goer was killed in the gunfire. The gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper. The shooting in July forced Kimberly Cheatle to resign as Secret Service director under bipartisan congressional pressure. The Secret Service's new acting director said in August that he was \"ashamed\" by the security lapse that led to the assassination attempt. Trump's team have stepped up security since the assassination attempt in July. When he is at Trump Tower in New York, parked garbage trucks form a wall outside the building. At outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind an enclosure of bulletproof glass. The Florida golf course was partially shut down for Trump's game, but there are several areas around the perimeter of the property where golfers are visible from the fence line. Secret Service agents and officers in golf carts and on all-terrain vehicles generally secure the area several holes ahead of and behind Trump when he plays. Agents also usually bring an armoured vehicle onto the course to quickly shelter Trump should a threat arise. Police have defended the security presence at the course. \"He's not the sitting president, if he was, we'd have the entire golf course surrounded. Because he's not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.\" The spokesperson added more officers might be deployed the next time Trump was at the golf course, but said the Secret Service did \"exactly what they should have done\".

We are thankful that the former President was not harmed, but remain deeply concerned about political violence and condemn it in all of its forms.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said he spent some time with Trump following the scary ordeal. “No leader in American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient. He is unstoppable,” Johnson wrote on X. The suspect, identified by sources as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, fled the golf course after the Secret Service agent opened fire. He was arrested inn his car on I-95 a short time later. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw later told reporters that because Trump is not the sitting president, the level of security he received was “limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.” Bradshaw noted that if Trump were in office, “we would have had this entire golf course surrounded.” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise blasted that revelation. “Thank God President Trump is safe. I can’t believe I’m having to say this once again this election cycle: there is absolutely no place for violence in politics. Grateful for all law enforcement involved who stopped what could’ve been a catastrophe,” Scalise (R-La.) posted on X. “Authorities just acknowledged if President Trump was president, they’d do more to protect him. This must change. There have been TWO attempts on Trump’s life. Secret Service must up their level of protection of him to their FULL capabilities—including expanding the perimeter.” House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) lauded the law enforcement that kept Trump safe but questioned how the suspect was able to get so close. “I am grateful to hear that President Trump is safe following today’s reported assassination attempt in Florida. I join in thanks for our hardworking law enforcement officers working to keep President Trump, his family, and his team safe,” she said in a statement. “However, we must ask ourselves how an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again? There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida.” Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) echoed Scalise. “I’m relieved President Trump and his family are safe, but concerned this is the second attempt on his life in the last few months,” Graves said. “There’s no place for this kind of violence in America. There’s no excuse for President Trump to have anything less than a FULL security detail now.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) chimed in, “Now, it is imperative that we move Secret Service out from under the Department of Homeland Security and back to the Treasury Department, where they had more focus. Also, it is time to increase resources.” Leading Democrats, meanwhile, also weighed in. “Political violence has no place in a democratic society,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) wrote on X. Trump’s November rival, Vice President Kamala Harris was among the first to react to the security incident. “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America,” Harris wrote on X. “Gwen and I are glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe. Violence has no place in our country. It’s not who we are as a nation,” her running mate Tim Walz (D) later stressed. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) added, “I was just briefed by the Acting Director of the Secret Service. I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump’s safety. There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service, FBI and Beach County Sheriff’s Office are investigating the situation. The assassination attempt on Trump on July 13 also remains under investigation. The shooter in the attack was killed by the Secret Service. Trump confirmed he was fine following the terrifying ordeal. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down,” Trump said in a statement. “I will NEVER SURRENDER! I will always love you for supporting me.”","summary":"\"We are thankful that the former President was not harmed, but remain deeply concerned about political violence and condemn it in all of its forms,\" said a bipartisan task force.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/gop-dems-react-to-would-be-trump-assassination-grateful-but-concerned/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-6bndpxp1h-1726440049890.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726425675&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:50:44","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":256483740,"title":"Another assassination attempt on Trump jolts topsy-turvy presidential campaign","text":"So far, the political impact is unclear, in contrast with the first attempt, which sparked an outpouring of reactions from lawmakers around the world and the business community while prompting some top observers to predict a Trump victory in November. “My ‘controversial’ take on the gunshots near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach today: We need to wait for the facts to be determined before reacting,” GOP polling expert Frank Luntz posted on X. The latest incident happened while Trump was playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach, Fla., with Steve Witkoff, a friend and top donor. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters that a Secret Service agent who was performing a security sweep a few holes ahead spotted a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence and opened fire on the suspect. Trump was about 300-500 yards from the incident. A witness saw a man flee the scene and took a picture of his car, which Bradshaw described as a black Nissan. With that information, authorities tracked down the vehicle on Interstate 95, where the Martin County Sheriff’s Office arrested him. Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder told reporters that the suspect was “relatively calm” when detained. “He was not displaying a lot of emotions. Never asked, ‘What is this about?’” Bradshaw said the witness was taken to Martin County and identified the suspect, who was later revealed to be Ryan Wesley Routh. An AK-47-style rifle, a backpack, and a Go-Pro camera were found at a fence outside Trump’s golf club. The Secret Service said Trump is safe, and the FBI announced it is investigating the incident as an assassination attempt. Trump’s Secret Service protection Because Trump is not a sitting president, Bradshaw said his security was more limited, though he suggested it would be ramped up further. After the shooting in Pennsylvania, it was beefed up. “If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible,” he explained at the press briefing. “So, I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there’ll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter. But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done.” Meanwhile, there are less than two months before Election Day, and polls remain tight. That’s despite a topsy-turvy race. A week after the first assassination attempt on Trump, President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who quickly secured the Democratic Party’s support, picked running mate Tim Walz, and raised more than $500 million. Last week, the first and only debate between Trump and Harris took place, with Harris widely regarded as the winner. Markets and the campaign Financial markets have been volatile as they followed all the wild swings in the campaign. After Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump in June, the “Trump trade” saw the dollar and crypto rally while U.S. bonds fell. The first assassination attempt and Trump’s defiant reaction to it fueled that trade further. In fact, hours after the shooting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced his support for Trump. The tech billionaire has since helped start a pro-Trump super PAC and even interviewed him on his X social media platform. But Harris’s elevation to the top of the ticket sparked a wave of enthusiasm among Democrats who pulled even with Trump in the polls, unwinding the Trump trade. On Sunday evening, U.S. stock futures were little changed. The S&P 500 was flat, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq pointed 0.1% lower. Bitcoin fell 1.2% to $59,135, and Brent crude futures rose 0.2% to $71.78 a barrel. Markets were already bracing for a critical week, as the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday with Wall Street widely expecting Chairman Jerome Powell to announce a rate cut amid signs of slowing inflation and a cooling labor market.","summary":"A second assassination attempt Sunday on the former president further jolted a campaign that has already seen unprecedented twists and turns.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/15/trump-assassination-attempt-presidential-campaign-fbi-secret-service-financial-markets/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171581562-e1726436019529.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:42:25","author":"Jason Ma","authors":["Jason Ma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":256483452,"title":"Why hasn’t the Secret Service given Trump the security he PLAINLY merits?","text":"How many assassination attempts will it take for the Secret Service to provide adequate security for Donald Trump?

Sir Edward Davey, party leader, invited the cameras to snap him playing beach volleyball. The ball boinged off his bald head and Sir Ed fell to the sand like Norman Wisdom in an Ealing comedy. His deputy Daisy Cooper – teeth like a Colgate racehorse – held a rival photo opportunity. She was playing crazy golf. They are not the first senior Liberals of recent history to have been drawn to balls. Quick-change artiste Sir Edward can switch costume as fast as he alters low-fat socialist policy positions. He wriggled out of a business suit into some beach gear; later he leapt into a green jumper and brown trousers for questions in the conference hall. As he took to the stage, we were given the theme tune to TV's Ski Sunday.The questions were put by former BBC radio journalist Carolyn Quinn who was presumably hired – now that she can put aside that celebrated BBC impartiality – as a tame presence. Actually, she did not give him an entirely easy time. She was sceptical about Lib Dem budget sums and pointed out that Sir Ed was in the coalition government during Andrew Lansley's hapless reorganisation of the NHS. When Sir Ed tried to support both Nimbyism and greater house building, Quinn said, 'You can't have it both ways, can you?' Having it both ways has always been a Lib speciality. Look at old Thorpe. Sir Edward was on tremendously self-congratulatory form, hugging himself as he stood by the lectern and talking about 'that stunning general election win' (er, they came third, or arguably fourth). He mentioned the US presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate by their first names only, as if they were close friends. Quinn noted that the Reform party won 14 per cent of the national vote but returned five MPs, whereas the Lib Dems scored 12 per cent and bagged 72 MPs. 'Where's the fairness in that?' Sir Edward did some coughing and insisted he was not interested in working with Nigel Farage to campaign for electoral reform. At the mention of Mr Farage, as with Donald Trump, the hall warbled a few boos and hisses. Why were they so down on Farage? If he hadn't split the Right-wing vote, the Lib Dems would have had a miserable result. The activists' age profile has dropped a little. There are quite a few 40-somethings in trimmed, pomaded beards. During a debate on the economy, the moderator, a mild-mannered, Viyella shirt type called Jeremy, referred to part of the hall as 'the beards sector'. Several of these beardies were wearing tight chinos and blindingly white gym shoes. An unexpected development: activists have become hot for defence. 'I'm not calling for war,' mewed a yellow T-shirt from Chichester, but it did sound as if he was calling precisely for that. The biggest hear, hear came for returning to the EU's single market –Quinn forced a show of hands on this and it won about half the arms in the hall – but there was also a distinct appetite for Kremlin-bashing. The excitement was too much for one poor Herbert who went down with a nosebleed. First aid medics waddled to the scene. The economic policy working group discussion featured floor contributions, several with nasal, trainspotterish voices. The Lib Dems have always had their share of windy obsessives. One man, during a not under-long contribution, used the expression 'very interestingly'. Another suggested empty seats in the Commons to represent people who do not vote. At least three female-looking speakers had jolly deep voices and hands like spades. There were calls for compulsory recycling and more regulation (subject unspecified – just more rules).'Wonderful,' said Viyella Jeremy, hoping to stop one of these interminable bores.It only encouraged the bloke to continue longer. 'Very useful points,' said Jeremy, his eyes as glazed as a dead pollock.","summary":"QUENTIN LETTS: The Lib Dems ' conference opened with the intellectual rigour that has established the party so firmly in the politico-philosophical firmament.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-13853679/QUENTIN-LETTS-Sir-Ed-fell-sand-like-Norman-Wisdom.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/15/23/89706697-0-image-m-125_1726439912431.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:41:22","author":"Editor,Quentin Letts","authors":["Editor","Quentin Letts"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":256483314,"title":"Harris Representative Struggles to Respond to ABC News Question about Kamala’s Debate Statement on US Military","text":"Five days on from the presidential debate between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, it continues to take up oxygen in the room–and not in a good way for the vice president.

(Stephanie Matat/The Associated Press) WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Donald Trump was the target Sunday of ''what appears to be an attempted assassination'' at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, the FBI said, just nine weeks after the Republican presidential nominee survived another attempt on his life. The former president said he was safe and well, and authorities held a man in custody. U.S. Secret Service agents posted a few holes up from where Trump was playing noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away. An agent fired and the gunman dropped the rifle and fled in an SUV, leaving the firearm behind along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming and a GoPro camera, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said. The man was later taken into custody in a neighboring county. It was the latest jarring moment in a campaign year marked by unprecedented upheaval. On July 13, Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and a bullet grazed his ear. Eight days later, Democratic President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, giving way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the party's nominee. And it was sure to add to the questions about Secret Service protective operations after the agency's admitted failures in preventing the attempted assassination of Trump this summer. In an email to supporters, Trump said: ''There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!'' He wrote: ''Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!'' He returned to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach where he lives, according to a person familiar with Trump's movements who was not authorized to discuss them publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear whether the incident would affect his campaign schedule. He was set to speak from Florida about cryptocurrency live on Monday night on the social media site X for the launch of his sons' crypto platform. He planned a town hall Tuesday in Flint, Michigan, with his former press secretary, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, followed by a rally Wednesday on New York's Long Island. An email to Trump campaign staffers obtained by AP said, ''This is not a matter that we take lightly. Your safety is always our top priority. We ask that you remain vigilant in your daily comings and goings.'' ''As we enter the last 50 days of President Trump's campaign, we must remember that we will only be able save America from those who seek to destroy it by working together as one team.'' Biden and Harris were briefed and would be kept updated on the investigation. The White House said they were ''relieved'' to know Trump is safe. Harris, in a statement, also said ''violence has no place in America.'' In the aftermath, Trump checked in with allies, including running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and several Fox News hosts. Fox News host Sean Hannity recounted on air his conversation with Trump and the former president's golf partner, Steve Witkoff. They told Hannity they had been on the fifth hole and about to go up to putt when they heard a ''pop pop, pop pop.'' Within seconds, he said Witkoff recounted, Secret Service agents ''pounced on'' Trump and ''covered him'' to protect him. Trump had returned to Florida this weekend from a West Coast swing that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. His campaign had not advised about any public plans for Trump on Sunday. He often spends the morning playing golf, before having lunch at the club, one of three he owns in the state. He has had a stepped-up security footprint since the assassination attempt in July. When he has been at Trump Tower in New York, parked dump trucks have formed a wall outside the building. At outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind an enclosure of bulletproof glass. The Florida golf course was partially shut down for Trump as he played, but there are several areas around the perimeter of the property where golfers are visible from the fence line. Secret Service agents and officers in golf carts and on ATVs generally secure the area several holes ahead and behind Trump when he plays. Agents also usually bring an armored vehicle onto the course to shelter Trump quickly should a threat arise. The Palm Beach County sheriff said the entire golf course would have been lined with law enforcement if Trump were the president, but because he is not, ''security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.'' ''I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there will probably be a little more people around the perimeter,\" Bradshaw said. ''But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done, they provided exactly what the protection should have been and their agent did a fantastic job.'' Former presidents and their spouses have Secret Service protection for life, but the security around former presidents varies according to threat levels and exposure, with the toughest typically being in the immediate aftermath of their leaving office. Trump's protective detail has been higher than some other former presidents because of his high visibility and his campaign to seek the White House again. The man in custody was Ryan Routh, three law enforcement officials told the AP. The officials who identified the suspect spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. The FBI was leading the investigation and was working to determine any motive. Attorney General Merrick Garland was receiving regular updates. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping investigate. ''The FBI has responded to West Palm Beach Florida and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump,'' the bureau said. News reporters were not with Trump on Sunday. Bucking tradition, Trump's campaign has not arranged to have a protective pool of reporters travel with him, as is standard for major party nominees and for the president. Harris does not have a protective pool at all times, but does allow reporters to travel with her for public events. Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said the suspect was apprehended within minutes of the FBI, Secret Service and Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office putting out a ''very urgent BOLO'' — or ''be on the lookout'' alert detailing the specific vehicle sought, license plate number and description of the occupant. Snyder said his deputies ''immediately flooded'' northbound I-95, deploying to every exit between the Palm Beach County line to the south and St. Lucie County line to the north. ''One of my road patrol units saw the vehicle, matched the tag and we set up on the vehicle,'' Snyder said, ''We pinched in on the car, got it safely stopped and got the driver in custody.'' Snyder told WPTV that the suspect \"was not armed when we took him out of the car.'' The man had a calm, flat demeanor and showed little emotion when he was stopped by police, Snyder said, saying the suspect did not question why he was being pulled over. ''He never asked, ‘what is this about?' Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on. He never questioned it,'' Snyder said. ___ Richer, Long, Tucker and Miller reported from Washington.

A Secret Service agent opened fire on the suspect after spotting a rifle barrel through the perimeter fence of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The suspect fled but is now in custody and has been identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. Trump immediately began fundraising off the latest alleged assassination attempt with an email to supporters, reading, “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER! I will always love you for supporting me.” The investigation remains fluid, according to law enforcement, and details at the moment are sparse. But here’s what we know so far: One agent from Trump’s Secret Service detail was a few holes ahead of where the former president was playing, securing the area, when they spotted a man at the perimeter of the property, armed with a rifle, agency brass said. The suspect allegedly pushed the muzzle of the rifle through the chainlink fence — and Secret Service fired at him. Trump was just 300-500 yards away, between the sixth and seventh holes. “The rifle was pointed out, we engaged,” a Secret Service official said at Sunday’s press conference. It is unknown if the man fired any rounds. He was reportedly not hit by Secret Service gunfire. Police responded to the scene shortly after 1:30 pm local time. An AK-47 assault-style rifle fitted with a scope, two backpacks, and a GoPro camera were recovered near the scene, law enforcement officials said at a press conference following the incident. A witness told officers he saw a person emerge from the bushes nearby and run into a black Nissan, providing cops with a photo of the vehicle and license plate, officials said. An automated license plate reader flagged the vehicle as it drove along I-95, where the suspect was arrested. The golf course had been partially closed while Trump played, for security reasons, officials said. Trump was The suspect, who has been identified by law enforcement sources as Ryan Wesley Routh of Hawaii, was apprehended minutes after fleeing the scene. Armed with the suspect’s general location thanks to the license plate reader, deputies “flooded” I-95 in setting up a dragnet, posting up by each exit, according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. Snyder said Sunday that a patrol unit soon spotted the black Nissan and “we set up on the vehicle.” “We pinched in on the car, got it safely stopped and got the driver in custody,” he said. Snyder told reporters that the suspect was not armed when officers caught up with him, and that he had maintained a “calm, flat affect” throughout. “He was not displaying a lot of emotions,” Snyder said. “Never asked, ‘What is this about?” This is the second time in two months that Trump has been targeted by a potential assassin. A small portion of the corner of Trump’s right ear was bloodied in mid-July as the former president spoke to a rally crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania. Several shots from an AR-15 rang out about 15 minutes after Trump took the stage at a local farm show ground. Trump dropped to the ground before popping back up and pumping his fist to the audience as agents hustled him away. He was quickly discharged from a local hospital and flew to his New Jersey country club. Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman, was shot dead by a police sniper after firing multiple rounds at Trump, killing 50-year-old retired fire chief Corey Comperatore. Investigators later found three loaded magazines with 100 rounds in each, a bulletproof vest, and a remote control for explosive devices later found in Crooks’ car. The Secret Service is responsible for protecting sitting and former presidents; the security bubble around Trump has been reinforced in recent weeks. The FBI has jurisdiction over investigations into presidential assassination attempts. “The threat level is high,” a law enforcement official said at Sunday’s press conference. “We have increased the amount of assets that we are supporting. We live in dangerous times.” In a separate statement, Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic rival for the Oval Office, said, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.”","summary":"An AK-47 assault-style rifle fitted with a scope, two backpacks, and a GoPro camera were recovered near the scene, law enforcement officials said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-golf-club-shooting-west-palm-beach-b2613327.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/15/22/2171581774.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:38:18","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.624},{"id":256483258,"title":"Trump golf course shooter named as Ryan Wesley Routh as suspect is arrested for assassination attempt in Florida","text":"BREAKING NEWSTrump golf course shooter named as Ryan Wesley Routh as suspect is arrested for assassination attempt in Florida READ MORE: Trump assassination attempt live updates By Stephen M.

Special Agent Rafael Barros explained at the press conference on Sunday that Secret Service moves with Trump and is usually surveying one or two holes ahead of him when he goes for a round of golf. Asked if the security has changed around Trump since the first attempt on his life earlier this summer, Barros said: 'Yes, the threat was high.' 'We have increased the amount of assets that we've supported,' he continued. 'We are living in dangerous times.' Real estate investor and New York City landlord Steve Witkoff was Trump's golfing buddy on Sunday, sources told DailyMail.com. The FBI released a statement two hours after the incident claiming the attack 'appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.' The armed suspect was posted up outside the club around the 5th and 6th hole, which is confirmed to be a more 'vulnerable' area of the course because it is closest to the road. Sheriff Bradshaw detailed that the suspected assassin was wielding an 'AK-47 style weapon with a scope', which was recovered at the scene. So was a backpack and GoPro camera, which Sheriff Bradshaw revealed in images of where the suspect was set-up in the bushes along the fencing of Trump's golf club. Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters a member of Donald Trump's Secret Service detail spotted the barrel sticking out from bushes two holes from where the former president was golfing on Sunday Multiple shots were fired near Trump's golf club in West Pam Beach, Florida on Sunday When not campaigning, Trump is often found golfing at his West Palm Beach club. Pictured: Donald Trump flashes a thumbs-up as he golfs at his club in West Palm Beach on May 4, 2023 The area where the suspect was first spotted by his security detail was two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing at the time of gunshots, causing the individual to flee.

The incident comes as Trump's security detail has been ramped up in the two months after the former president was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) is on the House Task Force on the assassination attempt and said Sunday that the latest proves the attack in Butler was not an 'isolated incident.' 'As I've said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,' Waltz wrote on X. He added: 'As a member of the Assassination Task Force, I expect the Secret Service to brief us this week.' Trump's golf club is just five miles from his residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach and is where the former president is often spotted golfing when he is not on the campaign trail. The Palm Beach Sheriff's Department held a press conference Sunday afternoon to provide updates on the shooting and revealed images of the suspect's backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 rifle left at the scene. 'Nothing will slow me down,' Trump wrote in a statement. 'I will NEVER SURRENDER!' Palm Beach Sheriff's Department vehicles posted up outside Trump International Golf Club on Sunday after gunshots were reported in the vicinity of where the former president was golfing Traffic in West Palm Beach as police shut down roads outside Trump International Golf Club after gunshots were fired in the vicinity of the former president, who was golfing President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are aware of the shooting and 'relieved' he is not harmed. 'The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,' according to the White House. 'They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.' Harris, who just met Trump for the first time in person at their debate on Tuesday, responded to the shooting with a statement sharing the platitude: 'Violence has no place in America.' 'I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,' she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Trump speaks with DailyMail.com during an interview at his Mar-a-Lago club – just five miles down the road from his golf club where shots were fired on Sunday United States Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X: 'The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m.' 'The former president is safe,' he assured, adding that the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office will follow up with more details about the incident. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke with Trump moments after news broke. 'He is one of the strongest people I've ever known,' the senator wrote on X. 'He's in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.' It is still unclear how many people were involved in Sunday's shooting and whether they were targeting the former president. It is also still not known if the suspect ever fired his gun or if the gunshots came from the agents who took aim at the alleged threat. But just the report of shots near Trump raises eyebrows as multiple investigations are ongoing into the shooting in Pennsylvania earlier this summer that left two dead, including the shooter, and two critically injured. A bullet struck Donald Trump's right ear during an assassination attempt on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service agents after he was able to climb onto a roof with an AR-15 just 400 feet from where Trump was speaking and take multiple shots that killed one rally goer, critically injured two others and struck the former president Trump walked away from the assassination attempt with just a bloody ear that could have been a fatal shot had it been a few millimeters different and struck his head. But would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service before he was able to get in another shot at the former president. Initial canvassing led to authorities discovering his car near the rally site in Butler with explosives and his parent's home with even more bombs. Congressional and other local and federal investigations are ongoing to discover what led to the failures that allowed a shooter to get just a few hundred feet away from Trump with an AR-15 rifle.

The singer, 47, was showing off her signature dance moves onstage at LIV Miami as she danced onstage to new single, Soltera when she appeared to spot revelers filming up her skirt. The star was seen stopping dancing as she held onto her skirt with both hands and shook her head at the fans - while gesturing that she had seen what they were doing. She then resumed dancing before turning to the unidentified fans once again and waving her hand. Shakira then left the stage where she was seen being greeted by security and fans in the VIP area. Shakira was filmed abruptly leaving the stage after fans appeared to film up her dress in a shock social media video DailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Shakira for comment. Read More Shakira drops jaws in sexy black swimsuit as she graces Rolling Stone cover Fans online quickly condemned filming, writing: 'People are gross'. Another wrote: 'That's truly disappointing behavior. Artists deserve respect and privacy, both on and off stage. It's crucial to ensure a safe environment for everyone.' Others typed: 'shakira cant even enjoy and dance to her OWN song like??', 'I f*****g hate men, ban these men from clubs entirely', It’s wild how some guys can single-handedly turn a great experience into a total cringe-fest with their creepy vibes.' Back in June Shakira said she's not quite ready for a 'formal relationship' but suggested she may be open to a fling — two years after her split from longtime partner Gerard Pique. The Colombian hitmaker and the Spanish football star, 37, were together for 11 years and welcomed two children — sons Milan, 11, and Sasha, nine — before separating in 2022. It was rumored that Gerard had cheated on Shakira with his now-girlfriend and former employee Clara Chia, 26. 'I'm not thinking about that. What space do I have for a man right now?' she told Rolling Stone this week when asked about her dating life. The singer, 47, was showing off her signature dance moves onstage at LIV Miami as she danced onstage to new single, Soltera when she appeared to spot revelers filming up her skirt The star was seen stopping dancing as she held onto her skirt with both hands and shook her head at the fans - while gesturing that she had seen what they were doing - before leaving the stage She continued: 'What can I tell you, I like men. That's the problem. I shouldn't like them with everything that's happened to me, but imagine how much I like men that I still like them.' Since parting ways with Gerard, Shakira has been romantically linked to the likes of A-list actor Tom Cruise and racing champ Lewis Hamilton. Most recently, Shakira has been spotted with Emily In Paris hunk Lucien Laviscount, 32, who starred in the sexy music video for her song Puntería in March. A source told DailyMail.com in April that she and Lucien 'are seeing each other but are not heavily involved yet.' But Shakira insisted to Rolling Stone that she isn't interested in a relationship at the moment as the well-being of her children is her primary focus. 'I think my kids would have to be very prepared for that, and their emotional and psychological well-being is the priority,' the She Wolf hitmaker admitted. But she appeared to hint that she isn't opposed to a future fling. 'Hey, I'm not opposed to having friends,' the mother-of-two told the outlet. The Colombian hitmaker and the football star Gerard Pique, 37, were together for 11 years and welcomed two children — sons Milan, 11, and Sasha, nine — before separating in 2022; seen in 2015 Shakira also declared that she's got her 'sexy back.' 'More swag. I got my swag back. And I got my sexy back,' she said. It's a remarkably positive turnaround from the pain Shakira endured two years ago, when she split from Gerard and was embroiled in a tax evasion legal battle in Spain. Her father, who was 90 years old at the time, had also suffered a terrible fall. He is now on the mend following six surgeries. Speaking of that time, she said: 'The suffering I felt was probably the greatest I had ever experienced in my entire life, and it kept me from functioning at times.' 'It felt like someone had stabbed a hole in my chest. And the sensation was so real, almost physical. I physically felt like I had a hole in my chest and that people could see through me,' she added. The music icon then vulnerably described the sacrifices she made during her relationship with Gerard and how she has begun to find herself again since their split. Shakira said she's not quite ready for a 'formal relationship' but suggested she may be open to a fling — two years after her split from longtime partner Pique; seen in May 'When you leave a relationship of many years, there are things about yourself that seem to have been lost along the way,' she told the publication. 'There's things about yourself that you change for the other person or give up. When that relationship breaks down, you feel like you're left with nothing and you have to heal, search for yourself, and travel back toward the center of yourself.' Shakira made Gerard and their children her top priority during their relationship and even moved to Barcelona for him, as he played soccer for FC Barcelona.

The 62-year-old actress shared details about how she met the Top Gun star, also 62, and the date they went on when they were both in the early stages of their acting careers. During a panel at 90s Con Florida on Saturday, she explained that they crossed paths at an audition sometime in the '80s, according to PEOPLE. They went out dancing at Club Lingerie, and Locklear — who admitted in 2013 that she was turned off by his dance moves — recalled that he was 'very nice' on their date. However, the self-proclaimed 'rock and roll girl' felt that their styles did not fit well together.

Jokingly, the Melrose Place alum added: 'He's even worse!' 'So, at that time, he was just like this little baby boy that I feel like I was a little bit older, and he ended up coming over to my house with Sean Penn,' she continued. 'And they were just nice, but he was very \"yes ma'am\" to me, and I was like, \"Okay, sir\",' she added. The Dynasty star, who previously said that they went out together because they were both new in Los Angeles at the time, said with a laugh: 'He didn't quite cut it.' She then shared more details about their first date. 'We went out dancing to Club Lingerie at that time, and I've said this before, I mean, he was really cute.' She also pointed out that she got to witness Cruise's dance moves and was one of the first people to see what ended up being his famous scene when he slides on his knees in his 1983 film Risky Business.

In a statement posted to X, Harris wrote, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” President Joe Biden has also reportedly been briefed on the incident. Trump’s campaign said Sunday afternoon that the former president was safe “following gunshots in his vicinity.” His communications director, Steven Cheung, did not provide any additional details at the time. U.S. Secret Service agents opened fire after seeing a person with a firearm near Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while the Republican presidential candidate was golfing Sunday, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. No injuries were reported. The person fled in an SUV and was later apprehended in nearby Martin County by local law enforcement, the officials said. In a Facebook post, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office said it has stopped a vehicle on northbound Interstate 95 and taken a suspect into custody who is believed to be connected to the shooting. The sheriff’s office said it made the stop after authorities in neighboring Palm Beach County put out a “be on the lookout” alert. Photos included in the post showed an SUV stopped behind multiple law enforcement vehicles. The post by the Martin County Sheriff’s Office indicated the suspect was apprehended near Palm City, Florida, about a 45-mile drive north of Trump’s golf course. Northbound lanes of I-95 were shut down, the sheriff’s office said. Two law enforcement officials also told The Associated Press that an AK-style firearm was recovered near the golf course. Sources told CNN that Trump is believed to have been the target. No additional details were immediately available. In an email to supporters, Trump said: “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” the former president said. Roughly two months ago, Trump was shot during an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania, and a bullet grazed his ear. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(NEXSTAR) &#8212; Vice President Kamala Harris says she has been briefed after&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris Expresses Relief that Trump is Safe Amid Gunshots, Condemns Violence in America first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/harris-expresses-relief-that-trump-is-safe-amid-gunshots-condemns-violence-in-america/","image":"https://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2024/09/AP24256758566413-e1726441905350.jpg?w=800","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:13:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.628},{"id":256482238,"title":"Maná cancels collaboration with Nicky Jam due to Donald Trump endorsement: “Maná refuses to collaborate with racists”","text":"Maná has removed their collab with Nicky Jam, “De Pies a Cabeza,” from streaming services after the reggaeton star endorsed Donald Trump.

Standing in a room drenched in red and blue lighting, Jordan Coleman, the 29-year-old son of Eric Adams who released his debut rap album last year under the moniker, Jayoo, commemorated the day by recording music inside Gracie Mansion. Coleman’s music features drill rap, a hip-hop subgenre that Adams has publicly denounced for its association with street violence, as its lyrics often center around gangs. “Real Session,” Coleman captioned the picture of himself with an emoticon of the Statue of Liberty followed by “9/11.” The mayor’s son later attended rapper Jeezy’s concert with the radio host “Ogee Money,” according to an Instagram post by the The Push Effect on Taste Radio 1 host. The radio personality described the night as an “All Access” show he took Coleman along to after “the 9/11 sessions at Gracie.” In one video in the post, Coleman can be seen arriving at the Jeezy concert in a black vehicle with tinted windows. While Coleman recorded music, his father — who had COVID-19 — himself did not attend the annual ceremony that marks the worst terror attacks in US history. Adams instead hung a wreath outside Gracie Mansion that day in honor of lives lost. His absence was among several conspicuous no-shows from people within his administration who have recently been named in federal investigations. The meager showing by New York City officials drew disbelief among political insiders sources told The Post at the time. President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris were all in attendance and — in a remarkable tableau — stood together at Ground Zero just hours after Trump and Harris faced off in their first-ever debate. Trump and Biden shook hands while former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared to facilitate a handshake between Harris and Trump. The campaign rivals then stood only a few feet apart, with Biden and Bloomberg between them. Trump’s running mate JD Vance stood on his other side.","summary":"Bereaved families, local and national dignitaries and first responders gathered in NYC to mark the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but Hizzoner's son had different plans.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/nyc-mayors-rapper-son-posts-about-9-11-music-recording-session/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/new-york-city-mayor-eric-89752984.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5bcb2j9P-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:55:56","author":"Aneeta Bhole,Craig McCarthy","authors":["Aneeta Bhole","Craig McCarthy"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":256482210,"title":"Kamala Harris briefed on Trump attempted shooting as Washington weighs in","text":"“I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,” she posted on X. “Violence has no place in America.” Trump survived after another attempted assassination attempt within two months Sunday afternoon when the Secret Service shot at a man at Trump International Golf Club they suspected of having a gun. He was later pulled over by Martin County police officers and taken into custody. Statements and reactions poured in from both sides of the aisle in Washington, with the White House saying Harris and President Joe Biden were aware of what happened. “The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,” the White House statement said. “They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.” Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump’s running mate, said that he talked to Trump before news of the shooting was announced. “I’m glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,” Vance wrote. “Still much we don’t know, but I’ll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude.” Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s running mate, posted well wishes for Trump. “Gwen and I are glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe,” he said. “Violence has no place in our country. It’s not who we are as a nation.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he was briefed by the Secret Service. “I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump’s safety,” he said. “There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Former President Barack Obama retweeted Harris’s post, and later posted about a golf tournament in Virginia, a move that drew some controversy online. Trump himself posted a statement saying “nothing will slow me down.” “There were gunshots in my vicinity but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL. Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” he wrote in an email sent from the campaign. The suspect has been identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, according to Fox News.

The former president was rushed to safety on Sunday after multiple shots were fired in his vicinity while he was playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach. A suspected gunman is in custody after the terrifying incident at Trump International Club almost exactly two months after a gunman tried to take out Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Multiple reports names the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh. Trump confirmed in a statement about an hour after the incident that he is ‘safe and well’ and didn’t want rumors to ‘start spiraling out of control.’ The 2024 Republican nominee’s bulked up Secret Service advance team spotted the shooter in the tree lines just two holes from where Trump was golfing. The FBI now says two hours after the incident that the attack ‘appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.’ The armed suspect was posted up outside the club around the 5th and 6th hole, which a source familiar with the incident told DailyMail.com is a ‘vulnerable’ area of the course. Multiple police sources have confirmed to media that a ‘high powered rifle’ was recovered at the scene and that he was pointing the weapon towards the golf course on Sunday afternoon before shots were fired at 2:00 p.m. The suspect’s car is also in police possession. The area where the suspect was first spotted by his security detail was two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing at the time of gunshots, causing the individual to flee. Undergrowth is cut back in this area every summer and is one of the parts of the course closest to the road. The incident comes as Trump’s security detail has been ramped up in the two months after the former president was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Trump’s golf club is just five miles from his residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach and is where the former president is often spotted golfing when he is not on the campaign trail. Real estate investor and New York City landlord Steve Witkoff was Trump’s golfing buddy on Sunday, sources told DailyMail.com. The Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department held a press conference Sunday afternoon to provide updates on the shooting and revealed images of the suspect’s backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 rifle left at the scene. ‘Nothing will slow me down,’ Trump wrote in a statement. ‘I will NEVER SURRENDER!’ President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are aware of the shooting and ‘relieved’ he is not harmed. ‘The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,’ according to the White House. ‘They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.’ Harris, who just met Trump for the first time in person at their debate on Tuesday, responded to the shooting with a statement sharing the platitude: ‘Violence has no place in America.’ ‘I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,’ she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. United States Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X: ‘The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m.’ ‘The former president is safe,’ he assured, adding that the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office will follow up with more details about the incident. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke with Trump moments after news broke. ‘He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known,’ the senator wrote on X. ‘He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.’ It is still unclear how many people were involved in Sunday’s shooting and whether they were targeting the former president. It is also still not known if the suspect ever fired his gun or if the gunshots came from the agents who took aim at the alleged threat. But just the report of shots near Trump raises eyebrows as multiple investigations are ongoing into the shooting in Pennsylvania earlier this summer that left two dead, including the shooter, and two critically injured. Trump walked away from the assassination attempt with just a bloody ear that could have been a fatal shot had it been a few millimeters different and struck his head. But would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service before he was able to get in another shot at the former president. Initial canvassing led to authorities discovering his car near the rally site in Butler with explosives and his parent’s home with even more bombs. Congressional and other local and federal investigations are ongoing to discover what led to the failures that allowed a shooter to get just a few hundred feet away from Trump with an AR-15 rifle. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) is on the House Task Force on the assassination attempt. He said on Sunday that this proves the attack was not an ‘isolated incident’ and demanded the Secret Service brief the task force this week. ‘As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,’ Waltz wrote on X.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe FBI is investigating a second assassination attempt against Donald Trump in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FBI Investigating &#8216;Attempted Assassination&#8217; on Trump at Golf Course\tpooling on Title: FBI Investigating &#8216;Attempted Assassination&#8217; Incident at Trump&#8217;s Golf Course first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/fbi-investigating-attempted-assassination-on-trump-at-golf-coursepooling-on-title-fbi-investigating-attempted-assassination-incident-at-trumps-golf-course/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-FBI-says-it039s-probing-039attempted-assassination039-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:50:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":256481660,"title":"Kamala Harris showcases a new unusual accent at the black caucus dinner","text":"Kamala Harris left listeners baffled as her notoriously changeable accent went through another transition in front of an audience of black politicians in DC on Saturday night. The Democrat nominee seemed keen to ingratiate herself as she addressed the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation at the Phoenix Awards Dinner. ‘Hello to all of my Divine Nine brothers and sisters!’ she hollered to the diners. ‘And to all my HBCU brothers and sisters.’ ‘Kamala Harris is whatever you want her to be, depending on which audience she is talking to,’ wrote one observer on X. ‘But I give her credit for being able to change her accent for so many audiences!’ The VP who spent her childhood in San Francisco and Montreal has long been accused of adapting her accent to whatever audience she is addressing. She raised eyebrows on the campaign trail in 2020 when she adopted a languorous southern drawl to excite one Florida rally with the words ‘We will tell them we were hangin’ out in a parking lot this particular Saturday afternoon with Kamala.’ She unleashed her Dixie accent again in July at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia, when she told her audience ‘You all helped us win in 2020 and we gonna do it again in 2024’. In 2021 she was even accused of slipping into a cod French accent as she spoke to scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. And her latest switch came just days after teachers in Michigan were left scratching their heads at her attempt at a Detroit demotic. ‘You may not be a union member but you better thank a union member for the five-day work week,’ Harris told them. ‘I’m from California. We all talk like this,’ an X user sarcastically wrote alongside a phonetic spelling of how Harris spoke in her remarks: ‘I’m gonna make sure to thanka union memba today.’ The VP has both Jamaica and Indian heritage and her vocal dexterity has been leapt on by Donald Trump after her GOP rival accused her of using her blackness to her advantage when it suits her. ‘I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,’ he said during the annual convention. ‘So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?’ The VP’s latest accent sparked similar derision from right-wing commentators after it she tried it out with her mainly black audience on Saturday. ‘Kamala Harris is speaking in front of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation so of course she’s suddenly developed a mysterious accent,’ tweeted conservative pundit Benny Johnson. ‘New? Or is it her old fake black accent?’ demanded Paul A. Szypula. ‘Either way, it’s incredibly insulting to black people. Shame on Kamala.’ ‘Kamala Harris revealed a new accent at the Black Caucus Dinner,’ added Steve Guest. ‘Despite a childhood in Berkley, California and Montreal, Canada, Kamala uses what she thinks is a Detroit accent, a southern accent, a French accent, and more…’ he added. The White House refused to comment when challenged over Harris’s mercurial enunciation earlier this month. ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about,’ spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. ‘She was talking about unions in Detroit using one tone of voice,’ Peter Doocy of Fox News pointed out. ‘She used the same line in Pittsburgh, and it sounded like she at least had some kind of a southern drawl.’ ‘Do you think Americans seriously think that this is an important question?’ Jean-Pierre demanded. ‘They care – you know what they care about? They care about the economy. They care about lowering costs. They care about healthcare. That’s what Americans care about. ‘I’m not even going to entertain some question about — hearing it sounds so ridiculous. ‘It’s insane,’ she added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris left listeners baffled as her notoriously changeable accent went through&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris showcases a new unusual accent at the black caucus dinner first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-showcases-a-new-unusual-accent-at-the-black-caucus-dinner/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-debuts-ANOTHER-bizarre-accent-at.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:48:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.048},{"id":256482866,"title":"Kamala Harris to Attend Los Angeles Fundraiser on Sept. 29","text":"Kamala Harris will make a fundraising visit to Los Angeles on Sept. 29, according to an invitation issued by the Harris Victory Fund.

The unsettling incident unfolded at Trump's West Palm Beach golf club around 1:30 pm ET today when Secret Service agents spotted someone brandishing an AK-47 through a fence line. During a press briefing at 5pm, Palm Beach Sheriff Rick Bradshaw disclosed that the suspect had been apprehended on the I-95 following a tip-off from a witness who observed the figure jumping into a black Nissan SUV after fleeing from the bushes. \"After that we took the witness and he identified him as the person seen running out of the bushes and jumping into a car,\" confirmed Sheriff Bradshaw.

Shortly after the incident at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Trump was shift to reassure his allies, indicating in an email to donors: \"gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiralling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! \" It follows an earlier assassination effort Trump faced during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump had flown back to Florida this weekend after a West Coast tour that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. His campaign had remained silent about Trump's Sunday plans, which often involve a morning round of golf followed by lunch at the club, reports the Mirror US. In a nearby county, the sheriff disclosed that the suspect was unarmed and didn't question his arrest. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told WPTV that the man thought to be connected to the incident \"was not armed when we took him out of the car.\" The suspect maintained a calm, emotionless demeanour when stopped by police, according to Snyder. He added that the man did not ask why he was being pulled over. \"He never asked, 'what is this about? ' Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on. He never questioned it,\" Snyder said. Officials report that the Secret Service opened fire when a man pushed the muzzle of a firearm through the perimeter of the golf course. A man brandishing an AK-style rifle thrust the firearm's muzzle through the boundary of Donald Trump's West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course while the Republican presidential candidate was playing a round. The individual dropped the weapon and fled in an SUV, and was later captured in a neighbouring county, the officials reported. The officials were not authorised to discuss the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity. Officials have confirmed that parts of the golf course were cordoned off for Trump's game, and agents identified an individual carrying a firearm several holes ahead of him.

Meanwhile, the Japanese firm Nippon Steel Corporation, the world’s fourth largest steelmaker, is hoping to acquire the U.S. Steel firm.Steel DealLast year, Nippon Steel announced it would purchase U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion cash. U.S. Steel shareholders approved the offer in April, and union workers oppose the deal, as do presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

Gene J. Puskar/AP Photo Earlier this month, the foreign investment committee sent a letter to Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel saying that the acquisition could lead to a reduction in steel production capacity in the United States.China OvercapacityBoth Japanese and U.S. steel industries view cheap steel exports from China as a major issue. The U.S. government has already increased tariffs on Chinese aluminum and steel to 25 percent and in July announced a partnership with Mexico to try to close a loophole that allows Chinese state-run manufacturers to avoid tariffs by shipping to the United States through Mexico. Nippon Steel is also lobbying the Japanese government to curb imports of steel from China. Domestically, China’s real estate construction usually accounts for roughly a quarter of all steel consumption worldwide, according to an HSBC analyst. However, the collapse of China’s real estate industry resulted in sharp decline in demand and an increase in China’s net crude steel exports, which went up 64 percent in 2023 from 2022. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has aggressively expanded China’s steel industry to achieve a dominant position in the global market, and other countries’ anti-dumping measures have heightened China’s oversupply crisis. In late August, the regime suspended a steel industry policy enacted in 2021, which had the effect of stopping any new steel plants from being built.

The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hold oral arguments on the legal challenge, putting the fate of Chinese-owned TikTok in the middle of the final weeks of the 2024 presidential election. Both Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Vice-president Kamala Harris are active on TikTok seeking to court younger voters. TikTok and ByteDance argue the law is unconstitutional and violates Americans’ free speech rights saying it is “a radical departure from this country’s tradition of championing an open Internet”. Driven by worries among US lawmakers that China could access data on Americans or spy on them with the app, the measure was passed overwhelmingly in the US Congress in April just weeks after being introduced. ByteDance has said a divestiture is “not possible technologically, commercially, or legally” and without a court ruling will lead to an unprecedented ban on January 19. Circuit judges Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao and Douglas Ginsburg will consider the legal challenges brought by TikTok and users. TikTok and the Justice Department have asked for a ruling by December 6, which could allow the US Supreme Court to take up the decision before any ban takes effect. President Joe Biden signed the law in April, giving ByteDance until January 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban, but he could extend the deadline by three months if he certifies ByteDance is making progress toward a sale. The White House and other advocates of the law said the measure is a challenge to Chinese-based ownership of the app, and not a move to eliminate TikTok.

The issue also held a front row seat at the Sept. 10 presidential debate as both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris laid out their plans for the economy. Harris says she'd provide bigger tax benefits for families but would offset the costs by raising corporate taxes, while Trump has said he'd extend the tax cuts enacted in 2017.Trump's proposed economic plan also includes blanket tariffs on all imports into the United States, including a 60% tariff on imports from China and a 10% tariff on imports from other nations. The former president doubled down on these proposals last week during the presidential debate.\"Other countries are going to, finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world,\" he said.Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance also spoke to Trump's tariff plan Sunday on Face the Nation.\"We want American workers to get tax cuts under President Trump's policies, and we want to actually penalize companies that are shipping jobs overseas through tariffs,\" Vance said. \"We should not be allowing slave laborers to benefit from American markets. If you want access to our market, you've got to pay our workers fair wages.\"On paper, the proposed tariff hike could cover the cost of tax cuts, which are a cornerstone in Trump's campaign pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare.\" But some experts have warned that Trump's economic policies could stall, or even reverse, progress. They note that tariffs effectively act as a consumption tax, increasing the cost of imported goods into the U.S. which consumers usually feel the weight of on their receipts. Cohn said Sunday that he finds it \"completely reasonable\" for the U.S. government to tariff Chinese imports on products the U.S. also produces, like electric vehicles, which the Biden administration announced plans for in May. But he also noted that he does not see the value of tariffs on imports of products that are not manufactured in the U.S. \"We import many products that we do not produce in this country. Those products are in high demand, and we need them. A lot of them are pharmaceuticals, many other products that we expect to have on our shelves when we go in the store,\" Cohn said. \"If we start tariffing those products, we will have inflation. To the extent that we want to produce those products in this country, we should start out on a very methodical path to do that.\"The former Trump adviser then cited the CHIPS and Science Act as a competitive approach that was \"done pretty reasonably.\" The CHIPS Act funds the domestic production of semiconductors, and was developed by the Trump administration before being signed into law by President Biden in 2023.\"So we can build chips here, and then we can become self-sufficient on chip manufacturing,\" Cohn said. \"Then we can tariff foreign chips from flooding our market at a discount price, but until we have the capacity to build them ourselves, putting a tariff on those chips would just be debilitating to our economy.\"As both presidential candidates continue to campaign their economic agendas, the United States Federal Reserve this week is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years since 2020.Economists told CBS News that Trump's plans for tax cuts would act as an inflationary fiscal stimulus and that his plans for deporting immigrants could force employers to pay higher wages. In that case, the Fed could be forced to keep its benchmark rate higher for longer.If consumers \"are upset now, they will be hopping mad a year from now\" regarding inflation if Trump wins and implements his policies, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics and co-author of a June report on the macroeconomic impacts of either a Trump or Biden win in November, told CBS News.","summary":"Gary Cohn served as former President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser from 2017-18 and served as director of the National Economic Council.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gary-cohn-trump-tariffs-face-the-nation/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/15/56c15eaa-2a9a-4d77-ad04-74be69c4d865/thumbnail/1200x630/3caa54c4a708f6397e552208be9fc9ad/1726417243775.png?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3195502_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:21:21","author":"Patrick Maguire","authors":["Patrick Maguire"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":256483266,"title":"Moment Donald Trump ally argues with Sky News presenter before appearing to have his line cut after calling Joe Biden a 'senile bag of oatmeal' in fiery interview following 'assassination attempt' on former US president","text":"This is the moment an inflammatory Donald Trump ally had his mic cut after calling US president Joe Biden a 'senile bag of oatmeal', following a suspected assassination attempt on the former president. Trump, 78, is confirmed safe and alive after shots were fired while he was at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. A man driving a black Nissan was detained shortly after the incident at 2PM EST (7PM BST), and an AK-47, two backpacks and a GoPro were found in the area. Following the incident, potentially the second time in two months Trump's life was threatened by a shooter, the White House said that both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were briefed on the incident, adding: 'They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.' But Trump ally and former adviser Sebastian Gorka told Sky News' Gillian Joseph that he did not believe that Biden and Harris were relieved to hear that Trump was safe, claiming: '[Joe Biden] doesn't even know what day of the week it is. He's a senile bag of oatmeal.' 'These are the same people who called my former boss a threat to democracy and a wannabe dictator. They are part of the problem. 'I reject everything that comes out of their mendacious mouths. They are absolute hacks and liars who hate America and my former boss, and anybody who believes in the idea of making America great again. Yes, they are liars.' After verbally sparring with the host, he said before he was cut off: 'Don't invite me on your show, can you promise me that.' Trump has since issued a defiant statement after shots were fired at his golf course near West Palm Beach while he was present - promising to never surrender. 'There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I am safe and well,' he wrote in an alert sent out by his team Sunday. 'Nothing will slow me down. I will never surrender,' the candidate continued, months after surviving a separate attempt on his life that saw him shot in the ear. 'I will always love you for supporting me. 'Unity. Peace. Make America Great Again. May god bless you,' he wrote as a signoff, sharing a photo of his face as a characteristic signature. Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign’s communications director, added in his own bulletin not long after the shots were heard: 'President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity. 'No further details at this time.' A man, meanwhile, has been reportedly taken into custody, though it remains unknown whether he was the one responsible for the gunfire. No members of the Secret Service were injured, and cops said the shooting occurred just before 2pm. The person detained by feds at the scene was said to have a 'calm demeanor', but has not been identified. The nature of the shooting, as a result, remains unknown, and members of the Secret Service were seen firing at the suspect, who was said to be a few holes ahead of the group Trump was a part of. A long gun has reportedly been recovered from the scene, and sources briefed on the matter have said officials believe Trump was the intended target. It's not known if the person detained even let a shot off, with initial reports only indicating Secret Service agents fired at the suspect. That confrontation took place in woods near the golf club, officials said. As reports of the shooting circulated, Vice President Kamala Harris issued her own response on X. 'I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida,' the short statement read. 'I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.' Trump, meanwhile, went on to return to the club, officials revealed, before confirming he has since left the scene. The presidential candidate was initially rushed off the golf course when the shots rang out. Members of the Secret Service were said to have spotted the individual now being held in relation to the case, likely avoiding casualties. He was seen holding an assault-style gun that some have said appeared to look like an AK-47, though that remains to be seen. The FBI has responded to the scene, calling the event an 'attempted assassination.' Feds' investigation into the incident remains ongoing. The person detained has yet to be named. In the meantime, many - including Trumps team - are asking questions: like how could two people with guns get so close to the former president in a manner of months. The probe, as the last one after the failed attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, did, will likely yield answers. Trump has a campaign office in West Palm Beach, not far from the golf course.","summary":"This is the moment a Donald Trump ally had his mic cut after calling US president Joe Biden a 'senile bag of oatmeal', following a suspected assassination attempt on the former president. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13853449/moment-donald-trump-ally-argues-sky-news-presenter-assissination-attempt.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/15/22/89705563-0-image-m-125_1726437584895.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:20:16","author":"Editor,Guy Adams","authors":["Editor","Guy Adams"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.654},{"id":256480966,"title":"Scooter Braun defends Taylor Swift against Donald Trump after hateful diss: ‘Shake it off’ former president","text":"Haters gonna hate. Scooter Braun had a special message for Donald Trump after the former US president claimed he “hates” Taylor Swift. “Shake it off Donald,” the former talent manager wrote via his Instagram Stories Sunday alongside a screenshot of Trump’s vulgar message. “Kamala 2024,” Braun, 43, added, alluding he is voting for 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the forthcoming election. The producer, who infamously “stripped” Swift of her “life’s work” and acquired the singer’s masters, spoke out against Trump, 78, after the politician expressed his distaste for the pop star hours earlier. “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump spoke out against the “Lover” songstress, 34, after she publicly endorsed Harris following the 2024 presidential debate last week. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” she wrote on Instagram. “I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” Swift continued. The 14-time Grammy winner added Harris’ running mate Tim Waltz has also “been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.” Additionally, Swift called out a fake AI image showing her falsely” endorsing Trump, saying, “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.” Trump, however, brushed off the pop star’s support for Harris, claiming he likes her friend Brittany Mahomes more. “Well, I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth. She’s a big Trump fan,” he said on an interview with “Fox & Friends.” Trump previously referred to the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes as “beautiful” after she was criticized for “strongly defending” him. “I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country,” he wrote on social media earlier this month.","summary":"The former talent manager, who infamously acquired Swift's masters, subtly showed his support for the Grammy winner after Trump proclaimed he hated her.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/09/15/celebrity-news/scooter-braun-defends-taylor-swift-against-donald-trump-after-hateful-diss-shake-it-off-former-president/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/89764560.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:18:16","author":"Vanessa Serna","authors":["Vanessa Serna"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.222},{"id":256481050,"title":"Surprising survey reveals Kamala Harris close to Trump in very conservative state","text":"Kamala Harris is closing the gap with former President Donald Trump in Iowa, new polling numbers show. The survey conducted by the Des Moines Register and Mediacom Iowa was published Sunday, and shows Harris just four points behind her Republican rival. Perhaps even more shockingly, the survey was taken September 8 to 11, days before Trump’s debate against Harris that many in the media are convinced Harris won. This comes after Trump handedly won the same poll in 2016 in the same state by nearly 10 points, and again in 2020 by more than 8 points. Both times, the survey proved prophetic, with the GOP frontrunner winning the swing state by a narrow margin. Barack Obama is the only Democrat to win the presidential race in Iowa since Al Gore in 2000. No Democrat aside from Obama has won statewide since Tom Harkin was dragged over the line by the two-term president in 2008. The poll is considered elite, having been declared by FiveThirtyEight in 2016 to be best in class. A June poll, meanwhile, showed President Joe Biden trailing Trump by a whopping 18 points – a gap that’s seemingly since been erased with the switch in candidates. While Trump’s lead is still outside any margin of error, the woman who runs the poll says it is not a great sign for the former president. ‘I wouldn’t say 4 points is comfortable [for Trump],’ pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co. who lead the Iowa poll, told Des Moines Register. ‘The race has tightened significantly.’ Selzer asserted that the results ‘signal a change in the mood of the electorate’ since Harris’ entry into the race. A DailyMail.com snap poll determined Harris was the winner of the debate and seemed most presidential, while Trump was deemed the most aggressive. A positive sign for Trump, besides still leading the race, is that the poll was taken before Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s exit from election. RFK Jr. was polling at six percent, while libertarian Chase Oliver has garnered one percent. Now, new polling from Yahoo News/YouGov shows the vice president gaining a five-point lead over Trump among registered voters in a head-to-head match-up. The poll of 1,755 U.S. adults conducted from September 11-13 found 50 percent of people said they would vote for Harris, while 45 percent said they would vote for Trump. Harris trailed Trump by 9 points among independent voters – 35 percent to 44 percent – prior to the debate. The new poll now has her leading with that bloc by 10 points, 47 percent to 37 percent. While national polling has Harris taking the lead, a new poll of the crucial swing state of Michigan shows warning signs for the vice president as she looks to secure the so-called Democratic ‘blue wall.’ The InsiderAdvantage poll shows Donald Trump leading by one point in the state. It has the GOP nominee at 49 percent and Harris at 48 percent signaling it’s going to be an extremely close race in the must-win state for Democrats on their path to the White House. The InsiderAdvantage poll was conducted of 800 likely voters September 11 and 12, after the presidential debate. Trump confirmed there will not be a debate rematch with the vice president in a lengthy Truth Social post.

A spokesperson for Donald Trump's campaign said the former president is \"safe.\" Law enforcement sources told ABC News a suspect is in custody. The incident comes around two months after Trump was shot in the ear at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the gunman got as close as 300 to 500 yards away from the former president when he was spotted and agents fired four to six rounds at him before he dropped the gun and fled. It was not clear if the suspect was aiming his weapon at Trump. The source said the suspect got into a vehicle and witnesses reported the license plate number, which was tracked by authorities. The suspect was stopped and taken into custody. Bradshaw said along with an \"AK-47-style rifle,\" two backpacks were found at the scene with a GoPro camera and ceramic tiles inside. The sheriff said the golf course was not surrounded by law enforcement because Trump is not the sitting president. “If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible. So, I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there’ll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter.\" But Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he already had concerns about the Secret Service after the first assassination attempt against Trump and advocated moving the agency from under the Department of Homeland Security and back under the Treasury Department, \"where it had more focus.\" A Republican who spoke with Trump shortly after the incident told ABC News that Trump said he was near the 5th hole of the Trump International golf course when he heard \"popping sounds\" in the vicinity. The source said Trump was in \"good spirits.\" Sheriff Will Snyder of neighboring Martin County told ABC News that his units detained a man following the incident. Snyder said after the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department, the Secret Service and the FBI put out a \"Be on the lookout for\" alert, one of his officers saw the suspect vehicle northbound on Interstate 95 and other officers \"forced it to a stop without incident.\" Snyder said the vehicle matched the description in the bulletin but \"now we have to determine if this, in fact, was the right suspect.\" Shortly after the incident, Trump sent a fundraising email saying that he was safe and well and that no one was hurt. \"But, there are people in this world who will do whatever it takes to stop us,\" he wrote. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the \"security incident at the Trump International Golf Course,\" the White House said in a statement Sunday. \"They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team,\" the White House added. This is a developing story.

A man was in custody and found an AK-47 style rifle, two backpacks filled with ceramic tile and a GoPro camera that he had abandoned. “The FBI has responded to West Palm Beach, Florida, and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump,” the agency said in a statement. This was a second assassination attempt on Trump in just more than two months. The first was in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 when he was hit in the right ear. The shooter, who was operating by himself, was killed by a law enforcement sniper. The Sunday incident took place at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach around 2 p.m. Investigators said a US Secret Service agent moving ahead of the former President to secure the area spotted a man with a gun in a portion of the thick shrubbery around the periphery of the Golf Course. The agent went in that direction and it was not clear yet if the suspect had opened fire. But he was about 350 to 500 yard behind, which was not out range for the scope on the rifle. A witness saw the suspect, investigators said, took a picture of the car and the registration plate and he was pulled over shortly and taken into custody. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” Trump said in a statement. “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” A news conference is awaited from authorities on the details of the shooting. The White House said in a separate statement that US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who are both in Washington D.C., had been briefed. “The President and Vice-President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing. They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.” Harris said in a post on X that she is “glad” the former President is safe. “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” The shooting is reported to have taken place near his Palm Beach golf course. President Trump was on course and shots were fired from the trees on the periphery, CNN said. The US Secret Service personnel returned fire in that direction. –IANS yrj/khz","summary":"Washington, Sep 16 (IANS) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Sunday that it was investigating an incident at former US President Donald Trump&#8217;s golf course in Florida as an &#8220;attempt assassination&#8221; on him.

In his first debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, on Tuesday, which attracted in excess of 67 million viewers, the former president repeated the claim, saying: \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs—the people that came in. They're eating the cats.\"However, Trump was quickly fact-checked live when he repeated the accusations, as city officials have debunked the rumors and police say there are \"no credible reports\" of the claims. Nevertheless, the false claims have spread like wildfire online, leaving Haitian immigrants to consider leaving the city as backlash against immigrant communities has intensified.In a Sunday interview with NBC News' Meet The Press, host Kristen Welker asked Buttigieg about officials in the state warning about a \"strain on resources\" over Haitian migrants in the community. The question came after the mayor of Springfield, Rob Rue, a Republican, admitted his city has been dealing with an \"infrastructure strain\" with the influx of Haitian migrants.\"We have been dealing with an infrastructure strain due to this immigration influx. Any community in the United States that would receive 25 to 30 percent of their population in a short period of time is going to face infrastructure strain.\"In response, Buttigieg pointed toward the use of the false claims as a campaign strategy to \"talk about anything, but their actual agenda.\"\"Let's be very clear, that community and the very real people who are dealing with some really ugly stuff right now, like the bomb threats, are having that inflicted on them as part of a strategy from a campaign that wants to talk about anything, but their actual record and their actual agenda,\" Buttigieg said.He added: \"Donald Trump and JD Vance cannot afford for this campaign to be about things like how Donald Trump eliminated the right to choose and continues to leave the door open to signing a national abortion ban...they need to get us talking about something else. The crazier, the better. And they go for something so outrageous that you actually can't ignore it...because very real pain has been inflicted on this community.\"Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.Buttigieg's response, posted on X, formerly Twitter, by journalist Aaron Rupar, has garnered over 520,000 views as of Sunday evening.In addition, Buttigieg posted on X, \"Cats! Dogs! Geese!...Like the last season before a show gets canceled for getting over-the-top and, at the same time, boring. This election is about jobs, wages, climate, health care, abortion. Not his show. Your life.\" That post has garnered over 1.8 million views.Buttigieg's remarks come after Ohio's Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, defended Haitian immigrants in his state during a Sunday interview on ABC News' This Week, and spoke on some of the challenges due to the influx of Haitian migrants.\"I think it's unfortunate that this came up,\" the governor said. \"Let me tell you what we do know though. What we know is that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal. They came to Springfield to work. Ohio is on the move, and Springfield has really made a great resurgence, with a lot of companies coming in.\"He added: \"What the companies tell us is that they are very good workers. They're very happy to have them there. And frankly, that's helped the economy.\"The governor went on to say that there are \"some problems\" that have arisen as a result of the large influx of new residents.\"When you go from a population of 58,000 and add 15,000 people onto that, you're going to have some challenges and some problems,\" DeWine said. \"We're addressing those. We're working on those every single day.\"This comes after half a century of economic decline, Springfield worked hard to lure back the manufacturing industry. The plan worked and began creating jobs that ended up attracting immigrants. Between 15,000 and 20,000 Haitian migrants have moved to the city, which had a population of just under 60,000 in 2020, over the space of four years, city officials say.They are in the country legally, the City of Springfield's Immigration FAQ page says, many under the Immigration Parole Program, which, under certain conditions, allows noncitizens to remain in the U.S. temporarily without meeting standard visa or immigration requirements.In addition to DeWine's remarks, Rue also spoke out and condemned the rhetoric recently telling local news station WSYX: \"All these federal politicians that have negatively spun our city, they need to know they're hurting our city, and it was their words that did it.\"It comes after Springfield's city hall had to be evacuated on Thursday morning after a bomb threat, which officials said included \"hateful language toward immigrants and Haitians in our community,\" was sent to it, along with the Clark County courthouse and two elementary schools.Meanwhile, Vance was confronted with the mayor's remarks during a Sunday interview with CNN's State of the Union but rejected the idea that his promotion of the \"eating pets\" claim caused the bomb threats and condemned the threats. He also defended his right to spread the claims.\"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,\" Vance told CNN's Dana Bash in the interview.Trump was also asked about the bomb threats by a reporter on Saturday.\"I don't know what happened with the bomb threats,\" the former president said. \"I know that it's been taken over by illegal migrants and that's a terrible thing that happened.\"","summary":"Buttigieg pointed towards the use of the false migrant claims as a Trump campaign strategy to \"talk about anything, but their actual agenda.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/pete-buttigegs-response-donald-trump-jd-vance-migrant-claims-takes-off-online-1954203","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2471775/pete-buttigieg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:10:05","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":256480730,"title":"Laverne Cox sparkles in black and gold gown with striking jewelry as she kicks off the red carpet at the 2024 Primetime Emmy Awards","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Sep 15th 2024 10PM 8°C 1AM 8°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement New Trump assassination bid: FBI shares pictures of rifle, backpacks and GoPro that AK47-toting suspect had stashed in bushes on Florida golf course where he was lying in wait for the ex-President Second 'attempted assassination' on Donald Trump: Gunman with machine gun is spotted in bushes at Florida golf course where ex-President was playing - suspect is arrested after fleeing when Secret Service opened fire at him 'NEVER SURRENDER': Trump breaks his silence with determined message after gunfight erupted on his golf course between shooter and agents Kamala Harris speaks out after gunman shot at on Trump golf course while former president played Married at First Sight star Alex Henry is JAILED for going AWOL from the RAF to take part in Channel 4 dating show Fury as three-year-old girl died 10 hours after being admitted to A&E because 'doctors failed to recognise her symptoms' New 'more contagious' Covid variant spreads through Europe as experts warn it's 'just getting started' The truth about all the disputed Lucy Letby evidence: As claims she is innocent grow louder, read the definitive breakdown by GUY ADAMS My top ten tips for finding love over-50 and how to deal with ghosting, by veteran dating coach STEPHEN ELLERKER Embrace your depression and anxiety.

Rambling, pointless. This wasn’t word salad, it was word jambalaya. Most of the press would be concerned — if they weren’t writing their 10th story about Laura Loomer. For reasons that boggle the mind, Donald Trump let the self-described “pro-white nationalist” tag along to the debate and the 9/11 anniversary. She repaid the favor by insulting Indian-Americans and reminding people that she thinks the terror attack was an inside job. We know her support for Trump is as unwavering as her face, but these aren’t, as the former president once said, “the best people.” A kooky Cabinet of Deplorables have attached themselves to Trump like remoras, throwing out conspiracy theories when he should be talking about policy: Loomer, Tucker Carlson and the vloggers who get paid in rubles come with dark hearts and bad ideas. Some independent voters look and wonder: If Trump wins, will Loomer show up in the White House? Will Carlson redecorate and throw out the bust of Churchill? These provocateurs aren’t serving the campaign, they are only serving themselves. Despite weeks of the press blocking and tackling on her behalf, Harris is barely tied with Trump in the swing states. This may be her ceiling, but we suspect there are still moderate Republicans who are on the fence this year — not about voting for a Democrat, but leaving the top line blank.

On Sunday, minutes after former President Donald Trump posted “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” on Truth Social, the former music manager shared a post on his Instagram Story, asking Trump to “shake off” his hatred for Swift — while Braun endorsed Harris in the process. “Shake It Off Donald,” he wrote. “Kamala 2024.” Trump had shared the anti-Swift post on Sunday, just days after the pop star endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket for president following last week’s debate where Harris demolished Trump. Swift signed her post with her name and “Childless Cat Lady” — trolling Trump’s VP pick J.D. Vance, who said “a bunch of childless cat ladies” were running the country. After Trump’s tantrum, Harris’ camp was quick to respond, sharing a statement filled with references to Swift’s song titles. “Donald Trump’s week of whining and spouting conspiracy theories has voters on both sides of the aisle ready to Forget That He Existed,” wrote Harris-Walz spokesperson Sarafina Chitika. “The American people want to be Out of the Woods of the chaos and division of the Trump era.” Swift seems to be living in Braun’s brain rent-free, as she has not spoken publicly about him in years. In fact, the music manager using the Tortured Poets Department singer’s name to propel his Harris endorsement comes five years after the now-infamous battle that sparked Swift to launch her Taylor’s Version re-releases. In a quick summary of that drama: Braun‘s Ithaca Holdings acquired Scott Borchetta’s Big Machine Label Group, and with it, the master recordings to each of Taylor Swift‘s first six studio albums. Swift’s side argued that she was shut out of the sale of her masters, adding that Borchetta “knew what he was doing” selling her music to someone with whom she had a long-standing conflict. Meanwhile, Braun claimed Swift refused to negotiate, which incited her fan base against him.","summary":"\"Shake it off Donald,\" the longstanding Swift foe wrote, quoting the singer's famous lyric","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/scooter-braun-shares-trump-hate-taylor-swift-post-endorses-harris-1235102703/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/scooter-trump-swift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:03:07","author":"Tomás Mier","authors":["Tomás Mier"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.129},{"id":256483262,"title":"Taylor Swift does NOT sit with Trump supporter Brittany Mahomes at Chiefs game again after former president lashed out - as popstar snubs WAG bestie for her mom and A-List pals","text":"Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday to watch the Chiefs - and she sat away from Brittany Mahomes for the second straight week. Swift and Mahomes have developed a close bond through their respective relationships with Chiefs stars Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes, but have publicly supported different presidential candidates of late, with Mahomes herself seen liking a Donald Trump social media post and Swift endorsing Kamala Harris. And while the friends were seen back together at last weekend's US Open, they sat apart for the second consecutive week in Kansas City as Swift was seen without Mahomes in her suite. Swift, who has been dating tight end Kelce since last year, arrived to the game earlier in the day with her mother Andrea, her brother Austin, and singer Danielle Haim. Mahomes also posted an Instagram story of her view - without any sight of the singer - as she also posed with her and Patrick's children Sterling Skye and Lavon ('Bronze'). Swift made a stylish entrance to the game in a long Chiefs t-shirt, knee-high black boots and gold jewelry, as seen in footage posted on X by KSHB's Aaron Ladd. Swift was already a fixture in the Sunday news cycle - and not for any reason of her own. She was a subject of national discussion again after former President Donald Trump posted 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' in all-capital letters on his social media platform, Truth Social. Swift recently publicly endorsed Kamala Harris' bid for president - an action that drove a reported 338,000 visits to Vote.gov, a federal voter registration website that the 'Fortnight' singer linked to in her endorsement post on Instagram. This was not the first time that Trump criticized the pop superstar this week, saying that he likes 'Mrs. Mahomes much better'. That's a reference to Brittany Mahomes - the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes - who recently voiced support for Trump's 20-point platform by 'liking' one of his campaign's Instagram posts. Brittany has since been praised and criticized by conservatives and liberals respectively over her support for the 45th President. The lingering question on Sunday was whether political differences would prevent Swift and Brittany from reuniting at Arrowhead Stadium. In Week 1's NFL opener, Swift was in a luxury box alongside Chariah Gordon, the fiancée of Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman. Notably absent from Swift's box was Brittany Mahomes. That helped fuel speculation that there may be a rift between the two because of political differences. But, as Daily Mail sources said after the first game of the season, there's no bad blood between the two. The pair had been spotted out at a swanky Kansas City cocktail bar after the first game of the 2024 season, celebrating the start of another NFL campaign. Swift and Mahomes were also spotted together enjoying the men's singles final at the US Open last Sunday. As Taylor Fritz was defeated by Jannik Sinner, Brittany and Taylor were seen warmly embracing while the drinks flowed in their suite (not including Brittany, who is pregnant). The couples both looked to be in good spirits as the suite sipped on champagne. The group, minus Brittany, ordered two bottles of Rosé Champagne Moët et Chandon and two bottles of Champagne Impérial Moët et Chandon, sources close to Travis told The US Sun. Afterwards, they enjoyed a double date in New York City as both couples arrived hand-in-hand at Meduza Mediterrania. But since then, Swift has fully endorsed Harris - whereas before, it was only rumored. Brittany has also been subject to some pretty brutal trolling from fans of Swift's in recent days since the endorsement. But a source exclusively told DailyMail.com that they 'respect that they have different views' and have made a 'pact' to avoid discussing politics last month. It remains to be seen if the friends will be seen together off the field. On the field, it should be a tight battle - with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce expected to play starring roles. Last week, with Swift in attendance, the Chiefs were able to beat the Baltimore Ravens, despite the Mahomes-Kelce connection not being at its strongest. Kelce caught three of his four targets for only 34 yards as he finished the night as the fourth-best receiver on Kansas City. He'll hope to bounce back against a Cincinnati team that was stunned at home in Week 1 against the New England Patriots.","summary":"Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday to watch the Chiefs - and she sat away from Brittany Mahomes for the second straight week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-13853345/taylor-swift-sitting-brittany-mahomes-chiefs.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/15/22/89704183-0-image-a-24_1726434868683.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:00:57","author":"Editor,Jake Fenner","authors":["Editor","Jake Fenner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.27},{"id":256480924,"title":"VP Kamala Harris ‘Glad’ Trump Wasn’t Assassinated In Latest Attempt On His Life","text":"Law enforcement secures the area around Trump International Golf Club after an apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on September 15, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida. | Source: Joe Raedle / Getty Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House responded with empathy and compassion in the wake of the latest apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump‘s life.

The Associated Press reported: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the U.S. Secret Service agents fired at a man pointing an AK-style rifle with a scope as Trump was on the course. Bradshaw said the gunman also had two backpacks hanging on a fence and a GoPro camera, and that he was about 400 yards to 500 yards away from Trump and hiding in shrubbery while the former president played golf on a nearby hole. The person dropped the weapon and fled in an SUV, and was later taken into custody in a neighboring county. No information about the suspect was immediately released by law enforcement.

The FBI said it was investigating Sunday’s incident as an “attempted assassination,” which came less than a week after a contentious presidential debate during which Harris exposed Trump on the topics of race, healthcare, immigration, his rally sizes and much more. The debate also came a little more than two months after Trump was the target of another assassination attempt. In Butler, Pennsylvania, a suspect fired from an assault rifle and grazed Trump’s ear on July 13. That suspect was ultimately shot and killed by Secret Service agents, who were vilified for the shooting happening on their watch. This is a developing story that will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Brittany Mahomes went for a black-and-white look to support husband Patrick Mahomes at the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Cincinnati Bengals game on Sunday, suiting up in an all-Chanel ensemble. The personal trainer, 29, chose a vintage black minidress from 1997 featuring the fashion brand’s name all over it — with the style selling on the resale market for a whopping $5,499. She went for a totally logomania outfit, adding a pearl necklace with Chanel’s iconic “CC” logo and a pair of loafers ($1,360) with the brand’s name again spelled out across the tongue. Brittany, who is currently pregnant with her third child, topped the look off with a black blazer and her go-to oversized sunglasses and piled her hair up into a top knot. She shared photos on Instagram with daughter Sterling, 3, and son Bronze, 1, on the sidelines, with the former sporting a custom “Mahomes” dress and the latter his dad’s Chiefs jersey. The quarterback, 28, also went for a logomania look when he arrived at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., rocking a monogram-covered Louis Vuitton white T-shirt and holding a white backpack from the brand ($2,820). While Brittany appeared to sit separately from good friend Taylor Swift, the two were somewhat coordinated, with the pop star, 34, also choosing a vintage look. Swift, who is dating tight end Travis Kelce, showed up to the game wearing an oversized 1995 Chiefs T-shirt dress from a local Kansas City shop. There doesn’t appear to be tension between the pair despite Brittany recently “liking” Instagram comments that supported Donald Trump for president while the “Bejeweled” singer officially endorsed Kamala Harris after last week’s debate. Trump, 78, has since bashed Swift and praised Brittany, while Patrick stayed neutral when asked about the upcoming election. While the two blonds have yet to take in a football game together this season — sitting separately at last week’s Chiefs season opener against the Baltimore Ravens — they hit New York City with their men in tow, showing out at the US Open and grabbing dinner afterward.","summary":"The pregnant personal trainer wore a vintage logomania dress with matching loafers and a Chanel necklace.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/09/15/style/brittany-mahomes-wears-head-to-toe-chanel-at-chiefs-vs-bengals-game/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/89761958-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 21:58:40","author":"Melissa Minton","authors":["Melissa Minton"],"language":"en","catgory":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.477},{"id":256481380,"title":"FBI investigating apparent ‘attempted assassination’ of Donald Trump with suspect in custody","text":"The FBI said on Sunday it was investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump. In a statement, the FBI said: “The FBI has responded to West Palm Beach Florida and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former president Trump.” Law enforcement officials said during a press conference that the gunman was in some bushes near the property line of the golf course when secret service agents, who were clearing holes ahead of Mr Trump, spotted a rifle barrel in the bushes. Agents engaged the gunman and fired at least four rounds of ammunition around 5.30pm Irish time. The gunman then dropped his rifle, two backpacks and other items and fled in a black Nissan car. A witness, the sheriff said, saw the gunman and managed to take photos of his car and license plate. Authorities then sent out an alert to statewide agencies with the information on the vehicle, which led to sheriff’s deputies in neighbouring Martin County stopping and apprehending the suspect on I-95. “We have somebody in custody right now,” said Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw. The Republican presidential candidate is safe, his campaign team confirmed. Mr Trump said in a statement after the incident: “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” Mr Trump was previously injured in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on July 13th, raising questions about protection for candidates just months ahead of what looks likely to be highly contested November 5th election in which he will face off against Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris. Mr Trump had returned to Florida this weekend from a west coast tour that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. The White House said US president Joe Biden and Ms Harris had both been briefed and would be kept updated on the investigation. The White House added they were “relieved” to know Mr Trump is safe. Ms Harris, in a statement said she was “glad” Mr Trump was safe, adding that “violence has no place in America”. Mr Trump’s election running mate, Republican senator for Ohio JD Vance said in a post on X: “I’m glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits. “Still much we don’t know, but I’ll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude.” In an X post, senator Lindsey Graham, one of Mr Trump’s top congressional allies, said he had spoken with the former president after the incident and that he was in “good spirits” and was “one of the strongest people I’ve ever known”. Mr Trump often spends the morning playing golf, before having lunch at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, one of three he owns in the state. Mr Trump has had a stepped-up security footprint since the assassination attempt in July. When he has been at Trump Tower in New York, a line-up of trucks have parked in a wall outside the building. And at outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind an enclosure of bulletproof glass. Max Egusquiza, of Palm Beach, described the emergency response outside Mr Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course. “From what I saw five black unmarked SUVs blocked in a grey Mercedes in front of the golf course. There were about 20 or more cop cars flying from nearby streets,” he said. – Reuters/AP","summary":"US secret service says agents spotted rifle barrel in bushes of West Palm Beach golf club before opening fire","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/09/15/fbi-investigating-attempted-assassination-of-donald-trump-in-florida/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/BDXWGFU5AWDE7IU7O7J565AXRY.jpg?auth=fb841d96036e0a75a802e20bb645eca752ca13a4618c292d2f697f2692840cae&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 21:58:04","author":"Sun Sept","authors":["Sun Sept"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":256481010,"title":"Trump Safe as FBI Investigates Apparent 2nd Assassination Attempt","text":"“The FBI has responded to West Palm Beach Florida and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump,” the FBI told The Epoch Times in a statement.

A Secret Service agent that is stationed near of Trump while he was golfing “was able to spot this rifle barrel” and “immediately [engaged] that individual, at which time the individual took off,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told the news conference. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office in Florida said it has taken a suspect into custody that is believed to be connected to reports of shots fired in the vicinity of Trump. The identity of the individual has not been disclosed. The sheriff’s office and Martin County Sheriff William Snyder confirmed that a section of Interstate 95 was shut down, confirming to reporters that a suspect in connection to the Trump International Golf Course incident was detained. The individual, who was not identified, “was relatively calm” during the arrest, he said. He added that law enforcement also discovered an AK-47 rifle, describing it as a “very serious incident.” Federal law enforcement officials are on the scene, Snyder said. A portion of Interstate 96 near State Route 74 was shut down, the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post. “We will update this information as it becomes available,” the post said. The former president’s campaign said in a statement earlier Sunday that he is safe, which was later echoed by the U.S. Secret Service. No injures were reported, law enforcement officials said. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating and that the incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m. “The former president is safe,” it said. Trump had returned to Florida this weekend from a West Coast swing that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. As of press time, he has not issued a statement on the matter on his social media website, Truth Social.

Law enforcement held a press conference in West Palm Beach on Sunday after the FBI announced it is investigating a second assassination attempt against Donald Trump in just two months. The former president was rushed to safety on Sunday after multiple shots were fired in his vicinity while he was playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach. A suspected gunman is in custody after the terrifying incident at Trump International Club almost exactly two months after a gunman tried to take out Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Officials said U.S. Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of the bushes two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing on Sunday, prompting the agents to fire at the suspect. The suspect ran into his vehicle from the brush, but was spotted by a witness who snapped a picture of his vehicle and license plate. Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters that the witness was able to share the plate and later identify the suspect as who he saw fleeing the scene. Trump confirmed in a statement about an hour after the incident that he is ‘safe and well’ and didn’t want rumors to ‘start spiraling out of control.’ The 2024 Republican nominee’s bulked up Secret Service advance team spotted the shooter in the tree lines just two holes from where Trump was golfing. The FBI now says two hours after the incident that the attack ‘appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.’ The armed suspect was posted up outside the club around the 5th and 6th hole, which a source familiar with the incident told DailyMail.com is a ‘vulnerable’ area of the course. Sheriff Bradshaw detailed that the suspected assassin was wielding an ‘AK-47 style weapon with a scope’, which was recovered at the scene. So was a backpack and GoPro camera, which Sheriff Bradshaw revealed in images of where the suspect was set-up in the bushes along the fencing of Trump’s golf club. The area where the suspect was first spotted by his security detail was two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing at the time of gunshots, causing the individual to flee. Undergrowth is cut back in this area every summer and is one of the parts of the course closest to the road. The incident comes as Trump’s security detail has been ramped up in the two months after the former president was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Trump’s golf club is just five miles from his residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach and is where the former president is often spotted golfing when he is not on the campaign trail. Real estate investor and New York City landlord Steve Witkoff was Trump’s golfing buddy on Sunday, sources told DailyMail.com. The Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department held a press conference Sunday afternoon to provide updates on the shooting and revealed images of the suspect’s backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 rifle left at the scene. ‘Nothing will slow me down,’ Trump wrote in a statement. ‘I will NEVER SURRENDER!’ President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are aware of the shooting and ‘relieved’ he is not harmed. ‘The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,’ according to the White House. ‘They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.’ Harris, who just met Trump for the first time in person at their debate on Tuesday, responded to the shooting with a statement sharing the platitude: ‘Violence has no place in America.’ ‘I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,’ she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. United States Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X: ‘The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m.’ ‘The former president is safe,’ he assured, adding that the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office will follow up with more details about the incident. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke with Trump moments after news broke. ‘He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known,’ the senator wrote on X. ‘He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.’ It is still unclear how many people were involved in Sunday’s shooting and whether they were targeting the former president. It is also still not known if the suspect ever fired his gun or if the gunshots came from the agents who took aim at the alleged threat. But just the report of shots near Trump raises eyebrows as multiple investigations are ongoing into the shooting in Pennsylvania earlier this summer that left two dead, including the shooter, and two critically injured. Trump walked away from the assassination attempt with just a bloody ear that could have been a fatal shot had it been a few millimeters different and struck his head. But would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service before he was able to get in another shot at the former president. Initial canvassing led to authorities discovering his car near the rally site in Butler with explosives and his parent’s home with even more bombs. Congressional and other local and federal investigations are ongoing to discover what led to the failures that allowed a shooter to get just a few hundred feet away from Trump with an AR-15 rifle. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) is on the House Task Force on the assassination attempt. He said on Sunday that this proves the attack was not an ‘isolated incident’ and demanded the Secret Service brief the task force this week. ‘As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,’ Waltz wrote on X.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNew images reveal the backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 style rifle that&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FBI releases photos of gun, bag, and camera hidden by &#8216;assassin&#8217; in bushes near Trump&#8217;s Florida golf course first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/fbi-releases-photos-of-gun-bag-and-camera-hidden-by-assassin-in-bushes-near-trumps-florida-golf-course/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/15/22/89704549-13853475-image-a-53_1726435788281.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 21:49:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.476},{"id":256480358,"title":"FBI confirm gunman shot after Donald Trump 'second assassination attempt' in Florida","text":"US Secret Service agents have shot a gunman at Donald Trump's Florida golf course in what the FBI is calling a second assassination attempt. Trump was swiftly taken to safety after agents opened fire on a man spotted with what appeared to be a gun while the former president was on the course, according to law enforcement sources. The FBI has confirmed that the incident, which occurred around 2pm local time at the West Palm Beach golf club, was an apparent assassination attempt, reports the Mirror. Just nine weeks after surviving a similar attack, Trump was reportedly moved to a secure room as the Secret Service engaged a suspect who attempted to push the barrel of a gun through a fence aimed at the Republican presidential nominee. \"President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity. No further details at this time,\" Steven Cheung wrote in a statement posted on the X account @TrumpWarRoom, one of Trump's official campaign outlets. The suspect fled in an SUV but was later apprehended, officials confirmed. An AK-style firearm was recovered at the scene. As Trump played golf, the course was partially shut down, with Secret Service agents positioned a few holes ahead when they spotted an individual with a firearm, officials reported. Several areas around the course’s perimeter allow golfers to be visible from the fence line. Secret Service agents, along with officers in golf carts and on ATVs, typically secure the area several holes ahead and behind Trump during his games. An armored vehicle is also brought onto the course to quickly protect him in case of a threat. Donald Trump Jr. posted on X: \"Once again, folks! SHOTS FIRED at Trump Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Local law enforcement found an AK-47 in the bushes. The Trump campaign has confirmed former President Trump is safe. A suspect has reportedly been apprehended.\" The Martin County Sheriff's Office announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that they had stopped a vehicle on northbound Interstate 95 and taken a suspect into custody believed to be connected to the shooting. Sheriff William Snyder stated that police surrounded the car after forcing it off the road, and the man was arrested without incident. Sheriff Snyder noted the suspect remained calm and unemotional during the arrest, not questioning why he was being stopped. \"He never asked, 'What is this about?' Despite law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, and a lot going on, he never questioned it,\" Snyder said. The sheriff's office said it made the stop after authorities in neighbouring Palm Beach County put out a \"be on the lookout\" alert. Photos included in the post showed an SUV stopped behind multiple law enforcement vehicles. The post by the Martin County Sheriff's Office indicated the suspect was apprehended near Palm City, Florida, about a 45-mile drive north of Trump's golf course. Northbound lanes of I-95 were shut down, the sheriff's office said. In an email to supporters, Trump said: \"There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!\" US Senator Lindsey Graham wrote on X: \"Just spoke with President Trump. He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known. He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.\" Max Egusquiza, of Palm Beach, describing the emergency response outside the golf course, said: \"From what I saw five black unmarked SUVs blocked in a grey Mercedes in front of the golf course. There were about 20 or more cop cars flying from nearby streets,\" he said. Trump had returned to Florida this weekend from the US West Coast that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. His campaign had not advised Trump's plans for Sunday but he often spends the morning playing golf, before having lunch at the club, one of three he owns in the state. Since the assassination attempt in July, former President Trump has significantly increased his security measures. At Trump Tower in New York, a barricade of garbage trucks is set up outside, and at outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind bulletproof glass. Following the recent incident, Trump was safely returned to his private Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, according to a source familiar with the situation. The White House confirmed that both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had been briefed and would continue receiving updates. The White House expressed relief that Trump is safe, with Harris adding in a statement, \"Violence has no place in America,\" and that she was \"glad\" Trump was unharmed. Trump is scheduled to speak about cryptocurrency Monday night on X to promote his sons' new crypto platform. He is expected to do so from Mar-a-Lago. On Tuesday, Trump will return to the campaign trail with a town hall in Flint, Michigan, alongside former press secretary and current Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. This will be followed by a campaign rally in Long Island, New York, on Wednesday.
