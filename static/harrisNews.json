Federal authorities arrested 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr. in December, accusing him of planting the explosives.\n\nRepublicans have long argued that the pipe bomb investigation was sidelined while Democrats focused their attention on President Donald Trump and his supporters. More than 1,500 arrests of protesters were made during the four years of former President Joe Biden‘s term, including two federal criminal cases levied against Trump, all while the pipe bomber case remained unsolved.\n\n“The obsession with persecuting Trump supporters left no institutional impetus to get to the bottom of the pipe bomber mystery,” said witness John Nantz, a retired FBI special agent who now appears frequently in conservative media. \n\nDuring questioning by Loudermilk, Nantz went as far as to claim it was “likely” that the FBI knew Cole’s identity far earlier than the December arrest, pointing to cellphone data, license plate reader information, and financial records. He argued that leadership under then-Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray may have influenced investigative priorities.\n\nWatch as a 20 year veteran of the @FBI with a background in counter intelligence gives his opinion on whether or not he believes Wray's FBI identified the suspected pipe bomber. pic.twitter.com/roWkDTvfTB— Select Subcommittee on January 6th (@J6Select) January 14, 2026\n\n“I don’t think it’s just plausible,” Nantz said. “I think it’s likely.”\n\nSeveral Democrats on the committee countered that the hearing was premature, given the ongoing prosecution.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the ranking member of the eight-member panel and a former member of the original Jan. 6 select committee, called Cole’s arrest a “rare bright spot for federal law enforcement” under the Trump administration but said the GOP-led hearing risked interfering with an active criminal case.\n\nDespite the narrow topic, much of the hearing was devoted to a broader relitigation of Jan. 6 itself, including the legitimacy of the previous select committee, the conduct of federal agencies, and the delayed deployment of the D.C. National Guard.\n\nRep. Raskin: “There are some lingering questions. Most of them could be answered by Donald Trump, who’s never once testified under oath about what he did on January 6th, other than sit on his hands…while he watched the whole scene unfold on TV.” pic.twitter.com/c8U6yglXs1— The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) January 14, 2026\n\n“There are some lingering questions — most of them could be answered by Donald Trump, who’s never once testified under oath about what he did on Jan. 6,” Raskin said. “The truth is a resilient thing. We’re not going to put up with a pack of lies in this subcommittee and a bunch of conspiracy theories.”\n\nFormer DOJ attorney Michael Romano, who prosecuted Jan. 6 rioter cases, testified that some protesters had planned in advance to disrupt Congress, citing evidence such as an “Occupy Congress” image circulating before the attack. Romano also criticized claims promoted by the White House and conservative outlets that Capitol Police instigated the violence.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) attacked the legitimacy of the original Jan. 6 select committee, noting that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s Republican appointees — a move that led McCarthy to withdraw all GOP selections and left the panel without any Republican-appointed members.\n\n“The previous select committee established by Speaker Pelosi was a sham from the start,” Nehls said. “It was a total sham.”\n\nThe hearing drew an audience deeply tied to Jan. 6 controversies. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence was commuted by Trump, sat in a reserved front-row section alongside Ivan Raiklin, a right-wing activist who supports Jan. 6 defendants. \n\nAt one point, Raiklin held up a piece of paper bearing the name of a Capitol Police officer previously accused by a conservative outlet of planting the pipe bombs.\n\nLegally, morally, and ethically.tune into https://t.co/ISoQ7doJ0Z now! pic.twitter.com/kxz8PZDbJc— Ivan Raiklin (@IvanRaiklin) January 14, 2026\n\nAlso present was Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer while attempting to enter the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who is not a member of the subcommittee, observed the hearing and later said he remained unconvinced that the FBI had arrested the correct suspect in the pipe bomb case.\n\n“I was hoping to learn more details about the pipe bomb,” Massie said. “I think they’re going to just try to sweep this under the rug and say we got our guy and move on.”\n\nRaskin, meanwhile, raised the political implications of Cole’s prosecution, repeatedly highlighting Cole’s support for Trump and questioning whether Trump’s sweeping pardon for Jan. 6-related offenses could apply to the pipe bomb defendant if he is convicted.\n\n“Is it their position that the pardon extends to Mr. Cole?” Raskin asked, calling the possibility “unprecedented” and “corrupt.”\n\nDC PIPE BOMB SUSPECT SAYS HE SHOULD BE COVERED BY TRUMP JAN. 6 PARDON\n\nRaskin’s remarks come just days after Cole’s attorneys spoke to Fox 5 DC, indicating they plan to challenge the indictment against their client in novel ways, including by arguing that Trump’s broad pardon of the Jan. 6 protesters should apply to him.\n\nCole is still in the early stages of his criminal case and is fighting to obtain pretrial supervised release with his grandmother after a magistrate judge sided with prosecutors over their effort to keep him behind bars pending the trial.

Multiple federal courts have rejected parts of the order, including in a decision last week in Oregon.\n\nThe Trump administration is also suing 23, mostly Democrat-led states, as part of a separate DOJ effort to obtain sensitive voting data, a campaign that has set off alarm bells for privacy experts and Democratic lawmakers, who fear such information could be fed into the Trump administration’s deportation regime. \n\nThe president has used claims of fraudulent voting activity to justify his military-style crackdowns on mostly Democratic-led cities.\n\n“These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,” Trump wrote in a June post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump ally Elon Musk has sounded a similar note.\n\n“By using entitlements fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants,” Musk said in March on Sen. Ted Cruz’s podcast. “And buy voters. Basically, bring in 10, 20 million people who are beholden to the Democrats for government handouts and will vote overwhelmingly Democrat, as has been demonstrated in California.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump and JD Vance often claimed the Democratic Party was in league with non-citizen voters to fraudulently sway elections.\n\n\"A lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,\" Trump said in September during one of the presidential debates. \"They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in, practically.\"\n\n“When [Kamala Harris] let in millions of illegal aliens,” Vance told a rally in Michigan that August. “It made our communities less safe — but it did give the Democrats a lot of voters.”","summary":"States that voluntarily submitted data to a federal program learned there was not evidence of the kind of widespread non-citizen voting Trump frequently claims is occurring","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-immigrant-voter-fraud-data-b2900801.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/14/20/Trump_29699.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Iv8uDvvV-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:33:01","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":392975858,"title":"AOC’s bill to ban deepfake AI porn passed the Senate. What’s taking the House so long?","text":"On Tuesday, the Senate did something it rarely does: it passed legislation by unanimous consent. The DEFIANCE Act was inoffensive enough: a bill to ban nonconsensual deepfake sexually explicit images. \n\nMoreover, the bill was introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). It’s the latest sign that the lawmaker has grown her influence in a legislative body that once dismissed her as a firebrand but in which she’s now a power broker. \n\nThe idea of banning sexually explicit deepfake images without a person’s consent gained massive steam amid the proliferation of nonconsensual images of women and even underage girls on X via Grok, its in-house AI tool. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer warned its owner, Elon Musk, that it would take “fast action” to deal with the nonconsensual images. Indonesia and Malaysia become the first two countries to block Grok. \n\nAnd Ocasio-Cortez has some ostensible support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who voiced some support for the bill. \n\n“I'm certainly in favor of it,” Johnson told The Independent. “We've got to find the vote tally, but that should be a big bipartisan concern. We need to protect children online, and we need to stop these abuses. Is terrible. It's horrible.”\n\nAll of this would seem encouraging if the Senate had not passed the DEFIANCE Act during the last Congress, before it died in the House of Representatives. \n\n“I've spoken with Speaker Johnson. At that point, it's just about having those conversations to ensure that the legislation moves,” Ocasio-Cortez told The Independent. \n\nMusk remains an influential money man despite his rapid fall from grace in Trump world last year after running the Department of Government Efficiency and his venom toward President Donald Trump. \n\nThe two seem to have patched things up and Musk pledged to throw his support behind Republicans on New Year’s Day because “America is toast if the radical left wins.”\n\nAnd in December, the Pentagon announced that it would add Grok to its “AI arsenal.” \n\nOcasio-Cortez said she was not surprised by this.\n\n“I mean, they’re in business together,” she told The Independent. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean the legislation doesn’t have allies in the House, even from unexpected places. Rep. Nancy Mace, the anti-trans MAGA Republican candidate for governor of South Carolina, told The Independent she supports the bill.\n\n“I just had to have a Grok AI-generated image taken down,” she said. “It was sexually explicit, in my opinion, and disgusting.”\n\nAt the same time, Mace said that the problem did not stem from the technology. \n\n“It's the human who's prompting the technology to make these types of deep fakes,” she told The Independent. \n\n“I mean, I'm all over this sort of thing,” she said. “I've sponsored my own bills. I'm co sponsor of other bills. Like, we need to be moving fast on this.”\n\nThe legislation is a sign of how Ocasio-Cortez, who came to Washington after she knocked off House Democratic Chairman Joe Crowley in a surprise primary victory in 2018, has become a power broker and a leading messenger. \n\nDespite her ability to generate media headlines and earn the moniker “AOC,” she faced significant opposition from Democratic leadership. \n\nToward the end of Joe Biden’s presidency, she attempted to run for the ranking member spot on the House Oversight Committee, only to get bumped for a more senior member who ended up dying months into his tenure. \n\nBut she might have won the long-term war, given she joined the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which regulates two policies that matter to her: health care and renewable energy. Her endorsement of Zohran Mamdani played a major role in his victory in the New York mayoral primary last year. \n\nAnd it’s no longer just progressives who see her prowess. Kamala Harris praised Ocasio-Cortez in her memoir 107 Days and Ocasio-Cortez now sends out fundraisers for moderate Democratic campaigns like Abigail Spanberger’s run for governor of Virginia and Mary Peltola’s run for Alaska’s Senate seat, who might have shied away from her in the past.\n\nShe’s also become one of the most influential Democrats in terms of responding to Trump’s immigration crackdown. \n\n“I want everyone to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this,” she told The Independent on Monday. “Understand how these dots connect. You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.”\n\nBy Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee’s X account blasted out her response.","summary":"The bill is a sign of Ocasio-Cortez’s growing influence within the Democratic caucus that once shunned her, writes Eric Garcia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/aoc-deepfake-ai-porn-house-b2900788.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/14/22/34/GettyImages-2213616598.jpg?crop=6091,4060.7,x0,y1.2&trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KPYamWej-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:28:38","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":392975860,"title":"Trump’s approval with Gen Z has dropped a massive 42 points in the past year, polling finds","text":"President Donald Trump’s approval rating among Gen Z has dropped a massive 42 points in the past year, new polling has found. \n\nTrump won over more young voters in the 2024 election than in his two previous runs for president, helping him return to the White House. But nearly a year into Trump’s second presidency, Gen Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, are turning on him.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten announced shocking results from new polling, which showed Trump’s net approval rating among Gen Z at negative 32 percentage points. That is a huge dip from his plus-10 net approval rating with young people in February 2025, shortly after the start of his second term. \n\nEnten said Trump was “falling off that cliff” among Gen Z.\n\n“My goodness gracious. This is, I said, a very swinging group and it has swung very much away from Donald John Trump,” the data guru said.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Trump had 42 percent of the vote among Americans born between the 1990s and 2000s in the 2024 election. While this was still 13 percentage points lower than his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, he did better with this cohort than in previous years. \n\nIn his 2020 race against former President Joe Biden, Trump only got 35 percent of the vote among this cohort, and when he was up against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, he received just 25 percent. \n\nOne major issue that concerns Gen Z, like many other Americans, is the cost of living. Trump’s approval rating on the economy, one of the main issues he campaigned on during the 2024 election, has sunk. \n\nAn AP-NORC poll from last December found 67 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, while just 31 percent approve. This gap was smaller in March, when 58 percent of people disapproved of the president’s job on the economy and 40 percent approved. \n\nDespite the polling, Trump bragged about the state of the economy during an annual appearance before the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. The president said the U.S. had experienced “the strongest and fastest economic turnaround in our country's history.”\n\nInflation held steady in December at 2.7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, but grocery prices remained high. Home sales in 2025 remained at a 30-year low amid high prices and mortgage rates, the Associated Press reported.","summary":"Trump won over more young voters in the 2024 election than in his two previous runs for president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-approval-rating-gen-z-poll-b2900776.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/14/22/26/GettyImages-2255277125.jpg?crop=5397,3598,x0,y1&trim=0,0,2,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V4GSdEB7-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-14 23:29:42","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":392912550,"title":"JD Vance&#039;s Chances of Beating Harris, Newsom in 2028 Election: Poll","text":"Vice President JD Vance leads Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom but trails former Vice President Kamala Harris in a potential 2028 presidential election matchup, according to a new poll from Zogby Analytics. Why It Matters As anticipation of the 2028 U.S. presidential election grows, early polls and betting odds signal a potentially fierce competition between Vance, Harris, Newsom and other top contenders. These preliminary surveys offer insight into evolving voter sentiment, candidate recognition and potential outcomes, even as most major candidates have yet to formally launch their campaigns. The competitive landscape may reflect party dynamics following President Donald Trump’s 2024 victory and a national search for new leadership, with many Americans reportedly undecided on their 2028 preference. What To Know The poll shows Vance with 42.1 percent of the potential vote compared to Harris' 48.5 percent, with 9.4 percent not sure. The survey also shows in a potential head-to-head with Newsom, Vance has 44.6 percent of the vote compared to Newsom's 41 percent, and 14.3 percent are not sure. The poll surveyed 891 likely voters in the U.S. from January 1 to January 7 and has a margin of error of 3.3 percent. The poll also surveyed likely voters on a potential matchup between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Newsom, Harris and Pennsylvania Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro. Newsom leads Rubio in the hypothetical race, 41.7 percent to 39.9 percent, with 18.4 percent of voters not sure. Rubio holds a slight lead over Shapiro, with 35.9 percent versus 35.3 percent, and 28.9 percent not sure. Harris is narrowly ahead of Rubio, 43.4 percent to 43.1 percent, the poll shows, with 13.5 percent of likely voters not sure. Another recent poll by CNN in December shows Newsom and Vance leading the top of the ticket for their respective parties as potential 2028 candidates. What People Are Saying Columbia University professor Robert Y. Shapiro, to Newsweek on Wednesday: “It is much too early to be comparing Democratic versus Republican candidates in the 2028 general election. What is interesting though too far from determinative is how Vance fares against Rubio for the Republican party nomination, since Trump has cited both of them as possible successors. Both surely want the nomination, as had Biden and Clinton as the possible successors to Obama. In that case Obama supported Clinton and not his Vice President. We see a comparable match-up now for the Republican nominations. Will Trump forsake his own Vice President as Obama did?“ Trump, in August when asked if Vance is the successor to MAGA: “Well, I think most likely in all fairness, he's the vice president. I think Marco [Rubio] is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form. I also think we have incredible people, some of the people on the stage right here, so it's too early obviously to talk about it but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point.“ What Happens Next The 2028 presidential race remains fluid, with major contenders on both sides yet to declare their intentions officially. Historically, most candidates announce their bids after the midterms, when the political landscape becomes clearer. Vice President JD Vance speaks on the final day of Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest conference at the Phoenix Convention Center on December 21, 2025, in Phoenix, Arizona.

The United States’ kidnapping of Nicolás Maduro and occupation of Venezuela. The Iranian regime’s brutal massacres of thousands of citizen protesters. Minneapolis’ rallies against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents occupying the city after killing Renee Nicole Good. Yet, Dokoupil added, CBS had also “walked into not one, but two exclusive newsmaking conversations” on Tuesday, citing the episode’s preceding segments with GM CEO Mary Barra and, for an interview that was much lengthier and had earned more advance hype, President Donald Trump.\n\n“You may not agree with everything you hear on this broadcast, but we trust you to listen, and we trust you to decide for yourself,” Dokoupil concluded, parroting a favorite line of his before previewing the next stop of his 10-cities-in-10-days editorial excursion: the great city of Chicago, which he would be flying to via a corporate-chartered private jet.\n\nIndeed, if this Detroit stop offered any clue as to how the rest of the tour will go, it’s likely to live up to CBS’ initial promise to grant the Evening News’ upstart anchor an opportunity to “meet Americans face to face.” Tuesday night’s episode was dominated by Trump, who stood for his talk with Dokoupil amid the din of the GM factory, taking up nearly half of the half-hour broadcast. The CBS host merely alluded to conversations he’d had with plant staffers and other Detroiters, but none were shown or given due credit on camera. (Not even the autoworker who’d called Trump a “pedophile protector” earlier that day, earning both the president’s middle finger and a company suspension in response.) The “newsmaking” prowess of the chat—which saw Trump boast about “no inflation” and “ending eight wars” sans pushback from the interviewer—manifested primarily in headlines about how much time Trump took up, how uneventful the interview was (in spite of Dokoupil’s pledges to “ask the questions that weren’t being asked before”), and how Trump managed to get in a jab at Dokoupil about the reason he’s even here. (“If [Kamala Harris] got in, you probably wouldn’t have a job right now. Your boss, who’s an amazing guy, might be bust.” Perhaps the most truthful thing Trump said that day!)\n\nNot the most ideal takeaways from a segment where Dokoupil clearly wanted to get one particular confirmation from Trump: whether the U.S. would “get involved if Iran started killing protesters.” Horrific and barbaric as the carnage fostered by the regime has been, Dokoupil’s ethos of supposedly speaking for everyday Americans was belied by this push for “involvement,” considering that an overwhelming majority of U.S. residents do not want their country to take military action against Iran, even in light of the mass slaughter of Iranian citizens. Something even odder: During his closing monologue, Dokoupil vaguely cited “reports” that “as many as 12,000 protesters have been killed by Iran’s government and as Trump weighs intervention.” The primary report in question delivering this shocking figure is … CBS News itself, in an article whose authors admit they have “not been able to independently verify the massive death toll indicated by the source,” and which repeatedly presses a case for U.S. “action” in Iran. (Activists within the country, along with a U.S.-based human rights group, have estimated a death toll of at least 2,500—still a morbid and record-breaking number, but nowhere near the CBS figure.)\n\nIn fairness to Tony, this wasn’t the end of dubious reporting affixed with the imprimatur of the broadcaster’s brand. On Wednesday, CBS News’ official social media accounts posted a “BREAKING” update that the ICE agent who’d killed Renee Nicole Good had “suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident”—even though Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that he’d been “spending time with family” soon after a reported hospital visit.\n\nIf one thing has become clear at this point, it’s that you can’t expect any editorial improvement, or solid journalistic value, at Bari Weiss’ CBS News. As my colleague Derreck Johnson pointed out on social media, Weiss had personally seen to it that 60 Minutes should drop its much more elaborate, fact-checked report on the El Salvador gulag where the Trump administration illegally renditioned many immigrants—yet this anonymous, thin story for an ICE agent’s “internal bleeding” gets approved straightaway. (See also: the dropped 60 Minutes segment from veteran Anderson Cooper regarding Trump’s exclusive asylum welcome for Afrikaner “refugees.”) The Free Press, the ostensibly “completely editorial independent” website that’s also owned by Paramount-Skydance, ran a rant from Weiss’ wife defending the decision to drop the El Salvador piece.\n\nThe CBS News EIC’s recent memo to her staff, delivered on the eve of Dokoupil’s cross-country tour, laid out that she expects less for her outfit to “deliver the news” than to “*be the news*” through segments with “viral potential.” Setting aside the moral bankruptcy inherent to running a public service whose focus is intended to be all about itself, the only “viral potential” stems from the extent of Weiss’ efforts to give CBS a far more journalistically shaky ethos. At Sunday’s Golden Globes, host Nikki Glaser made a quip about the channel as “BS News” right in front of Paramount-Skydance CEO David Ellison. The legendary David Letterman, who started the Late Show franchise that was very likely canceled last year in order to make the Paramount-Skydance merger happen, eviscerated CBS News’ new leadership for “trampling” and “pissing on” the “integrity of CBS News.” George Clooney called out Weiss for “dismantling CBS News as we speak,” eliciting only a weak clapback from the EIC in response as she invited the actor to visit the studio.\n\nTo quote Sky Ferreira, everything is embarrassing. CBS hoped a “Whiskey Fridays” setup for Tony Dokoupil would earn a sponsorship from Jack Daniel’s, only for the liquor’s parent company to flatly deny that it would ever do such a thing. The stumbling and bumbling that characterized Dokoupil’s first day at CBS Evening News reportedly happened in part because Weiss was revising the script up until it was time to broadcast—keeping with her purported affinity for late-night-editing Free Press staffers’ pieces to her liking. (Per a former Wall Street Journal contributor, Weiss also tended to rewrite bits of book reviews when she worked there as an editor, in a manner that gelled with her ideological preferences.) And if you thought Dokoupil’s Tuesday interview with Trump was strange enough, take a look at the way CBS “sanewashed” the president when he spoke with 60 Minutes (post–Paramount merger approval) in November.\n\nMeanwhile, ratings have not been swell for CBS Evening News, Weiss’ first “town hall,” or even for the heralded 60 Minutes. But a Canadian rip of the yanked 60 Minutes El Salvador segment racked up some hefty viewership online, as have articles about all the leaks from infuriated CBS News staffers.

In a Dec. 26 text exchange, he allegedly told his date that Vance would be traveling to Ohio for a few days before heading to Florida the following weekend. \n\nHe also sent photographs from inside secure locations—including images taken aboard Air Force Two—along with messages indicating when the vice president would be landing.\n\nOne of the most serious breaches involved a photo Escotto sent of the vice president’s motorcade during an overseas trip, including an image showing President Donald Trump’s convoy at Emirates Palace during a visit with United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Multiple images Escotto shared also contained location metadata, including one showing the exact location of the presidential helicopter at JFK Airport.\n\nThose actions appear to directly violate the Secret Service’s code of conduct, which states that employees may not divulge classified or sensitive information related to protective operations.\n\nFollowing the release of the video, U.S. Secret Service Deputy Director Matthew Quinn told The Daily Beast that Escotto’s security clearance had been revoked and that he had been suspended from access to secure facilities and systems pending an internal investigation.\n\n“The U.S. Secret Service has no tolerance for any behavior that could potentially compromise the safety, privacy, or trust of our protectees,” Quinn said in a statement. He added that Escotto had been placed on administrative leave and that all personnel will be required to retake the mandatory anti-espionage training.\n\nThe video also showed Escotto expressing personal political opinions that went well beyond professional boundaries. Escotto, who worked as a Secret Service agent for former Vice President Kamala Harris, told the undercover reporter that he voted for Joe Biden and voiced hostility toward the current administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.\n\n“I hate that sh-t,” he said, referring to ICE raids under President Trump. “I don’t understand why they’re covering their face,” he added, saying he did not agree with the tactics being deployed by the agency.\n\nEscotto also complained about assignments involving the vice president’s children, telling the reporter that agents “go to school with them” and “follow them everywhere.” He joked that he felt more like a “babysitter,” adding that agents sometimes ask, “What the f— is this?”\n\nIn another exchange shown in the video, Escotto texted the reporter updates on his movements—including going from the West Wing to pick up the vice president’s wife at a location redacted by O’Keefe to avoid further security risks. Escotto ended the revealing message with a laughing emoji. \n\nQuinn apologized directly to the Vance family in a statement, calling the incident a “violation of their trust and privacy.”\n\n“The faith our protectees place in this agency is not something the U.S. Secret Service takes lightly,” Quinn said. “We are committed to taking the necessary actions to ensure that a similar breach does not occur again.”","summary":"Alex Wong / Getty ImagesVice President JD Vance is changing up his Secret Service detail after one of his agents was caught spilling sensitive security information with a Tinder date who turned out to be an undercover reporter.\n\nThe agent, Tomas Escotto, was placed on administrative leave on Wednesday after a 14-minute undercover video published by reporter James O’Keefe showed the agent casually divulging details about the Vice President’s travel plans and internal shift operations.\n\nO’Keefe said the woman Escotto met through the dating app Tinder in October was working undercover for O’Keefe Media Group.

But at one point Trump derailed the interview to insist that Dokoupil likely wouldn't be helming the news show if not for his big victory.\n\n \"Tony, we have now the hottest country in the world. A year and a half ago, our country was dead,\" Trump told the anchor, referring to his predecessor Joe Biden's presidency. \"We had a dead country. You wouldn't have a job right now.\"\n\n \"If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now,\" he reiterated. \"Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?\"\n\n Dokoupil, who seemed confused by the president's remarks, asked him to clarify.\n\n \"That's how bad — might be bust,\" the president continued. \"I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn't have this job. You wouldn't have this job, certainly whatever the hell they're paying you.\"\n\n Trump's words alluded to Larry Ellison, a friend of the president and one of the world's richest people, whose family now controls CBS after acquiring its parent company, Paramount Global, last year.\n\n Since taking possession of the network, the Ellison family has gotten flack for implementing sweeping changes, including hiring controversial former New York Times journalist Bari Weiss to overhaul CBS News. Weiss, who was named editor-in-chief in October 2025 despite having no broadcast experience, has since faced criticism accusing her of deference to the Trump administration. Amid several programming changes, Weiss tapped Dokoupil to step up as a new anchor for CBS Evening News.\n\n Towards the end of his Tuesday conversation with Trump, Dokoupil pushed back on the president's claims, responding, \"For the record, I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.\"\n\n Trump retorted, \"Yeah, but at a lesser salary.\"\n\n Dokoupil's interview with the president comes amid his travels across the U.S., where he has been visiting major cities in his first month as the CBS Evening News anchor. Dokoupil has had a rocky start in his new position, including having an on-air flub during his very first broadcast.\n\n Hanging over Dokoupil's appointment is Trump's complicated history with CBS. Last year, Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The outcome of the legal dispute has sparked concerns about the precedent Paramount has set for media companies giving in to the demands of the president.\n\n Another concerning development soon followed. A month before the Paramount-Skydance merger took place, the Late Show franchise was canceled after 33 years on the air. Its host, Stephen Colbert, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration. Though CBS insisted that the cancellation was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" skeptics have blasted the move as a conciliatory effort at appeasing Trump's FCC in the midst of the merger.\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n Such criticisms were clearly on Dokoupil's mind before he signed on to his new role. In his recent New Year's Day message at the start of Evening News, the anchor asked its audience to hold him and the legendary CBS show to high journalistic standards.\n\n \"Today and every time you see me in this chair: You come first,\" Dokoupil said. \"Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS.

Clayton County, a case about whether a federal civil rights law that prohibits employment discrimination based on “sex” extends to gay and transgender Americans too.\n\nOn paper, right-wing culture warriors had good reason to be optimistic that the court’s answer would be no. A year earlier, President Donald Trump had replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who occasionally sided with the liberals in cases about LGBTQ+ rights, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative with a track record of adopting the movement’s preferred positions when it mattered most. His confirmation gave the right what it had sought for decades: the five Supreme Court votes necessary to turn its policy agenda into binding precedent.\n\nEight months later, though, a six-justice majority of the court held that federal employment protections indeed protect trans people in the workplace. The basic logic of Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion in Bostock, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberals joined, is that if an employer treats a transgender man differently than it would treat a man assigned male at birth, the workplace is treating that trans man differently “because of sex.”\n\nConservative types who had expected Kavanaugh’s confirmation to pay immediate dividends promptly lost their minds. In a dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito called the majority’s argument “deceptive” and its conclusion “preposterous.” One conservative activist accused Gorsuch of abandoning textualism and succumbing to pressure from “college campuses and editorial boards”; another compared Bostock to Dred Scott, the 1857 Supreme Court case that denied citizenship to Black Americans and more or less started the Civil War. In a somber speech on the Senate floor, Missouri Republican Josh Hawley declared that the decision heralded “the end of the conservative legal movement.”\n\nBostock felt like ancient history on Tuesday morning, when the court heard oral argument in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. BPJ, two cases about state laws that ban trans women and girls from playing on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This time, the members of the court’s conservative bloc sounded far more comfortable with imposing some limits on legal protections for trans people. In an exchange with West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams, Roberts sought to distinguish these cases from Bostock, asserting that a “sex-based classification” about sports eligibility might not “necessarily” implicate transgender status, and thus might not be discriminatory at all. Williams, realizing he was getting good news from a justice whose vote he needed, had the sense to quickly agree.\n\nAfter Roberts, counting to five gets easy. Last year, in a different case about trans rights, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a concurrence, joined by Alito and Thomas, in which she opined that trans people are probably not a “suspect class” for purposes of equal protection and that trans sports bans are thus likely constitutional. Kavanaugh, another Bostock dissenter, did not join Barrett’s opinion, but his questions at oral argument in Hecox and BPJ suggest that he is willing to give states some flexibility in the name of preserving the sanctity of women’s sports. Even if—and this is a huge if—Gorsuch were to stick to the logic of Bostock, the conservatives still have the votes to allow lawmakers to legislate their trans constituents out of existence.\n\nThe shift from the court’s approach in Bostock has less to do with substantive legal issues than with the evolving social and political context in which the justices will decide these cases. Bostock came five years after the court’s landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, in which the justices held that the Constitution protects the right of same-sex couples to marry. Although conservatives mourned that case in the same way that they would mourn Bostock, Obergefell was consistent with established trends in public opinion: A month before the court decided the case, Gallup found that 60 percent of Americans supported marriage equality—an all-time high, and up from just 27 percent two decades earlier.\n\nIn the wake of Obergefell, legal protections for trans people seemed, for a moment, as if they might be on the same trajectory. North Carolina’s “bathroom bill,” which Republicans passed in March 2016, was an economic and public relations disaster that cost the state thousands of jobs, billions in investment and tax revenue, and the privilege of hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. In a 2017 survey, about 70 percent of respondents said the country was becoming “more tolerant” of transgender people, and slightly more than 50 percent wanted the government to “do more to support and protect” them. To anyone whose brain was not pickled in right-wing media, Bostock was not some outrageous act of judicial overreach, but a simple, overdue acknowledgment of what most people believed that the law required.\n\nThe right responded as it has always responded to threats to its cultural relevance: by redoubling its efforts to incite a moral panic, vilifying trans people as dangerous and anti-woman. Since 2021, state lawmakers have introduced more than 2,500 bills that target trans people, including more than 1,000 just last year. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump, who during his first term sought to ban trans people from serving in the military, promised more of the same if voters returned him to the White House. Attack ads in swing states contrasted Democratic nominee Kamala Harris as “for they/them” and Trump as “for you.” In October, the month before the election, Fox News aired at least 47 segments about trans athletes, up from six in September—nearly a sevenfold increase.\n\nThis steady drumbeat of transphobic agitprop was maybe even more successful than its proponents had hoped. Today fundamental legal protections for trans people—the same protections the conservative-controlled court extended in Bostock—are less popular than they were three years ago, according to Pew Research Center data from February 2024. This is true among not only Republican voters but also Democrats looking to apportion blame for Harris’ loss. In the aftermath of the 2024 election, some Democratic politicians publicly argued that the party’s support for trans rights had contributed to its losses at the ballot box. One Democratic member of Congress went so far as to parrot vile anti-trans talking points to the New York Times, explaining that he did not “want to discriminate against anybody” but did not believe that “biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports.”\n\nBack in 2018, YouGov found that 29 percent of Americans thought that society had gone “too far in accepting people who are transgender.” Today that number has increased to 36 percent. Support for explicitly anti-trans policies like bathroom bans, sports bans, and bans on gender-affirming care for young people is stronger than it was as recently as two years ago. Sports bans like those at issue in Hecox and BPJ are especially popular, supported by two-thirds of voters, including 45 percent of Democrats, according to Pew.\n\nThe most important predictor of the court’s behavior is its ideological composition. The confirmation of Barrett in late 2020, which cemented the current six-justice conservative supermajority, certainly made outcomes like Bostock less likely. But the court’s apparent willingness to retreat from Bostock in Hecox and BPJ is not just a product of its changing membership. It is also the result of a cynical campaign to dehumanize trans people and to ensure that whenever the court decided that it was ready to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, Americans who might have otherwise been supportive of those rights would be just fine with that result.\n\nPerhaps the most ominous sign for the future of trans rights is that Trump’s 2024 election has emboldened anti-trans activists like never before. Since taking office, the president has issued executive orders that (among many other things) require passports to display the holder’s sex assigned at birth, that pull federal funding from certain providers of gender-affirming care, and that (again) ban trans people from military service. On its shadow docket, the court has backed Trump by rejecting requests to temporarily block some of these orders from taking effect. The result is a vicious cycle of bigotry: anti-trans voices persuading voters to elect anti-trans politicians who pass anti-trans laws blessed by anti-trans judges and celebrated in anti-trans media outlets, which then whip voters into an anti-trans frenzy all over again.\n\nThe eventual opinions in Hecox and BPJ will be long on legalese and explain in excruciating detail why, notwithstanding the result in Bostock, the court’s precedent empowers Republican lawmakers to stop trans women and girls from playing women’s and girls’ sports. The better explanation for the decisions will be much simpler: The conservative movement spent years working to prevent anything like Bostock from happening again. The justices are simply delivering the payoff.","summary":"The conservative movement spent years working to prevent anything like Bostock from happening again.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/supreme-court-trans-rights-gorsuch-bostock-trump.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/2221cf53-1a73-41b8-94e2-dc410b3a7d7f.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 19:28:57","author":"Jay Willis","authors":["Jay Willis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.064},{"id":392907012,"title":"Vance’s Secret Service Agent Caught Leaking Sensitive Details","text":"A Secret Service agent assigned to protect the vice president was apparently caught on camera openly sharing secret details of JD Vance’s security to a stranger who turned out to be an undercover reporter.\n\nTomas Escotto, who became a citizen in 2018 and a Secret Service (SS) agent soon after, not only told an undercover journalist about his anger against the Trump administration — especially ICE — and his previous vote for Joe Biden, he also provided many sensitive details about shift changes, travel routes, and security measures for Vice President Vance. While his political opinions are his constitutional right to express, his dangerous information dropping and photo texting potentially endangered Vance and violated the SS code of conduct.\n\nBREAKING: U.S. Secret Service Agent Assigned to VP JD Vance Leaks Sensitive Security Information to Undercover Reporter.Escotto is a holdover from the Biden administration and stated that he voted for Joe Biden, while expressing opposition to ICE & the Trump administration’s… pic.twitter.com/AyAjrt3XY4— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) January 13, 2026\n\nThe undercover video comes from O’Keefe Media Group (OMG), though James O’Keefe assured viewers that his team had coordinated with Vance‘s team in advance of the release to ensure that no information Escotto shared that could compromise the vice president’s safety in the future would be included in the video. Certain texts and words are therefore bleeped or blocked out in the video, such as the details on when exactly the Secret Service shifts are.\n\nEscotto even sent the undercover journalist photos of himself at Vance’s residence and next to transports, and other images related to the vice president with location metadata. Escotto’s actions potentially violated 18 U.S. Code § 793, O’Keefe argued, and certainly violated the SS code of conduct. Indeed, Escotto himself acknowledged in a note that he had signed paperwork agreeing not to disclose sensitive information. O’Keefe wrote on X that the government notified his team that they suspended Escotto’s clearance and revoked his access to agency facilities, as the disgraced SS agent is on administrative leave.\n\nRecommended: Scott Adams’ Final Message to His Fellow Americans\n\nO’Keefe referred to a recent violent break-in at Vance’s Ohio residence and the SS failures surrounding the 2024 Butler shooting of Donald Trump to emphasize the importance of Escotto’s irresponsibility. Imagine if Escotto had been speaking to a leftist terrorist instead of an undercover journalist interested in protecting Vance?\n\nBesides his casual dinner discussions about security formations, shifts, and complaints about protecting the Vance children, Escotto would also text the undercover journalist. For instance, Escotto mentioned the building at which he picked up Second Lady Usha Vance and then his location at the time of the message with VP Vance, along with a laughing emoji. Escotto sent her selfies and photos of others in the convoys while he was on duty, even when he was overseas. \n\nWhile Escotto did not always send the photos right after taking them, he should not have been taking the photos on his personal iPhone and sharing them with anyone at any time. Even worse, Escotto sometimes sent the undercover journalist details about Vance’s upcoming travel plans, including which plane the VP would use and his timetable.\n\nBut, as the video shows, Escotto might have been cavalier because he dislikes the Trump administration's policies. He confirmed that he had previously voted for Joe Biden. Asked about the “ICE stuff”, Escotto said, “I don’t like that… I don’t understand why they’re covering their face. I don’t agree with that at all,” he added of ICE officers, totally ignoring the 1,340%+ increase in assaults on ICE. “That is actually a sad thing, I hate that s**t.” While he is allowed to critique his bosses, it seems Escotto — who previously served on Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff’s detail — regrets Vance is in office, indicating a motive for his actions.\n\nSS is supposed to be composed of individuals who, whatever their political opinions might be, are willing to protect whichever politician is their assignment as honestly and securely as possible. If loose lips sink ships, Escotto could have (figuratively) sunk an entire fleet.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of bombshell exposés and other key news in this new year.

The entire institution stands by those freedoms and our work.”\n\n“It’s a clear and appalling sign that this administration will set no limits on its acts of aggression against an independent press,” Marty Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, told the Guardian.\n\nMurray said neither the newspaper nor Natanson were told they were the target of a justice department investigation.\n\nPam Bondi, the attorney general, said in a post on X that the raid was conducted by the justice department and FBI at the request of the Pentagon.\n\nThe warrant, she said, was executed “at the home of a Washington Post journalist who was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor. The leaker is currently behind bars.”\n\nThe statement gave no further details of the raid or investigation. Bondi added: “The Trump administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our nation’s national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”\n\nThe reporter’s home and devices were searched, and her Garmin watch, phone, and two laptop computers, one belonging to her employer, were seized, the newspaper said. It added that agents told Natanson she was not the focus of the investigation, and was not accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nA warrant obtained by the Post cited an investigation into Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland with a top secret security clearance who has been accused of accessing and taking home classified intelligence reports.\n\nNatanson, the Post said, covers the federal workforce and has been a part of the newspaper’s “most high-profile and sensitive coverage” during the first year of the second Trump administration.\n\nAs the paper noted in its report, it is “highly unusual and aggressive for law enforcement to conduct a search on a reporter’s home”.\n\nIn a first-person account published last month, Natanson described herself as the Post’s “federal government whisperer”, and said she would receive calls day and night from “federal workers who wanted to tell me how President Donald Trump was rewriting their workplace policies, firing their colleagues or transforming their agency’s missions”.\n\n“It’s been brutal,” the article’s headline said.\n\nNatanson said her work had led to 1,169 new sources, “all current or former federal employees who decided to trust me with their stories”. She said she learned information “people inside government agencies weren’t supposed to tell me”, saying that the intensity of the work nearly “broke” her.\n\nThe federal investigation into Perez-Lugones, the Post said, involved documents found in his lunchbox and his basement, according to an FBI affidavit. The criminal complaint against him does not accuse him of leaking classified information, the newspaper said.\n\nPress freedom groups were united in their condemnation of the raid on Wednesday.\n\n“Physical searches of reporters’ devices, homes and belongings are some of the most invasive investigative steps law enforcement can take,” Bruce D Brown, president of the Reporters’ Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in a statement.\n\n“There are specific federal laws and policies at the Department of Justice that are meant to limit searches to the most extreme cases because they endanger confidential sources far beyond just one investigation and impair public interest reporting in general.\n\n“While we won’t know the government’s arguments about overcoming these very steep hurdles until the affidavit is made public, this is a tremendous escalation in the administration’s intrusions into the independence of the press.”\n\nJameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, demanded a public explanation from the justice department of “why it believes this search was necessary and legally permissible”.\n\nIn a statement, Jaffer said: “Any search targeting a journalist warrants intense scrutiny because these kinds of searches can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy.\n\n“Attorney General Bondi has weakened guidelines that were intended to protect the freedom of the press, but there are still important legal limits, including constitutional ones, on the government’s authority to use subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists.\n\n“Searches of newsrooms and journalists are hallmarks of illiberal regimes, and we must ensure that these practices are not normalized here.”\n\nSeth Stern, chief of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said it was “an alarming escalation in the Trump administration’s multipronged war on press freedom” and called the warrant “outrageous”.\n\n“The administration may now be in possession of volumes of journalist communications having nothing to do with any pending investigation and, if investigators are able to access them, we have zero faith that they will respect journalist-source confidentiality,” he said.\n\nTim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at PEN America, said: “A government action this rare and aggressive signals a growing assault on independent reporting and undermines the First Amendment.\n\n“It is intended to intimidate sources and chill journalists’ ability to gather news and hold the government accountable. Such behavior is more commonly associated with authoritarian police states than democratic societies that recognize journalism’s essential role in informing the public.”\n\nThe Post has had a rocky relationship with the Trump administration in recent months, despite its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, attempting to curry favor by blocking it from endorsing Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBezos defended the action, which saw the desertion of more than 200,000 subscribers in protest.","summary":"Agents searched Hannah Natanson’s Virginia home and seized devices in inquiry tied to a classified materials case\n\nThe FBI raided the home of a Washington Post reporter early on Wednesday in what the newspaper called a “highly unusual and aggressive” move by law enforcement, and press freedom groups condemned as a “tremendous intrusion” by the Trump administration.\n\nAgents descended on the Virginia home of Hannah Natanson as part of an investigation into a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified government materials.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/fbi-raid-washington-post-hannah-natanson","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c63c9bc377336cbf31486c2a7dfab61e9798d6/868_854_2265_1812/master/2265.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base6","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 18:20:11","author":"Jeremy Barr,Richard Luscombe","authors":["Jeremy Barr","Richard Luscombe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":392931970,"title":"Washington Post Readers Rip Bezos as He Stays Silent on Raid","text":"Washington Post readers are blasting the paper’s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, for staying silent after the FBI conducted a shock search of the home of a reporter digging into the Trump administration.\n\nHannah Natanson, a reporter dubbed the Post’s “federal government whisperer,” said Wednesday that the FBI searched her home in Alexandria, Virginia—a move critics decried as a crackdown on press freedom.\n\n“Happy now, Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post?

The Daily Beast has contacted the Washington Post for comment.\n\nDuring the FBI search, agents checked 29-year-old Natanson’s devices and seized a phone, a Garmin watch, and two laptops: her personal computer and one owned by the Post. Natanson was reportedly told she was not the focus of the investigation, and that the seizure of her devices followed the paper’s investigation into “a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified government materials.” \n\nSome readers expressed concern for Natanson’s safety alongside their criticism.\n\n“All of Jeff’s money and all those paid bribes and he couldn’t spare his employees lives,” one reader wrote. “I hope she’s safe and they didn’t assault her like they’ve been assaulting other U.S. citizen women.” \n\nThis is not the first time readers have revolted against Bezos, who has frequently been accused of using his ownership of the Post to steer its journalism in a MAGA-friendly direction.\n\nThe Post reportedly lost roughly 250,000 subscribers in October 2024 after Bezos scrapped a planned editorial board endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race.\n\nBezos has repeatedly courted Trump, including donating $1 million to his inauguration fund and offering Melania Trump a reported $40 million for the rights to her documentary.\n\nThe paper’s opinion section has also taken a sharp right turn after Bezos announced it would refocus on “personal liberties and free markets”—a shift that sparked a petition signed by more than 400 staff members opposing the change.\n\nThree high-profile liberal columnists subsequently departed, including longtime columnist Karen Attiah, who said she was fired over posts she made following the assassination of Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe Post soon hired three conservative writers, and its editorial board has since rallied behind several of the president’s most controversial moves, including his dismantling of the White House’s historic East Wing.\n\nTrump has repeatedly targeted the Post and warned the paper it “ought to clean up their act” ahead of the 2024 election. But in March last year, Trump effusively praised Bezos’ makeover of the paper.\n\n“A guy like Bezos, I’ve gotten to know him, and I think he’s trying to do a real job,” Trump said. “Jeff Bezos is trying to do a real job with The Washington Post, and that wasn’t happening before.”\n\nNatanson, however, has continued her critical coverage of the Trump administration. The D.C. native penned a first-person account detailing the rigors of covering Trump on Christmas Eve, writing that her fiancé urged her to stop fielding late-night calls and texts from federal workers “who wanted to tell me how President Donald Trump was rewriting their workplace policies, firing their colleagues or transforming their agency’s missions.”","summary":"Photo Illustration by Eric Faison/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesWashington Post readers are blasting the paper’s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, for staying silent after the FBI conducted a shock search of the home of a reporter digging into the Trump administration.\n\nHannah Natanson, a reporter dubbed the Post’s “federal government whisperer,” said Wednesday that the FBI searched her home in Alexandria, Virginia—a move critics decried as a crackdown on press freedom.\n\nThe Post was among the numerous outlets reporting on the search, but readers quickly noticed that Amazon CEO Bezos remained silent.

The exchange comes as it was revealed that the network’s ratings have collapsed under the new conservative regime.\n\nDuring the interview, Dokoupil discussed the ailing economy under Trump. Responding to growing concerns about rising prices as he imposes tariffs, Trump said, “A year and a half ago, our country was dead. We had a dead country. You wouldn’t have a job right now. If she [former Vice President Kamala Harris] got in, you probably wouldn’t have a job right now.”\n\nTrump went on to praise conservative David Ellison, chairman and CEO of CBS parent company Paramount, as “an amazing guy.” The president also reiterated to Dokoupil that he “wouldn’t have this job” unless Trump had won.\n\nOn the same day that CBS aired the Trump interview, it was revealed that Dokoupil’s first week anchoring the broadcast has been a ratings disaster.\n\nCompared with a year ago, when Norah O’Donnell was anchoring the show, Nielsen ratings were down 23% in the first five days of Dokoupil’s run. Over the comparable five-day stretch, O’Donnell had an average of almost 5.4 million viewers. Dokoupil is averaging just under 4.2 million viewers.\n\nBy contrast, ABC’s “World News Tonight” had roughly 8.1 million viewers and “NBC Nightly News” scored about 6.7 million viewers over the same period.\n\nViewers may be tuning out due to segments like one that ran on last Tuesday’s broadcast, when Dokoupil said “we salute you” to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom he praised as “the ultimate Florida man.”\n\nThe fall for CBS comes after Paramount chose to pay out $16 million to Trump to settle a frivolous lawsuit, after which the Trump administration approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance. The action, characterized by many as a bribe, is under investigation by congressional Democrats.\n\nIn another widely criticized pro-Trump move, CBS announced last July that it would cancel “The Late Show,” hosted by comedian and longtime Trump critic Stephen Colbert. A few months later, conservative activist Bari Weiss was installed as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\nEven Trump had a laugh at the expense of the network’s drift to the right, noting in a November interview with “60 Minutes” that the network “paid me a lot of money.” Conveniently, the mockery was omitted from the show’s broadcast.\n\nA few weeks later, Weiss pulled a report from “60 Minutes” that highlighted the systematic abuse of inmates at El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, a Trump administration destination for migrants abducted from their families.\n\nThings have gotten so bad at CBS that the network was mocked during its own broadcast of the Golden Globes on Sunday. During her monologue, host Nikki Glaser described the network as “America’s newest place to see B.S. news.”\n\nMeanwhile, Weiss is reportedly enraged at the mockery and scrutiny of her stewardship of CBS News. Her wife, Nellie Bowles, complained about internal CBS criticism of Weiss in a piece for the right-wing Free Press, which Weiss still oversees.\n\nBut when even Trump is noting the network’s subservience to him, the bad news is unlikely to stop.","summary":"In an interview on “CBS Evening News” on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump mocked anchor Tony Dokoupil for having a job due to the network’s rightward shift following the 2024 election.

I mean, if there was ever a white woman who was definitely rooting for the vampires…\n\nFrom Entertainment Weekly:\n\nFirst on the 55-year-old’s trigger list for the evening was what she called “nonsense” displayed on pins worn by several attendees, including “actors like Mark Ruffalo” who “showed up wearing a Be Good pin that’s an homage to Renee Good” — the Minnesota mother who was shot and killed last week by an ICE agent.\n\nKelly then set her sights on Wanda Sykes, who nearly stole the show with jokes she made Sunday night as she presented the award for Best Stand-Up Comedy on Television.\n\nAccording to Kelly, Sykes “made it all about herself” when Sykes joked on stage that there would be “some people pissed off that a queer Black woman is up here doing the job of two mediocre white guys.\n\nInadvertently fulfilling Sykes’ prophecy, Kelly said, “You’re pathetic, Wanda Sykes,” before criticizing her for being “disrespectful” when she accepted the award on behalf of eventual winner Ricky Gervais and dedicated it to “God and the trans community” after Gervais’ past transphobic jokes.\n\n“So disrespectful. How dare you?” Kelly said of the moment, before calling for the Globes to ban Sykes from ever presenting again at the show that Kelly herself admitted to not watching.\n\nKelly also called Sykes “racist” because Black women celebrating Black women gives her the Caucasian cootie flare-ups, just like it did when Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) was showing Kamala Harris HBCU love during the DNC in 2024.\n\nAlso, every time Kelly accuses a Black person of racism, I feel compelled to remind her that she’s a Klan maiden who vehemently defended blackface and stated emphatically that Jesus and Santa Claus are white and should only be depicted as white. Kelly was 100% certain about what race Santa and Jesus were, but wasn’t quite sure if Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile or not.\n\nAnyway, after Kelly was done being white and whiny about outspoken Black women and people who care about murderous ICE agents, Kelly started lying about her podcast being nominated for an award, which it was not.\n\nMore from EW:\n\nThen, Kelly turned her attention toward the Golden Globes’ new Best Podcast category, for which she made the eligibility shortlist — which was automatically compiled by listener and audience data — late last year.\n\n“I, among other podcasts, were nominated,” Kelly said, though the show wasn’t officially nominated, and instead only advanced on the aforementioned shortlist. Still, Kelly maintained that “we pulled our name from consideration” after she alleged that she was asked to pay a fee and engage in promotional tactics.\n\nKelly alleged, “They also wanted me to go to Hollywood and do interviews with Golden Globes members behind the scenes to woo them into voting for me. Which, I said at the time, I’d rather put a bullet in my brain. F— no. There was zero chance I was doing any of that. So, we pulled our show from consideration.”\n\nMegyn, please — ain’t nobody coming to see you, White Otis.\n\nKelly went on to whine about progressive celebrities winning awards and journalists getting emotional after their wins during the show that she, again, claims she did not watch. She basically gave her viewers 10 minutes of pouting when she could have just said, “I didn’t want any stinky Golden Globe anyway,” and called it a day. Seriously, if she has so much contempt for the Golden Globes — to the point where she’s out here lying about pulling her podcast from consideration that it never really had in the first place — why does she even care who won, who performed, or what pins other celebrities were wearing?\n\nIt’s like she wakes up every morning just to be visibly miserable — as if there’s some kind of award for that. \n\nMegyn Kelly Conservatively Criticizes Beyoncé’s ‘Try Too Hard’ Levi’s Jeans Ad\n\nMegyn Kelly Questions Whether Epstein Is A Pedophile","summary":"Megyn Kelly, who claims she didn't even watch the Golden Globes, sure had a lot to say about the ceremony, the winners, and the presenters.","url":"https://newsone.com/6757911/megyn-kelly-sheds-kkkaren-tears-over-golden-globes-calls-wanda-sykes-racist/","image":"https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/08/17545108743042.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024&crop=0,0,100,683px","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 17:00:00","author":"Zack Linly","authors":["Zack Linly"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":392958440,"title":"Will Bezos step in?

Additionally, Monday night’s broadcast at the start of week two of Dokoupil’s reign was down 8 percent week-over-week in total viewership and flat in the demo.\n\nAs Status News’ Oliver Darcy noted in his newsletter, the “numbers are awful,” even if one were to dismiss the year-over-year decline. With the full-court promotional effort CBS News put into hyping Dokoupil’s two-week “Live From America” road trip, staying flat compared to the past few weeks and months “would be somewhat of a failure,” especially with the network chartering a private plane to cart Dokoupil and his team from city to city.\n\n“Weiss, taking a notably hands-on approach, has helped land bookings for the program. Under her direction, the network’s digital team has relentlessly promoted Dokoupil across its platforms,” Darcy additionally observed. “And CBS News leadership has fully embraced placing the anchor at the center of the story itself, with Dokoupil delivering on-air monologues about the loss of trust in the press, the ‘CBS Evening News’ issuing declarations of its love for America, and the social team even circulating a strange video of Dokoupil openly weeping during a hometown interview with a Miami affiliate.”\n\nMaking matters worse is that the other broadcast networks’ evening news programs absolutely walloped CBS Evening News during Dokoupil’s first week. \n\nABC’s World News Tonight, long the ratings winner in evening news, brought in 8.1 million total viewers, besting CBS by 94 percent and 86 percent in the key demo, in which it averaged an audience of 989,000. \n\nNBC Nightly News, which recently brought in its own new anchor in Tom Llamas, pulled in 6.725 million viewers overall and 992,000 in the key demo. NBC’s demo victory over ABC was its first since Llamas replaced Lester Holt last fall as the lead of the nightly news broadcast.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Dokoupil and Weiss can turn around the low ratings for the show with what many observers – both inside and outside the network – have denounced as a “MAGA-friendly” pivot to directly appeal to the president and his supporters. \n\nWeiss, the founder of the “anti-woke” digital outlet The Free Press, was installed as CBS News’ top editor in October by Paramount chief David Ellison – who is looking to curry favor with Trump amid his hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. “It’s state TV,” one network staffer told The Independent, with others calling it “sad and pathetic.”\n\nDokoupil did little to silence those critics when he scored an exclusive interview with the president during a tour of a Ford plant in Detroit. \n\n“So CBS gave Trump essentially 3/4 of the Evening News tonight, airing an interview that would be right at home on Fox News (dayside, not primetime.) Not a single question about Justice Dept. resignations or Epstein Files. Not a single Trump lie corrected,” Vulture editor Joe Adalian noted after the broadcast.\n\nThat interview also included Trump repeatedly telling Dokoupil that he wouldn’t have his job as nightly anchor if Kamala Harris became president, prompting the host to eventually retort, “I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.” \n\nTrump, meanwhile, fired back: “Yeah, but at a lesser salary.”\n\nOne network staffer told The Independent that it was a “crap interview” and the only thing it will be remembered for is that Dokoupil “couldn’t just ignore Trump’s broadside” about the president taking credit for his hiring.","summary":"Compared to the debut week of the co-anchor duo Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson, who Dokoupil replaced after they spent less than a year behind the desk, CBS Evening News declined 23 percent in adults between 25 and 54 years old","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cbs-evening-news-ratings-tony-dokoupil-b2900487.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/20/49/cbs-evening-news-(5).jpg?crop=540,360,x50,y0&trim=0,50,0,50&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sf6UYbvT-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-14 16:31:22","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.408},{"id":392942508,"title":"Senate Democrats still have difficult path to majority","text":"ANALYSIS — Even with former Rep. Mary Peltola’s candidacy in Alaska, Senate Democrats still have a difficult path to the majority in November. \n\nThe fact that Democrats may need to rely on Alaska — a state where Republicans have a 9.4-point Inside Elections Baseline advantage, where Donald Trump finished ahead of Kamala Harris by 13 points in 2024, and where Democrats have won just one Senate election in 50 years — to flip the chamber is evidence that it will be tough for the caucus to get to 51 seats this year. \n\nSenate Republicans currently hold 53 seats, meaning Democrats would need a net gain of four seats to win control and bypass Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote. And other races could pose more challenging for Democrats than Alaska. \n\nNorth Carolina appears to be the easiest takeover opportunity for them, given the current political climate and the fact that it’s an open seat with Republican Thom Tillis retiring. But a flip is not guaranteed. Trump won the Tar Heel State in all three of his presidential bids, including a 3-point win in 2024. And Democrats have won only one Senate race in North Carolina in the past 25 years (Kay Hagan in 2008). The last Democrat to win before her was John Edwards in 1998.\n\nAs a Republican in a Democrat-leaning state, Maine Sen. Susan Collins is supposed to be vulnerable. But while she’s been a consistent target going back a quarter century, Democrats haven’t been able to unseat her. Collins has five Senate wins under her belt, with an average margin of victory of 18 points. It’s remarkable that defeating Collins is supposed to be one of the easier races for Democrats.\n\nWinning Alaska, North Carolina and Maine would still leave Senate Democrats one seat short of a majority, assuming they hold all of their own seats. But that’s not a guarantee either. \n\nGeorgia is a swing state that has voted Republican in almost all cases, except for Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential win, a pair of down-ballot statewide special elections last year, and three recent Senate races. Those more recent results are good news for Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for reelection this fall. But he can’t take his race for granted.\n\nDemocrats are also trying to hold Sen. Gary Peters’ open seat in battleground Michigan, which Trump won in 2024 as Republicans came within a half a point of winning the state’s other Senate seat. And the race to succeed Democrat Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire could get tighter, considering it was the closest state Harris won and Republicans might nominate a former senator with a famous last name.\n\nOhio looks to be the fourth-best takeover target for Democrats. Over the past decade, the Buckeye State has shed its swing-state status, and Republicans now have a 10-point Baseline advantage there. (Inside Elections’ Baseline metric measures a state’s political performance by combining all federal and state election results over the past four cycles into a single trimmed mean.) \n\nDemocrats are relying on former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost reelection by 4 points in 2024, to pull out a win. Such a feat is certainly possible under the current political environment, with voters dissatisfied with the status quo while Republicans are the party in power. But it will be yet another difficult race. \n\nOther targets\n\nIf Democrats lose one of their own seats — Georgia, Michigan or New Hampshire — or swing and miss in any of the races in North Carolina, Maine, Alaska or Ohio, they’ll have to win elsewhere to win the Senate majority. \n\nIowa, where Republican Joni Ernst is retiring, would be the next target. The most recent Democrat to win a Senate race in the Hawkeye State was Tom Harkin, when he secured a fifth term in 2008. But the party hasn’t won an open race there since John Culver in 1974. Ernst’s decision to not run again probably boosted Republican chances of winning now that they have Rep. Ashley Hinson in the race, while Democrats are wading through a competitive primary. \n\nWithout Iowa, the climb gets even steeper. Some Democratic strategists are so disinterested in investing in Texas and Florida yet again that they’d rather talk about their prospects in ruby-red Mississippi, where Democrats haven’t won a Senate race since President Ronald Reagan’s first midterm election. \n\nPast is prologue\n\nFlipping Senate seats in three states that voted for the other party’s presidential candidate just two years earlier looks like a daunting task on paper. \n\nBut Senate Democrats can take some comfort in what Republicans did in 2010. \n\nWhile the GOP didn’t flip the chamber that year, they did notch a series of wins in states that had voted for Barack Obama two years earlier. \n\nFormer Sen. Dan Coats won in Indiana, which Obama had carried by a single point. Republican Patrick J. Toomey won in Pennsylvania, where Obama had finished ahead of John McCain by 10 points. Obama won Wisconsin by 14 points in 2008, and yet Republican Ron Johnson knocked off Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold two years later. And GOP nominee Mark S. Kirk prevailed in the president’s home state of Illinois, which had backed Obama by 25 points. And that doesn’t count Republican Scott P. Brown’s early 2010 special election victory in Massachusetts, just over a year after Obama had won the Bay State by 26 points.\n\nRepublicans might try to explain away the comparison for any number of reasons, but certain midterm dynamics are the same as they were 16 years ago. At the time of the 2010 elections, Obama’s job rating was underwater, according to Gallup, with 45 percent approving and 47 percent disapproving. \n\nTrump’s current standing is undeniably worse. Gallup’s most recent polling had 36 percent approving of the president and 59 percent disapproving. \n\nThere’s still time for things to get better for Republicans, but any improvement in Trump’s standing would likely be gradual. So simply saying there’s still time understates the challenge for Republicans as we march through the calendar. \n\nBut a lot of things would need to go right for Senate Democrats to win the majority.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2026/01/14/senate-midterm-elections-democrats-majority/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/OHPOL_468_102624.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 15:42:55","author":"Posted January 14, 2026 At 3:42pm","authors":["Posted January 14, 2026 At 3:42pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.228},{"id":392931968,"title":"ICE Barbie Destroys Trump’s Election Lies With Embarrassing Fraud Review","text":"Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that undocumented migrants were allowed to vote en masse in the 2024 election have been thoroughly debunked by his own administration.\n\nAn internal review carried out by the Department of Homeland Security under Kristi “ICE Barbie” Noem has found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, despite Trump and his allies’ insistence that Democrats allowed migrants to enter the country illegally so they could vote in the last presidential election.\n\nEven that tiny figure, amounting to just 0.02 percent, may be overstated as DHS’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system has also flagged U.S. citizens as possible noncitizens, among other errors.\n\nIn Charlotte County, Florida, the review initially suggested that just 15 of roughly 176,000 names on the voter rolls belonged to noncitizens. However, three people were mistakenly added to the rolls who never intended to vote, and two others had already submitted documentation showing they were naturalized U.S. citizens.\n\n“We didn’t get a mass onslaught of people,” Charlotte County Supervisor of Elections Leah Valenti told the Times. “We have clean voter rolls.”\n\nIn St. Louis County, Missouri, about 35 percent of the roughly 690 people initially flagged by the SAVE tool were later determined to have registered at naturalization ceremonies.\n\nTrump—who still falsely claims the 2020 election was “rigged” against him—also sought to undermine the 2024 election by repeatedly suggesting that immigrants living in the country illegally would vote against him.\n\nThe unsubstantiated claim echoes the racist “great replacement theory,” a far-right conspiracy that white Americans are purposely being replaced as the dominant race in the country in order to skew the electorate towards the Democrats.\n\n“I think they really are doing it because they want to sign these people up to vote. I really do,” Trump told a crowd in Iowa in January 2024 ahead of the first-in-the-nation GOP caucus. “They can’t speak a word of English for the most part, but they’re signing them up.”\n\nTrump continued to push these false claims throughout his campaign, including during a live presidential debate with Kamala Harris in September 2024.\n\n“Our elections are bad. And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote,” Trump said. “They can’t even speak English. They don’t even know what country they’re in, practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that’s why they’re allowing them to come into our country.”\n\nThe SAVE program was originally designed to help states verify the immigration status of people applying for government benefits. Several Democratic-led states refused to allow the Trump administration to expand its use to check voter rolls, citing privacy concerns and the risk of erroneous flags.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson claimed that more noncitizen voters would be uncovered if Democrats allowed broader data review.\n\n“This process takes time, especially given strong opposition from blue states with notoriously bad voter roll maintenance that have refused to check their rolls” against the DHS system, Jackson told the Times.","summary":"Jim WATSON / AFP via Getty ImagesDonald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that undocumented migrants were allowed to vote en masse in the 2024 election have been thoroughly debunked by his own administration.\n\nAn internal review carried out by the Department of Homeland Security under Kristi “ICE Barbie” Noem has found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, despite Trump and his allies’ insistence that Democrats allowed migrants to enter the country illegally so they could vote in the last presidential election.\n\nEarly results of the review, obtained by The New York Times, found that of 49.5 million voter registrations checked using the DHS’s immigration verification tool, only about 10,000 were flagged as potentially belonging to non–U.S. citizens.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-barbie-destroys-trumps-election-lies-with-embarrassing-fraud-review/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/H6Z25VIKSZASNHIJI5W2U52PVU.jpg?smart=true&auth=4e3d589f434cef1ec19c991d8ce08f15dc07b97e0efebe519dcfa5f69faa3156&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 15:25:22","author":"Ewan Palmer","authors":["Ewan Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":392906850,"title":"Trump 'falling off a cliff' with notoriously 'fickle' voter demographic: data guru","text":"President Donald Trump picked up support from a notoriously \"fickle\" voter demographic in his 2024 re-election, but CNN's Harry Enten said that group is running away from him.\n\nThe 79-year-old president lagged behind Kamala Harris with Generation Z voters by just six percentage points in his third campaign, but that young demographic has largely abandoned him since last February, the chief data analyst told \"CNN News Central.\"\n\n\"I mean, he has just fallen off a cliff when it comes to Generation Z,\" Enten said. \"Look at this: Donald Trump's net approval rating in February of 2025.

They tried to run on border security even after years of open-borders policies, because polls showed voters were turning against them. Now Democrats are getting another clear warning to hide their most extreme positions before the midterms. The playbook looks very familiar, and Republicans would be foolish not to take advantage of it.\n\nThird Way, a center-left think tank, released a memo telling Democrats to drop the \"abolish ICE\" slogan after the recent ICE shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. The memo warned Democrats against using extreme rhetoric in the aftermath of the shooting. \"The impulse is emotional,\" the memo explains. \"The slogan is simple. But politically, it is lethal. Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want. This piece argues for a harder and smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.\"\n\nLast year, NBC News reported that some elected officials had resurrected “abolish ICE” into campaigns and talking points. Third Way implored the left to instead talk about ICE abuses and overreach but be clear that they still want secure borders and legal immigration.They pointed to polling and focus groups that showed “a window, not a wave” for change, with potential voters saying they wanted deportations but were not happy with how they are being carried out and who is being targeted.“Even among Democratic primary voters, Third Way’s own polling shows a clear preference for a balanced approach over abolition, 65% to 35%,” according to the memo.\n\nSound familiar? It should. This is essentially a replay of what happened with \"defund the police\" a few years back.\n\nBack in April 2021, Democratic operatives warned party lawmakers to steer clear of any \"defund the police\" rhetoric ahead of the midterms. Celinda Lake, a pollster working for the Democratic National Committee, said that calls to defund police departments were hurting Democrats in tight races.\n\n“The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also concluded in an election autopsy earlier this year that the issue ‘carried a punch,’” Politico reported in October 2021. “But the Democratic messaging is also a reaction to polling: Only 18 percent of Americans said they support the 'defund the police' movement, according to a March poll.”\n\nNaturally, Republicans hammered Democrats with the “defund” message relentlessly, and it worked.\n\nThe pattern here is clear and easy to see. Democrats are often told to hide what they really believe until after the election is over. When issues like defunding the police or abolishing ICE come up, party consultants tell them to stay quiet while voters are paying attention. That should concern everyone. If a party has to cover up its real positions to win, that is more than a messaging problem. It becomes a problem for the whole country, because many voters end up being duped into thinking Democrats are more moderate than they actually are.\n\nThis warning also provides a clear roadmap for Republicans heading into the next midterms. Just as the GOP successfully turned “defund the police” into a liability for Democrats in past elections, tying today’s Democrats to “abolish ICE” rhetoric could prove just as potent this time around.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2026/01/14/abolish-ice-is-the-new-defund-the-police-and-thats-a-gift-for-the-gop-n4948268","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2026/13/d3518ede-8dbd-4c6e-a542-09407bacfe1a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 14:59:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":392931980,"title":"Keystone Kash Raids Home of Reporter Investigating Trump Administration","text":"Keystone Kash Patel’s FBI searched the home of a Washington Post reporter who has been digging into the Trump administration on Wednesday. \n\nWashington, D.C., native Hannah Natanson, described as the Post’s “federal government whisperer,” was in her Alexandria, Virginia, home at the time of the raid.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the sweep of the Harvard graduate’s house and the seizure of her devices followed the paper’s investigation into “a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified government materials.” Natanson was reportedly told she was not the focus of the investigation.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the raid took place in an X post not long after news broke in the media. She said the move was prompted by the Defense Department and executed by the Department of Justice and the FBI. Bondi said Natanson “was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor.”\n\nThe statement continued: “The leaker is currently behind bars. I am proud to work alongside Secretary Hegseth on this effort. The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation’s national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.” \n\nPatel added in a separate post: “This morning the @FBI and partners executed a search warrant of an individual at the Washington Post who was found to allegedly be obtaining and reporting classified, sensitive military information from a government contractor - endangering our warfighters and compromising America’s national security. The alleged leaker was arrested this week and is in custody. As this is an ongoing investigation, we will have no further comment.\"\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, the warrant said law enforcement was investigating Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a Maryland-based systems administrator with a top secret security clearance, who is accused of improperly accessing classified intelligence reports and removing them from secure facilities, with documents later found in his lunchbox and basement.\n\nPatel’s tenure as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been marked by high-profile gaffes. Patel, whom the Daily Beast has nicknamed “Keystone Kash” for his bungling performance, was criticized for rushing to social media to tout his agency’s work on tracking down a person of interest in the Charlie Kirk shooting prematurely. \n\nAfter the shooting, Patel reportedly refused to get off a plane without an FBI raid jacket and ended up wearing one nabbed from a female officer. He reportedly decorated it with patches from other agents.\n\nA scathing 115-page report compiled by a national alliance of retired and active-duty FBI special agents and analysts declared that Patel is “in over his head” and leading a “chronically under-performing” agency paralyzed by fear and plummeting morale. \n\nTrump has a particular vendetta against the Post. Before he was elected in 2024, he warned the paper “ought to clean up their act.” \n\nHowever, in March last year, Trump effusively praised billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ makeover of the paper after its coverage became kinder to him. “A guy like Bezos, I’ve gotten to know him, and I think he’s trying to do a real job,” Trump said. “Jeff Bezos is trying to do a real job with The Washington Post, and that wasn’t happening before.”\n\nThe praise came just weeks after Bezos, who attended the president’s inauguration last January and whose company donated $1 million to his inaugural fund, satisfied the new administration by announcing that the Post‘s opinion section would focus on “free markets and personal liberties,” two traditional conservative values that the mogul claimed were “underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion.”\n\nIn October 2024, just weeks before the presidential election, Bezos had killed the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris. \n\nThe newspaper has continued its critical coverage of the Trump administration, however. Natanson’s biography on the Post site says that she covers “Trump’s reshaping of the federal government and its effects.” \n\nNatanson wrote a tell-all first-person piece about the rigors of her work on Christmas Eve. She said her fiancé appealed to her to stop fielding late-night calls and texts from federal workers “who wanted to tell me how President Donald Trump was rewriting their workplace policies, firing their colleagues or transforming their agency’s missions.” \n\n“You’ve got to stop,” he said, according to Natanson. “Stop answering them.”","summary":"Photo Illustration by Eric Faison/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesKeystone Kash Patel’s FBI searched the home of a Washington Post reporter who has been digging into the Trump administration on Wednesday. \n\nWashington, D.C., native Hannah Natanson, described as the Post’s “federal government whisperer,” was in her Alexandria, Virginia, home at the time of the raid.\n\nDuring the search, the 29-year-old’s devices were checked, and FBI agents seized a phone, a Garmin watch, two laptops, her personal computer, and one belonging to the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/reporter-investigating-trump-administration-raided-by-fbi/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7TOQ7H6NDZAK5FEYCDPRWCWJXU.png?smart=true&auth=326bd479d4d9d16dff4975222a550e8e48bfd9c733db8581e6e80178abab944d&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 14:10:29","author":"Leigh Kimmins","authors":["Leigh Kimmins"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":392950574,"title":"After Democrat Smears, Tom Homan Confirmed ICE Agent and Family Were Forced to Go Into Hiding","text":"The Left has had it in for ICE agents for a while, calling them the \"Gestapo\" and fascists while demanding they unmask while performing their duties.

This includes Senators Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin, as well as Rep. Adam Schiff. Just last week, Democrats marked January 6, and lamented the attacks on law enforcement. But it seems their respect and concern last only 24 hours a year. And while we hadn't considered the defamation angle before, it would be nice to see ICE and Border Patrol agents start filing defamation lawsuits. \n\nEditor’s Note: Democrats are fanning the flames and raising the rhetoric by comparing ICE to the Gestapo, fascists, and secret police.\n\nHelp us continue to report the truth about ICE and its brave accomplishments to make America safe again.

Trump visited the plant with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford, Ford CEO Jim Farley, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent not long before he addressed the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nDokoupil did Tuesday night's broadcast from inside the General Motors global headquarters in the new Hudson’s Detroit building. The program also featured his interview with GM CEO Mary Barra, where he asked her, \"Are you seeing a change in car-buying habits that could be an early sign of trouble in the economy?\" Barra said the company wasn't seeing any change, adding, \"We think the market is going to be about the same as it was last year.\"\n\nDokoupil is taking the \"CBS Evening News\" on a tour of U.S. cities in an attempt at \"meeting people where they are — sharing the most urgent, important stories with Americans, rather than talking to them,” according to CBS News.\n\nDuring the Trump interview, touted as exclusive on the newscast, the president covered some familiar territory such as his frequent boast that America is \"the hottest country in the world\" now that he is back in the White House.\n\nHe described Fed chair Jerome Powell, who's being investigated by the Justice Department, as \"either corrupt or incompetent.\" When Dokoupil pushed him for a response to those who think the Powell investigation looks like political retribution, Trump said, \"I can't help what it looks like.\"\n\nDokoupil asked Trump about Iran's killing of reportedly thousands of protesters, adding, \"Now we're hearing that (Iran is) going to start hanging protesters tomorrow.\" After the anchor asked whether Iran has crossed Trump's red line or if the line has moved, Trump eventually said, \"We will take very strong action if they do such a thing.\"\n\nSince his official debut as nightly news anchor on Jan. 5, Dokoupil has been the subject of media attention over everything from a teleprompter snafu during the Jan. 5 broadcast to a Jan. 6 segment that played off of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's multiple jobs within the Trump administration during which Dokoupil referred to Rubio as \"the ultimate Florida man.\" It aired days after the U.S. military strike on Venezuela to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\nThe heavy scrutiny of Dokoupil is largely tied to the changes that CBS News is facing under the leadership of new CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss.\n\nWeiss stirred controversy in December after abruptly pulling a planned “60 Minutes” report about Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\n\nOn Sunday, host Nikki Glaser joked in her monologue during the Golden Globes awards ceremony — which was carried live by CBS — that “the award for most editing goes to … CBS News.” Glaser also delivered a mocking slogan for the network: “CBS News, America’s newest place to see B.S. news.”\n\nParamount Global, the former owner of CBS, was acquired in 2025 by Skydance Media as part of a massive, multibillion dollar merger. David Ellison, who runs Skydance and founded the company, is the son of billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a supporter of Trump.\n\nThe merger was approved by the FCC in July, weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a defamation suit brought by Trump regarding the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nDokoupil closed the broadcast from the Motor City in part by stating, \"You may not agree with everything you hear on this broadcast, but we trust you to listen and we trust you to decide for yourself.\"\n\n\"CBS Evening News\" is scheduled to broadcast from Chicago on Jan. 14.\n\n“CBS Evening News with Tony Dokoupil” airs at 6:30 p.m. weeknights on CBS Detroit (WWJ-TV).\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture critic Julie Hinds at jhinds@freepress.com.","url":"https://eu.freep.com/story/entertainment/television/2026/01/14/trump-got-testy-at-times-with-new-cbs-anchor-during-detroit-interview/88164389007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/PDTF/88164413007-img-8956.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2159,1214,x0,y109&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 11:05:19","author":"Detroit Free Press","authors":["Detroit Free Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.029},{"id":392902976,"title":"Trump redux: What he didn't do in Detroit","text":"President Donald Trump has been to metro Detroit plenty of times since his first run for the presidency in 2016 and has done everything here from proposing tax cuts meant to spur auto sales to arguing about the size of his hands on a debate stage.\n\nHis latest foray into southeast Michigan on Tuesday, Jan. 13, to tour Ford Motor's Dearborn Truck Plant and speak to the Detroit Economic Club for the first time as a sitting president (though he'd done so twice before as a candidate) didn't include any major policy announcements or developments. But we can't say it was entirely without incident, considering reports that he made an obscene gesture and remark to a heckler during the Ford tour (which a Trump spokesman called \"an appropriate and unambiguous response\" given the heckler's behavior).\n\nGiven the low volume of substantial news to come out of the visit, however, we thought we'd continue the theme and put together a short list of things Trump didn't do on this particular visit that he otherwise might have:\n\n1. Mention the auto show\n\nWe honestly thought that given the timing of the president's visit, his speech to the Detroit Economic Club and his quick tour of Ford's Dearborn Truck Plant before jetting back to Washington, he might give a shout-out to the Detroit Auto Show, which starts this week. But alas, POTUS gave it no notice.\n\n2. Go for a spin\n\nFive years ago, then-President Joe Biden flew in as Ford was unveiling its all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning and took it for a well-publicized spin on a Dearborn test track. Trump was back at Ford on Tuesday, singing the praises of Ford's F-series and taking some credit for its sales success despite its longstanding position as the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. Trump in his speech criticized Biden as out of it as he often does but at no point did he squeal the wheels of a truck.\n\n3. Insult Detroit\n\nThe last time Trump spoke to the Detroit Economic Club, in October 2024, he made headlines for suggesting − in a clearly unflattering way − that if he lost that year's presidential election to then-Vice President Kamala Harris, \"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit.\" Trump made no such mention regarding the city this time around.\n\n4. Attack (or praise) Whitmer\n\nOnce upon a time, you could count on Trump vociferously denouncing Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, that \"woman from Michigan,\" but no more. After the two found common ground on a handful of initiatives, including stopping Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes and a new mission for Selfridge Air National Guard Base it's been (mostly) hunky-dory between them. Trump didn't make mention of her at all in his speech.\n\n5. Give a protracted speech\n\nTrump has a particular way of speechifying that he calls \"the weave,\" a meandering and often repetitive campaign style that rouses his base and can be described as much more of a marathon than a sprint. Michigan has seen its share of these, from a two-hour-long speech in Battle Creek in 2019 as the U.S. House was voting to impeach him (for threats to Ukraine, he was acquitted by the Senate) to a similarly long speech before the nonpartisan Detroit Economic Club in October 2024. This time, the weave was there but not the protraction: He ended in about an hour.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

In the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position. Revolution Wind has received all its federal permits to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut and is nearly 90% complete. Trump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week. Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued, asking the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing on its Revolution Wind project was first. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast. The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds. “I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.” The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies on his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind. Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind. “The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Atty. Gen. Peter Neronha said in a statement. At Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a crucial stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February. Schneider said those involved in the project take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries. “We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday. Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers. Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables. With four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.” Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday. “I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday. McDermott writes for the Associated Press.

She often comes across as the poster child for what’s wrong with DEI hires. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Little v. Hecox, a case that will likely decide whether laws barring biological males from competing on girls’ sports teams are constitutional. Given that Jackson famously admitted during her confirmation hearings that she didn’t know what a woman was — because, as she put it, she’s “not a biologist” — you knew she was bound to be a real spectacle. And true to form, she did not disappoint.\n\nAs you probably could have guessed, Jackson struggled through a series of nearly incomprehensible statements about sex, gender identity, and sports classifications. It was embarrassing.\n\n“You have the overarching classification, you know, everybody has to be, um, uh, uh, play on the team that is the same as their sex at birth. Um, but then you have a gender identity definition that is operating within that. Meaning, a distinction, meaning that, um, for, uh, cisginger [sic] girls they can play consistent with their gender identity, w- for transgender girls, they can’t.”\n\nIt’s hilarious that Jackson stumbled over the pronunciation of one of the left’s favorite made-up words, all while failing to understand the difference between real girls and boys who pretend to be girls.\n\n🚨 Ketanji 'I'm Not a Biologist' Jackson: \"For cisGINGER girls, they can play consistent with their gender identity. For transgender girls, they can't.\" pic.twitter.com/uCqSHR6nM2— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) January 13, 2026\n\nAt another point, she delivered a Kamala Harris-style word salad, stumbling through a convoluted scenario about transgender athletes. “And so, to the extent that you have an individual who says what is happening in this law is that it is treating someone who is transgender but who does not have, because of the medical interventions and the things that has, have been done, who does not have, uh, the same, uh, threat to physical competition and safety and all of the reasons that the state puts forward, that’s actually a different class, says this individual,” she said, pausing to collect herself.\n\nICYMI: Justice Alito Obliterates Trans Ideology Effortlessly in Oral Arguments\n\nShe fumbled on: “So you’re not treating the class the same, and you’re not…. Uh, how do you respond to that? In other words, the as-applied challenge essentially redefines the class, or one could think of it as that. And so, what’s wrong with that, number one, and how do you square that with our, uh, holdings in Caban, uh, which Laher later described in this way? In other words, Laher suggested that Caban was establishing that as-applied challenges of this nature do exist.”\n\nThe argument was a dizzying tangle of “uhs” and qualifying phrases, leaving Idaho Solicitor General Alan Hurst unable to understand what she was even asking.\n\nThat makes all of us.\n\n🚨 BREAKING: DEI Justice Ketanji Jackson is DEFENDING men in women's sports with an utter word salad at the Supreme Court\"Is treating someone transgender, but does not have, because of the medical interventions and the things that have been done, who does not have, uh, the… pic.twitter.com/QTkpru6EqO— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 13, 2026\n\nPerhaps worst of all, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed confusion about the requirement that state laws be narrowly crafted: “I guess I’m still struggling to understand why the state would have to have perfectly tailored laws.” She continued, “I— I— I would think the state would just have to make exceptions where people can demonstrate that the justification that makes the state’s conduct constitutional does—doesn’t apply to them.”\n\nHashim Moopan, representing the Department of Justice, then had to give her a lesson that no Supreme Court justice should need: “Right.

The status of that house is unclear.\n\nAccording to an online listing, Harris and Emhoff’s new home was originally built in 1979 sits on three quarters of an acre and has a main living area that “is bathed in natural light, featuring high wood-beamed ceilings, a built-in speaker system, and a gas fireplace.” \n\nCompass’ Chris Cortazzo was the listing agent on the sale.\n\nA representative for Harris declined to comment, and Cortazzo did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Former vice-president Kamala Harris is upgrading her Los Angeles real estate portfolio, trading one celebrity-soaked neighborhood for another. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/13/real-estate/kamala-harris-buys-8m-mansion-in-malibus-celeb-packed-pt-dume/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/118846045.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7Hcb1BeA-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-14 00:25:09","author":"Peter Kiefer","authors":["Peter Kiefer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.34},{"id":392850168,"title":"New Hampshire lawmakers seek to tighten voting laws","text":"Proponents of House Bill 323 say many students who present those college IDs are nonresidents.

Not subscribed to The Verge yet? You should! It can materially improve your life.\nLast week was a grim reminder that no matter what sort of horror is being perpetrated or how many people end up dead, the Trump administration’s knee-jerk response is to shitpost through it. The White House’s response on X to abducting the head of a sovereign nation? “FAFO”. The response to an ICE agent shooting a woman in broad daylight? A Buzzfeed-style listicle of “57 Times Sick, Unhinged Democrats Declared War on Law Enforcement.” ICE agents arresting protesters? “Welcome to the Find Out stage.” \nTo the vast majority of people following current events, the Trump administration’s meme-ing is blunt and cruel. But the jaded political insider will also view Trump’s meme fusillade as an element of a media strategy known as “rapid response”: the full-time work of quickly shaping the political narrative of a breaking news event, sometimes within minutes, before the news media and your opponents can shape it for you.\n“Every political office, every political campaign, has a dedicated operation that helps them respond strategically to events in the news that are out of their control.” Lis Smith, a high-profile Democratic communications strategist based in New York City, told me. It’s a profession that dates back to the beginning of the 24-hour news cycle, when cable shows could quickly assemble a panel of pundits to discuss current events, and the workload has grown exponentially in the age of social media. “You cannot control all the narratives that are going to be out there, so you need to be able to manage the chaos that’s coming into your world.” \nSmith served as the director of rapid response for Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, which was one of the first to fully take advantage of social media, and worked in the comms shop for several New York City mayors and Democratic candidates. She’s widely credited for single-handedly elevating Pete Buttigieg’s profile, turning him from an obscure mayor to a serious presidential candidate as his director of communications. She views social networks through the lens of their messaging utility: X, formerly known as Twitter, is still the best for getting “text-based rapid response communications like written statements” in front of a wide range of “elites and opinion-shapers.” A Bluesky-based messaging strategy might engage a friendly left-leaning audience, but will never “penetrate” the world outside, nor will a Rumble-based campaign ever make it out of the right-wing bubble.\nMore importantly: memes may be a fast way to convey a political message to a specific audience who gets the inside joke, but the humor is rarely understood by anyone outside of that group — especially people who might have been sympathetic to the concept of stopping illegal immigration, but are horrified by how the Trump administration is going about it. The memes themselves are simply a reflection of that mindset. “The administration’s use of memes really flattens the political debate,” said Smith. “It takes the humanity, the seriousness, and the nuance that’s needed out of it and replaces it just with cruelty.”\nBefore we get to my conversation with Smith, here’s The Verge’s latest on the political tech dystopia:\nThis week at The Verge:\n* “Snatching Maduro was all about the spectacle”, Elizabeth Lopatto and Sarah Jeong: Real people are dead because Donald Trump wanted a spectacle.\n* “America’s new era of energy imperialism is about more than oil”, Justine Calma: Trump wants Venezuela’s oil, Greenland’s minerals, and above all — control.\n* “The MAGA-approved video of an ICE killing”, Mia Sato: After a federal agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, the Trump administration found its preferred angle of the incident.\n* “Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are cowards”, Elizabeth Lopatto: X’s deepfake porn feature clearly violates app store guidelines. Why won’t Apple and Google pull it?\n* “Trump’s fundraisers asked Microsoft for its White House ballroom donation”, Emma Roth: Amazon also admitted that it was in touch with fundraisers months before the White House released its list of donors in October.\n* “New York wants to regulate Roblox”, Lauren Feiner: Gov. Kathy Hochul made new requirements meant to protect kids online a centerpiece of her plan for state policy.\n* “Former NYC Mayor Eric Adams accused of $2.5 million crypto ‘rug pull’ as his NYC Token crashes”, Emma Roth: The NYC token’s value peaked at about $580 million, before dropping to $130 million.\n* “I can’t find the Trump phone at America’s largest tech show”, Dominic Preston: I’ve looked and looked, but Trump Mobile is nowhere to be found at CES this year \n“A meme that is funny or cruel will probably spread faster than anything with nuance”\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\nYou came up during an era where Twitter, before it was X, was really the only internet media environment for politics. How has the practice of rapid response changed in an environment where there is so much narrative to control over so many types of media?  \nIt’s gotten a lot harder. In the ’90s, the big change was the 24-hour news cycle with cable news. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the big development was social media, Twitter, and being able to respond in real time online to news developments. But now, there’s no question that it’s harder to get your message out, with how fractured these different social media channels are. Not everyone is on X today the same way they were 10 years ago. But also, your message is less likely to penetrate as effectively on a platform like X than it was 10 years ago, because of how verification, etc., have changed. \nSo you really need to have an “all of the above” communication strategy, where you’re hitting traditional media with press releases, calls to reporters and news networks, and you’re also hitting social media in real time. That means not just hitting X, but also hitting Threads, hitting Bluesky, TikTok, Instagram, all those apps, because there has never been a time where people’s media consumption habits have been more fractured than right now.  \nDo candidates view specific platforms for certain political purposes, or political leanings? \nX is still pretty dominant in American politics for getting out rapid response communications, especially text-based rapid response communications like written statements, because it’s still where you’re going to find the most political insiders, political pundits, and reporters. Everything [messaging-wise] trickles out from there. Where you see more fracturing is in terms of where people do short form video: you do see some campaigns using TikTok, others using Instagram more; you do see some favoring of different platforms across partisan lines. But Bluesky on the left is just never going to be as effective of a way of reaching elites and opinion-makers as X is — just as Truth Social or Discord on the right is never going to be the way that you reach elites or opinion-makers. \nLet’s go into the content of said messaging. I know that Kamala Harris and Biden tried to lean into memes during their 2024 campaigns, but clearly not as effectively as Trump, and the meme format seems to be really dominant in the Trump administration. Is there a specific way an operative views the meme format as a political messaging tool? \nThe meme format is more likely to spread quickly. It’s something that a specific audience is going to understand immediately, and it really simplifies a political argument. The problem with that, though, is, one, it’s very audience specific. Not everyone is going to understand a Family Guy meme, not everyone is going to understand a Patriots meme, or whatever the meme du jour is.\nAnother problem with the meme format is that you lose a lot of context and you lose a lot of humanity in it. So when you see the administration posting sort-of-funny memes about deportations or ICE, you lose a lot of the empathy and compassion that most people have when it comes to the immigration debate. Most people think that illegal immigration is bad and that we should do something about it. But most people also understand that there are real people who are involved in all of these situations and don’t think it’s funny to make light of, say, school pickups getting raided, or families getting separated, or parents crying as they’re being dragged away from their kids. \nI was listening to Joe Rogan interviewing Shane Gillis, and they actually touched on this. I would say both Rogan and Shane Gillis are people who were favorable to Trump in the election — Rogan more so than Shane Gillis — but Gillis said, I want our government to take the issue of illegal immigration seriously. I don’t want it to be funny to them. And I think that’s something that really taps into how most people feel about these issues. \nIf you reduce these very serious issues to cruel, funny memes, you’re going to alienate a lot of people who might be there with you on an issue if you’d approached it with a little bit more maturity and humanity. But the administration is saying, cut out the humanity, cut out the maturity. Those things don’t matter. Because a viral meme — a meme that is funny or cruel — will probably spread faster than anything with nuance. They’re prioritizing speed and virality over nuance and seriousness. \nI think you just refined what we’ve been thinking about at The Verge: the way that my coworkers saw Trump’s abduction of Maduro and their response to the ICE shooting was that this government’s policy is a meme mentality — their speed, virality and the need to get their spin out first before anyone feels any sort of way about it. \nThere’s a short window when people — everyone from reporters to voters to anyone online — are trying to figure out what the hell’s going on and what they think about breaking news. Rapid response is about stepping into that void and shaping it, but there are real problems with how the Trump administration is doing it. Ultimately, yes, they may win some sort of short-term viral meme war. But in the long term, the way that they’re communicating about these issues — whether it’s the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, or deportations in general — they’re gonna lose the political debate. People want action on these issues, but they don’t want wanton cruelty. \nAlso, if you [the administration[ step in very quickly and put out bad facts, what you do is just compound mistrust in government and mistrust in the administration. And it’s possible that the Trump administration benefits from that because the less people trust official sources, the more it’s good for them. But I think overall, it’s pretty bad that they’re putting out false information that goes mega-viral the way they do it, because ultimately, no one’s going to take anything they say at face value anymore. It’s especially damaging for their relationships with the news media and elites who, in the past, would have clearly taken what any presidential administration said at face value. \nIs it too early to think about meme warfare in the midterm election — changing people’s opinions who could be swayed to vote one way or another, getting that messaging to them as quickly as possible, driving them out to the polls?\nI don’t think that the meme strategy from this administration is gonna help Republicans in the midterms. And I think if you talk to a lot of Republicans who are up in swing areas or swing states or certain districts, and you presented them with the memes this administration is putting out, I don’t think they would agree with them, and I don’t think that they would say that this is good political strategy. Because to the point I made earlier: the administration’s use of memes really flattens the political debate. It takes the humanity, the seriousness, the nuance that’s needed out of it, and replaces it just with cruelty. The voters who are going to turn out in 2026 — yeah, some of them are going to be part of that MAGA base that it embraces the cruelty, but the people that you need to win over are going to be people who have nuanced views on issues like illegal immigration and people who say, Yeah, we need secure borders; yes, we need more enforcement of our immigration laws; but maybe we don’t need to be putting out memes about, you know, a father being taken off in handcuffs. \nThat’s where I think the administration’s focus on speed and virality comes at a political cost. Someone’s’s going to have to pay for the tone that they’re taking online, and it’s likely going to be the Republicans who are up in 2026, unless, I don’t know, Democrats somehow overplay their hand on immigration issues. \nAnd a lot of the voters who will determine the midterm elections are older voters. They’re not going to consume the memes firsthand, nor are they going to understand the memes. That’s something being lost in this debate too: even though more people than ever are getting their news through social media, a lot of the people who decide elections, and a lot of the people that Republicans need to win, are not meme consumers. It’s questionable whether it will pay off electorally for them.  \nAnd now, Recess.\nSpeaking of memes distilling political arguments:\n[Image: Image via @afraidofwasps/X. https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/IMG_8859.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]\nSee you next week.","summary":"Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the technology, broligarchs and brainrot rapidly transforming politics and civic society.

Judges in New York and Washington, D.C., ruled against both those moves, respectively.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/13/white-house-end-funding-sanctuary-cities-states-00726557","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/474b598/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F36%2Fda%2F9ded7f85472381a04d4d3328ef5f%2Ftrump-90909.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-13 23:09:00","author":"Cheyanne M.

The legal decision issued Monday comes after the Trump administration rolled back nearly $7.6 billion in October previously allocated to blue states. \n\nThe funding cancellation only targeted projects operating in 16 states that voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 and where Democrats served as governor at the time. Projects in other states were spared, even though many are part of the same Department of Energy programs and share the same general purpose. \n\n“Defendants offer no explanation for how their purposeful segregation of grantees based on their electoral support for President Trump rationally advances their stated government interest,” wrote U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in the ruling.\n\nThe funding rollback affected a variety of congressionally-approved projects, including solar power and battery installations, developing hydrogen fuel supply chains, improving energy efficiency and building electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The October cancellation came as the Trump administration has realigned U.S. energy policy away from renewables to instead focus on expanding oil and gas drilling, keeping coal plants running and investing in nuclear power. \n\nIn a statement to Straight Arrow News, an Energy Department spokesperson stood by the agency’s “review process” that it said, “evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars.” \n\nWhat was argued in the case? \n\nIn an announcement of the terminations, the Energy Department said affected projects were “not consistent with this Administration’s goals, policies and priorities” for energy development. The agency said it had determined terminated projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nIn legal filings, lawyers for the department had argued that “consideration of partisan politics is constitutionally permissible, including because it can serve as a proxy for legitimate policy considerations.”\n\nThe plaintiffs — the City of Saint Paul, Interstate Renewable Energy Council, Plug In America, Elevate Energy, Southeast Community Organization, and the Environmental Defense Fund — argued the cancellations violated the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection clause. The financial awards for these grantees were fully obligated, meaning not only had Congress allocated the funds, but the Energy Department had already signed contracts finalizing the specific awards. \n\nSiding with the plaintiffs’ claim that their equal protection rights were violated, Judge Mehta found the administration failed to explain how segregating grantees based on how they vote served any legitimate government interest. The terminated grants were “otherwise comparable” to awards in Republican-voting states that the Energy Department did not cancel.\n\n“There is no reason to believe that terminating an award to a recipient located in a state whose citizens tend to vote for Democratic candidates — and, particularly, voted against President Trump — furthers the agency’s energy priorities any more than terminating a similar grant of a recipient in a state whose citizens tend to vote for Republican candidates,” Judge Mehta wrote. \n\nWhat happens next? \n\nThe Energy Department did not respond to questions about whether the agency would seek an appeal, but a spokesperson told SAN, “the American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nThe ruling only applies to a few grant award winners who were plaintiffs in the case. The Energy Department is ordered to vacate termination orders and immediately release the $27.6 million in federal grants to the city of Saint Paul and six organizations involved in the suit. The ruling for these entities is likely to open the door to other affected grant recipients across the country. In total, 321 financial awards were terminated in October, affecting more than 230 projects. \n\nThe department also faces scrutiny from an internal agency watchdog over the decision. An Energy Department Inspector General audit announced in mid-December is reviewing whether the cancellations were politically motivated and complied with department rules. The audit is currently ongoing. \n\nThe post Judge sides with blue states in fight over $7.6 billion cancelled clean energy funds appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2026/01/13/judge-sides-with-blue-states-in-fight-over-7-6-billion-cancelled-clean-energy-funds/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2239224797_Getty_Images_clean-OG6n18.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-13 22:17:52","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":392832712,"title":"'Abbott Elementary,' 'Reasonable Doubt,' 'Paradise' score NAACP Image Awards nominations","text":"LOS ANGELES -- The NAACP has announced its list of \"57th NAACP Image Awards\" nominees.\n\n\"Abbott Elementary\" is up for six awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series and Quinta Brunson, Janelle James, Tyler James Williams, William Stanford Davis earned acting nods.

You are so lucky I allow you into this room to even be with me,” he said. \n\nThe assembled business leaders laughed nervously as he assured them he was only kidding before again claiming they were “so lucky” to be under his administration because American economic growth was “exploding.”\n\n“Productivity is soaring, investment is booming, incomes are rising. Inflation is defeated. America is respected again like never before,” he said.\n\nAfter more boasts about his administration’s economic record and swipes at both Biden and elected leaders in states such as California that did not vote for him or his party last year, the president began accusing Federal Reserve leaders — including Board of Governors Chair Jerome Powell, who he called a “stiff” — of trying to sabotage the country’s economy by failing to lower interest rates in response to positive economic numbers.\n\n“In the old days, when you had good numbers, interest rates would go down. When you had good numbers, the market would go through the roof. That's the way we're going to make it again. That's the old fashioned way. That's the right way,” Trump said. “Today, if you announce great numbers, they raise interest rates to try and kill it, so you can never really have that kind of rally.”\n\nTrump’s desire for lower interest rates has led to him to conduct a months-long campaign of browbeating and intimidation against Powell and other members of the central bank’s board that recently escalated after a federal prosecutor in Washington launched a probe into whether the Fed chair lied to Congress during testimony about a long-running renovation of the bank’s headquarters which Trump has accused him of mismanaging.\n\nHe claimed the bank once hewed to an “old standard” that lowered rates when the economy was doing well, but that has not been the case in the central bank’s modern history.\n\nWhen the Fed began raising interest rates during Biden’s presidency, it was to tamp down on inflation not seen since the mid to late 1970s after then-President Richard Nixon browbeat then-Fed chair Arthur Burns into slashing rates ahead of his 1972 re-election campaign. \n\nNixon ultimately reaped the short-term benefits in the form of his historic 1972 landslide victory which saw him win 49 of 50 states over Democratic nominee George McGovern, but by the end of the decade the artificial stimulation he had championed brought about crushing “stagflation” — a combination of low growth and high inflation — that would only be tamed in the mid 1980s after then-chair Paul Volcker instigated a recession by leading the central bank to jack up rates to 20 percent. \n\nTrump, who will nominate a replacement for Powell when his term as chair expires in May, said he wants Powell’s replacement to push for lower rates “because our country becomes stronger” that way. \n\nAfter a brief interlude during which he took credit for increased military recruiting that began under his predecessor, Trump claimed the country’s alleged recent economic success was due to his use of exorbitant tariffs on almost all American trading partners — import taxes which he falsely claims are paid by foreign countries as a kind of tribute for the privilege of having Americans import their products. \n\nThe president proceeded to embark on an extended stem-winding rant about how the country’s greatest period was during the late 1800s and early 1900s when tariffs were the main source of revenue for a far smaller federal government.\n\nHe claimed — without offering evidence — that the government’s use of an income tax after ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution had roots in a foreign conspiracy to “convince” the United States that tariffs were “no good.”\n\n“So some genius ... said, ‘oh, let's go to an income tax system.’ So instead of foreign companies and countries paying everything, the people started paying,” he said before claiming that the start of the income tax in 1913 caused the Great Depression (it did not).\n\nTrump’s defense of his tariff policies comes as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on whether he exceeded his authority by unilaterally imposing the import taxes on most of the world without involving Congress. \n\nHe accused the American business owners who brought a lawsuit to invalidate the taxes as being “China-centric” and suggested that his administration will “figure something out” to impose new tariffs if the high court rules against him. \n\nRoughly 40 minutes into his nearly hour-long remarks, he finally returned to the topic of affordability, which he called “a fake word by Democrats,” and promised that he’d roll out new ideas to bring housing costs down while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland next week. \n\nHe promised “much more detail” about policies that would permit more Americans to enjoy home ownership when he visits the Swiss resort town while also teasing a new “health care affordability framework” that he’ll introduce later this week.\n\nWhile Americans who purchase health insurance on Affordable Care Act exchanges are reeling from massive premium increases due to his refusal to support extending Covid-era tax credits that kept costs lower for consumers, Trump claimed the forthcoming plans would “reduce premiums for millions of lower drug prices” while “delivering price transparency and demand honesty and accountability from insurance companies all over the country.”","summary":"Address to Detroit Economic Club includes few concrete proposals to address cost-of-living

Violence","text":"You and I have all seen the videos of Renee Good taunting, stalking, and obstructing ICE officials conducting law enforcement activities in the city. And we've all seen the video when Good makes the fatal decision to accelerate her SUV (encouraged by her wife yelling, \"Drive, baby, drive!\" while filming) into an ICE agent. That agent used legitimate force to stop a threat and now Renee Good is dead.\n\nDespite what our eyes and ears are telling us, Democrats have spent the past week pretending the shooting was a cold-blooded murder. They said Good was \"scared\" (but videos showed her smiling), they said she didn't know the man ordering her out of the vehicle was a member of law enforcement (but she'd spent all day tailing them), they said she didn't hit the ICE agent (she did). \n\nThat's gaslighting.\n\nAnd now here's another example of it, wherein we're supposed to believe that the riots we're seeing during both this Trump administration and the last one are somehow the fault of Trump and conservatives.\n\nObama: PeaceTrump: RiotsBiden: PeaceTrump: RiotsDo people really not see the pattern here?— Claire (@ClaireFosterPHD) January 12, 2026\n\nAnd while the account in question is a parody, the sentiment is real and the pattern undeniable: Democrats are inherently violent and they've encouraged their voters to engage in lawless rioting, \"resistance\" and obstruction of federal law enforcement. The pattern is also that the so-called \"defenders of democracy\" do not, in fact, like democracy, nor do they respect the democratic process.\n\nDonald Trump won the 2016 election and again in 2024. Democrats have spent the past decade claiming he stole 2016, and they spent 2021-2025 trying to put Trump behind bars so he couldn't run again. Instead, they kicked Joe Biden off the ballot and installed Kamala Harris even though she never received a single primary vote, and was so soundly rejected by Democratic Party voters in 2020 that she dropped out before Iowa.\n\nRather than debate the issues or — heaven forbid — work with President Trump on, well, anything, Democrats do what Leftists have done since time immemorial: engage in violence to get their way.\n\nHere's a two-and-a-half-minute video of many prominent Democrats doing just that.\n\nYour daily reminder that the Democratic Party is the party of violence and the calls to violence come from the top.Two and a half minutes straight of Democrat officials and talking heads calling for violence: pic.twitter.com/zFkTfcn5cT— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) October 21, 2025\n\nOf course, Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, Eric Swalwell, and their ilk aren't the ones going out and getting their hands dirty. Instead, they send out women like Renee Good, who they somehow convinced to believe that Trump is Hitler and ICE agents are Nazis. And it got her killed. Of course, the decision to hit the gas pedal is all on Good, but she was on that street because Democrats told her it was her duty to do so in resistance to President Trump.\n\nInstead, they'll trip over one another to get in front of microphones to tell their voters to go out and, as MN Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan demanded, \"put their bodies on the line.\"\n\nMeanwhile, conservatives have jobs and families and lives to live. We're also not violent, despite the Left's gaslighting that portrays us as domestic terrorists for daring to question school boards, as gun-crazed would-be school shooters because we support the Second Amendment, and as disseminators of \"disinformation\" because we believe the First Amendment lets us say what's on our mind. We all know that's not true, yet the narratives persist.\n\nAs Orwell noted, \"The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" That Party is the modern Democratic Party, and they used Orwell as an instruction manual rather than a cautionary tale.\n\nThe good news is that gaslighting only works if people agree to deny what they can plainly see. Americans watched the videos. They saw the obstruction, the escalation, and the moment when a bad decision turned fatal. Pretending otherwise isn’t compassion — it’s manipulation. We also see it every time the Left accuses the Right of doing the very things the Democrats are doing. And the sooner people reject the Left’s demand to suspend reality for the sake of a narrative, the sooner we can stop sacrificing lives and sanity to political theater.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/13/vip-trump-riots-we-see-the-pattern-here-n2669395","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/160/e8b2f7e9-635e-48de-b39a-7cdfbdcbd542.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-13 21:00:50","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.507},{"id":392846320,"title":"In Detroit speech, Trump touts an economic boom invisible to many","text":"President Donald Trump visited Detroit on Tuesday, Jan. 13 to declare that the economic boom he promised Michigan during the 2024 campaign is well underway, but his perception is not shared by many Michiganders or supported by recent economic data.\n\nTrump, in an hourlong speech to the Detroit Economic Club as protesters demonstrated at two nearby locations, said the impact of his aggressive tariff policies has exceeded even his own optimistic expectations.\n\n\"One year ago, we were a dead country,\" Trump said during a speech in which he repeated familiar phrases from other addresses and few lines drew more than tepid applause. \"Now, we are the hottest country anywhere in the world.\"\n\nIn fact, though growth in U.S. gross domestic profit exceeded expectations in the third quarter of 2025, it slowed more than expected in December amid business caution about hiring because of import tariffs and rising artificial intelligence investment, Reuters reported Jan. 9, while the U.S. unemployment rate dipped to 4.4% from 4.5% in November.\n\nThe most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures from November also show the number of auto and auto parts jobs combined down in Michigan and across the nation compared with December 2024, the month before Trump took office.\n\nAt a business panel discussion that preceded Trump's appearance, Mary Buchzeiger, CEO of Lucerne International, a global auto supplier based in Auburn Hills, voiced a view shared by many business leaders that tariffs will hurt U.S. competitiveness.\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on U.S. citizens,\" Buchzeiger said. \"People don't realize that.\"\n\nTrump pointed to lower gas prices, a booming stock market, and signs that the U.S. trade deficit might be shrinking, along with his administration's efforts to reduce fraud related to government social programs.\n\nTrump arrived in Detroit for his first Michigan visit of 2026 amid continued concern among automakers and consumers about his tariff-focused trade policies, and amid recent controversies about the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, the Jan. 3 U.S. military extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and the Jan. 11 disclosure that the U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, all as Trump mulls possible military strikes against Iran and has renewed talk about taking over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.\n\nMichigan automakers, who were encouraged under President Joe Biden to invest heavily in electric vehicle technology and manufacturing, have faced costly adjustments amid policy reversals under Trump, while at the same time responding to tariffs. On Dec. 15, Ford said it will record $19.5 billion in special charges related to restructuring its business, including pulling back its all-electric vehicle investments. GM has pegged its loss related to pivoting away from EVs in 2025 at $7.6 billion. Stellantis in October announced a $13 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, including significant investments at two Michigan plants and moving production of the Jeep Compass away from Ontario, as earlier planned, to Illinois.\n\nMore: Multiple protesters arrested outside Trump's speech in Detroit\n\nMore: Trump in Michigan for speech to Detroit Economic Club: Watch replay\n\nMichigan will be a crucial state in the November midterm elections, as Trump hopes to hold or expand Republicans' narrow control of Congress amid 2.7% inflation in December and low approval numbers. Michigan's 2026 calendar includes an open U.S. Senate seat to replace Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, who is stepping down after two six-year terms, and several competitive U.S. House elections. Trump has stressed the importance of the midterms and pushed some states to redraw district lines to improve GOP chances. He has talked about the need to ban absentee voting by mail, raising concerns about voter suppression under the guise of election security. In September, the Trump administration sued Michigan and five other states for refusing to turn over complete voter registration data that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says includes personal data the U.S. Justice Department isn't automatically entitled to under the law.\n\nAfter Trump's speech, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin accused the president of trying to mislead Michiganders. “Under Donald Trump’s failed economic policies, Michiganders are seeing their paychecks get tighter, and jobs disappear. And today, Trump tried to gaslight Michigan families once again — but they weren’t fooled — because new polling shows that Donald Trump is disastrously unpopular in Michigan,\" Martin said in a statement.\n\nEarlier on Jan. 13, Trump toured Ford's Dearborn Truck Plant, where the popular F-150 pickup truck is manufactured. Trump was joined on the tour by Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford, Ford CEO Jim Farley, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nTrump addressed the Detroit Economic Club twice before, during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, but Jan. 13 was his first speech to the business group as president. Trump's 2024 remarks drew criticism when he said, in a comment not seen as complimentary, that the whole country would look like Detroit if then Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris won the election.\n\nJust down the street from the Jan. 13 event, at Trumbull and Temple, The Drop Trump Coalition assembled a crowd of over 100 to protest the president's visit as cars driving down Trumbull honked regularly in sporadic bursts of support.\n\nSam Poirier, 21, had the day off work and drove down from Adrian to protest on behalf of her siblings, some of whom she said are Latino and have voiced fear over getting pulled over or taken by ICE agents regardless of their status as American citizens.\n\nPoirier said regardless of where someone stands on the political spectrum, government agents acting aggressively against their own citizens should be concerning. “When it happens to one person, it opens the door up for it happening to others,” she said.\n\nProtesters also gathered at Detroit's Cass Park.\n\nThere, Ann Smith, a 52-year-old Ypsilanti resident, said she joined the protest because she believes “everything going on in the world right now is unacceptable.”\n\nSmith said she was alarmed by the police response as officers repeatedly ordered demonstrators to move and warned of possible force if they did not comply.\n\nFree Press staff writers Beki San Martin and Darcie Moran contributed to this report.\n\nContact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.\n\n(This story was updated to add a video.)","url":"https://eu.freep.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/13/donald-trump-speech-detroit-economic-club/88145888007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/PDTF/88163429007-trump-011326-es-04.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2258,1271,x0,y112&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-13 20:51:01","author":"Detroit Free Press","authors":["Detroit Free Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":392810048,"title":"Havana Syndrome Mystery Deepens: How A Newly Revealed Pentagon Device Is Fueling Fresh Suspicion","text":"A new CNN report suggests the mystery surrounding Havana Syndrome may be entering a critical new phase, after the Pentagon reportedly spent more than a year testing a device believed by some investigators to be capable of causing the illness. According to four sources briefed on the matter, the device was acquired through an undercover operation and cost the US government “eight figures.”,The device was purchased by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a division of the Department of Homeland Security, using Defense Department funding in the final days of the Biden administration. While still under study, its existence has reignited internal debate across the US government over the true cause of Havana Syndrome, officially known as “anomalous health incidents” (AHIs). The Pentagon later briefed House and Senate intelligence committees on the findings.,The device reportedly emits pulsed radio waves, a mechanism long speculated by some officials and researchers to be linked to the illness. One source said the device could fit inside a backpack, though officials remain puzzled about how a portable device could cause the severe neurological symptoms reported by some victims. The device reportedly contains Russian components, though it is not entirely Russian-made.,What Is Havana Syndrome?,Havana Syndrome first came to public attention in late 2016, when US diplomats stationed at the American embassy in Havana, Cuba, reported sudden symptoms consistent with head trauma. Some reports suggest earlier cases may date back to 2014.,Since then, at least 1,500 suspected cases across 96 countries have been reported, according to US officials cited by CNN. Cases have emerged in countries including China, India, Austria, Vietnam, France, and Switzerland. High-profile incidents include a delayed 2021 trip to Hanoi by then–Vice President Kamala Harris following reports of an anomalous health incident, as well as symptoms experienced by National Security Council staff and diplomats worldwide.,Havana Syndrome Causes and Symptoms,The exact cause of Havana Syndrome remains unknown. Over the years, officials have explored multiple theories, ranging from sonic attacks to directed energy weapons.,According to CNN, the newly acquired device produces pulsed radio waves, which some believe could be responsible for the illness. Past intelligence assessments have also suggested “pulsed electromagnetic energy” as a plausible explanation. However, researchers have struggled to determine how such energy could consistently cause the reported damage.,Reported symptoms have included:,VertigoSevere or pounding headachesNauseaEar-popping sensationsPiercing, directional noisesDespite the severity of symptoms, the National Institutes of Health found no evidence of “MRI-detectable brain injury,” adding further complexity to the investigation.,Conflicting Intelligence Assessments,US intelligence agencies have given mixed answers about Havana Syndrome over the years. In 2022, a panel said some cases might be caused by external electromagnetic energy, but in 2023 and early 2025, officials said it was unlikely that a foreign government ran a worldwide attack, though they couldn’t completely rule it out.,Many victims are frustrated, feeling ignored. Some former CIA officers say the agency downplayed evidence. A 2024 joint investigation pointed to Russia’s GRU Unit 29155, which Russia denies. Former CIA officer Marc Polymeropoulos said if the Pentagon device can cause Havana Syndrome, it would be “vindication” for victims.,Why the Device Matters,Officials are now concerned that if the technology is viable, it may have proliferated globally, allowing multiple countries access to a device capable of causing career-ending injuries to US personnel. How the US government discovered the device, or from whom it was purchased, remains unclear.,As investigations continue, Havana Syndrome remains one of the most baffling and contentious medical and national security mysteries facing the US government.,Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"The Pentagon is reportedly testing a covertly acquired device that emits pulsed radio waves and may be linked to Havana Syndrome, deepening the mystery around the illness.

More than 1,000 officials and their family members are thought to have been plagued by memory loss, hearing problems, trouble sleeping and what appears to be brain injury—yet no credible cause has emerged to explain the common set of symptoms originally linked to the U.S. Embassy in the Cuban capital when the ailment first became public nearly 10 years ago. But, according to a Monday report from CNN, the Pentagon has been testing a device purchased by undercover homeland security operatives that could finally pull back the curtain on the enigma of what the U.S. officially terms “anomalous health incidents.“ What Is Havana Syndrome? The first cases became public in late 2016, when U.S. government employees and several Canadian diplomats, plus their relatives, experienced similar symptoms after being assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Havana. Cases were then reported across the world, including in the U.S. Intelligence assessments fed back to the public had not been able to identify what causes the symptoms and who may be to blame. Tourists ride classic convertible cars on the Malecon beside the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, on October 3, 2017. A U.S. intelligence report, published in January 2025, said most of the American intelligence community still doubted that a foreign adversary was behind Havana Syndrome. But one U.S. intelligence agency believed there is a “roughly even chance“ that a foreign actor had used a “novel weapon or prototype device“ to induce the symptoms, according to the unclassified assessment. One scientific study commissioned by the State Department and published in 2022 said the symptoms appear to be “consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency energy.“ “Many of the chronic, nonspecific symptoms are also consistent with known radio frequency effects, such as dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, cognitive deficits, and memory loss,“ according to the study. Another intelligence agency judged that there was the same probability a foreign actor had developed such a weapon that could have caused the reported illness. One of the most common working theories has put Russia at the heart of deploying or experimenting with some form of sonic or directed-energy weapon. Moscow, an ally of Cuba, has repeatedly denied any involvement in inducing the symptoms. The device acquired by Homeland Security Investigations—part of the Department of Homeland Security—produces pulsed radio waves, one source told CNN. It contains Russian components but is not entirely Russian-made, they added. Newsweek reached out to the Russian Foreign Ministry by email for comment. In November 2021, then-CIA Director William Burns warned Russian intelligence services that there would be “consequences“ if they were found to be responsible for Havana Syndrome, The Washington Post reported. Where Have People Experienced Havana Syndrome? Symptoms associated with the illness have been reported around the world, but it's hard to work out exactly how many people have been affected and how many suspected cases could be coincidental or ultimately unrelated. Texas Republican Representative August Pfluger, chairing a congressional hearing in May 2024, pointed to cases in the U.S., China, Vietnam, Germany, Austria, Serbia, Taiwan, Colombia and Australia. In late 2017, a senior CIA operative reported a suspected case of Havana Syndrome, followed by another incident often described as linked to the illness in Guangzhou, China, the following year. In the years since, suspected cases of Havana Syndrome have been tentatively reported elsewhere, in countries such as Poland and Uzbekistan. Olivia Troye, a homeland security adviser during President Donald Trump's first administration, told CBS News' 60 Minutes that she had experienced a “piercing feeling“ in her head, nausea and disorientation as she walked close to the White House. A visit by then-Vice President Kamala Harris to Vietnam in 2021 was delayed for several hours by an investigation into two possible cases of Havana Syndrome in Hanoi. At least two U.S. officials in Germany suffered symptoms linked to Havana Syndrome, the Wall Street Journal reported in August 2021. Weeks later, a CIA officer in India reported illness consist with Havana Syndrome, according to media reports at the time.","summary":"No definitive conclusions on the source of Havana Syndrome have ever been reached.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/havana-syndrome-map-shows-reported-cases-across-the-world-11349863","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP22174811076771-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-13 20:38:32","author":"Ellie Cook,John Feng","authors":["Ellie Cook","John Feng"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.481},{"id":392819746,"title":"Trump declares ‘economic boom’ as inflation persists","text":"President Donald Trump visited the swing state of Michigan on Tuesday to deliver a speech before the Detroit Economic Club, a nonpartisan, members-only organization. He falsely declared “inflation is defeated” and ranted his way through a familiar list of grievances — election fraud, transgender athletes and Republican defectors in Congress among them. \n\nThe speech was a crucial opportunity for the Trump administration, which has been trying to get the president to focus on affordability — a word he has repeatedly derided as a “Democrat hoax” — in swing states ahead of midterm elections. Those efforts have been largely unsuccessful so far: In Pennsylvania last month, Trump delivered a meandering speech in which he again called affordability a “hoax” and attacked former President Joe Biden using vulgarity.\n\nBut in Trump’s telling on Tuesday, the economy is his administration’s latest success story. \n\n“The results are in, and the Trump economic boom has officially begun,” he said. In a speech that lasted more than an hour and regularly went off script, Trump bragged about “almost no inflation and super high growth” and said that grocery prices and rents are down.\n\nBut federal data released Tuesday shows that inflation has remained almost unchanged, at 2.7% last month, with prices for food and housing on the rise. The GDP, on the other hand, was up by 4.3% in the third quarter of 2025, indicating economic growth. \n\nTrump also claimed that tariffs “are making money for Michigan,” insisting “they are paid by middlemen.” But tariffs are ultimately passed onto consumers, and the Yale Budget Lab estimates that Trump’s tariffs are costing the average American household $1,700 annually. He also said gasoline is “under $2 in many places” — but the national average is $2.80, according to AAA, and the lowest appears to be $2.20 in Oklahoma. (In Michigan, the state average is almost $2.90, according to the data.) \n\nThe economy remains a key issue for Michigan voters, who have complained of rising prices amid Trump’s aggressive tariff campaign, according to local polling. The poll, conducted by The Detroit News and local NBC affiliate WDIV, found that almost half of respondents — 48% — said Trump’s economic policies have made the economy weaker overall. More than 60% said their household costs have gone up in the past year. \n\nThe state, which narrowly voted for Trump’s re-election amid his promises to combat inflation, will be a focal point for the GOP in November, as Republicans seek to maintain control of two swing U.S. House districts they won in 2024. \n\nThe president often gets defensive when speaking on the economy. He told Politico last month he would grade the economy “an A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus,” and insisted that “prices are coming down,” despite evidence to the contrary. And in a breathless, defiant pre-Christmas address delivered from the White House, Trump blamed the cost-of-living crisis on Democrats and made baseless claims about the cost of gasoline and the status of inflation. \n\nThe blame game continued Tuesday, as the president faulted Democrats and his predecessor — whom he referred to as “sleepy Joe Biden” — for Americans’ economic woes. \n\nFollowing the speech, the Democratic National Committee cast Trump’s economy as “a disaster.”\n\n“Under Donald Trump’s failed economic policies, Michiganders are seeing their paychecks get tighter, and jobs disappear,” said DNC Chair Ken Martin in a press release. “And today, Trump tried to gaslight Michigan families once again — but they weren’t fooled — because new polling shows that Trump is disastrously unpopular in Michigan.”\n\nTrump has touted some economic wins in his second term: The prices of eggs, gasoline and Thanksgiving turkeys have all come down, and he has announced cost-cutting deals with several prescription drug companies. In his White House address last month, Trump announced so-called “warrior dividends” of $1,776 — “in honor of our nation’s founding in 1776” — that would be paid out to more than 1.45 million service members. \n\nTrump also recently announced a slate of new measures that he suggested would bring down prices for average Americans. Last week, he said he was calling for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates and that he would take immediate steps to “ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes” — a plan that appears similar to the housing plan put forward by former Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris. (Trump said Tuesday he would provide more details on that plan at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week.) And on Monday, Trump said in a Truth Social post that his administration was working with tech companies, including Microsoft, to bring down Americans’ electricity bills. \n\nBut some American consumers can expect hard times ahead as a result of various Trump-backed policies. Monthly premiums for the lowest-income enrollees of insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act have skyrocketed after subsidies expired on Jan. 1. In September, the health policy organization KFF estimated that enrollees’ monthly premiums would more than double. \n\nOn Tuesday, Trump teased even more actions to come to help bring prices down — with a caveat. \n\n“In the coming weeks, I will be laying out even more plans to help bring back affordability,” he said, “and remember — that’s a fake word by Democrats.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/trump-declares-economic-boom-as-inflation-persists","image":"https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/250113-donald-trump-es.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-13 20:33:39","author":"Julianne McShane","authors":["Julianne McShane"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.452},{"id":392924858,"title":"Tony Dokoupil, 'CBS Evening News' host, to interview Donald Trump - USA Today","text":"Newly minted \"CBS Evening News\" host Tony Dokoupil is set to interview President Donald Trump on Jan. 13.\n\nThe Tuesday interview comes as Dokoupil faced a bumpy first week on the job amid technical difficulties and other criticisms.

She campaigned against him and endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, writing that she was 'proud and honored' to support the Democratic candidate. \n\nTrump's niece added that the wedding was last October and only a small group of family and close friends attended. \n\nShe gushed over the newfound love in her life, adding: 'There is more to the story, of course - including the reason for my not having spoken of my marriage publicly before this - and times continue to be challenging.'\n\nMary also took the opportunity to condemn her uncle's administration, calling the first year of his second term 'as shocking as it is predictable.' \n\nAlthough she didn't reveal her wife's name in the post, author E Jean Carroll commented: 'MARY! MARY! AMERICA NEEDED SOME JOY! And you and Ronda are giving it to us!!!'\n\nCarroll was awarded $83 million in a New York civil court after she accused the President of sexually abusing her. \n\nMary has a daughter, Avary Linden Trump, from her first marriage. Her father, Fred Trump Jr, was the President's older brother. He died in 1981 from a heart attack linked to alcoholism. \n\nFred was one of Trump's four siblings, including Maryanne, Elizabeth and Robert. Elizabeth is the only one of Trump's siblings still alive. \n\nTrump has previously said that Fred's alcoholism was the reason why he never drank, telling the Washington Post in 2019: 'He was so handsome, and I saw what alcohol did to him even physically... and that had an impact on me, too.'\n\nMary, a trained psychologist, revealed the family's tumultuous dynamic in her 2024 memoir, Who Could Ever Love You. \n\nShe wrote about her father's alcoholism, how he competed with his siblings for their father's attention, and how his death at 42 impacted her. \n\n'Inadequately and only conditionally loved, there were no adults in her life except for the father she loved, but lost before she could know him; and a mother abandoned by her ex-husband’s rich and powerful family who demanded her loyalty but left her with nothing,' the memoir's description reads. \n\nMary's brother, Fred Trump III, has also repeatedly spoken out against Trump's policies. \n\nIn response to the President's use of the 'R' slur, the 63-year-old wrote on X in December: 'As the parent of a young adult with severe disabilities, the use of the 'R' word is never acceptable and is very hurtful. Where has this country gone that we even have to discuss this?'\n\nFred Trump III also wrote a book about the family's dark secrets titled All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way.","summary":"Mary Trump shared that she married her second wife in a private ceremony last October.
