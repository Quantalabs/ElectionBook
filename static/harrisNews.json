I’m no great Californian hippie, but you have to look after yourself, you really have to.”","summary":"He said the BBC stood against racism but it was ‘not appropriate for a journalist who may be covering that issue to be campaigning in that way’.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/tim-davie-bbc-black-lives-matter-reform-kamala-harris-b1253743.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/10/19/23/d4f472a6b2c406eaf56d2c54ebe340c1Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzYwOTk3NzMx-2.81540983.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 22:22:07","author":"Casey Cooper-Fiske","authors":["Casey Cooper-Fiske"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":370761928,"title":"Looking for a way forward, Democrats zero in on affordability","text":"Democratic candidates Zohran Mamdani of New York City and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey are separated by a river, but the gulf between them would appear to be larger than that. Mamdani, favored to become New York’s mayor, is a self-described democratic socialist. Sherrill, who aspires to be her state’s next governor, is a former Navy helicopter pilot and centrist trying to woo moderates back to her party.\n\nSherrill, along with another centrist candidate, Abigail Spanberger, who is running for Virginia governor, are pitching themselves as the Democrats’ best hope in the November elections for flipping the page after President Donald Trump’s victory. While they are advocating pragmatism and consensus-driven solutions, Mamdani is pushing for a set of left-wing policies that would take the party in a new direction. Despite their differences, all three have zeroed in on what Democrats hope will be a winning strategy that carries over to the 2026 midterm elections: the high cost of living for everyday Americans. Each campaign is channeling the same voter frustration – that everything from energy to healthcare to groceries feels increasingly unaffordable.\n\n“That is the pain point right now with voters,” said Mark Riddle, president of Future Majority, a Democratic firm that conducts voter research. “And they’re blaming Trump.”\n\nDemocrats seek to use Trump’s economy against him\n\nSince Democrats lost both the White House and Congress last year, the party has been searching for a policy framework and fresh voices. Success in the key Nov. 4 mayoral and gubernatorial elections could help translate into victories next year, when control of both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs, strategists say.\n\nOne reason Trump won last year was that same economic anxiety. But Democrats argue that Trump slapping high tariffs on imports and his “Big Beautiful” tax bill have only made things worse.\n\nWhile inflation overall has cooled during Trump’s presidency, staples such as food, housing and power remain significantly more expensive than just a few years ago. Grocery prices are up 2.7% over a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while home electricity costs have jumped 6.2% and home gas prices have shot up 13.8% over a year ago.\n\nAfter record-breaking price increases in 2021 and 2022, home values have continued to rise, though at a slower pace — now closer to 3% annually. But rent and shelter costs, which factor heavily into the Consumer Price Index, haven’t meaningfully cooled. The cost of medical services excluding prescription drugs has increased 4.2% in the last year.\n\nAbout half of Americans polled in a June Reuters/Ipsos poll said they were “very concerned” about the cost of living. The issue is something of a thorn in Trump’s side: In another Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month, just 27% of respondents said they approved of his performance on the cost of living. Meanwhile, the price of imported goods has shot up 4% during Trump’s time in office, with the cost of domestic goods increasing 2%, according to a Reuters’ analysis this month. But while polls show voters are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of the economy, they continue to trust Republicans more than Democrats to fix it. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in September found Americans were more likely to trust the Republican Party over the Democratic Party (34% to 24%) on managing economic policy.\n\nTrump has repeatedly boasted about his economic record, arguing he’s lowered prices and inflation and that his tariffs regime is a success.\n\n“We’ve had the best economy we’ve ever had,” he said at a Cabinet meeting this month.\n\nSearching for a way forward\n\nThe Democratic Party has spent much of 2025 trying to figure out what went wrong last year. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential nominee, has toured states speaking to party officials about his ticket’s failure to reassure voters about their everyday concerns.\n\nMamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger, the three most high-profile candidates running this year, have responded by promoting affordability as a central campaign theme.\n\nSpanberger’s “Affordable Virginia” plan focuses on lowering healthcare, housing, and energy costs. Part of the plan would seek to force tech data centers to pay “their fair share” of electricity costs. A former CIA officer, she has also emphasized how federal job cuts and the U.S. government shutdown is damaging her state, which is reliant on federal jobs.\n\nSherrill’s “Affordability Agenda” targets similar cost-of-living concerns. She has pledged to declare a statewide energy emergency and freeze rates.\n\n“Housing, healthcare, and utility costs — I’ll tackle them immediately,” Sherrill said during a debate with Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli this month.\n\nCiattarelli is also promoting his “affordability agenda” – one that cuts taxes and regulations and argues that Sherrill’s plans are anti-growth.\n\nRecent polls show that Sherrill’s lead over Ciattarelli is hovering around 6 percentage points. Spanberger’s lead over her opponent, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, has fluctuated between 3 and 10 points, depending on the poll.\n\nMamdani’s agenda includes a rent freeze, free bus service, universal childcare, and city-run grocery stores. He has drawn fire from Republicans, who cast him as a radical, and from some Democrats, including his rival for mayor, Andrew Cuomo, who argues that Mamdani’s policies are unworkable and would lead to large tax increases.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Mamdani with a 13-point lead over Cuomo.\n\nRebecca Katz, a New York Democratic operative whose firm, Fight, has produced ads on behalf of Mamdani’s campaign, warned that Democrats would be imprudent to dismiss his success.\n\n“If and when he wins in November, Democrats shouldn’t write him off,” Katz said. “They should look at why his message resonated.”","summary":"Democratic candidates Zohran Mamdani of New York City and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey are separated by a river, but the gulf between them would appear to be larger than that.

As the editor-in-chief of CBS News, Weiss posed a challenging question that caught the journalists off guard: why do viewers perceive their reporting as biased?\n\nThe 41-year-old, who champions political neutrality as a core value for the network, directed this pointed inquiry at the team on Tuesday, according to a report by The New York Times. Her question, simple yet profound, was met with silence from the room, which includes some of the most prominent figures in American journalism.\n\nWeiss’s inquiry reportedly created an awkward atmosphere, as noted by three anonymous sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe question was directed at a group of seasoned reporters, including Anderson Cooper, who also serves as a prominent anchor at CNN, and Lesley Stahl. These reporters pride themselves on their commitment to impartiality, insiders revealed.\n\nDespite claims from former President Donald Trump and other conservative voices suggesting a leftist bias, the 60 Minutes team has consistently denied such allegations, defending their work as objective and balanced.\n\nThey have fiercely rejected the idea perpetuated by Donald Trump and other conservatives that their coverage is left-leaning. \n\nWeiss has already caused a stir in her first two weeks filling the network’s top position, in which she vowed to provide news for the American ‘mainstream’ who have been ‘ill-served’ by the media. \n\nHer background as a vocal opinion journalist with no previous broadcast experience has made her a controversial pick for editor-in-chief. \n\nShe co-founded The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance is acquiring, and formerly worked as a NY Times opinion editor, but left the role due to the company’s ‘illiberal environment’ in 2020. \n\nWhile her official start date at CBS News was October 6, an insider previously told the Daily Mail she had been ‘informally consulting’ the company for ‘a while.’ \n\nHer hiring by new Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, the son of billionaire Trump ally Larry Ellison, made waves within the CBS newsroom after a tumultuous year.\n\nIn October last year, Donald Trump sued the network over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that he claimed was deceptively edited.\n\nParamount ultimately agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle the lawsuit. \n\nThat settlement paved the way for the administration’s approval of an $8billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount in August. \n\nCBS News – specifically 60 Minutes – was also heavily criticized for its coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nNetwork veteran Stahl specifically came under fire over her treatment of a Hamas hostage, with conservatives accusing her of being sympathetic towards the terrorist group in a damning April interview. \n\nStahl was slammed after she asked former hostage Keith Siegel if Hamas terrorists starved him on purpose or if they just did not have any food to hand out. \n\nSeigel, who spent 484 days in captivity, replied: ‘No, I think they starved me, and they would often eat in front of me and not offer me food.’ \n\nNot long after, 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon both resigned over concerns with the company’s direction. \n\nDespite his previous run-ins with CBS, Trump recently told CNN the network will be ‘fairer’ with Weiss and Ellison in charge. ‘CBS has great potential,’ he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBari Weiss, known for her stance against progressive ideologies, recently left the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Bari Weiss Leaves 60 Minutes Team Speechless with Bold Question on Media Bias first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/bari-weiss-leaves-60-minutes-team-speechless-with-bold-question-on-media-bias/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CBS-News-editor-Bari-Weiss-stuns-60-Minutes-journalists-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 21:27:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.188},{"id":370757406,"title":"Eric Trump, at the Nixon Library, talks culture wars and his father’s presidency","text":"Eric Trump, the second son of the president, was at the Nixon Presidential Library & Museum on Sunday morning, where he spoke about culture wars, the mainstream media and the growing power of young conservatives.\n\nSpeaking before a friendly crowd — many wore caps with President Donald Trump‘s “Make America Great Again” slogan emblazoned on them — Trump said the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and issues like transgender student-athletes’ participation in sports are driving a legion of young men to the Republican Party.\n\n“The youth male vote of this country didn’t want to see guys my size swimming against women in collegiate women’s sports,” Trump said during the event on Sunday, Oct. 19. “The youth of this country are energized, they’re engaged, and they’ve switched. Do you think they’re ever going back to the Democratic Party? Not a chance?”\n\nThe Trump scion reflected on the current political climate during a conversation about his new memoir “Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation,” which details the legal challenges and indictments, as well as the perceived smears from mainstream media, that his family has faced since his father was first elected president in 2016.\n\n“It’s been a siege for all of us. It’s a siege for this family …The good news is we won,” he said to loud applause from the crowd.\n\nThe discussion was moderated by Chris Nixon Cox, a board member of the Richard Nixon Foundation and grandson of former President Richard Nixon.\n\nTrump said his father’s defeat in the 2020 presidential election might, in hindsight, be “the greatest thing that’s ever happened to this nation.” Fueled by shortcomings of the Biden presidency, he said, Republicans now control both chambers of Congress, the Supreme Court and every swing state.\n\nThe whole country has shifted to the right, Trump told the crowd, including in California, where his father increased his vote share in 45 of 58 counties in 2024, according to a Calmatters analysis. In Orange County, Donald Trump lost to then-Vice President Kamala Harris by just 3%, after losing to Joe Biden by 9% in 2020.\n\nThe day before Eric Trump spoke in Yorba Linda, thousands of demonstrators across California took to the streets Saturday to participate in the second “No Kings” protest of the year. The protests were part of thousands of rallies held across the country, in cities large and small, to express concern about the future of the country and democracy.\n\n“Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation” was released Oct. 14.","summary":"President Donald Trump's second son spoke about his best-selling new memoir and his family's battles against the mainstream media.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/19/eric-trump-at-the-nixon-library-talks-culture-wars-and-his-fathers-presidency/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-L-ERICTRUMP-1020-2-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 21:21:12","author":"Claire Wang","authors":["Claire Wang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":370735600,"title":"Black Lives Matter not welcome in BBC newsroom, says Tim Davie","text":"Black Lives Matter is not welcome in the BBC newsroom, although some staff find that difficult to accept, Tim Davie has said.\n\nThe director-general said personal politics had no place in the Corporation’s news department amid repeated controversy over BBC impartiality.\n\n“You leave it at the door and your religion is journalism at the BBC. And the problem I’ve got is that people react quite chemically to that,” Mr Davie told the Cheltenham Literature Festival.\n\n“So you can’t come into the newsroom with a Black Lives Matter T-shirt.\n\n“We stand absolutely firmly against racism in any form.

No way.”\n\nMr Davie also denied bringing his own politics to work.\n\nIn the 1990s, he stood unsuccessfully as a Tory councillor and was deputy chairman of the Hammersmith and Fulham Conservative Party.\n\n“Everyone wants to ascribe a political layer on me. I’m not affiliated in any way because I did some politics 30 years ago. It’s all nonsense,” he said.\n\nMr Davie defended the BBC’s coverage of Nigel Farage and Reform, after an audience member asked why the party and its leader were featured so regularly when they have so few MPs.\n\n“We don’t just look at the number of MPs. That wouldn’t reflect where everyone is,” said Mr Davie, pointing out how highly Reform is polling.\n\n“This is uncomfortable territory for some people [but] I think it would be fatal if you’re not giving a voice to a large swathe of people supporting Reform, putting their politicians up and interrogating them,” he said, adding that the BBC must avoid “any whiff of sneering” about Reform.\n\nMr Davie revealed that he may write a book when he leaves his post, although it will not be a diary of his time at the BBC.\n\nHe said: “I’m a frustrated novelist.

Katy Neubauer told Fox News host Harris Faulkner her 8-year-old daughter was handed the offensive bracelet by a volunteer at the booth run by the Winnebago County Democratic Party.\n\n“We were down at the farmer’s market having a conversation, my sister-in-law next to their booth and they had free children’s books out and bubbles blowing in the wind and the kids were having a great time and we didn’t think much of it and continued our conversation,” Neubauer said. “And out of the corner of my eye I see the man leaning over and giving one of our children a bracelet and I kinda waited for it.”\n\n“I thought oh, this will be fun, you know, whatever. But the child runs over, hands it to us and we both look down and my sister-in-law says I don’t really know what it says and I said it says, ‘Is he dead yet?’ and we both kind of look at each other in shock and I walk back over to the table and hand it back to him and I had said we don’t wear hate speech here,” Neubauer continued. “And I had to walk away because I was seething.”\n\nA Rutgers survey showing 56% of “left-of-center” respondents saying that assassinating Trump would be at least partially justifiable was released in April. Neubauer said that after a while, she returned to confront the people at the booth.\n\n“I went and continued and bought a few more items and then I decided to confront them a second time. So, at that point I started going through the bracelets and found others that contained not-so-nice language, including 8647, which I’m sure you’ve heard that one before,” Neubauer said, with Faulkner responding, “Yeah.”\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey posted, then deleted, a photo of seashells on a beach that had the “8647” meme, which has connotations of wishing for Trump to be killed.\n\n“I said are any of these appropriate for children? He said no, I suppose they’re not. And I said okay, then why are you handing them to my 8-year-old child?” Neubauer continued. “I read off a couple others to them and he picked up the basket and said here, I will remove them then. I said okay, that would be a good start. So that’s how that came about.”\n\nThe manager of the Oshkosh Farmers Market, Michelle Schmid-Schultz, told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that the Winnebago County Democratic Party’s booth at the market had been banned for the rest of the 2025 season, and that its fate in future years would be decided at a November meeting. Faulkner asked Neubauer what brought about the market’s decision to kick the Democrats out.\n\n“I called the farmers market manager as I was walking home,” Neubauer said. “We live very close to downtown, our kids actually have a farmer’s market booth every other week and we’re down there a lot and we know the manager and she was very kind and she said you aren’t the first person to call and complain about their booth today. In fact, there were about ten complaints total that particular day.”\n\nThe Winnebago County Democratic Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Meaning the American public’s attachment to freedom wasn’t so deathless that the country wouldn’t soon be ripped apart in civil war over whether fellow human beings should be kept as slaves.\n\nWho were these common people, anyway? Who are they now? The millions who turned out Saturday for massive “No Kings” rallies across the country? Or the millions more who voted for the president three times? Who support him now, and who will continue to do so no matter what. Even if he runs for a third term in direct violation of the U.S. Constitution?\n\nWe were divided then. We are divided now. In 2024, 49.8% of voters cast a ballot for Donald Trump. And 48.3% voted for Kamala Harris. Almost an even split.\n\nOnce, a tight election might have led to efforts toward bridge building, reconciliation. Now Trump is implementing radical change by executive fiat, without congressional approval or concern for public reaction, which was in full cry Saturday.\n\nI slid over to the “No Kings” protest in Highland Park and was immediately struck by just how old everybody seemed. Gray hair, walkers, wheelchairs.\n\nWhy is that?\n\n“It’s an older crowd because we remember the way America was, and we want to get it back,” said Betty Kleinberg, 83, of Deerfield. “It wasn’t perfect, but it was better than it is now. We’re doing this for our grandchildren.”\n\n“I’m a very active member of our community and am so appalled by everything going on,” Joanne Hoffman, 92. “As long as I still have my wits about me, I’m going to keep doing this.”\n\nYou must really want to be here, I told Phil Reinstein, 87, tapping his rollator.\n\n“I do,” he said. “To try to save this country.”\n\nBut as I looked around, I realized something — the impression of an elderly crowd was premature, formed by noticing other cautious seniors such as myself who showed up half an hour early. A self-selected group. As the event unfolded, I realized there were plenty of families and children, too.\n\n“We need more young people,” said Grace Goodrich, 25, of Northbrook there with her father Paul. “It’s going to eventually affect us more. We need to stand up for what makes this country great.”\n\nJennifer Eason came with her 9-year-old daughter, Victoria.\n\n“I’m here because Donald Trump is doing bad things,” the 4th grader said.\n\nBetsy and Curtis Porter of Glencoe brought their 6-year-old son Ethan, already at his second protest — he also went to the first “No Kings” protest in June. I asked him why he was there.\n\n“America is free,” said the 2nd grader.\n\nAnd what does being free mean?\n\n“We make our own choices,” Ethan said.\n\nSometimes those choices conflict. Several came to protest but didn’t want their own voices cited. A woman holding a sign reading “I’M A 77 YEAR OLD GRANNY FOR FREEDOM” quailed at the prospect of having her photo in the newspaper.\n\n“I want to live,” she explained, fleeing.\n\nThat conflict — speak out versus shield yourself — is found in the best of us. Always has been.\n\nWhitman is remembered for his poem’s bold opening line. “I celebrate myself.” Less known is that he published the book anonymously — well, without his name. His included a title page photo of himself, looking very rakish, hand in pocket, in an open shirt and wide-brimmed hat.\n\n“Do I contradict myself?” Whitman asks. “Very well then I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes.)”\n\nAs do we all. The United States is large: 340 million people. Of course, our multitudes contradict ourselves and each other. The trick is for that third of a billion people to realize we’re all in the same country and must somehow get along.\n\nOr not. As bad as it seems today, it can always get worse.\n\nEight years after Whitman was celebrating his fellow Americans for their “generosity of spirit” —\"The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem ... not merely a nation but a teeming nation of nations” — he was volunteering at a Washington, D.C., hospital, tending to the wounded and dying harvested from blood-soaked battlefields.\n\nDon’t say it can’t happen; it has before.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2025/10/19/no-kings-protest-chicago-politics-donald-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cef5f64/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3043x2480+0+0/resize/1486x1211!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2Fea%2F5640fa994216a20f095a009addb7%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 15:46:55","author":"Neil Steinberg","authors":["Neil Steinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":370719206,"title":"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Caves to Outrage, Apologizes for Supporting Trump on National Guard Deployment","text":"Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce and a long-time Democrat megadonor and activist, has caved to leftist outrage, apologizing for his comments supporting President Donald Trump’s potential deployment of the National Guard to San Francisco.\n\nCNBC reports that Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, has expressed his regret for suggesting that President Donald Trump should send the National Guard to San Francisco to address safety concerns. Benioff’s initial comments, made in an interview with the New York Times, sparked controversy and drew criticism from local politicians and leftist radicals.\n\n“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff wrote in his apology post.\n\nThe Trump administration has recently deployed the National Guard to cities like Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, leading to protests, lawsuits, and the detention of citizens and immigrants without legal representation. Benioff’s apparent support for similar action in San Francisco was met with swift backlash.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and San Francisco politicians issued statements and held press conferences to emphasize that federal troops are not welcome in the city and that crime rates are declining. Prominent startup investor Ron Conway, who has backed companies like Google, Airbnb, and Stripe, resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday, citing a misalignment of values with Benioff.\n\nConway, a longtime Democratic donor and member of VCs for Kamala, had donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris’ unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign. While Benioff has supported Democrats in the past, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris, his recent comments led some to speculate about a potential shift in his political alignment.\n\nDavid Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar and a longtime friend of Elon Musk, suggested that Benioff could join the Republican party, stating, “Dear Marc @Benioff, if the Democrats don’t want you, we would be happy for you to join our team. Cancel culture is over, and we are the inclusive party.”\n\nFollowing Benioff’s initial comments, Elon Musk and other right-wing figures amplified the message, with Musk characterizing downtown San Francisco as a “drug zombie apocalypse.” President Trump also weighed in, calling San Francisco “a mess” and suggesting the possibility of sending in the National Guard.\n\nIn response to the growing controversy, Benioff attempted to walk back his comments on X, stating that safety is “first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.” However, the damage had already been done, and the CEO faced mounting pressure to address the issue more directly.\n\nBenioff’s apology on Friday aimed to clarify his stance and reaffirm his commitment to working with local leaders to address safety concerns in San Francisco. “My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,” he wrote. “It’s my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership.”\n\nRead more at CNBC here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.","summary":"Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce and a long-time Democrat megadonor and activist, has caved to leftist outrage, apologizing for his comments supporting President Donald Trump's potential deployment of the National Guard to San Francisco.\n\n\nThe post Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Caves to Outrage, Apologizes for Supporting Trump on National Guard Deployment appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/10/19/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-caves-to-outrage-apologizes-for-supporting-trump-on-national-guard-deployment/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/Salesforce-CEO-Marc-Benioff-and-Gavin-Newsom-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 15:43:41","author":"Lucas Nolan","authors":["Lucas Nolan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":370672224,"title":"As Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirm their unexpected relationship - all the celebrities you might not know who have dated politicians","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParis launches huge manhunt after priceless Napoleonic jewels stolen from the Louvre as the Mail reveals the audacious daylight raid minute-by-minute\n\nKing Charles is seen for the first time since Prince Andrew gave up his remaining titles following fresh string of scandals\n\nPrince Andrew is first royal to be caught up in criminal probe in more than 20 years as Met Police 'actively' investigates claims he asked personal protection officer to dig up dirt on Virginia Guiffre\n\nWhat the rich are doing now to shield their wealth from the Budget... and here's how to make their ploys work for you\n\nHow to ditch weight-loss jabs WITHOUT piling the pounds back on: Food cravings return the moment you stop injecting say experts, so follow these eight key rules to keep the weight off for good\n\nVirginia Giuffre lost her baby days after 'orgy with Prince Andrew and eight other girls'\n\nEmotional Meghan Markle is moved to tears at charity tennis tournament in memory of her best friend's late son\n\nI don't care if it makes him happy.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA PARKIN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:14:01 BST, 19 October 2025 |Updated:15:52 BST, 19 October 2025 \n\nKaty Perry confirmed her relationship with former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau this week when they packed on the PDA during a yacht trip. \nThe singer, 40, was pictured kissing the politician, 53, on board her boat off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, The Mail on Sunday revealed. \nSpeculation about a budding romance between the pair had been rife since July when they were spotted having an intimate dinner in Montreal. However, both have refused to comment on their relationship status.\nJustin's father, the dashing Pierre, was Canada's much-loved prime minister from 1968-1984 and dated a string of celebrities himself. \nA bachelor when he was elected to the top job, Pierre dated actresses Barbra Streisand and Kim Cattrall. \nSo, as Katy isn't the only celebrity to have dated a politician, here is a number of stars who have also enjoyed rather surprising relationships. \n\nKaty Perry confirmed her relationship with former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau this week when they packed on the PDA during a yacht trip\n\nBut the singer isn't the only celebrity to have dated a politician... with a number of stars also having enjoyed rather surprising relationships (Justin pictured in March)\n\nJustin's father, the dashing Pierre, was Canada's much-loved prime minister from 1968-1984 and dated a string of celebrities himself (pictured with Kim Cattrall in 1981)\nKim Cattrall\nSex and the City star Kim Cattrall is believed to have dated former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1981.\n'He was so incredibly sexy. He was very soft-spoken, incredibly smart, sensitive,' the actress once said. \nIn 2016, CBS were forced to make an embarrassing apology after they mistook actress Kim for the Canadian prime minister Justin's mother.\nDuring the 60 Minutes feature with Justin, a photo of the Sex and the City star with his father Pierre was shown as the interviewer spoke about his mother Margaret.\nThe picture was taken in 1981, while the actress was on a date with the then-Canadian prime minister. \nBarbra Streisand\n\nBefore dating Kim, Pierre also enjoyed a relationship with Barbra Streisand which began in in the late-1960s.\nBefore dating Kim, Pierre also enjoyed a relationship with Barbra Streisand which began in in the late-1960s. \nThe actress was 27, while he was 50, which she later said was the reason why their relationship didn't work out. \nWriting in her memoir, My Name Is Barbra, she recalled first meeting him in 1968 at the premiere for her film Funny Girl.\nIn the publication she admitted how she had said to a friend: 'That’s the kind of man I’d like to date' before reconnecting with him the following year. \nBarbra added: 'Trudeau was very dapper, intelligent, intense ... kind of a combination of Albert Einstein and Napoleon (only taller). And he was doing important work. I was dazzled.\n'He was so elegant, yet totally unpretentious and perpetually curious ... an adventurer who had backpacked through the Middle East and Asia as a young man.' \nAfter dating for a short amount of time, Barbra became 'scared of the intensity' and admitted: 'But for me, there was something missing. My brain was in love, but not my body.' \nThe two remained friends until his death in 2000, after which she said: 'The world lost a great leader and I lost a great friend.'\nElizabeth Taylor \n\nElizabeth Taylor led an infamously scandalous life with many men and a mindboggling eight marriages. Her sixth husband was US senator John Warner (pictured)\nElizabeth Taylor, one of the great Hollywood beauties, led an infamously scandalous life with many men and a mindboggling eight marriages, to seven different men. \nHer sixth husband US senator John Warner, who she first met on a blind date in 1976 after she had broken up with Richard Burton for the second time.\nThey said 'I do' that December on Warner's farm near Middleburg, Virginia, and his marriage to a movie star drew huge crowds when he was elected to the Senate in 1978. However, their marriage was short-lived and they divorced in 1982.\nThe actress wrote later that they remained friends, but she 'just couldn't bear the intense loneliness' when he became engrossed in his Senate duties.\nDuring the marriage, Elizabeth, known for her seductive violet eyes and once spectacular figure – unhappy with her life as a senator's wife in the ritzy and conservative Georgetown enclave – ate and drank so much that she ballooned 40 pounds to more than 170 pounds. \nShe told Larry King in 2001: 'Well, I thought we would get married, live on the farm, raise horses... And I thought it would be all very sort of farmish, and jobby, horsey, and I could have animals, and I would go out and brand the cattle.'\n'I don't think I've ever been so alone in my life as when I was Mrs. Senator, and I don't blame my ex-husband,' Taylor wrote in her 1987 book 'Elizabeth Takes Off.' \n'He never pretended to be anything but a man devoted to public service, and once that service began in earnest, I had to take a backseat to his constituency.'\nJane Fonda \n\nJane Fonda was married to California State Senator Tom Hayden from 1973-1990\nAfter Jane Fonda officially finalised her divorce from Roger Vadim in 1973 she went on to marry her second husband, left-wing activist and politician Tom Hayden, just three days later.\nThe couple held their nuptials at an intimate ceremony at her home in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, and would soon welcome son Troy. \nThey channeled their energies into tackling civil rights and antiwar causes, including founding the Indochina Peace campaign, which advocated to end American involvement in the Vietnam War and to end funding for the South Vietnam military.\nIn 1977, the couple went one step further with their philanthropy when they bought land in California to set up a performing arts summer camp for disadvantaged children.\nThe camp, which was called Laurel Springs and ran for 14 years, used creativity as a way to build self-esteem and cooperation among children of all races and socio-economic backgrounds.\nIt was there that the couple met Mary Williams - a child of Black Panther Party members.\nJane quickly struck up a mother-daughter relationship with the youngster and went on to officially adopt the then 16-year-old in 1982.\nThe couple eventually decided to call it quits after 17 years of marriage and finalized their divorce in 1990. \nShe later confessed that she used to hide her Oscars during her 17-year marriage to activist Tom to 'play down the Hollywood part of herself'. \nMontel Williams\n\nPopular talk show host Montel Williams dated 49th vice president of the United States Kamala Harris back in 2001\nPopular talk show host Montel Williams dated 49th vice president of the United States Kamala Harris back in 2001. \nThe presidential hopeful was working for the San Francisco City Attorney's Office at the time when a photo of her and Montel ran in Ebony and Jet after they attended a gala event in Los Angeles. \nShe was identified as his girlfriend in both outlets.\nDaily Mail obtained video from the event that shows Harris walking the red carpet while holding Williams' hand and then posing for photographers with her arm around his waist.\nThe former couple had plenty in common, including a commitment to public service as Montel served in both the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy.\nThe relationship between the two was a brief one, and by the following year Williams was seen at events with a new lady love while Harris was preparing to launch her successful campaign for District Attorney of San Francisco. \nHe would go on to marry third wife Tara Folwer in 2006, while Harris settled down in 2014 with Douglas Emhoff. \n\nFormer Lib Dem leader for Wales, Lembit Öpik attracted widespread ridicule for his fling with ‘Cheeky Girl’ Gabriela Irimia (pictured in 2008) \n\nThey dated on and off for over two years - with the singer hailing him ‘the best lover I’ve ever had’ - and were even briefly engaged (pictured: Opik and Gabriela, right, and her twin Monica)\nThe Cheeky Girl's Gabriela Irimia \nFormer Lib Dem leader for Wales, Lembit Öpik attracted widespread ridicule for his fling with ‘Cheeky Girl’ Gabriela Irimia, setting off a chain of events that - according to Öpik - ultimately led to his dramatic fall from grace.\nWhen he started dating weather presenter Siân Lloyd in 2002, he was ‘flattered’ to be welcomed into the glittering world of celebrity, and appearances on Have I Got News For You and Who Wants to be a Millionaire soon followed.\nBut a chance meeting with Romanian ‘Cheeky Girl’ Gabriela Irimia swiftly followed his split with then-fiancée Lloyd (despite popular belief he insists his burgeoning relationship was not in any way linked to the end of their engagement).\nÖpik and Irimia met while appearing on Channel 5's The All Star Talent Show - he playing the harmonica and she doing ballet - and romance soon blossomed.\nThe couple, who had a 17-year age gap, became instant tabloid catnip and his love life soon eclipsed his career in the eyes of the public. \nThey dated on and off for over two years - with Irimia hailing him ‘the best lover I’ve ever had’ - and were even briefly engaged after Öpik popped the question in front of Rome’s Trevi Fountain.\nTheir engagement lasted just four months, with work commitments ultimately forcing them apart.\nMarylin Monroe\n\nPresident John F Kennedy was rumoured to have had a torrid affair with Marilyn Monroe\n\nMarilyn pictured with President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy on May 19, 1962 where she famously sang Happy Birthday\nMarilyn Monroe is as much defined by her talent and legacy as a global sex symbol was rumoured to have had a torrid affair with President John F Kennedy. \nFor decades, rumours swirled that she was killed over her romantic relationships with the president and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy.\nThree months after she took the stage of Madison Square Garden in a sultry, skin-tight dress to wish President Kennedy a 'happy birthday' - she was found dead in her Brentwood home, at the age of 36 from a 'probable overdose.' \nGossip columnist Dorothy Kilgallen noted at the time: 'It seemed like Marilyn was making love to the president in front of 40 million Americans.' \nMarilyn's on-and-off affair with John Kennedy began in the early 1950s when he was then just a Senator from Massachusetts, and a relative unknown in Hollywood. \n'No one ever expected Jack to become the president or the nominee,' said Monroe's longtime confident, Arthur James in a Netflix documentary. He was 'just some smart-a** rich man's son that became a senator.' \nAt the time, the actress was experiencing a rapid decline in her mental health.\n'Whatever the exact nature of the Kennedy brothers' relationship with Marilyn, they were playing with fire,' said investigative journalist Anthony Summers in the doc. 'Those who wanted to get the dirt on Jack and Bobby Kennedy.'\nCarla Bruni \n\nItalian-French former model Carla Bruni married France's former president Nicolas Sarkozy following a whirlwind romance in 2008\nItalian-French former model Carla Bruni married France's former president Nicholas Sarkozy following a whirlwind romance in 2008. \nSpeaking to Harper's Bazaar earlier this year, she said she isn't a 'revolutionary person' and would never have 'entered politics on my own' if it wasn't for love.\n'I don't like big movements or militias. I don't even like politics or power. I don't believe in human action. I believe more in the Universe, in the sacred.'\nNicholas was president between 2007-2012, with Carla admiting she lived in fear her husband would be assassinated. But despite the struggles, it was an honour to serve as First Lady.\n'It was an extraordinary time, but I was scared all the time. 'I was scared all the time for my husband, I was scared for myself, that I'd do something I wasn't supposed to do.\n'I was afraid someone who tell or make up a story. It's such a high role, I felt I was a target,' she told local daily talk show Quotidien in 2020. \nThis month, Nicholas was sentenced to five years behind bars after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy over efforts by close aides to procure funds for his 2007 presidential bid from Libya during the rule of late dictator Muammar Gaddafi.\nHe was acquitted by a Paris court of all other charges, including corruption and receiving illegal campaign financing.\nSarkozy has already said he will appeal the verdict, which he denounced as 'extremely serious for rule of law'.\nCarla's biographer Besma Lahouri wrote in The Times: 'While she waits for her own fate to be decided, Bruni, an excellent cook, will visit her husband every day, I’m willing to bet. \n'Smart, bright and fiercely loyal, she will move heaven and earth to get him out of prison as quickly as possible.' \nCheryl Hines \n\nActress Cheryl Hines has been married to the current United States secretary of health and human services, Robert Kennedy Jr., since 2014\nActress Cheryl Hines has been married to the current United States secretary of health and human services, Robert Kennedy Jr., since 2014. \nThey married in a low-key but starry celebration in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\nShe wore a Jackie Kennedy inspired dress, guests dined on steamed lobster and a clam bake and Natasha Bedingfield serenaded the couple with her hit song, 'Unwritten.' \nHowever, this year, sources told the Daily Mail exclusively that Cheryl is 'absolutely still recovering from the emotional shock and pain' she received last September when her husband got caught up in a scandalous sexting affair with a woman half his age that ignited divorce chatter.\nThey have now seemingly made up. \n'Cheryl doesn't feel Bobby can be trusted one iota living on his own, in D.C., even part-time, with so many attractive women and Kennedy groupies around, as he gets settled in his powerful new position,' one insider said. \n'So she's given him a strict ultimatum – move me or else.'\nHines's rep did not return DailyMail.com's request for comment. \nCheryl has been a part of the Hollywood celebrity scene for years and the couple shares a $6million estate in the exclusive Brentwood section of LA.\nBut sources said: 'Cheryl's willing to sacrifice all that glamorous lifestyle to become a political wife, move to D.C. forthwith, and live in trendy Georgetown, so she can keep a close watch on Bobby.' \nSheryl Lee Ralph \n\nSheryl Lee Ralph tied the knot with Democrat Senator Hughes in 2005 after two years of dating\nSheryl Lee Ralph tied the knot with Democrat Senator Hughes in 2005 after two years of dating. \nThe actress and her husband don't live under the same roof and don't see the revelation as a big deal. \nAsked why he thought the news caused a stir, Hughes told Entertainment Tonight: 'I don't know why, we've been commuting ever since the beginning and it has worked for us so it's cool!' \nThe Abbott Elementary star previously admitted that because of logistics regarding both of their careers they end up seeing each other just once every two weeks - but insisted that because they have been together for so long now, the setup has 'worked' for them despite causing controversy amongst fans.\nShe said: 'Vincent and I have been married going on 19 years. We've been together 21 years. Abbott Elementary is shot in Los Angeles. \n'My husband, as a senator, is always in his Capitol, so I don't know what magic people think we're gonna do. \n'We see each other on the average of every two weeks. And everybody who questions that I say, guess what? We're still married.

But a 'Trump slump' made life worse","text":"Aaron Mahan is a lifelong Republican who twice voted for Donald Trump. He had high hopes putting a businessman in the White House and, although he found the president's monster ego grating, Mahan voted for his reelection. Mostly, he said, out of party loyalty. By 2024, however, he'd had enough. \"I just saw more of the bad qualities, more of the ego,\" said Mahan, who's worked for decades as a food server on and off the Las Vegas Strip. \"And I felt like he was at least partially running to stay out of jail.\" Mahan couldn't bring himself to support Kamala Harris. He's never backed a Democrat for president. So when illness overtook him on election day, it was a good excuse to stay in bed and not vote. He's no Trump hater, Mahan said. \"I don't think he's evil.\" Rather, the 52-year-old calls himself \"a Trump realist,\" seeing the good and the bad. Here's Mahan's reality: A big drop in pay. Depletion of his emergency savings. Stress every time he pulls into a gas station or visits the supermarket. Mahan used to blithely toss things in his grocery cart. \"Now,\" he said, \"you have to look at prices, because everything is more expensive.\" In short, he's living through the worst combination of inflation and economic malaise he's experienced since he began waiting tables after finishing high school. Las Vegas lives on tourism, the industry irrigated by rivers of disposable income. The decline of both has resulted in a painful downturn that hurts all the more after the pent-up demand and go-go years following the crippling COVID-19 shutdown. Over the last 12 months, the number of visitors has dropped significantly and those who do come to Las Vegas are spending less. Passenger arrivals at Harry Reid International Airport, a short hop from the Strip, have declined and room nights, a measure of hotel occupancy, have also fallen. Mahan, who works at the Virgin resort casino just off the Strip, blames the slowdown in large part on Trump's failure to tame inflation, his tariffs and pugnacious immigration and foreign policies that have antagonized people — and prospective visitors — around the world. \"His general attitude is, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do, and you're going to like it or leave it.' And they're leaving it,\" Mahan said. \"The Canadians aren't coming. The Mexicans aren't coming. The Europeans aren't coming in the way they did. But also the people from Southern California aren't coming the way they did either.\" Mahan has a way of describing the buckling blow to Las Vegas' economy. He calls it \"the Trump slump.\" :: Mahan was an Air Force brat who lived throughout the United States and, for a time, in England before his father retired from the military and started looking for a place to settle. Mahan's mother grew up in Sacramento and liked the mountains that ring Las Vegas. They reminded her of the Sierra Nevada. Mahan's father had worked intermittently as a bartender. It was a skill of great utility in Nevada's expansive hospitality industry. So the desert metropolis it was. Mahan was 15 when his family landed. After high school, he attended college for a time and started working in the coffee shop at the Barbary Coast hotel and casino. He then moved on to the upscale Gourmet Room. The money was good; Mahan had found his career. From there he moved to Circus Circus and then, in 2005, the Hard Rock hotel and casino, where he's been ever since. (In 2018, Virgin Hotels purchased the Hard Rock.) Mahan, who's single with no kids, learned to roll with the vicissitudes of the hospitality business. \"As a food server, there's always going to be slowdowns and takeoffs,\" he said over lunch at a dim sum restaurant in a Las Vegas strip mall. Mahan socked money away during the summer months and hunkered down in the slow times, before things started picking up around the New Year. He weathered the Great Recession, from 2007 to 2009, when Nevada led the nation in foreclosures, bankruptcies soared and tumbleweeds blew through Las Vegas' many overbuilt, financially underwater subdivisions. This economy feels worse. With tourism off, the hotel where Mahan works changed from a full-service coffee shop to a limited-hour buffet. So he's no longer waiting tables. Instead, he mans a to-go window, making drinks and handing food to guests, which brings him a lot less in tips. He estimates his income has fallen $2,000 a month. But it's not just that his paychecks have grown considerably skinnier. They don't go nearly as far. Gasoline. Eggs. Meat. \"Everything,\" Mahan said, \"is costing more.\" An admitted soda addict, he used to guzzle Dr Pepper. \"You'd get three bottles for four bucks,\" Mahan said. \"Now they're $3 each.\" He's cut back as a result. Worse, his air conditioner broke last month and the $14,000 that Mahan spent replacing it — along with a costly filter he needs for allergies — pretty much wiped out his emergency fund. It feels as though Mahan is just barely getting by and he's not at all optimistic things will improve anytime soon. \"I'm looking forward,\" he said, to the day Trump leaves office. :: Mahan considers himself fairly apolitical. He'd rather knock a tennis ball around than debate the latest goings-on in Washington. He likes some of the things Trump has accomplished, such as securing the border with Mexico — though Mahan is not a fan of the zealous immigration raids scooping up landscapers and tamale vendors. He's glad about the no-tax-on-tips provision in the massive legislative package passed last spring, though, \"I'm still being taxed at the same rate and there's no extra money coming in right now.\" He's waiting to see what happens when he files his tax return next year. He's not counting on much. \"I'm never convinced of anything,\" Mahan said. \"Until I see it.\" Something else is poking around the back of his mind. Mahan is a shop steward with the Culinary Union, the powerhouse labor organization that's helped make Las Vegas one of the few places in the country where a waiter, such as Mahan, can earn enough to buy a home in an upscale suburb like nearby Henderson. (He points out that he made the purchase in 2012 and probably couldn't afford it in today's economy.) Mahan worries that once Trump is done targeting immigrants, federal workers and Democratic-run cities, he'll come after organized labor, undermining one of the foundational building blocks that helped him climb into the middle class. \"He is a businessman and most businesspeople don't like dealing with unions,\" Mahan said. There are a few bright spots in Las Vegas' economic picture. Convention bookings are up slightly for the year, and look to be strengthening. Gaming revenues have increased year-over-year. The workforce is still growing. \"This community's streets are not littered with people that have been laid off,\" said Jeremy Aguero, a principal analyst with Applied Analysis, a firm that provides economic and fiscal policy counsel in Las Vegas. \"The layoff trends, unemployment insurance, they've edged up,\" Aguero said. \"But they're certainly not wildly elevated in comparison to other periods of instability.\" That, however, offers small solace for Mahan as he makes drinks, hands over takeout food and carefully watches his wallet. If he knew then what he knows now, what would the Aaron of 2016 — the one so full of hope for a Trump presidency — say to the Aaron of today? Mahan paused, his chopsticks hovering over a custard dumpling. \"Prepare,\" he said, \"for a bumpy ride.\"","summary":"Aaron Mahan, who's spent decades as a server on and off the Strip, says inflation and Trump's pugnacious immigration and foreign policies have chased tourists away.

Seth Moulton has entered the U.S. Senate race against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey.\n\nCongresswoman Ayanna Pressley, a Squad member, needs to make her move or risk losing the liberal high ground. That’s the burning question the Boston rep is now facing, probably daily.\n\nIs this her time? Can she betray Markey while challenging Moulton? We asked her team for a comment, but so far crickets.\n\nMarkey should not be underestimated. We’ve seen him in action, and he’s a young 79 years old. But Moulton, who is 46, is going to use age as a wedge issue.\n\nPressley, 51, won’t have that baggage if she runs for Senate, but time is not on her side.\n\nOn the Republican side, Nathan Bech, 51, a former town councilor from West Springfield, won’t be a spoiler. John Deaton, however, could possibly give the Democrats a run.\n\nMore to come but Pressley needs to get out of her comfort zone if she wants to climb the political ladder.\n\nBiden is coming to town\n\nFormer President Joe Biden is the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, so says the invitation to the Oct. 26 event here in the city.\n\nFormer Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the Secretary of Labor under Biden, is also on the ticket for “inspired leadership.” Retired Navy Adm.

In August 2021, Biden hosted an EV event at the White House with executives from General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, but Musk was not invited, despite Tesla being the nation's leading EV manufacturer. \"I write in the book that I thought it was a big mistake to not invite Elon Musk when we did a big EV event,\" Harris told Fortune Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell on Tuesday at the news outlet's Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington, D.C., referring to her memoir, \"107 Days,\" in which she criticized Biden for initially running for re-election despite his health struggles. \"I mean, here he is, the major American manufacturer of extraordinary innovation in this space,\" Harris said of Musk, who is also the CEO of SpaceX. WASHINGTON POST SLAMS KAMALA HARRIS BOOK TOUR, SAYS DEMS DON'T 'HAVE TIME TO WASTE' ON FORMER VP Musk's snub was widely viewed as an effort to support the United Auto Workers and organized labor overall, since Tesla plants are not unionized. Harris wrote in her book that she believed Biden was \"sending a message about Musk's anti-union stance\" but that she thought excluding him as the top player in the field \"simply doesn't make sense.\" Then–White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the event featured \"the three largest employers of the United Auto Workers,\" emphasizing that Tesla's workers are not unionized. Pressed on whether Musk's snub was punishment for his workers not being unionized, Psaki told reporters: \"I'll let you draw your own conclusion.\" The Biden administration defended inviting only those automakers, calling them key partners in the president’s push for union jobs. Harris said that presidents should \"put aside political loyalties\" when it comes to recognizing technological innovation. \"So, I thought that was a mistake, and I don’t know Elon Musk, but I have to assume that that was something that hit him hard and had an impact on his perspective,\" she said. Musk did appear to take offense after he was not invited to the event, taking numerous jabs at Biden. \"Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited,\" Musk wrote at the time on social media. A month later, he said the Biden administration appeared to be \"controlled by unions\" and was \"not the friendliest administration.\" KAMALA HARRIS BREAKS SILENCE ON BIDEN DROPOUT, ADMITS SHE HAS REGRETS ABOUT HER HANDLING OF SITUATION After Musk learned Tesla would not be invited, administration officials offered an apology, according to The Wall Street Journal.

But the tension lingered.\n\nMusk increasingly aligned himself with Republicans, railing against “the woke mind virus” and denouncing Democratic policy priorities. By 2024, he was bankrolling Trump’s comeback bid through a super PAC called America PAC.\n\nThe former vice president’s comments mark her sharpest public criticism yet of the administration she helped lead — and they come as Biden faces his most serious health battle since leaving office.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden was photographed leaving evening Mass at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Church in Wilmington, Del., his first public appearance since beginning a five-week course of radiation and hormone therapy for Stage 4 prostate cancer.\n\nAides say the treatment is ongoing and described his cancer as “high-grade” but hormone-sensitive.\n\nPhotos showed a frail-looking Biden walking slowly and holding onto a woman for support.

And in metro Detroit, anti-Trump protesters came out in strong numbers from Sterling Heights to Detroit, where thousands marched in the streets.\n\nDemonstrators have regularly lambasted the Trump administration for policies and tactics they say are increasingly authoritarian since the president’s second administration began, a take that the likes of the Michigan Republican Party chair have slammed. The White House has referred to other protest concerns this year, like immigration crackdowns, health care and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as lies. \n\nAsked for a reaction to the national protests ahead of time, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson replied, “Who cares?” USA TODAY reported.\n\nRoughly 300 people were already protesting by 11:30 a.m. on Mack Avenue and Cadieux Road on the east side of Detroit at its border with Grosse Pointe.\n\nCeleste Pleasant, 74, of Detroit, was among them. \n\nIt’s the first chance she has had to get out and protest this year. She’s concerned with how Hispanic people are being treated in the country, doesn’t like how Trump talks about people being felons with his own convictions under his belt, and is worried about threats to vaccines. \n\nShe also is concerned with voting rights, saying people fought for her right as a Black woman to cast a ballot. \n\nPeople need to stand up and act, she said, before sharing something she learned growing up: “Sitting still and waiting never made one great.”\n\nIn Dearborn, a crowd of about 500, including U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, protested at the Henry Ford Centennial Library around noon. \n\nAt least an estimated 1,000 people were in Sterling Heights in the area of 16 Mile Road and Van Dyke Avenue about 12:30 p.m., with signs, costumes and energy. Some passersby gave the crowd the middle finger, but honking was far more common.\n\nIn Romeo, protesters were beginning to trickle out about two hours after their scheduled start. More than 300 were seen either leaving with signs or still on the Romeo Trailside Bridge.\n\nIn Troy, about 2,000 protesters lined up near the intersection of Big Beaver and Rochester roads at 1:30 p.m. Justine Galbraith, vice chair of the Troy Democratic Club that organized the protest, said the rally was at least as big, if not bigger than Troy’s June No Kings rally, with protesters stretched farther down the road on Oct. 18. \n\nGalbraith said the protest is not just yelling, honking, holding signs and costume-wearing, but showing elected officials the people want them to act. The protest shows that opposition to Trump is not just in big cities like Detroit, Chicago and Portland, but also in the suburbs, she said.\n\nGalbraith hopes that outside of protesting, participants stay engaged in local actions like signing petitions, organizing for candidates they like, and donating to organizations supporting immigrant rights and other causes, she said. \n\nKathleen Downing, 58, of Troy, stood along Big Beaver Road in an inflatable unicorn costume. \n\nShe said she has been going to protests since before the election and is worried about rights and freedoms being taken away from people in the United States.\n\n\"Everybody needs freedom,\" she said. \"Everybody needs rights.\"\n\nThe cuts and the near elimination of the federal Department of Education are also a big concern, she said. \n\nShe wore her costume after being inspired by protesters in Portland,\n\nRepublican leaders and members of the Trump administration have painted the “No Kings” protests as dangerous, un-American and political fodder for the Democratic Party amid the government shutdown. Protesters have slammed the notions and multiple attendees wore inflatable frog and animal costumes to point to the absurdity of the claims of danger. The concept jumped off after a protester in an inflatable frog suit was sprayed with a chemical spray by a federal agent outside an immigration facility earlier in October in Portland.\n\nNearly daily protests in metro Detroit this year have been observed as being peaceful, though sometimes Trump supporters and protesters exchange harsh words. However, the last “No Kings” rally in Detroit did see a short skirmish involving a motorcycle club and protesters, and on Saturday, Oct. 18, a largely peaceful protest closer to downtown also saw a short, physical tussle.\n\nThousands gathered outside the newly refurbished Michigan Central Station for an afternoon protest, separate from the earlier one on the city's east side. After a series of passionate speeches touching on unity and concerns like the deaths in Gaza, immigration, making Detroit a sanctuary city and frustrations with local politicians, the crowd marched to the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building and back.\n\nSpeakers were unafraid to call out the likes of politicians U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Detroit, and mayoral candidate the Rev. Solomon Kinloch.\n\nOne verbally slammed Thanedar for his support of Israel, and another took on Kinloch regarding recent comments on bringing the National Guard to Detroit. His campaign has sought to clarify his statements in a mayoral debate, with Kinloch now saying he would not allow them to police the city, and the campaign blaming the phrasing of a debate question for any confusion.\n\nThe frequently cheering crowd also wasn't afraid to turn on one of their own speakers briefly with boos. Dr. Nidal Jboor, co-founder of the group Doctors Against Genocide, previously elicited cheers regarding Thanedar but also pointed out one good thing he thinks Trump has done, eliciting a negative reaction.\n\n“As a doctor, I care about life and anyone who saves my life or any life — I have to thank him. That’s why I have to thank President Trump for the ceasefire,” Jboor said of the ceasefire with Israel and Hamas. “The children are still starving. The doctors are still starving. The job is not over, but I cannot thank (former President Joe) Biden or (former Vice President Kamala) Harris for that.”\n\nIt was a rare comment amid an event otherwise rebuking the president and the policies of his administration, though there was talk of reaching across party lines at times, even as the crowd chanted a curse word along with \"Republicans.\"\n\nAmong the crowd that made the journey to the federal building was a family from Grosse Pointe: Randy Juip, 50, and his children Jake, 19; Claire, 18, and Tommy, 13.\n\nThis was Jake Juip's second time coming to Detroit for a No Kings protest, and he's concerned with issues like the treatment of undocumented immigrants and the cutting of health care research.\n\n\"I think America is great because we have the opportunity to make it better every day and that's something to raise your voice for and to fight for and to stand up for and know that whatever side you're on, red or blue, I hope that we can realize that this country is precious, it's something to fight for and that we should,\" Jake Juip said.\n\nTommy Juip said protesting is important, and Claire Juip said her sign said it well: \"The power of the people is greater than the person in power.\"\n\nTheir dad noted he's concerned with issues including a loss of checks and balances in the government, changes to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, such as mass layoffs and the government shutdown. Jake and Claire Juip — who use motorized wheelchairs — have a rare neurodegenerative disorder called Friedreich's ataxia. Experimental drugs that could help them are being held up while their disorder progresses daily, their dad said.\n\nCordelia Tuan, 32, of Detroit, who spoke outside of the Central Station, also raised concern with the shutdown and the ending of Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies being fought over amid it. She's also concerned with the Constitution being followed, saying it's not about party lines but rather \"about showing respect for democracy.\"\n\nThe physical incident outside the federal building did occur with a member of the opposition, a man who identified himself as Andre Williams, 24, of Detroit, and ended up in handcuffs.\n\nHe had been upsetting protesters, walking in front of the march and using his own megaphone to spout opposition to their cause, such as complaints about immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nThe interaction boiled over as the crowd gathered in front of the federal building, and Williams was seen moving through the mass of people. Organizers with the protest sought to remove him, and the effort became physical with organizers putting their hands on Williams. At least one organizer appeared to throw or push Williams back, and he ended up on the ground before police placed him in handcuffs.\n\nOne organizer involved in the incident, Jacob Smith with Detroit Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, said Williams tried to push a member of their group, and that escalated the matter. Smith and others subsequently put themselves between Williams and at least one still-upset protester to stop further interaction just before Williams was arrested.\n\nInformation on Williams' arrest was not immediately available, and Detroit Police Cpl. Dan Donakowski said information would likely not be available Saturday night.\n\nNationally, the “No Kings” effort has been organized by groups like Indivisible and Public Citizen, the American Civil Liberties Union, grassroots groups like 50501 and others, USA TODAY reports.\n\nIn metro Detroit, several organizers noted their actions were planned in solidarity with the national effort but not tied directly to national organizers.\n\nOrganizers in the region included 50501 Detroit, Detroit Anti-War Coalition, the Troy Democratic Club, local Indivisible groups and Detroit Will Breathe, a group that came to notoriety during the 2020 protests following the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe effort was about coming together as a community to say it doesn’t agree with the words and actions of the Trump administration, Troy Democratic Club Vice Chair Justine Galbraith said.\n\n\"It's coming together in a peaceful, joyful way,” she said. “It’s all about standing together as a community and knowing we can do better than we’re doing right now as a county.\"\n\nChristie Faisal, 53, and Rashid Faisal, 54, of Detroit, brought their 13-year-old daughter to join the effort outside Michigan Central Station. They wanted her to see \"Democracy in action,\" Rashid Faisal said. It was their civic duty to be there.\n\n\"First Amendment rights and protesting is just American, and it's what we do when we disagree with anything that's occurring,\" Rashid Faisal said.\n\nFree Press photographer Finn Gomez contributed to this report.","summary":"Michigan No Kings protesters lambast Trump administration  Detroit Free Press","url":"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/10/18/michigan-no-kings-protest-protesters-trump-administration/86706266007/","image":"https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/18/PDTF/86770052007-no-kings-101825-04-mw.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 02:39:51","author":"Darcie Moran,Natalie Davies","authors":["Darcie Moran","Natalie Davies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":370544416,"title":"Who will succeed Trump in 2028 election? New poll shows...","text":"Vice President JD Vance and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) are locked in a tight hypothetical 2028 presidential election race, according to a new poll from Emerson College. \n\nThe poll, released Friday, asked voters to choose between Vance and Newsom if the 2028 presidential election was held today. The poll found that voters were largely divided, with 46% choosing Vance, 45% choosing Newsom and 10% undecided.\n\nOverall, Newsom has picked up 3 percentage points and Vance has picked up 1 percentage point since July’s poll . However, the October results are basically unchanged from when the poll was last conducted in August, when the two men each clinched 44% support.\n\nVance and Newsom are seen as likely frontrunners for the 2028 presidential race, as President Donald Trump cannot seek a third term in office. No one has officially launched a bid for the White House yet, as speculation swirls over who the Democrats will nominate as their candidate after former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump.\n\nThe poll also questioned voters on which party they would like to see win the midterm elections next year. Forty-four percent of voters said they plan to vote for Democrats on the generic congressional ballot, while 43% said they plan to vote for Republicans. Another 14% are undecided, according to the poll.\n\n“The 2026 congressional ballot and the hypothetical 2028 matchup between Vance and Newsom also remain unchanged, suggesting a polarized electorate where individual issues may not be enough to sway overall opinion,” said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling.\n\n“It will be interesting to see whether ‘threats to democracy’ will influence voter attitudes, or if the dominant factor continues to be the economy, which voters, particularly women and younger voters, see as heading in the wrong direction,” he added.\n\nThe poll was conducted among 1,000 registered voters from Oct. 13-14.

The highest score on the Gleason scale is 10.\n\n“High-grade” means the cancer cells differ greatly from normal cells, so they behave more aggressively and have a higher chance of spreading beyond the prostate. \n\nBiden has been taking hormone pills and receiving care, according to reports.\n\nThe diagnosis came after Biden reported urinary issues earlier this year, leading doctors to detect a small nodule on his prostate.\n\nIn addition to the prostate cancer, he has twice undergone skin cancer procedures — most recently last month, when surgeons removed lesions from his forehead that left a visible scar.\n\nIn 2023, then-President Biden also had a cancerous growth removed from his chest. His physician previously said those earlier procedures were successful and required no further intervention.\n\nBiden’s health and age became central to political debates during his final year in office.\n\nMounting concerns about his fitness — intensified after a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump — led him to end his re-election campaign in July 2024 and endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who later lost to Trump.\n\nSince leaving the White House in January, Biden has kept a low profile, surfacing mainly for medical updates and limited public appearances.\n\nDespite his ongoing therapy, aides said he plans to attend two events in the coming weeks: an award ceremony in Boston and a Democratic fundraiser in Nebraska.","summary":"The 82-year-old former president left the hour-long service, walking slowly and holding onto a woman for support.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/18/us-news/joe-biden-seen-publicly-for-first-time-since-beginning-radiation-therapy-for-prostate-cancer/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/113749864.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uW48K68P-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-19 00:45:39","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":370638486,"title":"Anti-Trump Protests Erupt Across US Under Banner Of 'No Kings'","text":"The protest sponsored by the Democratic Party was the second“No Kings Protest” after the first held in June, and this time the crowds were bigger.\n\nKamala Harris, who lost the election to Trump, gave the call to arms, posting on X,“I encourage you to join your neighbors in peaceful protest at a No Kings event... to express out voice”.\n\n“In our country, the power is with the people,” she wrote.\n\nThe“No Kings” theme is meant to recall the anti-British protests that led to the birth of the US, abjuring monarchy and absolutism, and opting for a republican form of government.\n\nTrump denied he had regal ambitions or was acting like a monarch.\n\n“They're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,” he told a Fox Business TV interviewer.\n\nThe sponsors of the protests include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign, and some trade unions like those of teachers.\n\nThe protests took place while most of the government was shut down because of a standoff between the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, with no negotiations to end it.\n\nDemocrats are demanding the reinstatement of cuts to medical insurance and health-related programmes, which Trump says will drain more than $1.5 trillion from the treasury.\n\nBecause of the standoff, the Senate is unable to pass legislation to temporarily fund the government.\n\nThe protests were sparked after Trump sent federal forces to Democratic-run states and increased enforcement against illegal migrants.\n\nDuring the government shutdown, Trump has cut off funds to programmes in several Democrat-run states.\n\nThe protest's focus was on Trump using forces under federal control in the states under Democrats, asserting that there was a breakdown of law and order and crimes were rampant.\n\nHe has threatened to take over law and order in some of the cities, although under the US Constitution, there is no provision for a president's rule.\n\nTens of thousands of protesters jammed Times Square in New York.\n\nProtests were organised in Los Angeles on the West Coast, where federal immigration and other officials have clashed with demonstrators against immigration enforcement.\n\nIn the middle, in Chicago, in the state where Governor J.B.

ABC moderator David Muir immediately fact-checked him, claiming, “President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country … ”\n\nNearly every major media outlet echoed that narrative. National Public Radio ran the headline “Violent crime is dropping fast in the U.S.—even if Americans don’t believe it.” The Wall Street Journal declared, “Violent Crime Rate Falls Sharply After Pandemic Surge.” Vox insisted, “Violent crime is plummeting.” Axios reported, “New data shows violent crime dropping sharply in major U.S. cities.”\n\nHowever, a new Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which includes data through 2024, shows that Trump was right during the debate when he said, “Crime here is up and through the roof.” The National Crime Victimization Survey shows violent crime surged 59%, with rape and sexual assault up 67%, robbery up 38%, and aggravated assault up 62%. That’s the largest four-year increase in the survey’s 52-year history.\n\nThe contrast with Trump’s first term is stark. The National Crime Victimization Survey data shows that between 2017 and 2020, violent crime fell 15%, including a 6% drop in robbery and a 24% decline in aggravated assault. Although rape and sexual assault rose slightly, the increase was less than 10% of what occurred under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe federal government tracks crime in two main ways. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports count the number of offenses reported to police each year. The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey, by contrast, annually asks about 240,000 people living in the United States whether they were crime victims. The latter method captures both reported and unreported incidents.\n\nLast year, the media focused almost entirely on the FBI data.\n\nBefore 2020, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics trends generally moved in tandem. Since then, they’ve diverged sharply: The FBI reports fewer crimes, while more Americans say they’ve been victimized. Unreported crime was always a factor—and the reasons for it vary. They range from people reluctant to report being victimized by loved ones to a simple aversion by undocumented people to involve themselves with the criminal justice system.\n\nIn recent years, however, another factor appears to have skewed the FBI data: the breakdown of law enforcement in this country. When people believe police won’t catch or prosecutors won’t punish criminals, they’re simply less likely to report crimes. Between 2010 and 2019, victims reported 63.3% of violent crimes to police. In the last three years, that number plummeted to 48.8%. Arrests fell as well—from 26.5% before COVID-19 to just 16.6% afterward.\n\nOther factors also distort the FBI data. Many big-city police departments, such as D.C., have reclassified serious offenses, apparently in an effort to make the streets seem safer than they are. Downgrading aggravated assaults to simple assaults removes them from the FBI’s violent crime statistics, for example. Whether an attack counts as “aggravated” often depends on whether a weapon was used—but many progressive district attorneys now refuse to pursue weapons charges. That difference matters because the NCVS asks victims directly whether a weapon was involved, even if police reports omit it.\n\nProgressive prosecutors in cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also made a habit of reducing felony charges. In Manhattan, for example, the district attorney’s office downgraded felonies 60% of the time—with 89% downgraded to misdemeanors and 11% to less serious felonies. Chicago has labeled some murders as “death investigations” rather than homicides. These practices appear to be spreading, and police may now be adjusting their own reports to reflect prosecutors’ leniency.\n\nThe latest federal data expose a stark reality: Violent crime has surged dramatically despite claims to the contrary. The growing gap between reported crimes and actual victimization reflects both a breakdown in law enforcement and the deliberate downgrading of offenses by progressive prosecutors. Until the justice system restores accountability and accurate reporting, Americans will continue to face rising violence that the FBI’s official statistics fail to capture.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Maura Healey has led the state.\n\nTens of thousands packed Boston Common, holding signs with messages of disapproval of President Trump, while similar scenes played out at over 100 other protests in Massachusetts. Demonstrations unfolded nationwide.\n\nTrump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris in last November’s presidential election, winning the popular vote, 49.8% to 48.3%. He also garnered 312 electoral votes.\n\nMayor Michelle Wu headlined the protest at the Common, reminding the progressive crowd that “every voice is heard” in Boston, which she called the “cradle of liberty” for the past 250 years.\n\nThe mayor said the city stands with Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., where Trump has tried to deploy the National Guard to combat what the president has described as lawlessness.\n\n“Boston embodies the truth that America is a nation of immigrants and laws,” Wu told to a roar of cheers. “Our city is proof that both make us stronger. Boston will keep fighting back to keep moving forward.”\n\nAt the beginning of Wu’s speech, a couple of protesters, equipped with a megaphone and holding Palestinian flags, tried to disrupt the mayor’s comments. After a few moments, police officers ordered them to back away from the front row.\n\nThe nonviolent protest at the Common on Saturday took place after last week’s pro-Palestinian rally in which protesters assaulted Boston Police officers, one of whom suffered a broken nose that required reconstructive surgery.\n\nEvent organizers had a team of “security” volunteers who were dispersed throughout the massive crowd, wearing orange vests. The emcee of the rally, Rahsaan Hall, CEO of Urban League of Eastern Mass., joked around about how one of the speakers at the event would be the executive director of Antifa.\n\nAhead of the “No Kings” protests, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy made a social media post in which he highlighted actions under Gov. Healey that he has described as harmful.\n\nKennealy started the post with, “As citizens around Massachusetts are protesting on ‘No Kings Day,’ consider this:”\n\n“There’s a politician who stood by while migrant children were raped and abused in government-run facilities,” the GOP candidate stated. “A politician who appointed their ex-partner to be a powerful judge. … A politician who has threatened and defunded cities and towns for not following top-down edicts.”\n\n“I’m of course referring to our Governor Maura Healey,” Kenneally concluded.\n\nHealey did not attend the protest at the Common. This past week, she told reporters she wasn’t sure whether she’d be stopping by due to her schedule.\n\nWhile thousands focused on the federal government at the rally, at least one woman seemed more concentrated on calling out how Attorney General Andrea Campbell has refused to enforce the legislative audit that state voters approved last November.\n\nCampbell, addressing the crowd in Boston, championed how she has filed 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration since the president’s inauguration last January.\n\nThe AG received a 12%, or $9 million, budget increase this fiscal year, bringing her office’s total allocation to $83 million, to support its fight against Trump.\n\n“In America, we don’t have kings, we have ‘the people,’” Campbell told protesters. “They (the feds) will keep on coming and we will keep on fighting … If they come for Massachusetts, I say, bring it on.”","summary":"Thousands of Bay Staters protested the Trump administration across the Commonwealth on “No Kings Day,” as a leading Republican gubernatorial candidate told residents to consider how Gov.

While in the throes of divorcing his first wife, the television presenter and lawyer Kimberly Guilfoyle, it emerged he had had a brief affair with his appointments secretary, who also happened to be married to his then-campaign manager. It was a juicy national scandal but his career survived after he made a frank admission in a press conference, taking full responsibility: “I want to make it clear that everything you’ve heard and read is true.”\n\nHe married again in 2008 to Jennifer Siebel, an actress and film director, with whom he has four children (Montana, Hunter, Brooklynn and Dutch). She is designated California’s “first partner”. Guilfoyle, meanwhile, went on to date Donald Trump Jr: small world.\n\nNewsom briefly considered running for governor of California in 2009 but, facing strong opposition from the popular Jerry Brown, settled to run instead as Brown’s understudy in the largely lame-duck role of lieutenant governor. He had some minor progressive successes, helping to tighten gun controls and to legalise marijuana, but was probably best known during this tenure for designating the avocado as the state’s official fruit (he claims to eat several a week).\n\nThis week he banned the sale of Glock pistols and made it easier for high-school students to access further education.\n\nAs Brown reached the end of his last possible term (he’d served four; today, California mandates a maximum of two, like the presidency), Newsom ran for governor in 2018 and was elected in a landslide.\n\nHis campaign had been helped along the way by significant donations from San Francisco royalty including the Pritzkers, descended from founders of the Hyatt Hotel chain; the Fishers, founders of the Gap clothing brand; and, unsurprisingly, the Getty family.\n\nIn 2018, after auditing donations to Newsom’s various campaigns in the lead-up to the election for governor, the Los Angeles Times concluded he was “the product of a selection process in which some of the wealthiest families in the entire country have been involved from his earliest engagement in politics.”\n\nAs governor, Newsom has passed numerous progressive bills, such as requiring public colleges to offer abortion medications, banning smoking in state parks and on beaches, banning the sale of petrol-powered cars from 2035 and mandating that large retailers can no longer offer customers just “boy” and “girl” sections for toys but must have a “gender-neutral” section too. This week he banned the sale of Glock pistols (a popular brand of handgun) and made it easier for high-school students to access further education.\n\nHe has come under criticism for California’s homelessness epidemic, soaring house prices and a particularly sharp cost-of-living crisis. And there was a misstep in 2020 when he dined mask-free at the French Laundry, a high-end restaurant, in defiance of COVID recommendations; it added fuel to a campaign to have him unseated, which he survived.\n\nWhat are Newsom’s chances of becoming president?\n\nIt’s early days in the 2028 presidential campaign, if one yet exists. But Newsom’s willingness to take on Trump has had many pundits suggesting he has presidential ambitions and has flipped the switch on a shadow campaign.\n\nUntil recently, Newsom was seen as keen to mediate between left and right, playing something of a peacemaker. In January, he initially greeted Trump on friendly terms when the president flew out to discuss support after wildfires devastated Los Angeles County, meeting him at the airport and declaring: “We welcome President Trump to California with an open hand.”\n\nSurprisingly for a Democrat, Newsom has also reached out to several right-wing pundits to appear on his podcast, among them Charlie Kirk.\n\n‘Come after me. Arrest me. Let’s just get it over with, tough guy.’\n\nRelations with Trump’s MAGA acolytes deteriorated dramatically, however, in early June when Trump sent the National Guard and 700 Marines into Los Angeles to bolster a federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants. “Border tsar” Tom Homan made the extraordinary threat to have Newsom arrested for defying Trump’s orders. “His primary crime is running for governor because he’s done such a bad job,” said Trump. Newsom responded: “Come after me. Arrest me. Let’s just get it over with, tough guy.”\n\nThis level of friction is almost unprecedented, says Natasha Lindstaedt, a professor of government from the University of Essex. “We have rarely had a president getting into fights with governors,” she says. “They usually need to work together and have a strong working relationship.”\n\nSince then, it’s been a war of words that has given Newsom a national profile and, in a political system that, unlike Australia, has no formal leader of the opposition, elevated him to the unofficial role of the Democrats’ head of the resistance. “Democrats are unable to have any impact in Congress,” Dafydd Townley tells us from the University of Portsmouth. “Any resistance comes from the states themselves, and Newsom has assumed that leadership.”\n\nThe timing might suit a presidential run. Newsom’s final term as governor ends in 2027, which would give him clear air to tour the nation and raise the millions he would need in donations to run a successful national campaign.\n\n“On the negative side, he’ll have to push even harder to maintain the press coverage that he’s currently getting,” says Townley. “But at the same time he’ll likely be able to avoid any persistent targeting by Trump, unless the administration believes him to be the major candidate for 2028.”\n\n‘Don’t rule out Michelle Obama being on a ticket somewhere.’\n\nAlso in his favour: few, if any, possible rivals have the same name recognition. Perhaps Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Pete Buttigieg, who served in Joe Biden’s cabinet as transportation secretary. Other, lesser-known, hopefuls to be touted include Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer; Illinois governor JB Pritzker; Maryland governor Wes Moore; Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro; and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey. Meanwhile, “don’t rule out Michelle Obama being on a ticket somewhere,” says Townley. Then there’s Kamala Harris, who has said she won’t run for California governor but hasn’t ruled out another presidential campaign.\n\nNot so much in Newsom’s favour: he’s a white, straight male in a party that might prefer a more diverse candidate; his links to old money might alienate working-class voters. Tim Lynch, who is a professor of American politics, describes him electorally as a “target-rich environment”.\n\n‘I do think he is going to try to run, and has been positioning himself as the person that is best to beat Trump.’\n\nThen there’s the hurdle that liberal California, seen by many Americans as quite separate from the rest of the country, has yet to produce a Democratic president (the one it did chalk up was Ronald Reagan, a Republican).\n\n“It’s very difficult to see how a California Democrat is going to be any more electable than the last one to try, which was Kamala Harris,” says Lynch. “Democrats in California generally represent everything that even mild Trump supporters set themselves against. I don’t think Newsom is the most ‘woke’. But I think the caricature the ordinary middle-of-the-road voters have is that California is an empire of the woke and trans rights and Hollywood leftism.”\n\nNatasha Lindstaedt agrees. “I don’t see him as a viable candidate,” she says, though she adds: “I do think he is going to try to run, and has been positioning himself as the person that is best to beat Trump.”\n\nNewsom may also hit a roadblock within his own party, says Townley. “The most difficult opposition might be the far left within his own party who might state he’s not liberal enough. Will the left of the party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, be willing to support him if he doesn’t align with her agenda?” Of note, Newsom believes trans women should not compete in sport with biological women, defying a view widely held on the left. (Trans rights advocates have said they are sickened by his position.)\n\nIn the governor’s immediate future is a piece of California legislation that could yet cement him as the Democrat frontrunner. Ahead of next year’s mid-term elections, some Republican states, notably Texas, have been redrawing their congressional district boundaries to win more Republican seats.\n\n‘He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.’\n\nIn response, Newsom is holding a ballot next month asking Californians to do the same for Democrats, temporarily changing his state’s districts to deliver his party five more seats in 2028, offsetting their losses in Texas. Nancy Pelosi has been assisting in his campaign to win what is technically known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nFor Newsom to achieve this would change the political landscape in a meaningful way, says Bruce Wolpe. “If he wins that and California enacts it, that would be a big win for him. He becomes the giant-killer for the Democratic Party.” If Newsom is successful, “he will be the guy who did the most, more than anyone in Congress, to do something to stop Trump. He has all the time. He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.”\n\nAnd if the ballot fails? “This is a very important election for him,” says Wolpe. “He’s a popular governor. If he can’t persuade his own state to support him on something so important, like the future of the country, why should he be the presidential nominee?\n\nExplainers are brought to you by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald Explainer team: editor Felicity Lewis and reporters Jackson Graham and Angus Holland.

While in the throes of divorcing his first wife, the television presenter and lawyer Kimberly Guilfoyle, it emerged he had had a brief affair with his appointments secretary, who also happened to be married to his then-campaign manager. It was a juicy national scandal but his career survived after he made a frank admission in a press conference, taking full responsibility: “I want to make it clear that everything you’ve heard and read is true.”\n\nHe married again in 2008 to Jennifer Siebel, an actress and film director, with whom he has four children (Montana, Hunter, Brooklynn and Dutch). She is designated California’s “first partner”. Guilfoyle, meanwhile, went on to date Donald Trump Jr: small world.\n\nNewsom briefly considered running for governor of California in 2009 but, facing strong opposition from the popular Jerry Brown, settled to run instead as Brown’s understudy in the largely lame-duck role of lieutenant governor. He had some minor progressive successes, helping to tighten gun controls and to legalise marijuana, but was probably best known during this tenure for designating the avocado as the state’s official fruit (he claims to eat several a week).\n\nThis week he banned the sale of Glock pistols and made it easier for high-school students to access further education.\n\nAs Brown reached the end of his last possible term (he’d served four; today, California mandates a maximum of two, like the presidency), Newsom ran for governor in 2018 and was elected in a landslide.\n\nHis campaign had been helped along the way by significant donations from San Francisco royalty including the Pritzkers, descended from founders of the Hyatt Hotel chain; the Fishers, founders of the Gap clothing brand; and, unsurprisingly, the Getty family.\n\nIn 2018, after auditing donations to Newsom’s various campaigns in the lead-up to the election for governor, the Los Angeles Times concluded he was “the product of a selection process in which some of the wealthiest families in the entire country have been involved from his earliest engagement in politics.”\n\nAs governor, Newsom has passed numerous progressive bills, such as requiring public colleges to offer abortion medications, banning smoking in state parks and on beaches, banning the sale of petrol-powered cars from 2035 and mandating that large retailers can no longer offer customers just “boy” and “girl” sections for toys but must have a “gender-neutral” section too. This week he banned the sale of Glock pistols (a popular brand of handgun) and made it easier for high-school students to access further education.\n\nHe has come under criticism for California’s homelessness epidemic, soaring house prices and a particularly sharp cost-of-living crisis. And there was a misstep in 2020 when he dined mask-free at the French Laundry, a high-end restaurant, in defiance of COVID recommendations; it added fuel to a campaign to have him unseated, which he survived.\n\nWhat are Newsom’s chances of becoming president?\n\nIt’s early days in the 2028 presidential campaign, if one yet exists. But Newsom’s willingness to take on Trump has had many pundits suggesting he has presidential ambitions and has flipped the switch on a shadow campaign.\n\nUntil recently, Newsom was seen as keen to mediate between left and right, playing something of a peacemaker. In January, he initially greeted Trump on friendly terms when the president flew out to discuss support after wildfires devastated Los Angeles County, meeting him at the airport and declaring: “We welcome President Trump to California with an open hand.”\n\nSurprisingly for a Democrat, Newsom has also reached out to several right-wing pundits to appear on his podcast, among them Charlie Kirk.\n\n‘Come after me. Arrest me. Let’s just get it over with, tough guy.’\n\nRelations with Trump’s MAGA acolytes deteriorated dramatically, however, in early June when Trump sent the National Guard and 700 Marines into Los Angeles to bolster a federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants. “Border tsar” Tom Homan made the extraordinary threat to have Newsom arrested for defying Trump’s orders. “His primary crime is running for governor because he’s done such a bad job,” said Trump. Newsom responded: “Come after me. Arrest me. Let’s just get it over with, tough guy.”\n\nThis level of friction is almost unprecedented, says Natasha Lindstaedt, a professor of government from the University of Essex. “We have rarely had a president getting into fights with governors,” she says. “They usually need to work together and have a strong working relationship.”\n\nSince then, it’s been a war of words that has given Newsom a national profile and, in a political system that, unlike Australia, has no formal leader of the opposition, elevated him to the unofficial role of the Democrats’ head of the resistance. “Democrats are unable to have any impact in Congress,” Dafydd Townley tells us from the University of Portsmouth. “Any resistance comes from the states themselves, and Newsom has assumed that leadership.”\n\nThe timing might suit a presidential run. Newsom’s final term as governor ends in 2027, which would give him clear air to tour the nation and raise the millions he would need in donations to run a successful national campaign.\n\n“On the negative side, he’ll have to push even harder to maintain the press coverage that he’s currently getting,” says Townley. “But at the same time he’ll likely be able to avoid any persistent targeting by Trump, unless the administration believes him to be the major candidate for 2028.”\n\n‘Don’t rule out Michelle Obama being on a ticket somewhere.’\n\nAlso in his favour: few, if any, possible rivals have the same name recognition. Perhaps Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Pete Buttigieg, who served in Joe Biden’s cabinet as transportation secretary. Other, lesser-known, hopefuls to be touted include Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer; Illinois governor JB Pritzker; Maryland governor Wes Moore; Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro; and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey. Meanwhile, “don’t rule out Michelle Obama being on a ticket somewhere,” says Townley. Then there’s Kamala Harris, who has said she won’t run for California governor but hasn’t ruled out another presidential campaign.\n\nNot so much in Newsom’s favour: he’s a white, straight male in a party that might prefer a more diverse candidate; his links to old money might alienate working-class voters. Tim Lynch, who is a professor of American politics, describes him electorally as a “target-rich environment”.\n\n‘I do think he is going to try to run, and has been positioning himself as the person that is best to beat Trump.’\n\nThen there’s the hurdle that liberal California, seen by many Americans as quite separate from the rest of the country, has yet to produce a Democratic president (the one it did chalk up was Ronald Reagan, a Republican).\n\n“It’s very difficult to see how a California Democrat is going to be any more electable than the last one to try, which was Kamala Harris,” says Lynch. “Democrats in California generally represent everything that even mild Trump supporters set themselves against. I don’t think Newsom is the most ‘woke’. But I think the caricature the ordinary middle-of-the-road voters have is that California is an empire of the woke and trans rights and Hollywood leftism.”\n\nNatasha Lindstaedt agrees. “I don’t see him as a viable candidate,” she says, though she adds: “I do think he is going to try to run, and has been positioning himself as the person that is best to beat Trump.”\n\nNewsom may also hit a roadblock within his own party, says Townley. “The most difficult opposition might be the far left within his own party who might state he’s not liberal enough. Will the left of the party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, be willing to support him if he doesn’t align with her agenda?” Of note, Newsom believes trans women should not compete in sport with biological women, defying a view widely held on the left. (Trans rights advocates have said they are sickened by his position.)\n\nIn the governor’s immediate future is a piece of California legislation that could yet cement him as the Democrat frontrunner. Ahead of next year’s mid-term elections, some Republican states, notably Texas, have been redrawing their congressional district boundaries to win more Republican seats.\n\n‘He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.’\n\nIn response, Newsom is holding a ballot next month asking Californians to do the same for Democrats, temporarily changing his state’s districts to deliver his party five more seats in 2028, offsetting their losses in Texas. Nancy Pelosi has been assisting in his campaign to win what is technically known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nFor Newsom to achieve this would change the political landscape in a meaningful way, says Bruce Wolpe. “If he wins that and California enacts it, that would be a big win for him. He becomes the giant-killer for the Democratic Party.” If Newsom is successful, “he will be the guy who did the most, more than anyone in Congress, to do something to stop Trump. He has all the time. He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.”\n\nAnd if the ballot fails? “This is a very important election for him,” says Wolpe. “He’s a popular governor. If he can’t persuade his own state to support him on something so important, like the future of the country, why should he be the presidential nominee?\n\nExplainers are brought to you by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald Explainer team: editor Felicity Lewis and reporters Jackson Graham and Angus Holland.

'Without implicating anyone by name. I don't think I'm imagining this. It's not just sleeping with your scheduler, it's weirder than that. Have you noticed that?'\n\nBurchett wasn't buying and told Tucker he 'tries to stay' in his office 'as much as possible.'

It's my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership. I remain deeply grateful to Mayor [Daniel] Lurie, SFPD, and all our partners, and am fully committed to a safer, stronger San Francisco.\"\n\nThe Trump administration already has deployed the National Guard to Portland, Ore.; Memphis, Tenn., and Chicago in a crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. Lower courts blocked the deployments of the troops.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told in the Oval Office that \"we have great support in San Francisco\" for sending troops to the city, apparently a reference to Benioff. He urged FBI Director Kash Patel to make San Francisco \"next\" for deployment.\n\nBenioff's suggestion was condemned by politicians, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, investors and those associated with the company.\n\nNewsom, who was mayor of San Francisco, is a friend of Benioff and appeared at last year's company convention.\n\nMore than 180 Salesforce workers, alumni and community members wrote an open letter on Friday that was published online. They said his comments have \"revealed a troubling hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"Salesforce was built on empowering communities -- not deploying the National Guard into them,\" they wrote. \"Last week, that's exactly what you endorsed.'\n\nThe letter added: \"Walking back your words doesn't undo the damage.\"\n\nStartup investor Ron Conway resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday. Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nConway donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 presidential election campaign.\n\nBenioff has donated to both political parties but has supported Harris, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for president. He attended a state dinner by King Charles for Trump at Windsor Castle in England on Sept. 15.\n\nHis family and Salesforce have given more than $1 billion to Bay Area causes, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nBenioff, who acquired Time magazine in 2018, has a net worth of $8.8 billion, ranking 381st in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs, a pre-eminent philanthropist, criticized Benioff for his remarks.\n\n\"When wealth becomes a substitute for participation, giving is reduced to performance art -- proof of virtue, a way to appear magnanimous while still demanding ownership,\" she wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \"That's the quiet corruption corroding modern philanthropy: the ability to give as a license to impose one's will. It's a kind of moral laundering, where so-called benevolence masks self-interest.\"\n\nConservatives have rallied behind the Salesforce CEO.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, who is now Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, wrote on X : \"Dear Marc @Benioff, if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team. \"Cancel culture is over, and we are the inclusive party.\"\n\nBenioff has previously complained about crime in the city.

Senior Democrats are treating Saturday’s demonstrations as a show of strength and are urging participants to be peaceful amid fears disorder could be used to justify an administration crackdown.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nOver 3,000 demonstrations have been organized as part of “No Kings” on Saturday, which organizers say were called to show that “America has no kings, and the power belongs to the people.”\n\nThe demonstrations have been condemned by senior Republicans including Johnson, who shared an image on X indicating the “Communist Party USA” was supporting the “No Kings” rally in New York City.\n\n“Now we know Saturday’s events are actually funded by Soros, and sponsored by the Communist Party USA, among other far Left and communist groups. How could there any more appropriate nickname than the ‘Hate America Rally?'” he wrote.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has endorsed the demonstrations, leading Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, to write on X: “Nothing says ‘we care about democracy’ like showing up to a rally sponsored by communists. Chuck Schumer is desperately trying to appease the far Left crowd of his party to cling to his leadership role before AOC [Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] inevitably replaces him.”\n\nAccording to CNN, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy claimed the “No Kings” demonstrations were “part of Antifa,” a loose antifascist coalition that Trump recently designated as a terrorist organization. The outlet also quoted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as claiming the demonstrations would contain the “most unhinged in the Democratic Party.” \n\nThe demonstrations have been welcomed by senior Democrats, with former Vice President and 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Friday commenting via X: “In our country, the power is with the people. Tomorrow, October 18, I encourage you to join your neighbors in peaceful protest at a No Kings event.”\n\nDemonstrators take part in a protest against the Trump administration during the “No Kings” national rally in downtown Los Angeles on June 14. (Photo by RINGO CHIU/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nConservative commentator Laura Loomer, a Trump ally, wrote on X on Friday: “No Kings protesters were testing their massive ‘Impeach Trump Again’ sign on the National Mall today with life sized puppets of Donald Trump, JD Vance, [Secretary] Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller in chains. The radical left’s message is clear: ‘Get Trump and his supporters at all costs.’”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted to X: “Today’s No Kings rallies are an affirmation of what America is all about. We are a democracy. We have no kings, despite the fact that Trump has even said he wants to become one.”\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party, wrote on X on Friday: “I am looking forward to joining millions of Americans across the country at a ‘No Kings’ rally tomorrow. I’ll be speaking here in Washington, DC. I hope to see you there.”\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X: “I urge our nation to use this weekend’s No Kings marches as a declaration of independence against the tyranny and lawlessness currently running this country. Use your voice. ACT PEACEFULLY. Protect yourself and your community. THERE ARE NO KINGS IN THE UNITED STATES.” \n\nOn its website, “No Kings” states: “The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don’t have kings and we won’t back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty. Our peaceful movement is only getting bigger and bigger. ‘NO KINGS’ is more than just a slogan; it is the foundation our nation was built upon. Born in the streets, shouted by millions, carried on posters and chants, it echoes from city blocks to rural town squares, uniting people across this country to fight dictatorship together.”\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nThe size of Saturday’s demonstrations will impact the strength of the message sent to the White House.

BILL MAHER SLAMS DEMOCRATS LIKE KAMALA HARRIS AND THE CLINTONS FOR BEING 'AFRAID' TO COME ON HIS SHOW His comments come after months of student-led anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the country. Protesters often chanted anti-Israel slogans and clashed with police, with hundreds of arrests taking place. Some critics said their support of Palestinians blurred the line between anti-war activism and open support for Hamas. Several students in the U.S. have been investigated for links to the terror group. President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for foreign students attending American universities to have their visas revoked if they’re found to support Hamas. Now, as reports surface of Hamas turning its weapons on fellow Palestinians, Maher is questioning why those same protesters have gone silent. Footage has circulated online showing Hamas fighters allegedly executing Palestinians in Gaza City’s main square. Reuters reported that Hamas killed at least 33 people in recent days following the group’s truce with Israel to pause fighting in the region.

This culminated in July, when President Donald Trump reached a $16 million settlement with Paramount.

I just want affordable for my income.”\n\nHere she is thinking she needs special treatment because of her low income, and then voting Republican despite that. Bad move, Chrissy.\n\nLet’s head down to Florida, where insurance agent Alan Reynolds’ family is about to get walloped. \n\n“The loss of his wife’s subsidy means she is likely to pay about $1,200 or more each month, up from about $500 in 2024,” reported The Washington Post.\n\n“I voted for Trump,” Reynolds said. “I didn’t expect this.”\n\nWhy, oh why, wouldn’t he expect this? Trump literally promised to get rid of the Affordable Care Act—without even a proposal for an alternative beyond “a concept of a plan.”\n\nThe irony, of course, is that this mess is disproportionately hitting Republican voters in Republican states.\n\nAt least two polls show that MAGA overwhelmingly supports keeping the ACA subsidies, which proves how deluded they are. If they want the government to help them out, they should be Democrats.\n\nIn Idaho, retired schoolteacher Bob McMichael is going to lose his and his partner’s health care. \n\n“A few years after they retired, but before they were eligible for Medicare, McMichael, 63, and his wife, 62, got the cheapest plan they could find on the marketplace. It had monthly premiums of about $1,800, but Obamacare subsidies kept their monthly payments to about $50 a month,” reported the Idaho Statesman.\n\nIf that happens, McMichael and his wife plan to drop their coverage. He hopes they’ll find a cheaper plan, but he’s not optimistic. The plan they chose last year was the most affordable option, “other than not to have health care.”\n\nMcMichael taught in tiny Council, Idaho—the county seat of Adams County, which voted for Trump 76% to 21%. None of the stories featuring him (and there are several) indicate who he voted for, and as a teacher, there’s a nonzero chance he was one of the 21% who backed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. \n\nBut regardless of his own vote, the fact is that thanks to his neighbors, Idaho will be particularly hard-hit by the potential loss of subsidies.\n\nMcMichael might be one of the good ones—and now he’s collateral damage from his neighbors’ self-destructive efforts to deny themselves quality health care.\n\nRelated | GOP still at the 'ideas' stage of magically fixing health care\n\nThese are people who now will have to weigh whether to buy groceries or see a doctor, or to even entertain the idea of coverage at all.\n\nAnd people will die.\n\nIt’s an opening for Democrats to rebuild public trust around an economic populist agenda that centers on affordability and cost-of-living issues. It won’t reach everyone—the MAGA cult is resilient and deep. But peel away 5–10% of the Republican vote, activate some nonvoters, and it’s a whole different story.","summary":"The stories are starting to flood in of Donald Trump voters realizing in horror that when you vote for the guy who promised to gut the Affordable Care Act with no replacement plan in sight, you might lose your health insurance.

Some lawmakers are predicting it could become the longest, surpassing the 35 days from President Donald Trump's first term. The Trump administration is using the current shutdown to buttress priorities it favors while seeking to dismantle those it doesn't. Nevertheless, Democrats are insisting that any funding bill include help for millions of Americans who will lose health insurance coverage or face dramatically higher monthly premiums if Congress does nothing. The shutdown began Oct. 1. Here's a look at its impact so far on workers, the economy and the services the government provides. Furloughs and firings The federal government employed nearly 2.3 million civilian employees as of March 31. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 750,000 of those employees would be furloughed each day during a shutdown. That means they don't report to work until the shutdown ends. Others are considered \"excepted\" and do go to work, helping to protect life and property and perform other essential services. Both groups of workers will get paid, but on a retroactive basis. That means they are facing the prospect of missing a full paycheck later this month after receiving a partial one earlier for work performed in late September. Live Events The nation's 1.3 million active-duty service members got a temporary reprieve. They were looking at missing a paycheck on Wednesday. But Trump directed the Pentagon to redirect money. A second reprieve looks unlikely. Of note for taxpayers, the government tab for paying furloughed workers while they are at home comes to roughly $400 million a day, according to a CBO estimate provided at the request of Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. The administration is also trying to fire thousands of federal workers in agencies that don't align with its priorities. Republican leaders in Congress have said that's part of the fallout from a shutdown. Past presidents, however, did not use shutdowns to engage in mass firings. The Republican administration has announced one reduction in force affecting 4,100 workers, with the biggest cuts happening at the departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education and Housing and Urban Development. White House budget chief Russ Vought said in an interview on \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" that many more are planned. \"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said. \"We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,\" Vought said. \"Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.\" A federal judge has temporarily blocked the firings, saying the cuts appeared to be politically motivated and were being carried out without much thought. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the administration was \"100%\" confident that it will prevail on the merits in subsequent legal action. Lawmakers acknowledge that many federal workers live paycheck to paycheck and will face some financial stress during the shutdown. Food banks in some communities have boosted efforts to help them. The Capital Area Food Bank, for example, said it would hold additional food distributions in the Washington region beginning Monday to support federal workers and contractors. Economic Impact Past shutdowns have had slight impacts on the economy, reducing growth in the quarter during which the shutdown occurs, but growth increases slightly in the following three months to help make up for it. One estimate from Oxford Economics said a shutdown reduces economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week. A shutdown that lasts the entire quarter, which has never occurred, would reduce growth for those three months by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage points. Some industries are hurt worse than others. The U.S. Travel Association said the travel economy is expected to lose $1 billion a week as travelers change plans to visit national parks, historic sites and the nation's capital, where many facilities such as Smithsonian Institution museums and the National Zoo are now closed to visitors. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that the Small Business Administration supports loans totaling about $860 million a week for 1,600 small businesses. Those programs close to new loans during the shutdown. The shutdown also has halted the issuance and renewal of flood insurance policies, delaying mortgage closings and real estate transactions. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages in cities across the United States, from airports in Boston and Philadelphia, to control centers in Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Tennessee, Dallas, Newark, New Jersey and more. Political fallout The party that insists on conditions as part of a government funding bill generally doesn't get its way. That was the case in 2013 and 2018 for Republicans. It remains to be seen how things will shake out this time, but neither side appears to be budging. So far, the public is rather split on who is to blame for the impasse. Roughly 6 in 10 U.S. adults say Trump and Republicans in Congress have \"a great deal\" or \"quite a bit\" of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% say the same about Democrats in Congress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Perceptions could change depending upon how much the White House uses the shutdown to eliminate Democratic priorities and Democratic-leaning states and cities. The administration has put on hold roughly $18 billion to fund a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey and an extension of the city's Second Avenue subway. It canceled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election. The administration cited reasons apart from the shutdown for the funding changes. In the end, there does not appear to be an easy way out of the shutdown. Republicans insists any negotiations on health care occur after the government is fully open for business. \"We're not conducting negotiations in a hostage situation,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. Across the Capitol, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Democrats \"are not going to bend and we're not going to break because we are standing up for the American people.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onwhite housetrumpcongresshousetreasurysmithsonian institutionsmall business administrationoxford economicshousing and urban developmenthealth and human services\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Black athletes today are getting record NBA and NFL contracts. Black musicians like Kendrick Lamar and SZA are raking in millions — in their case, hundreds of millions of dollars — from globe-spanning tours. And after years of being denied film and TV’s top roles and highest honors, Black actors and actresses are now regularly cast in major projects as well as nominated for (and actually winning) major awards. On top of this, many of today’s top influencers are both young and Black, attracting legions of followers and large, coveted corporate sponsorships.\n\nWhatever the medium — art, sport or digital — Black celebrities are thriving. But they are flourishing within a kind of Gilded Age that’s at a deep remove from the rest of Black America.\n\nSpeaking as a Black historian, I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to say that the 2020s have presented arguably the greatest sustained attack against Black civil rights since the 1960s. I say this in considering just how successful contemporary, coordinated efforts to roll back Black Americans’ gains in areas like education and employment have been. The Trump administration’s effective demonization and banning of DEI programs — and the ongoing acquiescence of higher education and corporate America to its requested purges — is just one example of the gambit’s potency. Even before Trump 2.0, though, there has been a widespread targeting of Black civil rights, and voting rights in particular, at the state level. And overt forms of racism continue to be normalized in both American politics and the public square.\n\nBy and large, the growing universe of Black celebrities who are at the top of their game has had a muted response to these widening attacks on Black America. In fact, as Black entertainment has accumulated power and clout in recent years, becoming more visible, prolific and profitable, there has arguably been a simultaneous and equal dip in Black celebrity activism. There have been no notable calls for boycotts of companies that are retreating from DEI, which includes many a corporation in the entertainment and sports worlds. And no call for the kinds of organized protests for which Black celebrities of yesteryear were renowned, and which often achieved complex outreach goals.\n\nDespite its controversies, celebrity activism has considerable practical value and indeed represents a storied part of American politics. Most celebrities naturally possess the communication skills and “rizz” that we ordinary folk lack. We often find celebrities’ rallying cries powerful — even when we don’t like what they’re saying, or when we recognize our connections to them as largely parasocial.\n\nTo this end, Americans today have a strong, deep-seated distaste for entertainers speaking on politics. This isn’t solely because we perceive celebrities these days as more detached; we resent the seemingly substantial advantage celebrities confer when supporting our adversaries. An AP/NORC poll conducted in December found that only 24 percent of people want celebrities to speak up about political issues; those who want professional athletes to speak up on political issues ranked a smidgen higher at 26 percent. When certain populations, like Black people, are considered, however, the desirability of celebrities’ activism is much more fluid. Consider that the current decline of Black celebrity activism comes at a time when there is a striking lack of Democratic political leadership, and especially Black Democratic political leadership, on the national stage.\n\nDating back to the second wave of Jim Crow-style racism in the early 1950s, Black celebrities have been critical in efforts to bring awareness to racial injustice and accountability to those perpetrating it. Black actors, musicians and athletes sought to reach and engage with white Americans and policymakers alike who were uninformed about, or indifferent to, the sweeping impacts of segregation and state violence against Black people. Aiming to boost their lesser-known liberal white allies in politics, Black celebrities conveyed these messages while facing the very real threat of blacklisting and extrajudicial violence.\n\nIn an alternate universe, one wonders whether Martin Luther King Jr. could have succeeded without the embrace of the likes of Jackie Robinson, Sidney Poitier and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, or if Malcolm X could have achieved mainstream validation absent his association with boxing legend Muhammad Ali. Where might civil rights for Black people be today without the influence of these canonized Black celebrities? And where will those rights be without that influence moving forward?\n\nIn interviews and on social media, where entertainers are otherwise disposed and trained to flex their feats, leading Black talents have been largely mum on Black America’s worsening plight. Whether this reflects a genuine lack of awareness or strategic ignorance, the dynamic reflects a palpable shift from the Black collectivism that typified the Civil Rights era to one centered squarely, and often unapologetically, around Black individualism.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the old Black celebrity guard in the late 1960s, the mantle of Black celebrity activism remained dormant for years as civil rights expanded throughout the nation. The tradition was then briefly reawakened in the 1990s, as the War on Drugs began upending Black communities, by hip-hop acts like NWA, Public Enemy and my personal favorite, Tupac Shakur. It again lapsed until the early 2010s, which saw the arrival of Beyoncé as a bona fide solo artist and a flood of young, socially attuned rappers like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole.\n\nBeyoncé’s contemporary catalogue is sprinkled with references to Black liberation and radical Black feminism. But Queen Bey’s public activism has been anything but. Like many other modern Black celebrities, she has “protested” entirely in her art or via surface-level teases that fall short of any kind of organized call to action. Exhibit A: Beyoncé’s tepid, anticlimactic endorsement of Kamala Harris’ presidential run in 2024, which both began and peaked with an 11th-hour, minutes-long pitch to Harris supporters at a rally in Beyoncé’s native Houston.\n\nThis kind of advocacy breadcrumbing has also reigned in the Black sports world, where activism by the likes of NBA superstar LeBron James — who was told by a Fox News host in 2018 to “shut up and dribble,” following some pointed digs at Donald Trump — has arguably been even more subdued. Not since former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick began protesting racial injustice in America in 2016 by kneeling during the national anthem has there been a powerful and consistent pro-Black voice in American sports. It seems inarguable that Kaepernick’s de facto blacklisting from the NFL following his protests has had at least somewhat of a chilling effect on Black entertainers more broadly.\n\nTo this end, no one has possessed as much unfulfilled promise in carrying the Black celebrity activism torch as Kendrick Lamar. Known for highly sociological, race-aware raps that track well enough to routinely fluster pundits at Fox News, Lamar performed last February at Super Bowl LIX. On that grand stage, many fans and political commentators expected a provocative display of Black political thought, no less because newly-elected President Trump was in attendance. At any rate, that was what I expected as a longtime Kendrick superfan. While Lamar’s performance indeed touched a political third rail by embracing pro-Black imagery and metaphors, the Compton, California, native was demonstrably most in his zone when basking in coy slights to his rap nemesis, Drake. Drake, a rapper with a white Jewish mother and a Black father, has himself been criticized for his relative silence on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and inattention to Black concerns more generally. That’s another story.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nEven Spike Lee, who built a career celebrating Black culture and spotlighting racism in the entertainment industry and in America writ large, is lately known more for his takes on his beloved but underachieving New York Knicks than on the current Black political crisis. During a press conference at Cannes for his latest film, “Highest 2 Lowest,” a searing treatise on class and power, Lee, when prompted to weigh in on Trump, told reporters that his wife had told him to “be very careful what you say.” And he obeyed her dictum.\n\nBlack celebrities’ disposition, at best, gives us this: We care about what’s happening, but don’t count on any particular direct activism from us. The broader subtext to Black America is clear, but damning: We embrace our excellence, and our racial challenges, at our own peril.","summary":"Muhammad Ali and Sidney Poitier helped shape history.

Our sovereign power flows from God to us. We lend power to our federal and state governments through the loan agreement called the U.S. Constitution. This is radically different from Great Britain, from which we escaped, where the king or queen has sovereign power—and hands out sovereign crumbs to placate their subjects through documents like the Magna Carta. Our most crucial sovereign power, as We The People, is controlling our border and populace. We never gave away this power to unelected judges. Not at our founding and the passage of the Fifth Amendment. Not after the Civil War and the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. Not in any subsequent Congress. Certainly not after the last election. Judges simply do not have the power to steal We The People's sovereign power to control our border and populace. This includes the crucial issue of birthright citizenship. TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP FIGHT HEADS BACK TO SUPREME COURT AS NEW TERM BEGINS Enacted after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship to the freed slaves and their descendants, the Fourteenth Amendment dictates that those persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States receive birthright citizenship. This phrase has, over the decades, developed an absurd meaning that is incorrect and incentivizes illegal immigration. Like the children of foreign ambassadors or invading armies, illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Rather, they are foreign citizens subject to the jurisdiction of their home countries. For this reason, illegal immigrants cannot serve in the military or in government. Instead, they come to the United States and obtain jobs in secret, paid under the table, to avoid detection. The Supreme Court previously ruled in Elk v. Wilkins (1884) that the Fourteenth Amendment’s birthright citizenship did not apply to the children of American Indians. Congress then passed a statute granting birthright citizenship to them. Answer this dispositive question: If birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to American Indians, in what world would it apply to illegal aliens? It simply does not. If illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, it makes no sense that their children are. If a child is born to American parents in a foreign country, that child is still American; for instance, many military children are born overseas. Logically, the reverse also should be true. President Trump, who has the same commonsense view of this issue, signed an executive order on January 20. The order dictates that children of illegal immigrant mothers and mothers here lawfully on a temporary basis are not entitled to citizenship, except where a child’s father is an American citizen or legal permanent resident. This order does not impact children already born here; rather, it only applies to children born 30 days after the order takes effect. If birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to American Indians, in what world would it apply to illegal aliens? The order has yet to take effect because several courts immediately enjoined it. This June, the Supreme Court dramatically curtailed the issuance of nationwide injunctions in Trump v. CASA; however, district judges continued to enjoin the executive order on the basis that classes of plaintiffs with the same common question—challenging the order’s legality—as well as states could challenge it. The administration has sought review by the Supreme Court prior to decisions by any appellate court. This filing, known as a petition for certiorari before judgment, is rare, as the Supreme Court prefers that cases proceed in the normal order. The birthright citizenship case, however, is an exceptional one, and the Supreme Court should grant the petition. In addition to the legal reasons why President Trump’s order should survive any challenge, there are important policy issues at stake. Many illegal immigrants want to bear children in the United States so those children can enjoy the benefits of American citizenship. These illegal aliens will risk their lives in many cases, either taking a chance on drowning in the Rio Grande or dying in the sweltering desert. Many illegals pay smugglers to assist them in crossing the border. Many of these smugglers are violent and engage in armed conflicts with Border Patrol agents, jeopardizing the lives of the agents, the illegal immigrant mothers, and the unborn children of pregnant illegals. In short, the current policy of birthright citizenship incentivizes illegal immigration and results in many dangerous border crossings. This irrational policy must change, and President Trump deserves massive credit for endeavoring to do so. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Leftists have asserted in the media and in litigation that President Trump’s order is plainly illegal. The Supreme Court, however, has never addressed the specific question of whether children born to illegal immigrants are entitled to American citizenship. In United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), the Court addressed the issue of whether children born in the United States to permanent legal residents are citizens. The Court held that such children are because their status as permanent and legal residents demonstrates their allegiance to (\"subject to the jurisdiction of\") the United States. President Trump’s executive order, however, has nothing to do with permanent legal residents. The order concerns illegals and those here on, for instance, temporary protected status. As such, Wong Kim Ark is irrelevant, and President Trump is not, contrary to leftists’ claims, defying Supreme Court precedent. Leftists judges, to the contrary, are violating We The People’s most crucial sovereign power of controlling our border and populace. Our nation has a massive illegal immigration crisis. Over ten million illegals—and perhaps more than twenty million—poured into the United States thanks to President Biden’s abysmal border policy. Biden, Border Czar Kamala Harris, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas spent four disgraceful years grossly mismanaging our border, causing a deluge of illegal immigrants in cities across the country. Some of these illegals have targeted Americans, committing murders, rapes, armed robberies, and home invasions. Other illegals have joined or were members of international terrorist organizations like Tren de Aragua. Still other illegals have made an income by selling drugs, including fentanyl-laced narcotics that have claimed many American lives. President Trump commendably is attempting to rectify the Biden border disaster, but inferior court judges have blocked his reasonable effort to do so. The time thus has come for the Supreme Court to intervene and affirm President Trump’s order that restores some sanity to our immigration system. Stealing We The People’s most crucial sovereign power to control our border and populace is the red line the Supreme Court cannot allow the federal judiciary to cross.","summary":"President Trump&apos;s executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants faces court challenges as the Supreme Court considers reviewing the case.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mike-davis-why-scotus-must-affirm-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/birthright-citizenship-eo-challenged-by-aclu.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 12:18:54","author":"Mike Davis","authors":["Mike Davis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":370448578,"title":"The GOP’s extraordinary rhetoric about the “No Kings” rallies","text":"President Donald Trump and his allies have spent weeks painstakingly trying to manufacture an image of an irredeemably violent American left.\n\nThis despite a series of rulings from judges, including several Republican-appointed ones, saying the image being painted is a mirage.

Choo-choo, America. All aboard! Get on this train, or get off the tracks, because buddy, it is COMING right now. Fast and furious – almost like Kamala's incredible lies she's been spewing at every single stop. It's just one after another. Rapid-fire. They come so fast, I can't keep up. It's just one after another. Seriously. It's impossible. A few weeks ago, she showed up at campus bookstore and proceeded to tell the 14 fans that last year's election was the closest ever. Amazing. Obviously, it wasn't. Not even close. It was probably the most lopsided election of my lifetime, although what Obama did to poor Mitt Romney in 2012 may take the cake on that one. Once she stumbled her way out of the bookstore, our former VP found herself spewing more ridiculous claims just last weekend with … Hillary Clinton (!!!). Hillary! The OG! The two most insufferable people in America actually told the crowd that they were a combined 4-0 against Donald Trump in debates. 4-0! While those two absolute lies were certainly impressive, I think we may have a new leader in the clubhouse as we start the third Saturday of October. Take a gander: Kamala Harris is BACK, baby! I mean … she's just incredible. It's the best. Kamala took most of the first half of the year off after Trump humiliated her last fall. But folks, she is BACK and better than ever right now, and I cannot get enough of it. This is all just complete and total bullshit. Every single word of it. There is not a 13-year-old in the world who wakes up with climate anxiety. Not one. The ONLY Gen-Zer who even knows the term \"climate anxiety\" are the ones with purple hair and a closet full of \"my body, my choice\" shirts. They probably work a shift at Starbucks every few days. I guarantee you that they're unattractive. Do you want to find the 1% of the country who gives a shit about the climate? Go out today and find your nearest \"No Kings!\" rally. That's it. There they are. And guess what? There won't be any Gen-Zers picketing. It's all boomers. Mostly angry, liberal, old white women with short hair and Capri pants. That's it! There is no chance Kamala Harris' goddaughter called her up two days ago and openly wept into the phone over climate change. None. Zero. Zilch. This is Gaslighting 101. Pandering 101. It's complete nonsense. Even for Kamala – who is maybe the best liar in politics right now – this is a stretch. You know who the Gen-Zers voted for last fall? Donald Trump. I've said it for a year now – the Dems somehow lost the Gen-Z vote. Do you know how hard that is to do? I've lived my whole life with the young demographic voting Democrat. Literally, my whole life. I was in college for the Obama years. Trust me, I saw it firsthand. But they all voted Trump last year. And now you're telling me they're concerned about climate change? Piss off, Kamala. We have real problems to fix right now. Like those pesky wars in the Middle East and whatever the hell is going on in Venezuela. The adults are talking right now.

In fact, he is thinking back to Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American student from Florida who was shot dead by a white Latino neighbourhood watch volunteer in 2012.\n\n“The Martin case – the nightmare specter of a lynching screaming across the void of history – ruined the mood of a nation that had, just a few years earlier, elected its first black president, and in a dizzying moment of self-congratulation, began to ponder on editorial pages whether the nation was now ‘post-racial’,” Cobb writes in the introduction to his book Three or More Is a Riot: Notes on How We Got Here: 2012-2025.\n\nMany of the essays in the collection were written contemporaneously, affording them the irony – sometimes bitter irony – of distance. Together they form a portrait of an era bookended by the killing of Martin and the return to power of Donald Trump, with frontline reporting from Ferguson and Minneapolis along the way. They make a compelling argument that everything is connected and nothing is inevitable about racial justice or democracy.\n\nAs Cobb chronicles across 437 pages, the 2013 acquittal of Martin’s killer, George Zimmerman, became a catalyst for conversations about racial profiling, gun laws and systemic racism, helping to inspire the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThree years later, Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white supremacist, attended a Bible study session at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, then opened fire and killed nine Black parishioners. Cobb notes that Roof told police he had been “radicalised” by the aftermath of Martin’s killing and wanted to start a “race war”.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his office at Columbia, Cobb, 56, says: “It was a very upside-down version of the facts because he looked on Martin’s death and somehow took the reaction to it as a threat to white people and that was what set him on his path. Roof was this kind of precursor of the cause of white nationalism and white supremacy that becomes so prominent now.”\n\nThen, in the pandemic-racked summer of 2020, came George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man murdered by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes as Floyd said, “I can’t breathe,” more than 20 times. Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets with demands to end police brutality, invest in Black communities and address systemic racism across various institutions.\n\nCobb, an author, historian and staff writer at the New Yorker magazine, continues: “It was the high tide. A lot of the organising, a lot of the kinds of thinking, the perspective and the work and the cultural kinds of representations – these things had begun eight years earlier with Trayvon Martin’s death.\n\n“This was an excruciating, nearly nine-minute-long video of a person’s life being extinguished and it happened at a time when people had nothing to do but watch it. They weren’t able to go to work because people were in lockdown. All of those things made his death resonate in a way that it might not have otherwise. There had been egregious instances of Black people being killed prior to that and they hadn’t generated that kind of societal response.”\n\nCities such as Minneapolis, Seattle and Los Angeles reallocated portions of police budgets to community programmes; companies committed millions of dollars to racial-equity initiatives; for a time, discussions of systemic racism entered mainstream discourse. But not for the first time in US history, progress – or at least the perception of it – sowed the seeds of backlash.\n\n“It also was a signal for people who are on the opposite side of this to start pushing in the opposite direction and that happened incredibly swiftly and with incredible consequences to such an extent that we are now in a more reactionary place than we were when George Floyd died in the first place,” Cobb says.\n\nNo one better embodies that reactionary spirit than Donald Trump, who rose to political prominence pushing conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birthplace and demonising immigrants as criminals and rapists. His second term has included a cabinet dominated by white people and a purge of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nTrump lost the presidential election a few months after Floyd died but returned to power last year, defeating a Black and south Asian challenger in Kamala Harris. According to Pew Research, Trump made important gains with Latino voters (51% Harris, 48% Trump) and won 15% of Black voters – up from 8% in 2020.\n\nWhat does Cobb make of the notion that class now outweighs race in electoral politics? “One of the things that they did brilliantly was that typically politics has worked on the basis of: ‘What will you do for me?’” Cobb says. “That’s retail politics. That’s what you expect.\n\n“The Trump campaign in 24 was much more contingent upon the question of: ‘What will you do to people who I don’t like?’ There were some Black men who thought their marginal position in society was a product of the advances that women made and that was something the Republican party said overtly, which is why I think their appeal was so masculinist.”\n\nTrump and his allies weaponised prejudice against transgender people to attract socially and religiously conservative voters, including demographics they would otherwise hold in “contempt”. “I also think that we tended to overlook the question of the extent to which Joe Biden simply handing the nomination to Kamala Harris turned off a part of the electorate,” Cobb says.\n\nHe expresses frustration with the well-rehearsed argument that Democrats became too fixated on “woke” identity politics at the expense of economic populism: “They make it seem as if these groups created identity politics. Almost every group that’s in the Democratic fold was made into an identity group by the actions of people who were outside.\n\n“If you were talking about African Americans, Black politics was created by segregation. White people said that they were going to act in their interest in order to prevent African Americans from having access. Women, through the call of feminism, came to address the fact that they were excluded from politics because men wanted more power. You could go through every single group.”\n\nYet it remains commonplace to talk about appealing to evangelical Christian voters or working-class non-college-educated voters, he says: “The presumption implicit in this is that all those people see the world in a particular way that is understandable or legible by their identity, and so there’s a one-sidedness to it. For the entirety of his political career, Trump has simply been a shrewd promulgator of white-identity politics.”\n\nThat trend has become supercharged in Trump’s second term. He has amplified the great replacement theory, sought to purge diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and complained that museums over-emphasise slavery. His actions have built a permission structure for white nationalists who boast they now have a seat at the top table.\n\nMany observers have also expressed dismay at Trump’s concentration of executive power and the speed and scale of his assault on democratic institutions. Cobb, however, is not surprised.\n\n“It’s about what I expected, honestly,” he says, “because throughout the course of the 2024 campaign, Trump mainly campaigned on the promises of what he was going to do to get back at people. They’re using the power of the state to pursue personal and ideological grievances, which is what autocracy does.”\n\nIt is now fashionable on the left to bemoan the rise of US authoritarianism as a novel concept, a betrayal of constitutional ideals envied by the world. Cobb has a more complex take, suggesting that the US’s claim to moral primacy, rooted in the idea of exceptionalism, is based on a false premise.\n\nHe argues: “America has been autocratic previously. We just don’t think about it. It’s never been useful … to actually grapple with what America was, and America had no interest in grappling with these questions itself. Who has ever managed personal growth while constantly screaming to the world about how special and amazing they are?”\n\nCobb’s book maps an arc of the moral universe that is crooked and uneven, pointing out that, between the end of reconstruction and 1965, 11 states in the south effectively nullified the protections of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments of the constitution, imposing Jim Crow laws, voter suppression and violence to disenfranchise Black citizens.\n\n“The constitution gave Black people the right to vote but, if you voted, you’d be killed and this was a known fact,” he says. “This went on for decade after decade after decade. You can call that a lot of things. You can’t call that democracy. It was a kind of racial autocracy that extended in lots of different directions.”\n\nHe adds: “We should have been mindful that the country could always return to form in that way, that its commitment to democracy had been tenuous. That was why race has played such a central role in the dawning of this current autocratic moment. But it’s not the only dynamic.\n\n“Immigration, which is tied to race in some ways, is another dynamic. The advances that women have made, the increasing acceptance and tolerance of people in the LGBTQ communities – all those things, combined with an economic tenuousness, have made it possible to just catalyse this resurgence of autocracy in the country.”\n\nIt is therefore hardly unexpected that business leaders and institutions would capitulate, as they have in the past, he says: “We might hope that they would react differently but it’s not a shock when they don’t. Go back to the McCarthy era. We see that in more instances than not, McCarthy and other similar kinds of red-baiting forces were able to exert their will on American institutions.”\n\nCobb’s own employer has been caught in the maelstrom. In February, the Trump administration froze $400m in federal research grants and funding to Columbia, citing the university’s “failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment” during Gaza protests last year. Columbia has since announced it would comply with nearly all the administration’s demands and agreed to a $221m settlement, restoring most frozen funds but with ongoing oversight.\n\nCobb does not have much to add, partly for confidentiality reasons, though he does comment: “In life, I have tended to not grade harshly for exams that people should never have been required to take in the first place.”\n\nHe is unwavering, however, in his critique of Trump’s attack on the university sector: “What’s happening is people emulating Viktor Orbán [the leader of Hungary] to try to crush any independent centres of dissent and to utilise the full weight of the government to do it, and also to do it in hypocritical fashion.\n\n“The cover story was that Columbia and other universities were being punished for their failure to uproot antisemitism on their campuses. But it’s difficult to understand how you punish an institution for being too lenient about antisemitism and the punishment is that you take away its ability to do cancer research, or you defund its ability to do research on the best medical protocols for sick children or to work on heart disease and all the things that were being done with the money that was taken from the university.\n\n“In fact, what is being done is that we are criminalising the liberal or progressive ideas and centres that are tolerant of people having a diverse array of ideas or progressive ideas. The irony, of course, is that one of the things that happens in autocracy is the supreme amount of hypocrisy. They have an incredible tolerance for hypocrisy and so all these things are being done under the banner of protecting free speech.”\n\nThat hypocrisy has been on extravagant display again in the aftermath of Kirk’s killing by a lone gunman on a university campus in Utah. Trump and his allies have been quick to blame the “radical left” and “domestic terrorists” and threaten draconian action against those who criticise Kirk or celebrate his demise. The response is only likely to deepen the US’s political polarisation and threat of further violence.\n\nSpencer Cox, the governor of Utah and a rare voice urging civil discourse, wondered whether this was the end of a dark chapter of US history – or the beginning.

The movement looks different than it did the last time around. It’s more hard-bitten. But it retains the same underlying idealism about the American project that led first to the explosive growth of the coalition, and then to its dismissal by cynics.\n\nToday, in a reprisal of the first “No Kings” rallies that took place in June, millions of protesters will gather around the country to express their opposition to Trump. Over the summer, protesters waved American flags, dressed as the Founding Fathers and the Statue of Liberty, and held signs with quotes from the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Those rallies drew an estimated 2 million to 5 million people around the country—on the scale of the 2017 Women’s March that convened the day after Trump’s first inauguration, then a competitor for the largest single day of protest the United States had ever seen.\n\nOrganizers are now expecting an even bigger turnout. “We have a goal for No Kings to be the largest peaceful protest in modern American history,” says Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive organization Indivisible, one of the many groups coordinating the demonstrations. MAGA, at least, is doing its part to deride the gatherings as uncool: “Anyone who participates in a No Kings rally is a dork,” one right-wing influencer wrote on X. Earlier reflections on the Resistance brushed it off as embarrassing pap. But such dismissals now risk ignoring the possibility that earnest outrage, at the right place and the right time, is itself a powerful tonic against the corrosion of American democracy.\n\nThe circumstances of Trump’s first presidency lent themselves naturally to the rise of a popular opposition movement. Here was someone who had secured the White House via the quirks of the Electoral College despite losing a majority of the vote, and under conditions muddied by Russian interference. The movement that became known as the Resistance grew rapidly in this context, in what the political scientists Theda Skocpol, Caroline Tervo, and Kirsten Walters termed a “civic explosion” of local political engagement across the country, largely by first-time activists inspired by their disdain for Trump’s policies and character.\n\nThat movement’s on-the-ground organizing proved to be quietly, but strikingly, effective. The early phase of the opposition to the first Trump administration—before the racial-justice protests following George Floyd’s murder, in 2020—was largely led by white, college-educated, suburban women, and many of them, yes, wore pink “pussy hats” and T-shirts with slogans such as It’s Mueller Time! But they helped secure the “blue wave” midterm victory in 2018 that flipped the House of Representatives for Democrats and allowed the party to begin clawing back Trump’s power through legislative oversight. And though that congressional response had its limitations—neither impeachment of Trump, after all, successfully barred him from office—the Resistance notched continued successes at a local level in countering efforts to pull books from school shelves and restrict access to reproductive health care after Roe v. Wade was overturned. And, of course, a Democrat won the White House in 2020.\n\nThen came 2024, and Kamala Harris’s failure to secure the presidency against the rising tide of inflation and post-pandemic malaise. Lara Putnam, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh who studies grassroots activism in Pennsylvania, told me that the progressive social politics and “focus on protecting democracy” of the Resistance were not well aligned with the concerns of less engaged swing voters, who chose Trump for economic reasons. Still, Putnam’s research shows that local organizing that grew out of the Resistance made an impact in 2024: Activists were able to help Pennsylvania Democrats hold on to control of the statehouse, even as the state swung to the right.\n\nWhen Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he did so with a new claim to legitimacy after winning a plurality—though still not a majority—of the popular vote. This time, the streets were quiet on Inauguration Day and immediately after. Some on the right saw this as evidence of a “vibe shift,” a broader turn toward right-wing cultural dominance and away from liberal and progressive ideas. The rapid capitulation of major civic institutions, such as social-media companies and law firms, only emphasized the supposed shift.\n\nIn this environment, resistance seemed pointless. Maybe even worse than pointless: It had been kind of cringe. Meaning: unself-conscious; overly sincere; insufficiently insulated from criticism by the protective layer of irony that allows a person to declare, when mocked, “Just kidding!”; and, worst of all, ineffective. Remembering the pussy hats, Liza Featherstone, a columnist for the left-wing magazine Jacobin, mourned, “It’s triggering to even write these things down.” The progressive writer Ross Barkan derided the “hysterics” of the first-term Resistance and hoped the new quiet might “speak to the growing maturity of America.”\n\nAs the reference to hysteria suggests, it’s difficult to fully disaggregate the substance of this critique from gender politics, especially because of the predominance of older women in Resistance organizing during Trump’s first term. Liberal politics, the humor writer Clare Haber-Harris assessed in early 2025, had become “middle-aged-women coded” and therefore “uncool.” These Resistance aesthetics contrasted with the macho energy of Trump’s second term, itself a promise that Americans wouldn’t have to listen to those hectoring women anymore.\n\nBut these dismissals both ignore the very real victories of the Resistance and miss why cringe was essential to the movement’s effectiveness. These organizers were people “who basically believed that there was such a thing as the rule of law, that there was such a thing as democracy,” Putnam told me, “and that these were things that were worth fighting for.” They were, in that sense, institutionalists—and therefore inherently opposed to MAGA’s devil-may-care desire to burn the place down.\n\nCringe “implies a kind of naïveté that so often gets coded as feminine,” wrote the New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen, “a silly belief that human beings, through sincere effort, might actually improve themselves and the world.” Such a belief might seem uncool. But it can be a powerful tool with which to cut through the nihilism of Trump and those around him, which draws its power from its insincerity, its refusal to distinguish between truth and falsehood, its willingness to mock and degrade previously treasured beliefs. As one protest sign put it at a demonstration early in Trump’s second term: BE CRINGE. SHIT MATTERS.\n\nIdealism helped motivate Trump’s opponents during his first term. But it has the potential to carry even more weight during his second, given how the president’s anti-democratic project is not as constrained as it was the first time around. As Levin of Indivisible told me, “The real enemy in an authoritarian breakthrough moment is nihilism and cynicism and fatalism.” This idea was a regular subject of the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who famously argued that totalitarian regimes depend on eroding their subjects’ sense of political possibility. Such governments, she wrote, aim not “to instill convictions but to destroy the capacity to form any.”\n\n“I didn’t like resistlib cringe content in the first Trump administration,” wrote Adam Gurri, the editor in chief of Liberal Currents, in a social-media post two months after Trump’s second inauguration, admitting: “I was wrong. I was just being a snob.” As Gurri suggests, the administration’s insistence on irony and insincerity has given a new power to plain, old, corny symbols. Recently, a photo published in the Chicago Tribune went viral, showing a Marine veteran protesting amid clouds of tear gas in front of an ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, stoically holding not one but two American flags. Even the name of the No Kings protest is a reclamation of foundational American heritage that might have felt cheesy a year ago, but today carries a new seriousness.\n\nStill, for “resistlib cringe content” to have power, it needs to be welded with concrete action. Otherwise it risks undercutting itself and breeding distrust, an unwitting imitation of MAGA’s nihilism. Last spring, Senator Cory Booker held the Senate floor for a record-breaking 25 hours in a speech railing against Trump—arguably the first time in Trump’s second term that a congressional Democrat sought to harness the energy of the Resistance past. Demonstrators wrote out lines from Booker’s speech on placards at protests held later that week. But those hoping that the speech would herald a newly confrontational Democratic Party were disappointed when Booker voted to confirm Trump’s nominee for ambassador to China weeks later.\n\nOrganizers today are conscious of the danger of speaking the language of resistance without wielding any power to match. In a pamphlet published shortly after the 2024 election, Indivisible acknowledged, “Too often in Trump 1.0, we embraced the aesthetics of protests instead of using them as part of a strategy.” Theda Skocpol advised would-be Trump opponents in advance of his inauguration that the most effective aspects of the previous Resistance were not the showy marches, but what happened after the pink-hatted demonstrators went home and got to work: the “persistent, community-based efforts” that focused on building support for Democratic candidates and sharing information about the local effects of planned Trump policies. These activists were not concerned with ideological purity tests, but with the practical building of power. Even at the time, this organizing work received relatively little attention from commentators sneering at the overly earnest aesthetics of Resistance “wine moms.”\n\n“The most effective resistance might be investing in things that Trump’s rhetoric tries to delegitimize: community solidarity, mutual aid, and bottom-up organizing,” one contributor wrote to a postelection symposium organized by the left-leaning journal Democracy. This suggestion turned out to be a markedly accurate forecast of what opposition to Trump looks like today. The series of rallies that culminated in No Kings has taken the form of distributed protests organized by local activists across the country, without one single focal point. (The June No Kings rally didn’t even feature an event in Washington, D.C., avoiding tangling with—or giving further attention to—Trump’s military parade that same day.)\n\nSince the summer, Trump’s strategy of shifting ICE and the National Guard from city to city magnified this localism. Each targeted jurisdiction has responded with its own character: Protesters gathered to confront ICE en masse in the middle of a Los Angeles freeway, or have danced in frog costumes in Portland, Oregon. With the notable exception of a protest held a month into the federal occupation of D.C., the District’s residents have opted against the large gatherings that the city saw during the Women’s March and the George Floyd protests. Instead, many of them focused on helping one another as neighbors—chasing away ICE agents and walking the children of immigrant parents to school in the morning. “The people getting food to families of migrant neighbors abducted by ICE is resistance,” the D.C. mutual-aid collective Remora House explained. In Chicago, David Black, a Presbyterian pastor whom ICE agents shot with pepper balls, described protests outside Illinois ICE facilities as not “resistance” but “world building”: “We are making ourselves into the world we want to give to the next seven generations.”\n\nThis sentiment is, arguably, cringe. But it is also, on the most basic level, the work of politics. And precisely for that reason, it is an attempt to countermand the senses of loneliness and unmooring from reality that Arendt identified as ingredients of tyranny.\n\nOrganizers of today’s No Kings rally have emphasized that the gatherings are just one part of this broader movement, an opportunity to loudly and collectively voice the defiance already happening on the ground. The Trump administration appears to have noticed. Although June’s No Kings protests gained relatively little attention from Trump and congressional Republicans, the party has busied itself over the past week with attacking the upcoming demonstrations as a “Hate America Rally.” The mood this time is darker than in June: The government is shut down, more National Guard troops are deployed on the country’s streets, and the administration is intent on portraying its political opposition as un-American. But the protesters are coming with the Stars and Stripes in hand.","summary":"But it’s also effective.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/no-kings-protest-good-cringe-resistance/684595/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ykPkI0zjLNO6g8w1EFTuOI05CaA=/0x0:5000x2813/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_GoodCringe/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 11:00:00","author":"Quinta Jurecic","authors":["Quinta Jurecic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.249},{"id":370415764,"title":"Top MAGA officials are growing 'crueler' in the service of Trump: analysis","text":"During Donald Trump's first presidency, he bitterly clashed with a long list of traditional conservatives who pushed back against his proposals — from a secretary of state (Rex Tillerson) to a White House chief of staff (John Kelly) to a national security adviser (John Bolton) to two U.S. attorneys general (Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr).

Maybe Patel and Hegseth were always this paranoid and petulant, but Bondi seems to have grown crueler and coarser in direct relation to her time with Trump.
