I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"\n\nWhen asked if he has the legal basis to extend the deadline, he responded: \"We do.\"\n\nTrump's extension is at odds with the will of Congress, which passed the sale-or-ban measure last year. His predecessor, former President Joe Biden, immediately signed the bill into law.\n\nThe law was aimed to address concerns that TikTok, which has 170 million American users, could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with a lower court and upheld the law in January just before Trump was set to take office.\n\nThe platform briefly went dark for a few hours during the weekend before Trump's inauguration.\n\nTikTok praised Trump for saving the platform after it became available again.\n\nTrump tried to force a sale of TikTok to an American buyer in 2020, during his first term in office.\n\nBut last year, Trump said he liked the platform because he believed it had helped him win the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,\" Trump said in December, although most young voters backed the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump's unilateral deadline extensions have led some analysts to dismiss the notion that a ban might ever take place during his time in office.\n\n\"What ban? There is nothing 'looming' about the potential TikTok ban anymore,\" said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering. \n\n\"TikTok's behaviour also indicates they're confident in their future, as they rolled out new AI video tools at Cannes this week.\"\n\n\"Smaller players, like Snap, will try to steal share during this \"uncertain time,\" but they will not succeed because this next round for TikTok isn't uncertain at all,\" Ms Chickering added.\n\nThe Trump administration said in April that the US and China had neared a deal that would have placed majority control of TikTok's US operations under American ownership. That deal has yet to materialise.\n\n\"There are key matters to be resolved,\" a ByteDance spokesperson said at the time. \"Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.\"\n\nTrump has said he would be open to seeing it sold to cloud computing giant Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison is a long-time ally of Trump's.\n\nBillionaire Frank McCourt, Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian are part of another team bidding for the platform.\n\nAnd the biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has said he's also interested in buying TikTok as part of a different investor group.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyqjepq2e1o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e40c/live/5d52acc0-4bd2-11f0-a7ff-35f4da97d668.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:40:22","author":"Lily Jamali","authors":["Lily Jamali"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":332489734,"title":"Rock band frontman declares Trump voters are 'not allowed' at his shows","text":"The lead singer of the alternative rock band \"The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus\" told supporters supporters of President Donald Trump they are permanently banned from his shows Saturday.

Reid was the only man left after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity – the rare Republican officeholder in the vote-rich but heavily Democratic Washington, D.C. metro -- bowed out of the contest last month citing health reasons. Reid has been a well-known Republican voice in central Virginia, previously serving on the Henrico County Republican Committee, as a delegate to the RNC in 2024 and as a top staffer to former Sen. George Allen, R-Va. Reid will join current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears on the Republican ticket this fall, while Attorney General Jason Miyares joins them too in running for re-election. GOP HOPEFUL EARLE-SEARS UNVEILS ‘AXE-THE-TAX’ PLAN IN VIRGINIA GOVERNORS RACE Reid has centered his campaign on a unity message to \"grow\" the GOP in a state where the political divide is numerically narrow, but marked in that Democrats are often the favored line in statewide elections. The first point of his campaign message on his website centered around education versus \"indoctrination.\" \"His focus is on ensuring that our educational system imparts knowledge and critical thinking skills, not political bias, preparing students for success in a diverse world instead of creating radical activists,\" read a line on his website. On the hot topic of immigration, Reid’s campaign said the candidate is \"dedicated to enforcing immigration laws, not allowing localities to ignore them.\" His campaign also objected to \"obliterating\" U.S. heritage by conserving landmarks. WINSOME EARLE-SEARS ANNOUNCES VA GOV BID TO BUILD ON YOUNGKIN RECORD: IT'S ‘ALL ABOUT BUSINESS' Reid’s campaign did run into a short-lived controversy when the former pundit – the first openly gay man to run statewide in Virginia – was subjected to lewd photos of himself being posted online. Reid denied any connection with the Tumblr account in question, but the controversy led some Republicans to briefly call for him to drop out. Reid, Earle-Sears and several top Virginia Republicans converged on Richmond Tuesday night to celebrate the primary winners across the board, including in the General Assembly’s lower chamber.

Bernie Sanders is urging Democratic leaders to stop cozying up to their own wealthy donors.\n\nIn a letter obtained exclusively by The Washington Post, Sanders and seven Democratic senators call on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin to ban super PACs and “dark money” in Democratic primaries. \n\nThe message is clear: If Democrats want to fight the influence of right-wing oligarchs, they need to start by cleaning up their own house.\n\n“The American people are disgusted with a corrupt political system that allows Elon Musk to spend $270 million to elect Donald Trump,” the senators wrote. “They want change. We can make change.”\n\nThe letter’s signers—which include Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Peter Welch of Vermont—argue that billionaires and corporate interests are playing an outsized role in shaping elections and policy, and leaving lasting damage in their wake.\n\n“Right-wing billionaires have spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding super PACs to dominate in our primaries,” they wrote. “In addition to intervening in Democratic primaries, it is not uncommon for these same super PACS and dark money groups to fund general election campaigns where they work overtime to defeat Democrats. The result: they have defeated a number of excellent members in the House and Senate. That is unacceptable.”\n\nThey specifically call out pro-Israel groups like the Republican Jewish Coalition Victory Fund and the United Democracy Project PAC, which poured more than $30 million in 2024 primaries to unseat progressives such as former Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush. But the influence of outside groups is only part of the party. Before Kamala Harris even locked up the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, deep-pocketed billionaire donors like Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and former Meta CEO Sheryl Sandberg had already begun writing checks.\n\nStill, their contributions were dwarfed by Musk’s. By the end of 2024, the tech billionaire had dumped $288 million into Trump’s campaign—a sum Musk later suggested helped tip the race in Trump’s favor. \n\nWhile the senators acknowledge that overturning Citizens United—the Supreme Court ruling that opened the floodgates to unlimited outside spending—is a long-term project, they argue that Democrats can’t afford to wait on internal reforms. And they may be right: Americans are clearly uneasy with billionaire influence. A January poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that six in 10 U.S. adults think it’s a bad thing when the president relies on billionaires for policy advice. Just 12% think it’s a good thing.\n\nThat wariness could create an opening. During this year’s race for DNC chair, most candidates expressed support for limiting super PAC spending in Democratic primaries—at least rhetorically. Martin himself said he backed the idea “in spirit,” but admitted that “that’s about all the DNC chair can do.”\n\nRelated | The Democratic Party has a big problem on its hands\n\nStill, it might be time for Democratic leadership to take Sanders seriously. He’s one of the most popular elected officials in the country and is actively recruiting both Democrats and independents to run in red states as part of a working-class, anti-corporate movement. Alongside New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, he’s been rallying crowds on a “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, blasting Trump and Musk as twin faces of billionaire capture. This week, the tour heads to Texas.\n\nThe letter also taps into broader frustration with Democratic leadership, especially Schumer. In March, he and nine other Senate Democrats voted to pass Republican spending legislation, prompting backlash from the party’s progressive wing. \n\nAt the same time, the Democratic brand was cratering. Internal polling from Navigator Research, shared with Politico, found that most voters in competitive House districts felt Democrats weren’t focused on “people like me.” Only 27% of independents felt Democrats shared their priorities; 55% said the party didn’t.\n\nGiven all that, maybe this is Sanders’ moment—and maybe the path forward for Democrats starts with breaking up with the billionaires they claim to oppose.","summary":"As Americans grow increasingly uneasy about billionaires steering federal policy (see: Elon Musk), Sen.

Iran has acted on those calls by waging its war against Israel through Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and, until recently, Syria.\n\nAh, but everyone expects Israel to just sit there and take it. Sorry, but Iran does not get a free pass by hiding behind its war proxies. Iran started this war. Israel will finish it. In this context, Israel’s recent strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities and personnel is far from an act of aggression. Rather, it is a defensive move against an enemy that has repeatedly attacked Israel and called for its destruction.\n\nNo doubt, in the coming days and weeks, we will see the free Palestine crowd expand their protests to include support for Iran’s tyrannical regime, just as they have done with Hamas.

I suppose they could be referred to as “illegals.”\n\nHowever, as the offspring of these immigrants, we understand the universal desire to escape oppression and the eagerness of people to live free from tyranny. We support the rights of immigrants and refugees to seek asylum in the U.S. Today’s immigrants are as driven and hardworking as their predecessors.

A suspect surrendered to police on Sunday.\n\nThe Republican president spoke to reporters early Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after abruptly leaving an international summit in Canada because of rising tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. Asked if he had called Walz yet, Trump said the Democratic governor is “slick” and “whacked out” and, “I’m not calling him.”\n\nPresidents often reach out to governors, mayors and other elected officials at times of tragedy, such as after mass killings or natural disasters, to offer condolences and, if needed, federal assistance.\n\nOn the plane, Trump sounded uninterested in having such contact with Walz, who was the vice presidential running mate for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump. During the campaign, Walz often branded Trump and other Republican politicians as “just weird.”\n\n“I don’t really call him. He’s slick — he appointed this guy to a position,\" Trump said. \"I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I’m not calling him. why would I call him?\n\n“I could call him and say, ‘Hi, how you doing?’” Trump continued. “The guy doesn’t have a clue. He's a, he's a mess. So, you know, I could be nice and call him but why waste time?”\n\nTeddy Tschann, a spokesperson for Walz, responded Tuesday with a statement that said, \"Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn’t about Trump or Walz.\n\n“It’s about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the Governor remains focused on helping all three heal,” Tschann said.\n\nTrump's mention of “this guy” being appointed to a position appeared to be a reference to Vance Boelter, the suspect who surrendered to police after a nearly two-day manhunt in Minnesota.\n\nBoelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, records show, though it was unclear if or how well they knew each other.\n\nAuthorities say Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were seriously wounded in a shooting a few miles away from the home of former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was fatally shot along with her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs.\n\nFriends and former colleagues interviewed by The Associated Press described Boelter as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for Trump.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Boelter with murder and stalking, which could result in a death sentence if convicted. His lead attorney has declined to comment.\n\nWalz had no public appearances on Tuesday, but on Monday he thanked Ontario Premier Doug Ford on social media for his call expressing condolences to Hortman's family and the people of Minnesota.\n\n“In times of tragedy, I’m heartened when people of different views and even different nations can rally together around our shared humanity,” Walz wrote.\n\nIn an interview with Minnesota Public Radio, also on Monday, Walz said he wasn't surprised by the lack of outreach from Trump, saying, “I think I understand where that's at.”\n\nWalz said he has spoken with Vice President JD Vance and was “grateful” for the call and also had talked with former President Joe Biden and Harris.\n\n“I’m always open to, you know, people expressing gratitude. Vice President Vance assured us, and he delivered, that the FBI would be there as partners with us to get it done,\" Walz said. \"That was what needed to be done.”\n\nThis story has been corrected to show it was Hortman, not Hoffman, who was killed, and it was Hoffman, not Hortman, who served on the state workforce development board with Boelter.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Not once did they tell me why? I pray you never have a moment like this.'\n\nFollowing his Senate speech the Democrat was criticized by Republicans online for a 'fake crying routine.'\n\n'Democrat Senator Alex Padilla is doing a fake crying routine on the floor,' conservative news outlet The Blaze reacted to Padilla's emotional delivery. \n\nThe right-leaning outlet Townhall similarly wrote: 'Alex Padilla fake cries while explaining how law enforcement protected DHS Secretary Noem from a no-name Senator interrupting her press conference.'\n\nConservative influencer Johnny MAGA reacted: ''Senator Padilla' is literally crying on the floor right now after playing the victim in the Los Angeles DHS press conference incident, where he pushed Secret Service and charged the Secretary. So pathetic.'\n\nPadilla has been provided a security detail since he was temporarily apprehended by Secret Service. \n\nThe Democrat's detail joined him going to and from the Senate floor as he delivered his speech on his run-in with Noem. \n\nThe senator's wife and three sons were in attendance for the speech, reportedly watching from the Senate gallery. \n\n'If that is what the administration is willing to do to a United States senator for having the authority to simply ask a question, imagine what they'll do to any American who dares to speak up,' Padilla posed. \n\n'If what you saw happen can happen when the cameras are on you, imagine not only what can happen, but what is happening in so many places where there are no cameras. \n\nImmediately after the scuffle last week, Noem accepted a meeting with Padilla and the two spoke for 15 minutes. \n\nPadilla said in his speech that he was in the federal building where Noem was addressing the press because he was supposed to meet with four-star Gen. Gregory Guillot about the military's role in the Los Angeles anti-ICE riots.\n\nWhile he was waiting for his meeting, Padilla claims staffers escorted him to Noem's briefing where he was later apprehended. \n\nHis rough-and-tumble removal and apprehension by authorities immediately sparked indignation from most Democrats at the time, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who called the ruckus 'a shameful and stunning abuse of power.' But Maine Democrat Jared Golden said: 'I don’t think politics as theater is what our job is here.'\n\n'I think that it’s never good when a senator or member of Congress gets roughed up by law enforcement,' he added. \n\nMany Democratic senators stood on the floor as Padilla delivered his remarks.","summary":"Sen.

Why would I call him?”\n\n \"He’s slick — he appointed this guy to a position,\" he added, echoing rumors that Walz had close political ties to the shooting suspect, Vance Boelter, 57.\n\n Walz gave a press conference on Saturday, June 14, after early morning shootings left State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, dead and State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, gravely injured. In his remarks, the governor said the attacks \"appear to be politically motivated.\"\n\n Law enforcement officials said Boelter, 57, was apprehended with a list of about 70 potential targets, including doctors, community and business leaders, and locations for Planned Parenthood. U.S. Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, later said that her name was on the list, and six other state-level representatives — all Democrats — confirmed to the Detroit Free Press that they had been notified about being named by Boelter\n\n It is common practice for the president to reach out to the governor of a state amid or following major disasters or tragedies. However, Trump seemed unbothered by the implication that he should contact Walz — who notably ran against him last fall as Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate.\n\n \"I could call him, say, 'Hi, how are you doing?' \" the president mocked. \"The guy doesn’t have a clue, he’s a mess.... So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?\"\n\n Walz previously served with Hortman in the Minnesota State Legislature. While confirming her death on Saturday, he said, “Our state lost a great leader, and I lost a dearest friend.\"\n\n As for the rumors about Walz and Boelter's political ties, the suspected shooter was appointed to a 60-member state workforce development board by the governor's predecessor, Mark Dayton. He served a two-year term and was reappointed by Walz in 2019 for a term that ended in 2023. Sources within Walz's office told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the governor did not know Boelter.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Walz's office issued a statement to PEOPLE in response to Trump's snub on Tuesday.\n\n “Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn’t about Trump or Walz,” said spokesperson Teddy Tschann. “It’s about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, & the State of Minnesota, and the Governor remains focused on helping all three heal.\"\n\n Boetler was apprehended on Sunday, following what officials have called the largest manhunt in Minnesota history. He has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder, as well as federal charges including stalking and murder.","summary":"Speaking with reporters on Monday, the president said he had no plans to reach out to the Minnesota governor","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-refuses-to-call-tim-walz-following-minnesota-assassinations-11756532","image":"https://people.com/thmb/aJZW-2nsxLUAW1007oigDblwlKQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(750x239:752x241)/donald-trump-tim-walz-061725-edea93ffc1404edfb34329b0b372a4de.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 20:44:34","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":332455696,"title":"Michael Douglas' daughter Carys returns to her roots in move that delights mom Catherine Zeta-Jones","text":"Carys Douglas is enjoying her college graduate life already.\n\nThe youngest daughter of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas graduated from Brown University last month, and it appears her first order of business was a trip to her mom's \"mother country\" of Wales.\n\nIn addition to the 22-year-old, a budding singer, the No Reservations actress and the Fatal Attraction actor, who have been married since 2000, share son Dylan, 24, who also graduated from Brown, and are also parents to Cameron Douglas, 46, who the latter shares with his ex-wife Diandra Luker.\n\nThis week, Carys took to Instagram and shared a round of photos from her trip to Wales, starting off with a stunning shot of a white horse atop a green hill, with the beach behind it.\n\nShe next shared a glowing selfie, followed by more sights and food enjoyed in Wales, and lastly another sweet selfie featuring her grandmother, Catherine's mother Patricia Fair.\n\nCarys made her caption a string of whimsical emojis, and fans were then quick to take to the comments section under the post and gush over it, though first her mother wrote: \"Ah!!! The mother country, it's good, to touch, the green green grass of home.\" The doting mom appeared to be quoting lyrics from the 1965 country song \"Green, Green Grass of Home, written by Claude \"Curly\" Putman Jr., and first recorded by singer Johnny Darrell, of which there is a popular version by Welsh singer Tom Jones.\n\nOthers followed suit with: \"Majestic girl. Majestic place,\" and: \"Wow what a view,\" as well as: \"So pretty!\"\n\nCarys graduated from Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, following in the footsteps of her brother, who majored in political science. In addition to her college studies and dabbling in singing, Carys is a budding actress, having appeared in a short film titled F*ck That Guy featuring You star Victoria Pedretti. \n\nMeanwhile, her older brother, who has also dabbled in acting, launched a podcast with SiriusXM last year, Young American, through which he intended to both inform and motivate his generation when it comes to the political issues impacting their future. The show launched in September for a limited run, in time for the election between former Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram post at the time announcing the new venture, Dylan wrote: \"It's been a wild ride the last couple of years.

His mother Diana was part of one of the oldest and most respected families in the Caribbean island, and his ancestors' roots there have been traced back to the 1600s. The compound is located in the island's Warwick Parish, though the family listed it for sale for $10.6 million in 2019.\n\nAside from Bermuda, Dylan and Carys were largely raised in upstate New York; the family, who have also owned a home in Mallorca, Spain for over two decades, last year put on the market their 22-bedroom, Georgian-style estate in Irvington.","summary":"Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' daughter Carys delighted her mom as she shared photos from her post-grad trip to Wales","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/838743/michael-douglas-daughter-carys-returns-to-roos-delights-catherine-zeta-jones/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/00bfe9c54933-michael-carys-catherine-cannes.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 20:44:22","author":"Beatriz Colon","authors":["Beatriz Colon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.455},{"id":332459734,"title":"What happens in the Situation Room?","text":"In previous Situation Room meetings, the current intelligence and crisis information was discussed and shared with the National Security Council staff, the national security adviser, and the president, according to the Clinton White House archive.\n\nThe Situation Room has hosted many famous meetings that have shaped national and global events and policy.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the Situation Room.\n\nWhat is the Situation Room?\n\nIn 1961, after the Bay of Pigs invasion, President John F. Kennedy decided that he and future presidents needed a crisis management center and ordered the construction of a secure communications site.\n\nThe Situation Room, sometimes called the “sit room,” is located below the West Wing of the White House. The 5,500-square-foot space is equipped with advanced communications and information processing tools, making it a hub for national security officials to monitor and deal with national and foreign crises in real time.\n\nWho attends the Situation Room?\n\nThe conference room’s staff is composed of 130 personnel, organized around five watch teams that provide 24/7 monitoring of international and domestic events, a travel support team, video operators, and communication technicians.\n\nA handful of other officials could be needed in the Situation Room in addition to the president, National Security Council staff, and the national security adviser.\n\nDepending on the situation, they include the secretary of state, secretary of defense, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the director of national intelligence, according to the Obama White House Archives.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nOnly people with top-level security clearances, vetted by the U.S. Secret Service, are allowed in the Situation Room. All authorized people receive instruction on the rules and guidelines for appropriate conduct.\n\nOne of the main rules of the Situation Room is not to talk about what happened. In 2018, former Trump adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman was let go after secretly recording a Situation Room conversation.\n\nAccording to Brett Bruen, a former Obama administration official, phones are prohibited within the room and should be kept in a locker outside.\n\nAll communications are monitored and encrypted.\n\nRecent Situation Room meetings held by US presidents\n\nOperation to kill Osama bin Laden\n\nOn May 1, 2011, a historic moment was captured in the Situation Room: “Operation Neptune Spear.” This was the plan for a U.S. Navy SEAL raid to kill Osama bin Laden.\n\nBin Laden was the founder of the terrorist organization al Qaeda, conducting many terrorist attacks, including 9/11.\n\nWhen U.S. intelligence agencies finally determined where bin Laden might be, 10 years after the terrorist attacks, then-President Barack Obama and the national security team developed the operation.\n\nIn the photo, Obama, then-Vice President Joe Biden, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, among others, sat around the conference table watching their operation play out.\n\n“This was the first and only time as president that I’d watch a military operation unfold in real time,” Obama wrote after the meeting. He described waiting and watching the plan unfold as “excruciating.”\n\nRussia’s takeover of Crimea\n\nOn March 3, 2014, Obama called for a meeting in the Situation Room, following crises between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Defense Department announced that the U.S. will cease all military relations with Russia, due to its hostile takeover of Crimea.\n\nAfterward, then-Secretary of State John Kerry left for Kyiv, Ukraine, to seek a diplomatic solution.\n\nKilling of Abu Bakr al Baghadi: ISIS leader\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2019, Trump and his national security officials gathered in the White House to watch his operation to capture or kill the founder and leader of the Islamic State.\n\nAfter trying to hunt down Baghadi for six years, U.S. analysts believed they had found him in Syria.\n\nCompared to Obama’s raid that killed bin Laden, Trump was presented with different circumstances, since there weren’t any hostile forces nearby, as Trump received “consent” from the Russians and Turks to follow through. Trump said his biggest concern about the operation was getting Americans killed.No American soldiers were injured.\n\n“U.S. Special Operations Forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style,” Trump wrote. “The U.S. personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it.”\n\nDrone strike killing Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2020, an Iranian major general was killed by an American drone strike ordered by Trump in the Situation Room.\n\nWhile this meeting wasn’t in the official Situation Room, Trump convened a make-shift assembly in one of Mar-a-Lago’s suites. He hosted advisers and Congress members to discuss a strike to take out the commander of Iran’s security and intelligence services.\n\nIn the meeting, intelligence showed multiple threats to Americans from Iran, leading to Trump deciding to authorize the strike. According to officials, a serious debate within the Trump administration occurred during the meeting.\n\n“We took action last night to stop a war,” Trump said following the strike.\n\nTrump was updated by aides in the following days with Iran updates.\n\nPossible Iran attack on Israel\n\nBiden returned to the White House a day early from his Rehoboth Beach house on April 13, 2024, to meet with top advisers in the Situation Room.\n\nBiden previously said he was “devoted to the defense of Israel” and would “support Israel,” and after Biden heard an attack from Iran could happen sooner rather than later, he met with his staff.\n\nIn the meeting, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, among others, discussed how to move forward.\n\nThis led to a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Israel’s security.\n\nGaza ceasefire and hostage release deal\n\nOn Sept. 2, 2024, Biden and Harris met in the Situation Room with the U.S. hostage deal negotiation team to discuss the murders of hostages held captive by Hamas.\n\nIn the meeting, Biden and Harris received a status update from the negotiation team for a proposal outlined by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt. The group also discussed the next steps for successfully releasing the hostages.\n\nWhile no information has been explicitly shared yet on how Trump is going to move forward with the current Israel-Iran crisis, Trump has posted on Truth Social, calling for Iran to have an “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.”\n\n“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump wrote. “He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”\n\nThe Situation Room meeting started at 1 p.m. on Tuesday.","summary":"On Monday night, President Donald Trump reportedly directed his national security staff to convene in the Situation Room to discuss the Israel-Iran conflict.

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to emotionally describe the moments that led to him being forcefully removed from a news conference last week focused on the Trump administration's response to the immigration protests in Los Angeles. \n\nPadilla was in the same Los Angeles federal building last Thursday where Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was outlining President Trump's decision to send in National Guard troops and U.S. Marines in response to the protests. Padilla said that a meeting he had scheduled with a separate official down the hall was delayed by the Noem event, so he decided to attend. \n\nPadilla said he asked to attend and was escorted into the press conference by FBI and National Guard officials. As he tried to question Noem, another set of officials grabbed him and removed him from the room. \n\n\"You've seen the video. I was pushed and pulled, struggled to maintain my balance. I was forced to the ground. First on my knees and then flat on my chest, and was handcuffed and marched down a hallway repeatedly asking, 'Why am I being detained?'\" Padilla recalled. \"Not once did they tell me why. I pray you never have a moment like this.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security initially accused Padilla of \"disrespectful political theatre,\" charging that he did not comply with requests to back away. Secretary Noem said she and Padilla eventually spoke after the scuffle. \n\nIn his remarks Tuesday — his first on the Senate floor since the incident — Padilla said his detainment marked a turning point in what he described as the Trump administration's \"undemocratic crackdown\" on protest. \n\n\"At one point,\" Padilla said, \"the United States Secretary of Homeland Security said that the purpose of federal law enforcement and the purpose of the United States military was to, quote, liberate Los Angeles from our governor and our mayor. To somehow liberate us from the very people that we democratically elected to lead our city and our state.\" \n\nPadilla called the remark an \"un-American mission statement.\" \n\nHe railed against President Trump's efforts to focus raids on regions led by Democratic officials, and urged his colleagues to fight back. \n\nHe took to the Senate floor surrounded by his Democratic colleagues. Several Senate Republicans, including Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and North Carolina's Thom Tillis were also in attendance. \n\nPadilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, is an MIT engineering graduate who entered politics after marching with his parents for immigration rights. He was appointed to his seat in 2021 to fill the vacancy created after Kamala Harris became vice president and won election the following year. He is the first Latino to represent California in the Senate. \n\nOver the course of his roughly 20-minute address, Padilla said his experience should \"shock the conscience of our country.\" And he warned that if President Trump \"can deploy the Marines to Los Angeles without justification, he can deploy them to your state too.\" \n\n\"No one will redeem America but Americans. No one is coming to save us but us,\" Padilla said. \"And we know that the cameras are not on in every corner of the country. But if this administration is this afraid of just one senator with a question, colleagues, imagine what the voices of tens of millions of Americans peacefully protesting can do.\"","summary":"The California Democrat returned to the Senate floor Tuesday to warn that the Trump administrations response to immigration protests in Los Angeles should \"shock the conscience of our country.\"","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/17/g-s1-73157/alex-padilla-kristi-noem-los-angeles-immigration-protests-press-conference","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3821x2149+0+199/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe5%2Fe1%2Fe3f019fb47f98fb6c8d1b6992e6e%2Fgettyimages-2220601341.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 20:05:30","author":"Claudia Grisales","authors":["Claudia Grisales"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":332485938,"title":"Trump says he won't call Walz about lawmaker shootings","text":"President Trump said Tuesday that he won't call Minnesota Gov.

Domingo returned first in an episode hosted by Charli XCX and then again during SNL50, the supersized, star-studded anniversary special. By the end of the season, “Domingo: Bridesmaid Speech” was officially the season’s most watched sketch on social media, earning 171 million total views, according to NBC.\nBut before it took the world by storm, “Domingo” nearly fell apart. “We almost gave up on it,” says SNL writer Jimmy Fowlie. “We’re like, Is this cursed?” Below, SNL performers, crew members, veterans, and stars like Pedro Pascal and Molly Shannon go deep on “Domingo.”\n“Domingo” was the brainchild of writers Jimmy Fowlie and Ceara O’Sullivan, who enlisted former writing supervisor Sudi Green and newly hired writer Allie Levitan to help shape the sketch.\nJimmy Fowlie (writer): I saw this thing floating around on Instagram—a maid of honor speech where she sang Hamilton. God bless her, it really was so genuine. There was something about the pained look on the bride and the groom's face that I was like, Oh, this is so good.\nCeara O’Sullivan (writer): Jimmy showed Ariana Grande the video of this maid of honor singing poorly. Ariana immediately understood: “I need to sing off-key. That’s what this demands of me.”\nSudi Green (writer): I worked at the show for six years, and then I left. Then I came back and helped write Kamala [Harris] when Maya [Rudolph] came back. Jimmy and Ceara were writing these pop-culture sketches that I felt like were kind of my wheelhouse when I was there.\nAllie Levitan (writer): This was my third show. I was so fully still disassociated, and Ceara, Jimmy, and Sudi picked me up like fairy godparents.\nGreen: It was Allie’s first sketch, and it ended up being this massive thing.\nFowlie: At one point, I was like, “Allie, just so you know, this isn’t totally common.”\nOnce the writing team was set, the foursome got to work on designing the Kel Squad, the singing bridesmaids played by Grande and SNL cast members Sarah Sherman, Heidi Gardner, and Ego Nwodim, with Chloe Fineman playing bride Kelsey.\nO’Sullivan: I feel like Sudi brought up the idea they’re regaling on the bachelorette trip.\nFowlie: That was the key. Sudi knew to make it really an ensemble.\nEgo Nwodim (actor): It was nice to see all the women in a sketch together.\nSarah Sherman (actor): Me and Heidi and Ego are always really excited for how many rehearsals we have to do, because we never get to sing and dance. It’s kind of like we get to go girl mode, in a fun way.\nChloe Fineman (actor): I would consider myself probably one of the worst singers in the cast. Initially, I was like, Oh, I’m probably the bride because I cannot sing. Then we went to block it. I was like, Oh, actually, not at all. Maybe I just give bride.\nAnd then, of course, there was Domingo.\nMarcello Hernández (Domingo): It was just before the table reading. [Jimmy and Ceara] told me they had a fun thing at the end of a sketch for me to do. It was a Latino guy, and that’s all I knew.\nGreen: Ceara, you said “Domingo,” right?\nO’Sullivan: I feel like I’m getting credit for something that was truly just me being like, “Should we do ‘Espresso’ rhymed with ‘Domingo’?” And then for some reason we never questioned it. We just unanimously decided that’s what it would be.\nFowlie: I found out recently that Marcello said, “Does the name have to be Domingo? Can’t it just be James or something?”\nHernández: Domingo is my uncle’s name. One of my dad’s best friends is named Domingo. I don’t know if I didn’t like the name. He had this gold chain that I thought was a bit much. But ultimately, it’s fun. He’s a doctor and he takes care of animals, so you can’t be upset about how Latinos are represented there.\nOnce the characters were assembled, the writing commenced.\nGreen: We started writing it really early, and then everybody went off into their other rooms to write separate things. And I remember seeing Jimmy and Ceara in the hall and being like, “How’s ‘Domingo’?” “I wrote the first three pages. Should I email it to you?” It was very much being tossed around.\nFowlie: It was very fragmented. We almost gave up on it because we were so busy. There was really nothing to distinguish this sketch.\nO’Sullivan: Nothing topical about it.\nGreen: It was 2 a.m. Jimmy came up to me in the hallway, and he’s like, “Should we bail?” I’m literally about to go home, and I was like, “What if we just do the song right now, and we can add the jokes and the dialogue in the morning?” And I think I said to you, “Hard boundary—I’m leaving at 3 a.m.”\nO’Sullivan: I would say 90% of it was written between 2 and 3:30 a.m., to respect Sudi’s hard boundary.\nFowlie: We were like, Okay, let’s just submit it in the morning because everything’s due at 11:00 or noon. We were going to submit it, and Sudi’s like, “Let’s actually just look through this one more time.” Because Sudi said, “I have a good feeling that this could go well.”\nGreen: I felt like my other sketches that I had written weren’t that good, and so I was starting to bank on this one. I was like, I think it’s my only winner this week.\nAfter they put their finishing touches on the sketch, “Domingo” was read aloud at Wednesday’s table read—a make-or-break moment when 30-plus sketches are presented to SNL creator Lorne Michaels before he decides which ones ultimately make it into the show.\nGreen: It did not go well at the table. The music was too quiet in the beginning, so they didn’t hear the way that they were supposed to be counted in. The first time they revealed what’s happening…nobody heard it. It got no laughs.\nO’Sullivan: Our lovely SNL girlies, in the best way, are your perfect bridesmaids-type singers. But we were like, Oh, the beat is really far away. So Sudi and I were on our microphones in the writer section, embarrassingly mumbling the words to try to get us back on track.\nGreen: I think Ariana fought for the sketch. It was not one of the ringers of the table at all.\nSomehow, “Domingo” persisted. Now it was time to put all the practical pieces together: sets, costumes, and hair and makeup.\nKeith Raywood (production designer): We have two days, basically. If it’s drawn Wednesday night, it’s built on Thursday. Friday and Saturday is basically paint and wallpaper, and then we’re doing the show. It’s that quick.\nJodi Mancuso (hair department head): Jimmy and Ceara love wigs.\nO’Sullivan: I found this picture in my camera roll. I showed Jodi and said, “Can this be Domingo’s hair?”\nMancuso: It’s Marcello, so he’s already adorable. You can’t really see it, but the wig has blondish, reddish highlights in it. I thought that would be hilarious.\nTom Broecker (costume designer): It was a pretty clear directive—wedding, autumnal, pumpkin, fall, velvet. We found a really amazing bridesmaids place here in New York City and went there. Of course they had pumpkin-colored velvet bridesmaids dresses.\nRaywood: The set was meant to be a kind of corporate hotel ballroom—not the Waldorf Astoria, but more like a nice Marriott or Hilton type of hotel.\nLouie Zakarian (makeup department head): When every host comes in, I do a digital scan of their faces on Tuesday, and then I print their heads up. We have a bunch of 3D printers in the lab. So I’ll print their heads if we need any kind of prosthetics, bald, or facial hair.\nThen came the run-through on Saturday.\nFowlie: It went really well, right? There was a thought: Oh no, they’re singing too bad. It’s going to piss Lorne off. We need to do a last-minute rehearsal.\nSherman: Everybody’s like, “Oh my God, it was so funny when you guys were bad singing.” And I was like, “Oh, I didn’t notice I was bad singing, really.” That is kind of us legit trying to sing.\nFowlie: Sometimes SNL disease is when you actually start trying to make everything better, but then you make things worse. Luckily, we didn’t. We left them alone.\nO’Sullivan: Between table, run-through, dress, and air, Ari never sang it the same way twice. She always missed the notes in a slightly different unexpected way. We would have conversations like, “Is it too bad? Is it too good?” For the most part, we just let her rock out.\nLiz Patrick (director): I thought it was the funniest thing to see somebody like Ariana Grande singing poorly. She has one of the most incredible voices I’ve ever heard in my life.\nEli Brueggemann (music director): She’s one of the best singers in the universe. She knows how to manipulate her voice for comedic value because she’s been doing it since she was a kid on TV. If that means singing good, then that means singing good, like she did in the monologue.\nGreen: Kenan [Thompson] was trying to look out for us because he liked the sketch. He knows that Lorne doesn’t like bad singing, and he thought the sketch was really funny. He was like, “Okay, my Lorne Spidey senses are kind of tingling.” So I was the lead of the panic. I gather everybody, and I’m like, “During meal break, do we text all the girls—not Ariana—and do this quick music rehearsal?”\nBut they didn’t have time to focus on the music, as there were other problems at hand.\nGreen: The reason why we didn’t was because Jimmy had been very—I’m going to say on it—on the choreo. And we were kind of annoyed by that [laughs].\nFowlie: What I don’t have in singing skills, I was trying to make up for in the dance rehearsal. We were running these dance rehearsals ad nauseam, to the point that Ego was like, “Please leave me alone.”\nNwodim: I wouldn’t use that language. He’s probably wielded that language against himself. I’m happy to run things over and over again, especially choreo. I think there was one last time before the show started, and was it like, “Do you guys want to run it again?” And we were like, “We got it at this point. So no.”\nGardner: Jimmy definitely had ideas for choreography in all the different iterations.\nO’Sullivan: I put my foot down, I was like, “No rehearsal. They’re having fun. It’s going good. No music rehearsal. Leave the girls.”\nUnderrehearsed musically and overrehearsed choreographically, Grande and the Kel Squad were ready for showtime. The sketch aired directly after Grande’s opening monologue, a premium placement on the show.\nGreen: It moved up in the rundown. That’s always exciting.\nFowlie: It went well, but it wasn’t like, Oh my God, I can’t believe I’m watching this. It was just like, Oh, this is a fun sketch, and then you moved on.\nGreen: I remember walking off the stage and feeling it kind of came down from dress. The laughs weren’t as loud.\nIt wasn’t until the next day that the cast and crew realized “Domingo” was not your typical SNL sketch.\nGreen: It took me a while, because I’m not on TikTok, to realize afterwards that it truly was going viral on TikTok.\nFowlie: It wasn’t until that night at the after-party. People were like, “Oh my God, have you seen the numbers for the sketch?” I kind of think that’s gross, when people are like, “This sketch is going viral.” It’s embarrassing—it’s like, I guess this matters, but all the other sketches don’t matter? But then it kept going and going.\nSherman: You never know what’s going to be the one that’s randomly going to be viral with every teenager in the United States of America. Actually, the world.\nHernández: Dude, I had no idea. My sister told me that it’s everywhere.\nSabrina Carpenter liked the sketch so much that she invited Domingo to attend one of her concerts in Los Angeles the following month.\nO’Sullivan: She immediately shared the Domingo sketch, giving her approval.\nLevitan: Marcello flew us all out and put us all up, which was so sweet. We were running around with him as Domingo backstage, getting him ready, talking through. It was so cool.\nHernández: Her team reached out to my manager, and I remember going up to the writers and being like, “Can you believe this? We have to go, you guys.” I thought I would feel weird there by myself.\nO’Sullivan: We’re watching on the floor of the Forum: 50,000 people singing our version of Sabrina’s song. Backstage, Sabrina was so cute. She was like, “People don’t even care about my version anymore. They’re only singing your lyrics to me.” I look out at the crowd and I’m seeing posters that say, “The bridesmaids wanted a celebration.” And she literally goes, “Fuck my drag. I’m just going to do y’all’s version now.”\nFowlie: I said this to Ceara and Allie: “We are literally peaking right now.” It’s all downhill after this.\nHernández: Then we had to fly back right away. It felt like, Oh, this is a true Hollywood moment.\nAfter Domingo lay dormant for several weeks, the writers brought him back for the November 16 episode; this time, the Kel Squad was celebrating Kelsey’s babymoon with a song set to Chappell Roan’s “Hot to Go.” But who was the genius who discovered that “H-O-T-T-O-G-O” scanned perfectly with “D-O-M-I-N-G-O”?\nGreen: It was Ceara. But what was the other Chappell song that we were talking about doing?\nO’Sullivan: We talked about doing [sung to the tune of “Pink Pony Club”] “Her babymoon/ We all went together on her babymoon.” And then we were like, It’s not nearly as good as D-O-M-I-N-G-O.\nGreen: It’s crazy how much we talked about “Pink Pony Club.” We wanted to do it because it’s slower. We really almost did it.\nFowlie: I was the one who spelled it out. I was like, “Oh my God, you guys.” And I spelled it out and I spelled the name wrong. Ceara just looked at me and she rolled her eyes like, Do you mean D-O-M-I-N-G-O?\nGreen: The second one is always the hardest because you’re trying to recreate magic. The show puts more pressure on a second iteration of the sketch, because SNL doesn’t do as many reoccurs as they used to. In the age of the internet, you can go rewatch a sketch whenever you want to. Seeing it again in a different iteration sometimes isn’t as satisfying.\nO’Sullivan: The hardest part of the second one was, oddly, the D-O-M-I-N-G-O. It was really hard and really fast.\nAnd then there was SNL50. The anniversary special got a supersized helping of “Domingo,” featuring SNL vets Martin Short, Molly Shannon, Beck Bennett, Kyle Mooney, and Bowen Yang, as well as stars such as Bad Bunny, Pedro Pascal, and Sabrina Carpenter herself.\nO’Sullivan: The 50th was so much fun. So much pressure. There was this big bulletin board in the office with all the names of all the celebrities that are coming, and you’re basically playing celebrity Tetris, figuring out who’s going to go where. After we’d already written the first draft, Lorne was like, “And of course you’ll add Bad Bunny.” And we were like, “And of course we will.”\nFowlie: We wanted Ariana to be in it as well, but she couldn’t make it because she had the BAFTAs or something.\nBeck Bennett (actor): It was my first time going back into the building since I left four years ago, and it was so nice to be back rehearsing with old friends. We’re all just catching up and laughing so much, it was hard to even rehearse.\nO’Sullivan: When we found out in December that it was going to be in the 50th, we were kind of hoping and praying that there would be an “Espresso”-type song of the winter—a big hit—and that’s what we would hitch the 50th wagon to. It didn’t feel like there was that song, but it felt like the movie of the year was Wicked. And “Defying Gravity,” especially Cynthia Erivo’s performance, was kind of the song of the winter.\nFowlie: In some ways it felt easier too, because we’re so used to writing a show in one week. Now we had a month—which, of course, doesn’t seem like a lot of time to a normal person. But for an SNL writer, you’re like, That’s four times the amount that I normally have.\nO’Sullivan: One other difference between the 50th and a normal week is that there’s no dress rehearsal. The first time that a live audience saw the sketch was on air at the 50th, so that was uniquely terrifying.\nGreen: Marty and Molly were getting so many laughs on the floor from the crew. They were killing it. After rehearsal, Martin Short came up to me and he said, “Well, of course Molly and I will turn it up for air.” And they did. I didn’t know they could turn it up, but they did.\nMolly Shannon (actor): I just really wanted to make the most of my scene. My dad always gave me advice: “Molly, small parts in movies.” That was his deathbed advice. “A good small part is good. Never underestimate the riches in a good small part.”\nPedro Pascal (actor): [It felt like] theater camp. With megastars, comedic assassins, and a hangover.\nBennett: I got a laugh on my one line, which I’m still high on now.\nPascal: I was the first record scratch of the night, which mortified me. My nerves provided me with a cognitive breakdown, and I fucked up my cue, I think, three times in a row? I didn’t even know Sabrina was bouncing up against me. Then there was the relief of being swallowed into the huge ensemble, though I did get nervous Marcello would scold me later. He didn’t.\nBrueggemann: It’s amazing to see your heroes have a little slip of humor. It was perfect. I mean, Jack Nicholson was just to the left of the camera lens. It’s a crazy room to be playing a fool in.\nHernández: To do it with Pedro and Bad Bunny—Benito—who are two people that have altered my life in many ways, it just felt like another blessing and we got to do it again.\nSo will there be more Domingo appearances in the future? Who’s to say…\nShannon: It’s like a magic sketch. A lot of people come up, they’re like, “I’m so jealous you’ve got to dance with Bad Bunny.” Isn’t that funny? I get it every single day.\nSherman: They wrote another “Domingo” for the finale that ended up getting cut twice, which was really dramatic.\nHernández: That’s above my pay grade, but, dude, when Jimmy and Ceara get to cooking, they’re competitive. That stuff happens at the show, where things change.\nSherman: It was in, then it was out, then it was in, and it was out. That’s the thing about SNL—it’s like you legit never know what’s in the show while the show’s happening. “Domingo” is not exempt from that.\nHernández: People like to call me Domingo on the street sometimes. My name is Marcello, but I do find a way to just be a grateful young Latino boy.","summary":"Marcello Hernández, Pedro Pascal, Molly Shannon, and more reveal the origin story behind Saturday Night Live’s irresistible viral sensation.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/domingo-saturday-night-live-oral-history","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/685079b99bd9c627389d702e/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/snl-domingo-oral-history-site-story-image.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 18:38:02","author":"Chris Murphy","authors":["Chris Murphy"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":332485490,"title":"Candidates face sprint to nomination in special election for Connolly’s seat","text":"Candidates in the Virginia special election to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Gerald E. Connolly are facing a sprint, especially compared with their counterparts looking to fill other open House seats this year.\n\nWhile those running for a vacant seat in Arizona will have had months to campaign before their July primary, the Democrats who’ve announced bids to complete Connolly’s term have less than a month to officially campaign for their party’s nomination for Virginia’s 11th District ahead of a September special election.\n\nThey include James Walkinshaw, Connolly’s former chief of staff and now a member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors; state Sen. Stella Pekarsky; state Del. Irene Shin; Fairfax County Planning Commissioner Candice Bennett; attorney Amy Roma; former Democratic National Committee member and onetime Venezuelan legislator Leo Martínez; health care entrepreneur Dan Lee; Navy veteran Josh Aisen; and former CIA operations officer Amy Papanu.\n\nThe nominee will be chosen in a so-called party-run firehouse primary on June 28, for which three days of early voting begins next Tuesday. Republicans will pick their candidate in a canvass of their own on the same day, but the Democratic nominee will be strongly favored in the Sept. 9 general election for the Northern Virginia district with a sizable population of federal workers. Kamala Harris carried the seat by 34 points last year, according to calculations by The Downballot. \n\nStephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, said the primary electorate will likely be small, but highly motivated. \n\n“We’re talking about the most intense partisans participating,” he said. “The road to success may very well be who can demonstrate the greatest dislike and the most aggressive challenges to President Trump.”\n\nThe primary also comes a little over a week after Virginia voters pick their nominees for state legislative and executive positions ahead of the commonwealth’s November elections. Virginia is one of two states, along with New Jersey, that hold statewide elections in the year after a presidential contest. \n\nPrimary landscape\n\nThe quick nature of the campaign gives an advantage to candidates who already have a base of support within the district, likely boosting those who have previously run for office and already have a campaign infrastructure. \n\n“Obviously it’s a very fast election, which makes it very difficult for people who don’t already have some kind of base, some kind of name ID and ability to raise money to get their message out there and knock on doors and talk to voters,” Pekarsky said in a Tuesday interview. \n\nPekarsky, who won election to the state Senate in 2023 after serving on the Fairfax County Public Schools board, said she got into the special election in response to frustrations with the Trump administration. \n\nShe also said it was important for Northern Virginia to have a woman representing the area in Congress, which it no longer does after Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton did not seek reelection last year. \n\nPekarsky, who has support from Democratic leaders in the state Senate, said she thought the primary would come down to “who got their message and who was able to get their people out on short notice.”\n\nWalkinshaw, meanwhile, is considered the front-runner and is highlighting his decade of experience as Connolly’s top aide, as well as the endorsement the congressman gave him before he died last month just weeks after announcing that his esophageal cancer had returned. Walkinshaw also boasts the support of Wexton and Rep. Donald S. Beyer Jr. and said in an interview that his record was “resonating very powerfully with Democratic voters” across the district.\n\n“People want to see Democrats standing up and speaking out and fighting back against the Trump administration,” he said, adding that district voters were “highly knowledgeable” about Congress and Washington. “It’s not just about fighting. It’s about ‘Do you have the experience and the knowledge to know how to be strategic and effective in fighting the Trump administration?’”\n\nA poll released last week by a super PAC supporting Walkinshaw found him leading with 41 percent of the Democratic vote, while Pekarsky had 8 percent and Shin 6 percent. Thirty-six percent of voters were undecided.\n\nRoma, whose legal career has focused on energy policy, says in an ad airing on local cable and streaming services that her background will help her be an effective counter to the Trump administration’s agenda. \n\n“Donald Trump is dismantling the government piece by piece,” she says in a television spot. “I’ve spent my career using the law to make things happen in Washington. I know Congress, I know our federal agencies and I know our systems inside and out. And I know how to use all those levers of power to stop Trump’s agenda.”\n\nShin has the backing of Leaders We Deserve, the political action committee run by gun control activist David Hogg, who left his position as a DNC vice chair last week. New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim has also endorsed Shin’s campaign, giving her a boost from a candidate who took on his state’s political establishment last year and won. \n\nIn a June 10 update on her campaign website, likely aimed at supportive outside groups, Shin’s operation said that voters in Burke and Centreville “need to see ads on non-broadcast TV (streaming and YouTube) and on prestige news outlets ads that show that Irene Shin is an effective progressive who has taken on establishment ‘business as usual’ politicians and won – and she will do the same in Congress.”\n\nThe update also urged allies to help ensure Asian American voters, who make up about 20 percent of the district, know that Shin is the daughter of Korean immigrants.\n\nMartínez has the backing of the Latino Victory Fund, a group he helped found. \n\nSome of the candidates have benefited from outside spending, according to Federal Election Commission filings as of close of business Tuesday. \n\nFight for Virginia’s Future has spent $351,000 supporting Walkinshaw through advertisements, calls and mailings. Another group called People Over Monopolies has spent $56,000 on digital ads and mailers supporting Shin. And SD PAC spent $113,000 on direct mail and TV advertisements to support Pekarsky.\n\nFocus on federal workers\n\nThe Fairfax County-based 11th District has one of the highest percentages of federal workers, and Connolly was known as an advocate for federal workers throughout his time in the House. \n\nWith thousands of federal jobs lost since January under the Trump administration, it’s an issue that’s resonating in the special election.\n\nThe National Federation of Federal Employees has endorsed Walkinshaw, who pointed to his work alongside Connolly to support federal workers. \n\n“There aren’t a lot of champions, vocal champions, for federal employees in Congress, and my commitment is, I hope, to have a long career in Congress and to be a long-term champion for federal workers, just as Gerry Connolly was,” he said. \n\nPekarksy, who has the endorsement of the Fairfax County Federation of Teachers, said nearly everyone in the district had either been touched directly or knew someone who was affected by federal layoffs this year. \n\n“It is on everyone’s mind,” she said. “A lot of what I hear when I talk with people, the fear is real and people want to know how are you going to stand up? Will you be a strong voice?”","summary":"Candidates in the Virginia special election to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Gerald E.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could have chosen to condemn the violent riots, full-throatedly and with no equivocations. Instead, they claimed that Trump, and not the rioters trying to kill ICE agents, was escalating the situation. Newsom sued, arguing that the commander in chief does not, in fact, have the power to federalize the National Guard to maintain order against the violent thugs preventing federal agents from doing their jobs. All the while, rioters began throwing rocks and concrete through the windshields of cars belonging to Los Angeles Police Department officers and the California Highway Patrol.\n\nIt took days for Bass to offer unequivocal denunciations of the rioters that did not include her blaming Trump for the rioting, saying, “We will not allow violence, vandalism, or other dangerous behavior today,” and “Violent actors will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Newsom couldn’t even manage that, saying that California would hold accountable the “violent criminals who take advantage of Trump’s chaos.” For days and even still, Bass and Newsom deprive the rioters of their agency, acting as if the violence was a natural consequence of the Trump administration trying to detain violent illegal immigrants.\n\nNow, put aside the “Trump made them do it” defense of the rioters. Ask yourself this: Do you really think that Los Angeles and California, bastions of criminal justice reform fighting against “mass incarceration,” are truly keen to hold left-wing rioters accountable? Newsom’s legislature is, at this moment, seeking to make it so that murder is no longer an automatic life-without-parole crime under the logic that 25-year-old murderers are too young to be locked up for life.\n\nIn fact, we know that it is likely that most of the rioters arrested by state and local authorities will get nothing more than a slap on the wrist, because that is how Democrats have operated with every group of rioting thugs or law-breaking protesters. When Black Lives Matter riots broke out in Minneapolis and other cities in 2020, Democratic politicians and activists called for police departments to be defunded. Then-Sen. Kamala Harris, who went on to become the leader of the Democratic Party in 2024, supported the bail fund that sought donations to help get rioters right out of jail and back to the streets, where they would be free to riot even more (don’t even get started on the murderers that the same bail fund also helped get released).\n\nIt did not stop at the bail fund, though. By November, more than 90% of the rioters who were charged in Minneapolis had their charges dropped. Portland dropped charges against 82% of rioters. More than 5,000 summonses written by police in New York City were dismissed by a summons court. Detroit, Philadelphia, Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles all dismissed a vast majority of the charges that were pursued by police.\n\nPortland was particularly galling, as the city’s progressive leaders even doled out massive settlement payments to rioters. Portland handed out some $3 million to loser antifa activists complaining about the police, including a “nonbinary” activist who was given $375,000 for “emotional distress” from nonlethal crowd control methods.\n\nDemocratic politicians and activists defended violent rioters during the Black Lives Matter summer, ignored the looting and arson that came with those riots, helped get arrested rioters bailed out of jail, and then had the charges against most of them dropped. It echoes how California Democrats have defended Los Angeles rioters and ignored their violence. Newsom has ensured that California does all it can to keep criminals out of jail. All that is left is dropping whatever charges for the people he and Bass claim they will hold “accountable.”\n\nThe Black Lives Matter riots were not a one-off. After Palestinian terrorists slaughtered 1,200 Israeli civilians and took several hostages, “pro-Palestinian” terrorist sympathizers took to college campuses to protest against Israel’s existence. Those protests led to illegal encampments on campuses, “pro-Palestinian” activists blocking Jewish students from crossing campus, and mobs of terrorist sympathizers taking over buildings.\n\nIn one such case, a mob of antisemites stormed a building at Columbia University. Police showed up and arrested the lawbreakers, 45 in total. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg then dropped the trespassing charges against 30 of the activists and would have dropped charges against 14 more if they hadn’t rejected a deal. Bragg’s office cited a “lack of evidence” to prove trespassing against the group, who were arrested by police inside the building where they were trespassing.\n\nThe attorneys general in Washington, D.C., and Michigan have similarly dropped charges against criminal pro-Palestinian “protesters,” while many universities rolled back their suspensions and other disciplinary actions against student protesters. The message was clear: Hateful, antisemitic protests that break both university policy and the law were allowed, and neither the universities nor the Democratic “prosecutors” who have jurisdiction over them would hold left-wing protesters accountable.\n\nThrough all of this, Democrats constantly claim that the political Right is the only home to political violence and discord. They have normalized their left-wing rioters to the point that boarding up businesses during “protests” becomes a regular occurrence in Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles. The rot rises up to the top of the party, from former presidential candidate Harris to future presidential candidate Newsom.\n\nYou can expect the same thing to play out in Los Angeles, as it has time and time again through the Black Lives Matter riots and antisemitic college demonstrations. Whatever lawbreakers are arrested and charged by Los Angeles and California law enforcement will have their charges dropped en masse, and what few are actually prosecuted for their crimes will likely be let off with no jail time. Community service and diversionary programs for violent criminals; that is the story of the California criminal “justice” system.\n\nWhen these riots are put in the rearview mirror, the left-wing professional protester base will simply wait for the next excuse to take to the streets. Democratic politicians will continue to rile them up with talk about how Republicans are cruel dictators and how we must “fight” against them at every opportunity. When those next riots turn violent, those Democratic politicians will then argue there is no violence, like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), or that the rioters are just a little too caught up in the emotion of the moment, like Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), or that the violent, rioting left-wingers are Trump’s fault, like Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe playbook is the same as it has been for the past five years. Democrats coddle and enable the unruly activists who make up their base, no matter how many businesses are destroyed or law enforcement officers are assaulted.","summary":"Democratic politicians have spent the years since 2020 coddling their rioter base, through both rhetorical defenses and deflections, and creating a permissive legal environment that allows rioters to avoid the consequences of their actions.

This commitment to overcome crime and homelessness comes as Los Angeles still reels from the explosive response to Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nThe former Fox News star will aim to dramatically increase prison capacity in the Golden State as part of his plan to tackle the disasters he said have ramped up over the last 15 years of Democrat rule.\n\nHe blamed Governor Gavin Newsom for the issues as well as former Vice President Kamala Harris - who served as Attorney General from 2011 to 2017, and is a rumored candidate for governor.\n\n'She's the main cause of the problem,' Hilton declared during the interview on board the USS Iowa, a decommissioned battleship-turned-floating museum, adding his 'more prisons, less crime' agenda will make communities safer. \n\nHis plan involves reopening prisons Newsom permanently shuttered, rather than relying on crowded and under-equipped local jails for housing overflow inmates.\n\n'It is a massive issue,' said the 55-year-old British-born 'proud American' who moved to the US after a career in UK politics.\n\nHilton's Westminster experience included a stint as Director of Strategy for Prime Minister David Cameron from 2010 to 2012 when he rebranded the Conservatives with modern messaging before resigning in 2012.\n\nHe claimed Newsom's prison closures led to 'dangerous criminals' being released early or 'transferred to the county jails without the resources or facilities to properly hold, let alone rehabilitate them, which in turn has resulted in lower-level criminals not serving time at all.'\n\nHe claims, 'California's streets are less safe' because of it.\n\nNewsom closed four state prisons during his tenure, and California's prison population has dropped 32% - from 135,600 in 2014 to 92,582 in 2024.\n\nHilton claims this move 'hits working-class communities the hardest' as 'violent and repeat offenders are cycling through the system' and 'those who want a second chance are too often denied access to rehabilitation that works.\n\n'The quality of life for ordinary Californians is deteriorating as they're left to deal with the fallout...' which he suggests includes 'people on the streets... with drug and mental health problems.'\n\nThe father-of-two pledged to 'take these people off the streets and clean up this terrible combination of crime and homelessness.'\n\nHis latest plan has the backing of Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig, an outspoken architect of last year's Prop. 36, which targeted retail theft and drug offenses and was designed to overcome 2014's Prop. 47, which reduced penalties for theft of an amount totaling less than $950.\n\nHilton claimed there is a 'war on business' in California while addressing members of the California Business and Industrial Alliance on the decommissioned ship.\n\nAnd during his subsequent interview with with the Daily Mail, he branded Harris 'a complete joke' and 'machine politician' who 'doesn't believe in anything.\n\n'She has no strong convictions other than that she should be entitled to these jobs because of her identity, not her ability.'\n\n'It's an insult to every Californian, the idea that she should get to be governor as a consolation prize for losing to Donald Trump,' he added.\n\nHilton, who moved to California with his family in 2012 and became a citizen in 2021, condemned the 'vandalism, hooliganism, looting, vile graffiti and destroyed businesses' that resulted from recent downtown LA riots.\n\nHe 'completely support[s]' Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard, and said local law enforcement 'totally failed to do their job at every level' when ICE asked for help. He blamed the protests on Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Newsom.\n\nHe said it is 'totally right' for immigrants to go through 'official procedures' in order to become a citizen.\n\n'It's not true to say that you're an American if you're not a citizen - that's legally false,' he continued. 'I'm a proud American, but I didn't say that before 2021 when I became a citizen.'\n\nHilton - who lives in the Bay Area with his wife, their two sons and pet chickens - called California the country's 'most significant state'.\n\nBut, he says, its economy 'hides a lot of problems' - specifically, soaring poverty and unemployment rates.\n\nHe highlighted the dichotomy of 'extreme wealth and economic success, along with really serious poverty and deprivation.'\n\nHilton called California the 'worst-run state' and blamed the mostly Democrat representatives for the 'total disaster'.\n\nThe outcome 'is a terrible combination of ideological extremism and utter incompetence.'\n\nHilton called Newsom 'weak', adding 'His fundamental problem is that he is controlled by leftist activists who give him their marching orders,' Hilton claimed.\n\n Hilton argued the 'fundamental problem' for California is the 'massive explosion of government bloat and nanny state bureaucracy, especially with small businesses.'\n\nHis number one task as governor would be to strip away the 'endless red tape, taxes and bulls**t from the government'.\n\nHilton says his UK career gave him 'insight into the workings of government' and 'showed me how bureaucracy fights to keep its power and what their tricks are.'\n\nHe said he learned 'how strongly you have to fight them in order to make any difference.'\n\nHilton is 'incredibly proud' of the state's business successes, but plans to turbocharge investment to attract companies with large workforces.\n\n'You've got some incredibly successful businesses that generate huge amounts of revenue, but don't employ very many people and therefore the general standard of living doesn't increase.\n\nHe stressed he is 'massively pro-business, pro-enterprise and pro-job creation across the board.'\n\nHe noted that Nvidia, the massive AI chip manufacturer, is pumping $500 billion worth of capital investment into America over the next few years with new production plants - but nothing has been announced for California.\n\nHilton blames the the state's bureaucracy, regulations and taxes for stifling new manufacturing plants.\n\nHe praised Trump for the 'direction he wants to take the country.' He says California needs the same approach and plans to scrap state income tax on the first $100,000 earned to 'get money in people's pockets quickly.'\n\nOther issues on his to-do list include the housing crisis, education and reducing the price of gasoline.\n\nHe called the latter a 'simple way to make life easier for working class people.'\n\nLike Trump, Hilton is fiercely against transgender women competing in women's sports - an issue that's remained a focal point as California high school student AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old trans girl, won gold medals in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) state finals.\n\nHilton says he is a 'big supporter' of the Save Girls' Sports movement and wore a pink bracelet to highlight the issue.\n\nHe called it 'terrible' that California's 2013 Assembly Bill 1266 (the School Success and Opportunity Act), allows trans girls to compete in girls' sports and 'also be in girls' locker rooms'. He said he will 'strive to undo the law.'\n\nMeanwhile, Hilton claims 'the tide is turning' in California and that voters are ready for a Republican governor - a powerful shift, he said, that led to 10 out of 58 counties flipping to red in November's presidential election.\n\n'People have had enough,' he said. 'We can't take it anymore. it doesn't have to be like this...\n\n'I can win. And when I do win, I can make a big difference.","summary":"The TV star will aim to upend the policies under Gavin Newsom that have left the state in crisis mode.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14810943/The-TV-star-Gavin-Newsom-quaking-boots-shocking-plans-thatll-leave-Liberals-meltdown.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/16/03/99403901-0-image-m-27_1750042598212.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/21/8057342064684088865/1024x576_MP4_8057342064684088865.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-17 17:39:08","author":"David Thompson,Editor","authors":["David Thompson","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":332407708,"title":"What is Juneteenth in the US and how is it celebrated?","text":"It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed — after the Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nThe resulting Juneteenth holiday — its name combining “June” and “nineteenth” — has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries. In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday — expanding its recognition beyond Black America.\n\nThis year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.\n\nStill, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.\n\n“I don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. “I've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.”\n\nPeople who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a “right” way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIt depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans’ true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as “Black Codes,” enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\nPlans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\n“The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question ‘What is Juneteenth?’” Morial said.\n\nDr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn’t learn about it until his 30s.\n\n“I think many folks haven’t known about it — who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn’t celebrate it,” Anderson said. “It was like just a part of history. It wasn’t a celebration of history.”\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn’t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nSearch online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you’ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth’s history.\n\nThe National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.\n\nThe red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.\n\nMore people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nIn recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n\n“I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,” Morial said. “If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.”\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there’s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you’re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n“I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,” Brown said. “It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn’t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.”\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n“Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we’re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,” Brown said. “Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.”\n\nIt’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n“You know how at Christmas people will say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a ‘Merry Christmas’ from everybody. This is the same way.”","summary":"It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed — after the Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/juneteenth-holiday-date-meaning-b2771795.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/16/20/00/-The-Philadelphia-Union-honor-Juneteenth-before-the-game-against-Charlotte-FC-at-Subaru-Park.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 17:23:00","author":"Terry Tang","authors":["Terry Tang"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.324},{"id":332400804,"title":"Trump says he won’t ‘waste time’ calling Minnesota governor after slayings","text":"United States President Donald Trump has said he will not call Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in the wake of weekend shootings that killed a Democratic state lawmaker and injured another.\n\nTrump denounced the shootings as an act of “horrific violence” in a statement over the weekend. But on Tuesday, he confirmed to reporters that he would not reach out to Walz, who served as the running mate to his rival in the 2024 presidential election, Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n“I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I’m not calling him. Why would I call him?” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “The guy doesn’t have a clue. He’s a mess. So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”\n\nWalz, for his part, said he was not surprised by Trump’s lack of interest in calling him. He did, however, point out that he had spoken with Vice President JD Vance.\n\n“I’m always open to, you know, people expressing gratitude. Vice President Vance assured us, and he delivered, that the FBI would be there as partners with us to get it done,” Walz said. “That was what needed to be done.”\n\nThe suspect in the shootings is 57-year-old Vance Boelter, a father of five who was arrested on Sunday night.\n\nHe has since been charged with federal counts of murder and stalking in connection with the shootings early on Saturday, which resulted in the killings of Melissa Hortman, a top Democrat in the Minnesota House of Representatives, and her husband, Mark Hortman.\n\nBoelter is also accused of shooting Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, both of whom survived.\n\nProsecutors said that Boelter visited the lawmakers’ homes wearing a face mask and body armour to impersonate a police officer. He allegedly knocked on the Hoffmans’ door, identifying himself as police.\n\nProsecutors said on Monday that Boelter sent a message to his family after the shootings, which read: “Dad went to war last night.”\n\nLaw enforcement officials have said they are still investigating a potential motive in the attack. But investigators have recovered notebooks from the suspect with the names of Democratic lawmakers and abortion rights advocates.\n\n“Political assassinations are rare,” Joseph Thompson, Minnesota’s acting US attorney, said at a news conference. “They strike at the very core of our democracy.”\n\nHe added that authorities are searching through Boelter’s notebooks but have not found a “manifesto” clearly laying out his motivations. Boelter’s friends, meanwhile, have told reporters that the suspect was a supporter of Trump and an opponent of abortion rights.\n\nThe slayings have spurred increased concerns about political violence in the US. In the past year alone, Trump has faced an assassination attempt, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has seen his governor’s mansion targeted in an act of suspected arson.\n\nBetween January 6, 2021, and October 2024, the news agency Reuters said it had tallied upwards of 300 cases of political violence in the US.\n\nIn the aftermath of last weekend’s shootings, conspiracy theories claiming that the alleged shooter was a leftist ideologue began to circulate, with support from some Republican lawmakers.\n\nBoelter had previously served with other community members on a state workforce development board under two Democratic governors, including Walz, a fact that helped to fuel the rumours.\n\nHe had also worked as the director of security patrols at a security services company whose website said he had been “involved with security situations in Eastern Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East, including the West Bank, Southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip”.\n\nBoelter appeared briefly in court on Monday but did not enter a plea. He is due to appear in court again on June 27.","summary":"Suspect Vance Boelter has been charged with murder over the shooting deaths of a Minnesota Democrat and her spouse.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/17/trump-says-he-wont-waste-time-calling-minnesota-governor-after-slayings?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25168324688140-1750172409.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 17:02:13","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":332400460,"title":"Jon Stewart Asks ‘What the F–k Is Wrong’ With Sen. Mike Lee, Recalls Bizarre Meeting in Wake of Tweets Mocking Minnesota Assassinations | Video","text":"Jon Stewart was more serious than usual during his latest opening monologue for “The Daily Show.” In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, the Comedy Central host used his opening monologue to address the “jarring cognitive dissonance” among Republicans. And the target of his ire was Republican senator from Utah Mike Lee.\n\nThroughout his monologue, Stewart contrasted Republican politicians and Fox News’ responses to protests in L.A. to their response to the murders of Hortman and her husband. His overwhelming point was that the right is happy to take action when it comes to responding to violence in a way that fits their agenda, such as bringing in the National Guard to stifle protests against ICE in California. But when it comes to addressing violence that doesn’t fit their agenda, like the rise of mass shootings, there’s a sense of resignation on the political right that these things just happen. During an especially charged moment, Stewart listed some of the deadliest mass shootings from the past 25 years for a minute straight. \n\n“Turns out, when it comes to mass shootings, one’s not too many. A s–tload isn’t too many. By the way, you can say Second Amendment all you want, but you don’t seem to mind throwing out the Constitution when it comes to deportation,” Stewart said. “Violence should never be accepted. It should never be tolerated. But that’s for their issues.”\n\nTo further prove his point, Stewart zeroed in on senator Lee. “The Daily Show” host previously met Lee in 2019 as part of an event for the FealGood Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to assisting all emergency personnel. At the time, the foundation was trying to get Lee to support a bill that would provide life-saving coverage and money to 9/11 first responders. After one first responder cop shared his story about being in the tower that collapsed, Stewart said that Lee smiled and said, “I bet you’ve got a lot of stories.”\n\n“We met a lot of people in Washington. Some were hopeful, some of those meetings … Some were upsetting meetings,” Stewart said. “That was the only meeting where we all walked out and looked at each other and went, ‘What the f–k is wrong with that guy?’”\n\nStewart then played an impassioned clip of Lee using Laken Riley’s murder — a 22-year-old woman who was killed by undocumented immigrant José Antonio Ibarra — as a reason why more force needs to be taken when it comes to immigration and deportation. \n\n“He’s right to be upset at our leaders for allowing unsafe conditions to happen. That’s fine,” Stewart said. \n\nThe late night host then showed two tweets Lee posted on X of the sitting U.S. senator mocking Hortman’s death. One of these, which Lee pinned, showed an image of shooting suspect with the caption “When Marxists don’t get their way.” Another post of the suspect Lee captioned with “Nightmare on Walz Street,” a pun invoking the last name of Minnesota governor and Kamala Harris’ running mate Tim Walz. \n\n“I truly want to know why, in his mind, one death at the hands of an immigrant is worth $150 billion of border security, a militarization of American cities — well, just the blue cities. I know the undocumented immigrants in red state fields are the good ones,” Stewart said. “But I want to know why those deaths in Minnesota are worth only a night of edgelord s–t posting. No billions for mental health. No stopping illegal weapons coming in. No nothing. We should ask him why. I bet he’s got some stories to tell.” Watch the full opening monologue above.","summary":"The \"Daily Show\" host questions why the Utah politician resorted to a night of \"edgelord s--t posting\" following the  deaths of Minnesota Democrat Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark\n\n\nThe post Jon Stewart Asks &#8216;What the F&#8211;k Is Wrong&#8217; With Sen.

Tim Walz after a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were gunned down by an assassin.\n\nAs the president was departing the G7 Summit in Canada, due to the current turmoil in the Middle East, he was asked on board Air Force One if he planned to dial Walz to express his condolences over the Saturday killings. \n\nWalz had been Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate last year, losing the race to Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance. \n\n'I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out, I'm not calling him,' Trump said. 'Why would I call him? I could call him and say \"hey, how you doing?\" The guy doesn' thave a clue, he's a mess.' \n\n'So I could be nice and call him but why waste time?' the president added. \n\nTrump also pointed out that the Minnesota shooting suspect, 57-year-old Vance Boelter, who was apprehended late Sunday, had been a Walz appointee. \n\nThe state's former Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton had in 2016 appointed Boelter to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board. \n\nWalz later reappointed Boelter to the 41-member board. \n\nBoelter served on the board alongside one of his victims, State Sen.

'Those responsible for this will be held accountable.' \n\nIn Minnesota, voters do not declare a political affiliation when they register to vote, but a friend of Boelter's told The New York Times that he voted for Trump in the last election and was particularly passionate about his anti-abortion views. \n\nAnother Republican, Sen. Mike Lee, had speculated that Boelter was a member of the political far-left.\n\n'This is what happens When Marxists don't get their way,' the Utah Republican posted to X, prompting criticism from Minnesota's two Democratic senators. \n\nMinnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith went so far as to find Lee on Capitol Hill and chide him publicly for his comments, as Smith was close friends with Hortman. \n\nSmith told reporters that she confronted Lee for his 'cruel' post in the aftermath of Saturday's shootings. \n\n'I wanted him to know how much pain that caused me and the other people in my state and I think around the country, who think that this was a brutal attack,' Smith said, according to NBC News. \n\nShe added that the Utah Republican needed to hear from her 'directly' about the 'impact his actions had.' \n\n'I don't know whether Sen. Lee thought fully through what it was, you'd have to ask him, but I needed him to hear from me directly what impact I think his cruel statement had on me, his colleague,' Smith said.","summary":"President Donald Trump expressed zero interest in calling Minnesota Gov.

Trump: A defining moment for America or the California governor’s shot at presidency?","text":"Ever since President Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against an immigrant crackdown, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has emerged as a strident and ubiquitous antagonist to Trump’s military deployment on American streets, describing it as unconstitutional “madness.”\n\nTrump’s actions have “defined a serious and profound moment in American history,” he told New York Times podcaster Michael Barbaro on Thursday’s “The Daily.”\n\nFor the Democrat whose statewide term ends after the 2026 election, and who is widely considered a presidential contender in 2028, is this also a defining moment for him?\n\nMore clashes were expected Saturday when U.S. Army tanks rolling down Washington, D.C., streets during Trump’s military parade contrast with what were expected to be some 1,500 separate “No Kings” demonstrations against his administration in cities across the country.\n\nFor Newsom, what started Tuesday with a primetime speech warning that “democracy is under assault” cascaded into a daily onslaught of taunts, insults and threats attacking President Trump and his team, all spun out in interviews, social media posts and viral memes.\n\nWhen Trump said he got tough in a phone call with Newsom in the early days of the L.A. protests, Newsom called the president a “stone cold liar.” When Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan suggested Newsom could be arrested if his sanctuary policies impeded ICE officers (and Trump later agreed Newsom’s arrest would be “a great thing”) the governor posted on TikTok for Homan to “come and get me, tough guy.”\n\nNewsom’s barrage of attacks has left many demoralized Democrats hoping this is the anti-Trump leader for whom they’ve been waiting. But others wonder whether Newsom has chosen the wrong battle — that his larger principle of fighting for “democracy over authoritarianism” will be lost in a hail of images of protesters waving Mexican flags amid burning cars, and will only reinforce a running GOP narrative that Democrats are the party of a woke ideology and lawlessness.\n\n“It’s a very fraught issue for the governor to take a stand on because he has to walk a very fine line,” said political science professor Melissa Michelson of Menlo College. “A lot of Americans supported Trump because of his promise for massive deportations.”\n\nFor all the talk of the 57-year-old Newsom as the face of the Trump resistance — and a naturally telegenic one at that with his slicked-back hair recently fading to a distinguished gray — former Republican strategist Bill Whalen said Democrats “hyperventilating” about his presidential chances in 2028 “really need to take a chill pill.”\n\nJust two months ago, “the media went crazy,” he said, when U.S. Rep. Cory Booker gave a marathon speech protesting Trump and Elon Musk’s cuts to government agencies. They did the same with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in April, he said, during the “Fight Oligarchy” tour through California’s Central Valley with Sen. Bernie Sanders and again a few weeks later when Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker delivered a rousing speech about fighting for democracy.\n\n“We have to think about this in moments,” said Whalen, a Hoover Institute distinguished policy fellow, “and Gavin Newsom is having his moment.”\n\nThe confrontation began last weekend when Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard troops into Los Angeles following two days of unrest after an ICE immigration crackdown that started in a Home Deport parking lot. Newsom said Trump’s move was unconstitutional and only served to “inflame tensions,” since the National Guard hasn’t been summoned over a governor’s objection in 60 years.\n\nBut Whalen, a former speech writer for former California Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, said Newsom’s lofty speech fell into the same trap that doomed former Vice President Kamala Harris, a fellow Californian, in her campaign last fall against Trump. His “authoritarian rant” may have appealed to coastal elites, he said, but not to Trump voters who care about crime, illegal immigration and the economy.\n\n“He is not winning over the unconverted. And therein lies the challenge,” Whalen said. “Take that speech and tell me how that changes him going to Ohio or Pennsylvania or any swing state in America.”\n\nNewsom’s TikTok posts, however, some set to hip-hop music, are gaining traction with a young audience, such as a post about the state suing the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard, seen by millions.\n\nNewsom has been capturing the national spotlight since the early 2000s when, as San Francisco mayor, he defied state law and officiated same sex marriages at City Hall. During Trump’s first run for president in 2016, he defended California as a sanctuary state for immigrants living in the U.S. without permission.\n\nBut after Trump was inaugurated for his second term earlier this year, Newsom moved into a role as conciliator, inviting nationally known conservatives onto his podcast to seek common ground and grabbing headlines (and shocking progressives) when he agreed that transgender athletes competing in girls sports was “deeply unfair.”\n\nHis actions are part of a plan by the governor and his team to position Newsom for his next big move, said Sonoma State Political Science Professor David McCuan.\n\n“They want to create a new type of Democrat and something that blends Ronald Reagan and Morning in America with Bill Clinton’s retail politics skills and Obama’s charisma,” McCuan said. “They want to roll that all into one Democratic cigar that he can smoke all the way through.”\n\nThis latest fight with Trump, despite the harsh rhetoric, McCuan said, is advantageous for both politicians.\n\n“This is a made-for-television moment that both these individuals understand and creates this bromance between them,” McCuan said. “And while Donald Trump may be this East Coast guy leading this MAGA movement, he recognizes that there is an ambitious politician that potentially is a threat. Just like Democrats overreact to Donald Trump — anything he does, the sky is falling — Republicans and the right and their media circles overreact to anything the limousine liberal from San Francisco does. It is like red meat and tofu for each audience.”\n\nNo matter how skillfully Newsom may explain to Americans that he supports peaceful protests and opposes violence, or provides sanctuary for law-abiding immigrants but helps ICE deport violent criminal ones, he still carries political baggage — including his inability to solve the state’s twin crises of homelessness and housing affordability, pundits say.\n\n“It remains to be seen whether he can make that work, and he can put his missteps behind him and get folks to take him at his word and think that he is being sincere,” said Michelson of Menlo College. He will need to “overcome the skepticism that folks naturally have of the governor these days that everything he’s doing is an attempt to set himself up as a presidential candidate.”","summary":"Newsom’s barrage of attacks have left many demoralized Democrats hoping this is the anti-Trump leader they’ve been waiting for, but others wonder whether the governor has chosen the wrong battle.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/06/17/newsom-v-trump-a-defining-moment-for-america-or-the-california-governors-shot-at-presidency/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BRN-L-ELIAS-COL-0509-1.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 16:35:19","author":"Julia Sulek","authors":["Julia Sulek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":332380090,"title":"Jennifer Lawrence, Sienna Miller and Mariska Hargitay: All the Stars at Huma Abedin and Alex Soros' Wedding","text":"Huma Abedin and Alex Soros' Hamptons wedding was a starry affair!\n\n The guest list featured major names from the entertainment, fashion and political worlds. Hollywood celebs in attendance at the June 14 nuptials included Sienna Miller, Jennifer Lawrence, Mariska Hargitay and her husband Peter Hermann, Jimmy Fallon, and Adrien Brody and girlfriend Georgina Chapman, according to new photos shared by Vogue.\n\n Fashion designers Diane von Furstenberg, Prabal Gurung, Tory Burch and Stacey Bendet, model Karlie Kloss (sporting a baby bump under her floral dress) and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour also came out to witness the couple's union.\n\n In one photo, Hillary Clinton — who was joined by her husband Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea Clinton — posed with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Other notable guests included Nicky Hilton and Tony Goldwyn and his wife Jane Musky.\n\n Abedin, 48, and Alex, 39, tied the knot at their home in Water Mill, New York. According to Vogue, they initially intended to elope, but that plan changed during an engagement party co-hosted by the former political aide's longtime boss, Hillary Clinton. Their guests persuaded them that their idea to elope was \"nonsense.\"\n\n “It was an unexpectedly wonderful journey,” Abedin told the outlet. “We got engaged with no plans to have a wedding. We talked about hosting small dinners in different cities because we have close family and friends all over the world. But once we decided to have a wedding, or rather when we were instructed to have a wedding by Hillary and Anna [Wintour], who pulled out their calendars and suggested the date — it was set.”\n\n The pair held two ceremonies over their wedding weekend. On Friday, June 13, they were joined by a small gathering of family and friends at Alex's father George Soros' Southampton home to sign the nikah in honor of Abedin’s Muslim faith and the ketubah in honor of Alex's Jewish heritage. Abedin wore a custom Erdem lace dress for the occasion.\n\n The couple then had a larger celebration on Saturday at their home, with the bride in an off-the-shoulder ivory silk satin-backed crepe gown designed by Givenchy's Sarah Burton and the groom in a blue Dior tux.\n\n Alex saw Abedin's wedding dress for the first time at the ceremony. “Huma was adamant that I not see her dress, so there was an element of surprise,\" he told Vogue. \"Ultimately, I will remember looking into her eyes and holding her hands the whole time.”\n\n Despite the unexpectedly chilly and rainy weather, the couple's guests made a stylish showing. Many of the women embraced the floral-themed dress code, wearing colorful printed looks. Harris looked glamorous in a glittery midnight blue dress, while Lawrence wore a golden, robe-style dress with fan and floral details.\n\n After a dinner overseen by Olivier Cheng featuring chilled English pea soup, American wagyu bavette steak and grilled prawns, and truffle agnolotti, Boyz II Men got the party going with a live performance, followed by a set from DJ-Nice.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n \"We danced until 3 a.m.,\" Abedin told Vogue of the late-into-the-night celebrations.\n\n Reflecting on the magical weekend, she said, “I feel like a tsunami of love washed over us. I’m overwhelmed with joy. In a state of bliss and gratitude.”\n\n Alex added: \"I’m also overwhelmed — but in a good way — by the love, the warmth.

Walz after lawmaker shootings because it would 'waste time' (World)","text":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday ruled out calling Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers, saying that to do so would “waste time.”\n\nOne lawmaker and her husband were killed, and the second legislator and his wife sustained serious injuries in the shootings early Saturday. A suspect surrendered to police on Sunday.\n\nThe Republican president spoke to reporters early Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after abruptly leaving an international summit in Canada because of rising tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. Asked if he had called Walz yet, Trump said the Democratic governor is “slick” and “whacked out” and, “I’m not calling him.”\n\nPresidents often reach out to other elected officials, including governors and mayors, at times of tragedy, such as after mass killings or natural disasters, to offer condolences and, if needed, federal assistance.\n\nOn the plane, Trump sounded uninterested in reaching out to Walz, who was the vice presidential running mate for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump. During the campaign, Walz often branded Trump and other Republican politicians as “just weird.”\n\n“I don’t really call him. He’s slick — he appointed this guy to a position,\" Trump said. \"I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I’m not calling him. why would I call him?\n\n“I could call him and say, ‘Hi, how you doing?’” Trump continued. \"The guy doesn’t have a clue. He's a, he's a mess. So, you know, I could be nice and call him but why waste time?”\n\nTrump's mention of “this guy” being appointed to a position appeared to be a reference to Vance Boelter, the suspect who surrendered to police after a nearly two-day manhunt in Minnesota.\n\nBoelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, records show. Hoffman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. It was unclear if or how well Hoffman and Boelter knew each other.\n\nFriends and former colleagues interviewed by The Associated Press describe Boelter as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for Trump.\n\nAuthorities say Boelter also shot state Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, injuring them at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. Federal prosecutors charged Boelter with murder and stalking, which could result in a death sentence if convicted. His lead attorney has declined to comment.\n\nOn Monday, Walz posted a message of thanks on social media to Ontario Premier Doug Ford for his call expressing condolences to the Hortman family and the people of Minnesota.\n\n“In times of tragedy, I’m heartened when people of different views and even different nations can rally together around our shared humanity,” Walz wrote.\n\nIn an interview Monday with Minnesota Public Radio, Walz said he wasn't surprised by the lack of outreach from Trump, saying, “I think I understand where that's at.”\n\nWalz said he has spoken with Vice President JD Vance and was “grateful” for the call and had talked with former President Joe Biden, Harris and Ford.\n\n“I’m always open to, you know, people expressing gratitude. Vice President Vance assured us, and he delivered, that the FBI would be there as partners with us to get it done,\" Walz said. \"That was what needed to be done.”","summary":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday ruled out calling Minnesota Gov.

The Democratic ticket lost their White House bid to Trump and Vance.Walz, for his part, has thrown a few choice words Trump's way, too. In a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota Law School last month, Walz described the president as a \"tyrant\" who undermines civil rights and the rule of law. He warned graduates that they were entering a \"genuine emergency\" where Trump was \"trampling rights\" and abusing power to persecute scapegoats.He has called on Democrats to be \"meaner\" and to \"bully the s***\" out of Trump.

Huckabee’s also a Baptist minister and a former Arkansas governor.\n He opens by referencing last year’s attempted assassination of Trump in Pennsylvania, saying Trump was spared by God to be the “most consequential President in a century – maybe ever.” Huckabee says no president in his lifetime “has been in a position like yours. Not since Truman in 1945.” That’s a reference to President Harry Truman’s decision to drop an atomic bomb on Japan during World War II.\n “You did not seek this moment. This moment sought YOU!” Huckabee wrote, adding, “It is my honour to serve you!” Trump again dismisses comments of one of his top aides Back in March, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers US spy agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon.\n When asked about the comment aboard Air Force One, Trump dismissed her remark.\n “I don’t care what she said,” Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.” A widening schism over Iran among Trump’s MAGA supporters Trump bristled when asked about some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who’ve suggested further US involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end US involvement in expensive and endless wars.\n “Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,’ IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!’” the president wrote on social media.\n Other prominent Trump supporters have also raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel.\n Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk are among prominent Trump World allies who’ve noted that voters backed Trump because he promised not to entangle the nation in foreign clashes and to be wary of expanding US involvement in the Mideast conflict.\n Trump says he won’t call Minnesota Gov Tim Walz after lawmaker shootings The president said he he won’t call Walz after the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers because it would “waste time.” One of the lawmakers and her husband were killed.\n The Republican president spoke to reporters early Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after abruptly leaving an international summit in Canada because of rising tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran.\n Asked if he planned to call Walz, Trump said the Democratic governor is “slick” and “whacked out” and said, “I’m not calling him.” Presidents often reach out to other elected officials at times of tragedy to offer condolences.\n Trump added, “The guy doesn’t have a clue.

It applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA.\n Trump is at a moment of choosing as Israel looks for more US help crushing Iran’s nuclear programme President Donald Trump in about eight hours Monday went from suggesting a nuclear deal with Iran remained “achievable” to urging Tehran’s 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his visit to an international summit to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.\n He returns to the capital at a moment of choosing in his presidency.\n Israel, with five days of missile strikes, has done considerable damage to Iran and believes it can now deal a permanent blow to Tehran’s nuclear programme — particularly if it gets a little more help from Trump.\n Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his overnight flight back to Washington that Iranian leaders had been unwilling to reach an agreement over their nuclear programme, suggesting he was now less interested in talking with them.\n “They should have done the deal. I told them: Do the deal,” Trump said. “So I don’t know. I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate.” The Republican president, who said he plans to meet with advisers in the Situation Room, appears to be gradually building the public case for a more direct American role in the conflict.\n His shift in tone comes as the US has repositioned warships and military aircraft in the region to respond if the conflict between Israel and Iran further escalates.

On Sunday, he said he would increase targeted actions in so-called sanctuary cities. Then on Monday night, the Washington Post reported that the pause on farms, restaurants and hotels was being walked back.The mixed signals on the president's signature domestic policy caused some dismay among those on the right who made it clear they wanted illegal immigrants out of the U.S., regardless of the jobs they were doing, just as the president promised during his campaign.\"If ICE is being told to go easy or exempt all of agriculture, meatpacking, hotels, and restaurants from enforcement, first of all how many illegal aliens are left to enforce the law against?\" Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a right-leaning thinktank in Washington, D.C., told Newsweek Monday.\"If ICE at the same time is supposed to step up enforcement in sanctuary jurisdictions, can they raid restaurants in New York? Can they raid farms in California? Which of those two directives, to exempt certain industries but focus on sanctuary jurisdictions, which of those take priority?\"Are ICE Raids On Or Off?Krikorian's questions get at the heart of the complexities of carrying out mass deportations in a country dependent on migrant labor. Trump campaigned on a promise to deport upwards of 11 million people in the country without legal status. While originally focused on those with criminal records, experts repeatedly warned that a deportation effort on this scale would sweep up undocumented immigrants without criminal records — including those who make America's farming and hospitalities industries run.On Thursday, Trump appeared to concede that his sweeping immigration enforcement efforts were hurting some of those very industries, including agriculture, hospitality and dining.\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\"In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\"If Trump were to ease up on workplace raids, he will be going against his base in Republican-majority states who voted for the removal of illegal immigrants writ large. But many red states also have vast rural areas that see immigrants employed on farms, as well as urban and suburban regions that depend on migrants to staff jobs in healthcare and hospitality.\"The president himself is not a restrictionist. He's not a low immigration guy. He's a regular Republican, 'legal good, illegal bad' guy on immigration,\" Krikorian said. \"But his voters are immigration restrictionists. In other words, regular voters who voted for Trump want less immigration overall. Not just illegal but legal, too.\"On Monday night, DHS reportedly walked back the directive it had sent to agents days earlier, with the department's leads telling ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) that the White House did not support the pause, per the Post.Meanwhile, Trump's deputy chief of staff and immigration policy architect, Stephen Miller, has been clear that he wants to see around 3,000 arrests per day from ICE. Exempting workplaces would likely hinder that already difficult goal.Mixed Messaging From TrumpThe president also posted on Sunday night that he was ordering ICE, with its already strained resources, to increase its efforts in sanctuary cities such as Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles – areas which voted strongly in favor of Democratic candidate and former Vice President Kamala Harris in November's presidential election.\"This muddies the president's message about deporting the largest number of illegal aliens ever,\" Krikorian said. \"That's a problem both internally, as far as giving direction to what ICE agents are supposed to do, an externally as to who is going to bother self-deporting now, if Trump has said a huge share of the illegal population doesn't have to flee?\"DHS has urged those without legal status to self-deport, with reports over the weekend that upwards of a million people had chosen to do so before ICE could detain them. That data has not yet been made public.Krikorian said he believed there was a fight going on within the White House over what the priorities were on deportations, with Trump potentially throwing ideas out on social media and his staff struggling to keep up with the latest conflicting marching orders.This has the effect of sending illegal immigrants and their employers the same message that previous administrations had, in Krikorian's view: that it was OK to skirt the law.\"If you're going to restore integrity in the immigration system, then you're going to have to inconvenience people who have profited from the earlier arrangements,\" he said.When Newsweek asked DHS how it would continue to deliver on what the president promised while protecting American businesses, and whether policies would differ state-to-state, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the department will \"follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets.\"Where's Congress?Getting a grasp on deportation numbers remains difficult under this administration, but pressure is being placed on ICE to triply daily arrest numbers. Congress is being asked to dramatically increase funding for the agency, but longer-term solutions to keep border crossings low and tighten vetting requirements remain unknown.\"I really think that Trump's comments are a reflection of the decades of Congressional inaction on immigration,\" Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, told Newsweek. \"Because these industries are relying on immigrant workers, but they have not been provided a pathway to lawful status, and they have remained in the country, for many cases, for many years.\"Trump's back-and-forth over farming and hospitality worksite arrests will not change the status of those illegal immigrants. If or when the president decides to act on tightening legal immigration laws, or to give undocumented immigrants some kind of amnesty, remains to be seen, and bigger changes like this would likely need Congressional approval.Lawmakers have reintroduced the bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which would establish an easier pathway for immigrants to gain legal status to work on American farms, but widespread changes to improve the country's legal immigration system rarely make it all the way to the Oval Office.Bush-Joseph said Congress is currently being responsive to the president's wishes when it comes to ICE funding, so it could be the right time to act.\"So would Congress also be willing to move on more standalone immigration legislation, like they did with the Laken Riley Act, is a question, but of course the topic of legalization remains extremely politicized,\" she said.","summary":"The president said he heard concerns about ICE raids on farms and hospitality businesses.

In the race for governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, whose candidacy thwarted prospective primary challengers, will go up against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — the only Republican who qualified for the ballot. Republicans have also solidified nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general.Virginia is one of two states that host statewide elections the year after a presidential election — New Jersey is the other — and the races are typically seen as referendums on the party in power before Congress heads into midterm elections. Analysts will be looking for clues in both states about voter sentiment with President Trump back in the Oval Office and Republicans controlling power in Washington. National Democrats' hold on Virginia has slipped in recent years, moving it close to swing-state status nationally. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin beat former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2021. And although Democrats narrowly gained back complete control of the legislature in a 2023 election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won Virginia last year by less than six points, compared to former President Joe Biden's 10-point lead in 2020. Still, Democrats have history on their side: The party of the sitting president typically suffers defeat in Virginia's statewide races. And considering Mr. Trump has never won the state, Democrats are probably better positioned to make gains once their ticket solidifies.The six Democrats vying to be Virginia's next lieutenant governor aren't all that different on the issues: They support rights to abortion, a living wage, affordable housing and accessible health care. They also share similar criticisms of the president. The candidates notably fracture along regional lines, and distinctions emerge in what they have emphasized in stump speeches along the campaign trail.Former Richmond City Mayor Levar Stoney has touted his ties to the Democratic Party and experience working under former Govs. Mark Warner and Terry McAuliffe. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg endorsed his campaign in June.State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi is also from the Richmond area, representing part of the city and suburbs. Hashmi has pushed reproductive health in her bid and has been endorsed by abortion rights political action committees. Virginia Sen. Aaron Rouse, from Virginia Beach with ties to southwest Virginia, has also highlighted his legislative accomplishments.Prince William County School Board Chair Barbur Lateef, former federal prosecutor Victor Salgado and retired U.S. Department of Labor worker Alex Bastani are from northern Virginia. Lateef, an eye surgeon, has honed in on education and health care. Salgado has stressed the importance of strengthening democracy, and Bastani has emphasized labor rights.Former Del. Jay Jones and Henrico County Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor are seeking to be the next attorney general.Jones, who once represented Norfolk in the House of Delegates, comes from a long line of Hampton Roads politicians. His father was also a delegate, and his grandfather was the first Black member of the Norfolk School Board. Jones previously ran for attorney general in 2021 but lost the primary to Democratic incumbent Mark Herring. Taylor has served more than a decade as the top prosecutor in the suburbs outside Richmond after flipping the open seat in 2011. Notable cases include when she was appointed special prosecutor in the case of the torch-carrying mob in the fatal 2017 Unite the Right white supremacist riot. She took one of the torch carriers to trial, records show, but the case was dismissed after a hung verdict.Only one Republican candidate in each statewide contest is advancing to the ballot.Earle-Sears became the gubernatorial nominee after Republicans Dave LaRock and Amanda Chase failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Both LaRock and Chase initially challenged Earle-Sears for not being fully aligned with Trump.Conservative talk-radio host John Reid became the de facto nominee for lieutenant governor after his primary opponent left the race, and despite intraparty quarreling. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares sailed to his spot on the ballot after announcing his reelection bid.All 100 seats of the House of Delegates are up for election in November, and some nomination contests are taking place in Virginia's more competitive districts.Democrats May Nivar and Andrew Schear are racing to take on Republican incumbent Del. David Owen in a Richmond-area district that House liberals are vying to flip. Three Democrats are running to battle Republican Del. Carrie Coyner in a Petersburg-area district.Two Republicans and two Democrats will have separate primaries to fill a competitive seat in the Chesapeake area, which opened after Republican Rep. Baxter Ennis announced his retirement.","summary":"The gubernatorial candidates are already set for the highly anticipated, off-year election.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-democrats-nominees-primary-election-voting/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/04/16dc9ed5-58b5-4ea7-8e04-efe86ecfd06a/thumbnail/1200x630/eeefff6400202192ff9410d068faa0ee/gettyimages-1350850227.jpg?v=64f55bb7ef9382fe7916b907da543f1f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 14:33:15","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.048},{"id":332441974,"title":"“It’s a Chess Move” — Melania’s Subtle Act Goes Viral, Netizens Claim She’s ‘Shielding’ Trump","text":"One motion made by Melania Trump during a recent appearance has led some people to believe that she was attempting to “protect” her husband, Donald Trump. On Saturday, June 14, the president celebrated his 79th birthday, and the two attended a rare military parade in Washington, DC.\n\nA version of ‘Happy Birthday’ was played for the Army in celebration of its 250th anniversary, and Melania and Donald both ascended the stage. While some viewers found it odd that the president was sitting still, others noticed a subtle gesture from his wife that they now think they have figured out. A video of Melania and Donald Trump’s arrival was shared on X, showing the First Lady standing in front of her husband.\n\nThe user who posted the clip wrote: “Why did he let Melania stand in front of him? They sang happy birthday, he didn’t move. He didn’t move until they brought out the Flag.” While some thought this was odd, others saw it as an opportunity for Melania to use her First Ladyship. One person wrote: “It’s a chess move – The Queen protects her King.” Another agreed, adding: “I just realized that he said the Army Knights. Knights like in chess?” A third added: “Queen protects the King.”\n\nWatch the scorn and disgust Melania gives to Trump as she turns away from him, in their first public appearance together since April. In fact, it’s so delightful, watch it over and over again. pic.twitter.com/0GbtpOtAOx\n— Mike Sington (@MikeSington) October 31, 2021\n\nSince then, another user has clarified the chess rules in connection with the ostensibly presidential and first lady’s letter. They said: “It’s a chess move… when the queen is in front of the king in chess it means game over.” It coincides with the ongoing nationwide “No Kings” rallies against Donald Trump. It coincides with the ongoing nationwide “No Kings” rallies against Donald Trump.\n\nTrump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles during a previous rally against his immigration policies earlier this month, sparking nationwide protests.

He posted: “Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” “ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” was his subsequent message.\n\nBoth Trump’s remarks and the mobilization of the National Guard were denounced by Democrats and political analysts. Former Vice President Harris criticized the National Guard’s deployment and denounced Trump’s “dangerous escalation” in a statement.\n\nThe governor continued by accusing Trump of being a “stone cold liar” and saying that the president was “inflaming” the uprisings. “Donald Trump is exacerbating these conditions,” he stated at the time. It’s Donald. Trump’s current issue. And we will solve it if he is unable to.\n\nScroll down for some images of Melania and Donald Trump","summary":"Many observers of the event believe that Melania was attempting to \"protect\" her husband when she joined Donald Trump to a parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary last weekend","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/its-a-chess-move-melanias-subtle-act-goes-viral-netizens-claim-shes-shielding-trump","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-20T134438.371.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 14:33:06","author":"Melania Trump,Shrobana Rakshit","authors":["Melania Trump","Shrobana Rakshit"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":332344246,"title":"Trump says he won't call Minnesota Gov.

He made a brief appearance in federal court on Monday.\n\nA motive remains under investigation. But Minnesota state Sen. Scott Dribble, who worked with Hortman, told ABC News on Monday that he was \"very concerned about the nature of the rhetoric that's occurring with politics, especially among right-wing extremists.\"\n\nDribble pointed to what he saw as a change in recent years for \"those at the highest levels to engage in rhetoric of dehumanisation, politicizing instruments of government, politicizing our military, and really calling for a violent response rather than really having vigorous policy debates.\"\n\nMinnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said \"every elected official of every stripe and party has to turn down the temperature.\" Elected representatives and government staffers should in difficult times be displaying their \"humanity\" and reaching across the aisle, Flanagan told ABC News on Monday.\n\n\"Our community, our families, you know, taking care of each other, stepping up for one another. And that needs to continue to be the message during this time of divisive rhetoric,\" she said.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n\"The way our nation moves forward is not through hate. It is not through violence,\" Walz said in a statement Monday. \"It is through humility, and grace, and compassion.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump refused to call Walz, who ran alongside Kamala Harris last November, to offer condolences.\n\n\"I don't want to call him,\" Trump said. \"I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I’m not calling him. Why would I call him? I could call and say, ‘Hi, how you doing?’ Uh, the guy doesn’t have a clue. He’s a mess. I could be nice and call, but why waste time?\"\n\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, Katherine Faulders, Mike Levine, Alexander Mallin and Brittany Shepherd contributed to this report.","summary":"Boelter allegedly had firearms and a list of 45 elected officials in notebooks in his car, law enforcement said.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/minnesota-lawmakers-shooting-vance-boelter/story?id=122919011","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/365cf9a6-b870-4023-a46b-c548c715e09b/Melissa-Hortman-9-epa-gmh-250615_1750015395766_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 12:51:32","author":"Emily Shapiro,Kevin Shalvey","authors":["Emily Shapiro","Kevin Shalvey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.093},{"id":332312230,"title":"Melania Trump 'protects' Donald with 'chess move' in awkward public appearance","text":"First Lady Melania Trump appeared to be 'protecting' Donald Trump with a calculated gesture during a recent public appearance. The couple took to the stage to watch a rare military parade in Washington DC on Saturday (June 14), which coincided with the president's 79th birthday celebrations. Melania and Donald were front and centre as a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' was played in honour of the US Army's 250th anniversary. Some onlookers have noticed the president appeared to be keeping eerily still, while others have spotted what they claim is a clever move by the First Lady to guard her spouse. Footage of the event was posted to the social media platform X, showing the First Lady positioning herself in front of her husband onstage. The user who uploaded the footage asked: \"Why did he let Melania stand in front of him? They sang happy birthday, he didn't move. He didn't move until they brought out the Flag.\" While some found this behaviour odd, there were those who saw it as Melania exerting her influence as First Lady. A commenter suggested: \"It's a chess move – The Queen protects her King.\" Another X user wrote: \"I just realised that he said the Army Knights. Knights like in chess?\" A third added: \"Queen protects the King.\" Another agreed: \"It's a chess move... when the queen is in front of the king in chess it means game over.\" It comes following a wave of so-called 'No Kings' protests against Trump, with the movement gaining momentum nationwide in recent weeks. Tensions have been escalating across the States since riots broke out on the streets of Los Angeles, with Trump deploying the National Guard to quash demonstrations protesting his immigration policies. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris both decried the use of about 4,000 troops to quell violence in the California city. However, Trump has stood firm in his decision to send Guardsmen onto the streets. Posting to Truth Social, he said: \"Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!\" Shortly after, he doubled down on his comment, adding: \"ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!\" Key figures among the Democrats and political pundits have voiced their concern over Trump's remarks. Trump's former election rival Harris released a statement labelling the move a \"dangerous escalation\". Governor Newsom agreed, calling the president a \"stone cold liar\" and accusing him of exacerbating the unrest. He said at the time: \"Donald Trump is inflaming these conditions. This is Donald. Trump's problem right now. And if he can't solve it, we will.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump and wife Melania both appeared at a military parade in Washington DC last week, and the First Lady appeared 'protective' of her husband with one gesture","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/melania-trump-protects-donald-chess-35405790","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35405788.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Trump-Military-Parade-25166023557406.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 12:39:13","author":"Ewan Gleadow","authors":["Ewan Gleadow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":332322192,"title":"‘Trump Is America’s Hitler’: The Left’s 10 Most Outrageous Comments About LA Riots","text":"Although protesters injured 10 deputies with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office on the first day of riots alone, the Left has attempted to portray the anti-ICE riots as “peaceful protests” that “America’s Hitler,” Donald Trump, is using as a pretext to call in the National Guard. \n\nThe following are some of the most outrageous statements on the topic.\n\n1. Trump is “America’s Hitler.” Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., doubled down on the Democrats’ 2024 campaign’s losing message, telling Saturday’s “No Kings” rally, “Donald Trump is America’s Hitler.” The far-left Democrat and former Fang Fang associate threatened to use nuclear weapons against American citizens in a 2018 social media post.\n\n2. Trump is committing “domestic terrorism.” In the left-wing worldview, law enforcement is terrorism, and left-wing violence is peaceful speech. “I would argue that this is not immigration policy that we’re seeing unfold. This is domestic terrorism,” Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., told CNN.\n\n“Are you saying the ICE raids are domestic terrorism?” asked the apparently shocked CNN anchor, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Yes, I would argue that you are terrorizing communities,” replied Kamlager-Dove. By the same logic, Eliot Ness terrorized Italian American communities (most of whom were, at least, U.S. citizens).\n\n3. Trump wants to “flex his authoritarian muscles.” Trump has no real interest in quelling lawlessness, Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., told CNN’s Kasie Hunt over the first weekend of the protests. “He wants to provoke a violent reaction because then he wants to use that as an excuse to send in these troops and flex his authoritarian muscles,” she said.\n\n4. ICE agents “are provoking” preexisting riots. Some Democrats accused ICE agents of lying about being attacked. “Video after video has shown that these agents are the ones provoking these protesters and also making up aggression by these protesters that later video shows, people were not aggressive,” claimed Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. In 2019, Castro posted the names of people in his district who donated to Trump, telling MSNBC, “What I would like for them to do is think twice about supporting” the president.\n\n5. Kamala Harris: Trump wants to “provoke chaos.” Former Vice President (and potential 2028 Democratic presidential hopeful) Kamala Harris weighed in on the protests on June 8, saying, “Deploying the National Guard is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos. In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump administration’s cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division. This administration’s actions are not about public safety—they’re about stoking fear. … And as the LAPD, mayor, and governor have noted, demonstrations in defense of our immigrant neighbors have been overwhelmingly peaceful.” But as Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna cited his deputies’ injuries, he described the “big difference between the peaceful protesters and the individuals who are coming out with weapons to attack our folks.”\n\nNo word on whether Harris will raise bail for those incarcerated.\n\n6. “There was no violence”? In a classic example of gaslighting, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., encouraged liberals not to believe evidence they saw with their own eyes. “Get it in your head! … Don’t think that somehow, because they called out the National Guard, there was violence. There was no violence,” Waters insisted on June 10. “Get it straight, and don’t just rely on what you’re being told or the few incidents that you saw.” When asked about Waters’ comments, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., displayed his Southern roots. “Bless her heart,” he replied.\n\n7. The overwhelmed police force has everything under control. “Local authorities have this under control,” insisted Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., on June 10, accusing Trump of “inflaming those tensions.” But Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told local media just one day earlier, “We are overwhelmed. We had individuals out there shooting commercial-grade fireworks at our officers. That can kill you.”\n\n8. “Mostly peaceful” burning cars. A California Democrat attempted to portray Trump as a dictator using the military to thwart the First Amendment. Unfortunately, as she made the allegation, video footage discredited her in real time. “We are having an administration that is targeting peaceful protests,” Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., told CNN’s “State of the Union” on June 8 as the split-screen showed rioters on motorcycles waving the Mexican flag as they circled a burning car. “The president is sending the National Guard because he doesn’t like the scenes. He doesn’t like the scenes of people peacefully protesting,” she continued as CNN promptly stopped showing footage of the vehicular inferno from the other side of the screen.\n\n9. Rioters are just “having fun watching cars burn.” On June 8, KABC-TV in Los Angeles anchor Jory Rand warned, if Trump moved law enforcement to stop the violence, he could “turn what is just a bunch of people having fun watching cars burn into a massive confrontation.” Protesters set at least six Waymo electric taxis on fire during the riots. “Burning lithium-ion batteries release toxic gases, including hydrogen fluoride, posing risks to responders and those nearby,” warned the LA Police Department.\n\n10. Irrational exuberance? Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., warned, “You always have to be careful, whether you see a burned car or a broken window, whatever it is. It may be the exuberance of the moment.” Pelosi actually made the broader point that “when there is a large gathering of people, the anarchists see it as an opportunity, and they move in.”\n\nBetween June 7 through June 11, CNN and MSNBC described the 2025 Los Angeles riots as “peaceful” 211 times: 123 on CNN and 88 on MSNBC, according to a study from the Media Research Center.\n\nThere have been attempts to set the record straight. “Peaceful protests? Call them what they are: violent, anti-American riots,” demanded U.S. Customs and Border Protection, showing footage of the violence.\n\n“What’s happening in Los Angeles aren’t ‘peaceful rallies,’ They’re Third World insurrection riots on American soil,” said the White House.\n\n“The American people are not as stupid as these Democrats are trying to make us out to be,” said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Stand\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

This gathering took place the day before the wedding, which was officiated by both a rabbi and an imam to respect Alex’s Jewish roots and Abedin’s Muslim faith.\n\nA source told the publication he and his wife Tamiko Bolton, ‘hosted an intimate family service on Friday morning at their home.’\n\nThe source maintained Soros is ‘in good health’ when asked if he skipped out on the festivities for health reasons.\n\nBut Soros was pictured with Alex wearing his wedding day suit in a happy snap his son shared to Instagram to celebrate Father’s Day.\n\n‘Happy Father’s Day to the goat! This was a special one,’ Alex wrote alongside the picture.\n\nThe Friday celebrations at Soros’ Southampton home was followed by an intimate lunch for family and close friends.\n\nAnd Alex made sure to pay homage to his father on his special day, revealing in an exclusive interview with Vogue that his blue tuxedo reminded him of happy memories with his billionaire father.\n\n‘I wore a Dior tux. My favorite color is blue, and when I worked for my father, I would often show up for meetings and both of us, completely unscripted, would be wearing blue,’ he said.\n\n‘It’s also my mother’s favorite color. I didn’t buy many new clothes for the wedding. My mother taught me when I was young that good clothes last, at least for men.’ \n\nThe bride wore a Givenchy gown for the main ceremony, and often turned to fashion guru Anna Wintour for advice during the planning stages of the wedding.\n\nWintour spoke at the reception, with the help of Hollywood funnyman Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nRecalling that detail, Abedin said: ‘When Alex and I first met he asked me out and I said ”no,” then I said ”maybe,” then I finally said ”yes.”… So Jimmy stood up and said, ”Anna asked me to hold the mic, I said no, then I said maybe, then I said yes.” The whole place went wild.’\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney, and the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and her husband, the media mogul Barry Diller, were also thought to have been among the high-profile attendees.\n\nMichelle and Barack Obama were on the guest list too, Page Six reported. \n\nScores of blacked out chauffeur driven minivans and luxury cars queued to ferry the couple’s well-heeled guests through the estate’s main gate.\n\nHuge white tents were erected on the property, giving guests shelter from the almost constant rain and cold that threatened to overshadow the couple’s special day.\n\nSoros and his father are among the most prolific fundraisers in the Democratic Party. Soros has been named heir to his father’s $25 billion empire.\n\nAbedin was one of Clinton’s top aides during her tenure as Secretary of State during President Obama’s first term.\n\nShe hit the headlines when it was revealed her husband, then a Democratic US Congressman from New York had texted nude pictures to young women.\n\nAnthony Weiner resigned his post but ran again in 2013 when again he was found to have sexted pictures. Abedin divorced him and he was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison and he had to register as a sex offender.\n\nAbedin and Soros met in the fall of 2023 at Nicky Hilton Rothschild’s birthday party, and they were engaged in New York City in May 2024.\n\nA rehearsal dinner ahead of the wedding was surrounded by heavy security, including Secret Service agents guarding former US President Bill Clinton and his wife, who arrived with Soros and Abedin in a motorcade of black SUVs. \n\nSecurity staff stood guard on the long front drive of the Georgian-style 12-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion, which was originally designed by architect W.E. Brady.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThis weekend, George Soros, a billionaire and donor to the Democratic Party,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: George Soros unexpectedly misses his son Alex&#8217;s wedding to Huma Abedin first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/george-soros-unexpectedly-misses-his-son-alexs-wedding-to-huma-abedin/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/George-Soros-mysteriously-skips-son-Alexs-wedding-to-Huma-Abedin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 12:24:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.404},{"id":332382080,"title":"Voices: How the ‘big, beautiful’ UK-US trade deal led to a big, beautiful friendship","text":"He called him “Donald”. No one calls him “Donald” – maybe not even Melania or his kids. “The Donald”, yes. Though about him, not to him; face to face, it’s “Mr President” or “Sir”. \n\nBut that’s what Keir Starmer did – the “woke”, progressive, left-wing human rights lawyer, the kind of chap that Maga loves to hate. The same guy that JD Vance tried, but failed, to bait about free speech when he was last in the Oval Office (Trump notably did not rise to the invitation to join in and publicly maul the British prime minister).\n\nApparently, Keir is on such good terms with the US president, he calls him by his first name only – like it’s the most natural thing in the world – and Donald doesn’t seem to mind a bit. \n\nI’m sure I saw it happen at the G7, when the pair announced to great surprise that Trump had signed (most of) the “US-UK economic prosperity deal” (EPD). It was like they’d said they were getting engaged. Trump dropped the papers out of the folder at the reveal, but before he had even started to lean down – and who could be sure he’d make it and then get up again? – Starmer had helpfully hit the tarmac and was retrieving the precious pages. “Very important document,” he said. \n\nIs it? Well, the “optics” make it so. I wondered what Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson – not to mention former UK international trade minister Kemi Badenoch – would think of this outbreak of transatlantic bonhomie; and of Starmer’s success, albeit modestly on paper, in finalising a trade deal with the most dynamic economy on Earth after they had failed to do so. \n\nThe EPD is certainly not as good as it might be. It’s not the kind of comprehensive free trade deal that was touted by the Brexiteers a decade ago. They’ve dropped the clauses on steel, seemingly because of residual American worries about the nominal Chinese ownership of the near-nationalised British Steel. There are also ominous clauses about pharmaceuticals and (the implied) renegotiation of the prices paid by the NHS. \n\nThere are the usual vague hopes about hi-tech stuff, but there’s nothing about financial services (down to the individual states mostly), while the car industry is still subject to a 100,000 quota before punitive tariffs kick in. \n\nHowever, the glass is definitely half full, in the sense that the EPD has potential – and it is one more Trump tariff deal than anyone else in the world has got. There’s no mistaking the fact that it’s a personal diplomatic achievement for Starmer and his diplo-political team.\n\nIn fact, the most significant words about trade weren’t contained in the EPD, but were uttered by Trump – sorry, Donald, now we're all pals – as he left the improvised press conference. The British would be looked after on trade “because I like them”, he declared.\n\nIn particular, he likes Keir. Even though the prime minister, in Trump’s words, is “slightly more liberal than I”. \n\nToo right, Donald. This is a guy who despises everything the US president stands for, but, unlike David Lammy or Peter Mandelson (to take two prominent examples), Starmer was not one of the people stupid enough to slag him off in public and then have to recant it. It just wasn’t – and isn’t – Starmer’s style. \n\nThey say opposites attract, so maybe that’s why the boastful felon and the reserved British former public prosecutor get along so well. That and the fact that both men are so desperate to show that they can actually get stuff done that they felt a sudden and compelling impulse to sign off on the EPD. \n\nTo be fair, Starmer has enjoyed remarkable success in foreign affairs. However, it is an uncomfortable fact for Donald that the EPD, such as it is, is the only international deal on peace, trade, or indeed anything, that he’s managed to reach. \n\nThe great dealmaker has failed in the Middle East and Ukraine. In fact, he’s off early from the G7 summit to go and deal with the Israel-Iran conflict, possibly making contingency plans to bomb Tehran (although that’s denied). \n\nHad Kamala Harris won last November, Trump would now be fulminating about how “this would never have happened if I’d been president” – the usual hypothetical nonsense. He hasn’t achieved peace anywhere, let alone on day one, and his tariffs policy is mostly a disgrace. But he can at least boast that he’s got one “big, beautiful trade deal” done. Starmer, too, can go home to tease Badenoch and Farage about this post-Brexit triumph. \n\nNo wonder Donald’s so nice about Keir, and Keir is so nice about Donald. That’s a nice deal.","summary":"They say opposites attract – and never has that been truer than in the case of Starmer and Trump, writes Sean O’Grady","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/donald-trump-keir-starmer-uk-us-trade-deal-b2771402.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/17/6/31/Canada-hosts-the-G7-Leaders-Summit-o4v2gtmf.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oJeE3ycn-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-17 12:08:35","author":"Sean O'Grady","authors":["Sean O'Grady"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":332309228,"title":"Trump says he won’t call Minnesota Gov.

So, you know, I could be nice and call him but why waste time?”\n\nTrump's mention of “this guy” being appointed to a position appeared to be a reference to Vance Boelter, the suspect who surrendered to police after a nearly two-day manhunt in Minnesota.\n\nBoelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, records show. Hoffman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. It was unclear if or how well Hoffman and Boelter knew each other.\n\nFriends and former colleagues interviewed by The Associated Press describe Boelter as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for Trump.\n\nAuthorities say Boelter also shot state Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, injuring them at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. Federal prosecutors charged Boelter with murder and stalking, which could result in a death sentence if convicted. His lead attorney has declined to comment.\n\nOn Monday, Walz posted a message of thanks on social media to Ontario Premier Doug Ford for his call expressing condolences to the Hortman family and the people of Minnesota.\n\n“In times of tragedy, I’m heartened when people of different views and even different nations can rally together around our shared humanity,” Walz wrote.\n\nIn an interview Monday with Minnesota Public Radio, Walz said he wasn't surprised by the lack of outreach from Trump, saying, “I think I understand where that's at.”\n\nWalz said he has spoken with Vice President JD Vance and was “grateful” for the call and had talked with former President Joe Biden, Harris and Ford.\n\n“I’m always open to, you know, people expressing gratitude. Vice President Vance assured us, and he delivered, that the FBI would be there as partners with us to get it done,\" Walz said. \"That was what needed to be done.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Sarah Brumfield in Cockeysville, Md., contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-wont-call-minnesota-114745339.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYu.6i0Tgf6y9PHtmdScrQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/c2ae3f64d927d0f9cfae9c9b8ab3e308","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 11:47:45","author":"Darlene Superville","authors":["Darlene Superville"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":332316498,"title":"Çfarë ndodhi brenda dasmës së Alex Soros?","text":"Revista prestigjioze “Vogue” ka publikuar fotot nga dasma e Huma Abedin dhe Alex Soros, ku ndër të ftuarit e veçantë ka qenë edhe kryeministri i Shqipërisë, Edi Rama. \n\nNë një nga fotot e eventit shfaqet Rama, i ulur në tavolinë me disa të ftuar të tjerë specialë.

In 2021, when members of Congress urged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to block the sale of a Miami radio station over its perceived political slant, Carr—one of the agency's commissioners—called that move \"a deeply troubling transgression of free speech and the FCC's status as an independent agency.\" He urged his colleagues to push back and assured the public that the FCC's review of the transaction would be \"free from political pressure.\"\n\nThese days, Carr has little credibility\non freedom of speech. Now the chair of the Commission, he has been busy reopening\ninvestigations against broadcast networks\nbecause of their editorial policies, threatening public broadcasters ostensibly about how they raise sponsorship funds (but really about their editorial positions), threatening media companies over their hiring practices, and strong-arming technology companies about issues well beyond the FCC's limited statutory mission.\n\nMost recently, he took to social media to berate NBC owner Comcast for its coverage of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia—the migrant illegally sent from Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, and threaten a \"news distortion\" probe. Carr's post triggered a complaint from the Center for American Rights, which filed a complaint against 60 Minutes that Carr reopened in January.\n\nThe FCC now has a chance to put its money where Carr's mouth used to be. In April, the Commission invited public comments on which rules it should scrap—part of a proceeding cheekily titled Delete, Delete, Delete. The goal is to cut outdated regulations, reduce barriers to competition, and adapt to technological changes.\n\nThe Public Notice requesting comments didn't focus on media content rules. Buried in the fine print, however, it notes that certain rules or statutory requirements \"have been found to be unconstitutional.\" It then asks \"whether constitutional concerns provide a basis for repealing any existing FCC\nrules or should inform the Commission's approach to implementing or enforcing particular statutory provisions.\" Glad you asked.\n\nThe FCC should start by cutting back its regulation of broadcast speech. No greater tension exists in the Communications Act than the FCC's authority over broadcast content—the law expressly withholds from government the power to \"interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication.\" Not only does this deny the FCC \"the power of censorship,\" it also bars any \"regulation or condition\" that interferes with freedom of speech. The Supreme Court has reaffirmed repeatedly that these statutory limits \"were drawn from the First Amendment itself\" and that \"the 'public interest' standard necessarily invites reference to First Amendment principles.\"\n\nAmong other things, the FCC should immediately terminate its investigation of 60 Minutes over the editing of its October 2024 interview with Kamala Harris, its review of ABC over fact-checking candidate Donald Trump during a presidential debate, and its examination of NBC under the \"equal opportunity\" rule (with which the network complied) for Harris' appearance on Saturday Night Live. Each of these investigations were dismissed right before Trump's inauguration, but Carr revived them as one of his first acts as chair. Needless to say, the FCC should not now initiate a news distortion investigation against NBC.\n\nCarr says the FCC operates based on precedent and that he was only following the rules established by earlier \"Democrat\" administrations. That's nonsense. But even if that were true, now is the perfect time for the FCC to change its precedent to comply with the First Amendment. As Carr himself put it in 2021, \"A newsroom's decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official, not targeted by them.\"\n\nAnd while it reviews its outdated content regulations, the FCC should eliminate its \"news distortion policies\" (the basis of the 60 Minutes investigation), significantly narrow or eliminate its indecency rules, and reform or eliminate its antiquated regulation of children's television. Courts blocked efforts to enforce the FCC's incomprehensible indecency rules more than a decade ago, and the Commission never completed a 2013 proceeding aimed at reforming them. Likewise, the children's television rules were adopted in the era of Saturday morning cartoons and are no longer relevant in a world dominated by digital media and streaming services.\n\nAdmittedly, this may be too much to ask of a chair who struts the halls of the agency sporting a Trump lapel pin, particularly when the president is taking to social media demanding revocation of CBS' broadcast licenses. But it would be the principled thing to do.","summary":"Now is the perfect time for the FCC to change its precedent to comply with the First Amendment.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/06/17/fcc-free-speech-flip-flop/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/topicsregulation.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 10:00:55","author":"Robert Corn-Revere","authors":["Robert Corn-Revere"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.089},{"id":332261084,"title":"U.S. Sen.

In a clip circulating on social media, later shared by the Instagram account @livebitez on Monday, June 16, 2025, Seales pointed out that the former president shouldn't be above critique, especially of his policies. In the clip, Seales brought up musician Questlove's recent post calling out people for nitpicking Obama. She explained that while the former president was a great orator and an inspiration, she claimed he just \"inspired\" people to be part of \"establishments.\" She pointed out that he never spoke about \"reparations\" or \"police protection.\" The comedian even questioned what he did for the African-American community. Referencing Obama, Amanda asserted politics should not be rooted in \"identity,\" adding that \"representation\" did not mean someone did good for the said community.

Earlier this week, she shared a post pointing out that it was the said party that defended the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).For context, several protests have taken place across the country against President Donald Trump's mass deportation of immigrants. Since he returned to office, ICE officials have undertaken raids across cities like Atlanta, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and several others to detain illegal immigrants. These raids were carried out even in schools.However, news outlets like ABC News 7 reported that alongside undocumented residents, several citizens, including veterans, have been detained without a warrant. View this post on Instagram Instagram PostIn an Instagram post, Amanda Seales shared a screenshot of a post by Linda Sarsour, claiming that under the Democratic administration, many called for ICE to be abolished. But they were called \"radicals\" as the administration expanded funding for ICE. She claimed: \"We did not forget. The Democratic leadership is also to blame for this horror show we are witnessing that's tearing out communities apart.\"Seales captioned the post:\"Obama built the cages at the border.\"Ahead of the 2024 elections, the comedian alleged that she had once told then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris that her messaging was \"disingenuous.\" In July 2024, a video of Seales discussing Harris went viral, according to Vibe. In the clip, Seales criticized politicians for \"stat(ing) things\" instead of \"do(ing) things.\"Recalling a meeting with the former VP, who had \"summoned\" her, the comedian explained:\"I told her straight up, 'You talk out two sides of your neck, and we don’t know what you’re talking about.' I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s Kamala Harris who is trying to shut me the f**k up.\"When Harris pointed out she was being \"too critical,\" the 43-year-old fired back that it was her job as a voter to be critical. She continued to state that if Harris were not \"loud (and) bold,\" people would never know \"where (she was) coming from.\" View this post on Instagram Instagram PostIt is worth noting that Seales has also called out Donald Trump and criticized his policies, especially the mass deportation of illegal immigrants.

[CLIP] “As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.“ Starting the day of that speech, Trump launched an all out effort to roll back trans rights using every power of the federal government had, and some that it may not have. [CLIP] President Trump has signed an executive order which declares the US government will no longer recognize the concept of gender identity. [CLIP] President Trump, directing the Secretary of Education to create a plan to cut funding for schools that teach what he calls gender ideology. [CLIP] This afternoon, President Trump makes a move to ban transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. [CLIP] Ban on gender-affirming care for transgender kids. [CLIP] A ban on gender-affirming care for transgender inmates in federal prisons. [CLIP] A ban on transgender troops serving in the military. [CLIP] These executive orders, many of them, have not actually gone into effect yet. But when I look across the country, we’re already hearing the stories of impact. [CLIP] It’s a complete dehumanization of transgender people. It’s about privacy and dignity. For me to be able to change my passport to male, [CLIP] It’s going to come along with having to out myself to border patrol agents. [CLIP] We are begging to be allowed to continue our service and you’re just going to wash us away. A lot of the things Trump is doing in this term have put him on the wrong side of public opinion, but not this. In a recent poll where Trump’s approval rating was around 40 percent, 52 percent of Americans approved of how he’s handling trans issues. And if you look more deeply into polling on trans rights, the public has swung right on virtually every policy you can poll. Banning trans medical care for minors? That’s a majority issue now. A few years ago, it wasn’t. Trump didn’t just win the election. He — and the movement and ideology behind him — have been winning the argument. Sarah McBride is a freshman Congresswoman from Delaware, where she was formerly a state senator. She is the first openly trans member of Congress, and her view is that the trans rights movement and the left more broadly, has to grapple with why their strategy failed. How they lost not only power, but hearts and minds. [CLIP] We have to grapple with the reality of where people are beyond this room or this city or my state. Meeting people where they are is not selling out. It’s what this work is. I was struck, talking to McBride how much, she was offering a theory that goes far beyond trans rights. What she’s offering is a counter to the dominant political style that emerged as algorithmic social media collided with politics, a style that is more about policing and pushing those who agree with you than it is about persuading those who don’t. Sarah McBride, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. So I want to begin with some polling. Pew asked the same set of questions in 2022 and 2025. And what it found was this collapse in, I would call it persuasion. So they polled the popularity of protecting trans people from discrimination in jobs, housing, public spaces that had lost 8 points in those three years requiring health insurance companies to cover gender transition, lost 5 points requiring trans people to use bathrooms that match their biological sex gained 8 points. When you hear those results, what to you happened there. By every objective metric, support for trans rights is worse now than it was six or seven years ago. And that’s not isolated to just trans issues. I think if you look across issues of gender right now, you have seen a regression. Marriage equality support is actually lower now than it was a couple of years ago in a recent poll. We also see a regression on around support for whether women should have the same opportunities as men compared to 5, 10, 15 years ago. And so there’s a larger regression from a gender perspective that I think is impacting this regression on trans rights. But I think it has been more acute, more significant in the trans rights space. I think just candidly, I think we lost the art of persuasion. We lost the art of change making over the last couple of years. We’re not in this position because of trans people. There was a very clear, well coordinated, well-funded effort to demonize trans people, to stake out positions on fertile ground for anti-trans politics and to have those be the battlegrounds rather than some of the areas where there’s more public support. We’re not in this position because of the movement or the community, but clearly what we’ve been doing over the last several years has not been working to stave it off or continue the progress that we were making 8, 9, 10 years ago. And I think a lot of it can be traced to a false sense of security that I think the LGBTQ movement and the progressive movement writ large began to feel in the post-marriage world. I think there was a sense of cultural momentum that was this unending cresting wave. I think there is this sense of a cultural victory that led us into a false sense of security, and I think in many ways shut down, needed conversations. And I think we the support that we saw for trans rights in 2016, 2017. It was a mirage of support in some ways, because I think there was in the post-marriage world, there was a transfer of support from the LGB to the tea. I think for two reasons. One, I think people said, well, the tea is part of the acronym, so I support gay people, so I’ll support trans people. It’s all the same movement. But two, I think in those early days after marriage, a lot of people regretted having been wrong on marriage in the 90s and in the 2000. And they went I didn’t understand what it meant to be gay, and therefore I didn’t support marriage. And I regret not supporting something because I didn’t understand it. So I’m going to without understanding, support trans rights because I don’t want to make that same mistake again. And I think that resulted in a lot of us, a lot of our movement stopping the conversation and ceasing doing the hard work of opening hearts and changing minds and telling stories that over 20 years had shifted and deepened understanding on gay identities that allowed for marriage equality to be built on solid ground. And I think that allowed for the misinformation, the disinformation, that well-coordinated, well-funded campaign to really take advantage of that lack of understanding and the support on trans rights was a house built on sand. I want to connect to things you said there, because I hadn’t thought about this exactly before. So you made this point that there’s been a generalized gender regression, which is true. And you also made this point that people had this metaphor in their minds that I was wrong about gay marriage. I didn’t understand that experience. So maybe I’m wrong here, too. But that one thing maybe that’s different here is there’s a set of narrow policies here non-discrimination and then a broader cultural effort. Everybody should put their pronouns in their bio or say them before they begin speaking out at a meeting. It was more about destabilizing the gender binary. And there people had a much stronger view. I do know what it means. I’ve been a man all my life. I’ve been a woman all my life. How dare you tell me how I have to talk about myself or refer to myself. And that made the metaphor break. Because if the gay marriage fight was about what other people do, there was a dimension of this. It was about what you do and how you should see yourself or your kids or your society. I think that that’s an accurate reflection of the overplaying of the hand in some ways that as a coalition, went to trans 201, trans 301 when people were still at very much trans 101 stage one and then two, I think there was. There were requests that people perceived as cultural aggression, which then allowed the right to say we’re punishing trans people because of their actions rather than we’re going after innocent bystanders. And I think some of cultural mores and norms that started to develop around inclusion of trans people were probably premature for a lot of people. We became absolutists, not just on trans rights. I think across the progressive movement. We became absolutist and we forgot that in a democracy we have to one grapple with where the public authentically is and actually engage with it. And I think we and part of this is fostered by social media. We decided that we now have to say and fight for and push for every single perfect policy and cultural norm right now, regardless of whether the public is ready. And I think it misunderstands the role that politicians frankly, social movements have in maintaining proximity to public opinion of walking people to a place. We should be ahead of public opinion, but we have to be within arm’s reach. If we get too far out ahead, we lose our grip on public opinion. And we can no longer bring it with us. And I think a lot of the conversations around sports, and also some of the cultural changes that we saw in expected workplace behavior, et cetera, was the byproduct of maybe just getting too far out ahead and not actually engaging in the art of social change. Making the position for more maximalist demands is one that you need to be in a hurry. Trans people are dying now, suffering now and that there isn’t time for decades of political organizing here. And also that maybe it works. Or maybe there’s a reason to believe it works. So you’ve been in more of those spaces in May. How would you describe how this more maximalist approach in culture evolved and why. Well, first off, I think you’re right. It is understandable. I mean, this is a scary moment. I’m scared as a trans person. I am scared and I recognize that when the house is on fire, when there are attacks that are dangerous, very dangerous, that it can feel like we need to scream and we need to sound the alarm, and we need everyone to be doing exactly that. I get that instinct, I understand it, I understand that people would say, if you give a little bit here, they’ll take a mile. We’re not negotiating with the other side, though, in this moment we have to negotiate with public opinion. And, and and we shouldn’t treat the public like they’re Republican politicians. And when you recognize that distinction, I think it allows for a pragmatic approach that has the best, in my mind, the best possible chance of shifting public opinion as quickly as possible. It would be one thing if screaming about how dangerous this is right now had the effect of stopping these attacks. But it won’t. You call it a abandonment of persuasion became true across a variety of issues for progressives, also for people on the right. And sometimes I wonder how much that reflected the movement of politics to these very unusually designed platforms of speech, where what you do really is not talk to people you disagree with, it’s talk about people you disagree with, two people you agree with, and then see whether or not they agree with what you said. And there’s a way in which I think that breeds very different habits in the people who do it. I think that that’s absolutely right. I mean, again, we’re not in this place because of our community or our movement, but clearly we aren’t in this place because we weren’t shaming people enough, because we weren’t canceling people enough, because we weren’t yelling at people enough, because we weren’t denouncing anti-trans positions enough. I think the dynamic with social media is that the most outrageous, the most extreme, the most condemnatory content is what gets amplified the most. It’s what gets liked and retweeted the most, and people mistake getting likes and retweets as a sign of effectiveness. And those are two fundamentally different things. And I think that whether it’s subconscious or even conscious, rewarding of unproductive conversations has completely undermined the capacity for us as individuals or politically, for us to have conversations that persuade that open people’s hearts and minds that meet them where they are. And I think the other dynamic that we have with social media is that there’s two kinds of people on social media. The vast majority of people are doom scrollers. They just go on and they scroll their social media 20 percent maybe are doom posters 10 percent on the far right, 10 percent on the far left, the people who are so, so strident and angry that they’re compelled to post and that content gets elevated. But what that has resulted in for the 80 percent who are just doom scrollers is this false perception of reality. Take a person. Let’s say they’re center left, and it gives them a false perception of everyone on the left believes this, and it pulls them that way, and then it gives them a false perception that everyone on the right believes the most extreme version of the right. And it creates this false binary extreme perception of availability bias. Because all of the content we’re seeing is reflective of just the 20 percent and it’s warped our perception of reality. It’s warped our perception of who people are and where the public is. One of the best things about being an elected official is that I have to break out of that social media echo chamber, that social media extreme world and interact with everyday people. And you see yeah, there are real disagreements, but that 80 percent of the doom scrollers or the people who aren’t even on social media are actually in a place where we can have a conversation with them. When I ask this question, I don’t just mean on trans issues, but you represent Delaware, which is a blue state, not Massachusetts blue, but blue. If you took your sense of what Democrats want or what the country wants from your experiences on social media versus your sense from traveling around your state, how would they differ. I think they would differ in two ways. One, they would differ in the issues that we would focus on. What you hear on social media is a preoccupation with the most inflamed culture war issues that you almost never hear when you’re out talking to voters in any part of the state. What you hear is a understandable catastrophizing around democracy, which you don’t hear nearly as much when you’re out talking to voters. What you hear when you’re talking to voters is you hear about the cost of living. You hear about the bread and butter issues that are keeping people up at night, people who aren’t on social media or aren’t posting on social media. And so you hear a difference in priorities, but then you also hear a difference in approach. People are hungry for an approach that doesn’t treat our fellow citizens as enemies, but rather treats our fellow citizens as neighbors, even if we disagree with them. An approach that’s just an approach that’s filled with grace. And I think on social media, we have come to this conclusion, rightfully so, that people’s grace has been abused in our society that the grace of marginalized people, the patience of marginalized people, has been abused. And that is true. But on social media, the course correction to that has been to eliminate all grace from our politics. It’s how dare you have conversations with people who disagree with you. How dare you be willing to work with people who disagree with you. How dare you compromise. How dare you seek to find common ground with Republicans. And I think when you go out into the real world, Democrats, independents and Republicans, there is a hunger for some level of grace for us to just not be so angry at one another and miserable. They want to see and know that we actually do have more in common, and therefore, it gives you hope that persuasion is not only necessary, but can actually still be effective. What does grace in politics mean to you, and when have you either seen it or experienced it. I think Grace in politics means. One creating room for disagreement. Assuming assuming good intentions. Assuming that the people who are on the other side of an issue from you aren’t automatically hateful, horrible people. I think it means creating some space for disagreement within your own coalition. I think it’s a kindness that just feels so missing from our body politic and our national dialogue. And look, I saw it in the Delaware State Senate on both sides of the aisle, whether it’s in Republicans in Delaware joining on to be co-sponsors on an LGBTQ panic defense bill that I was the prime sponsor of whether it was the discourse being much kinder and more civil on a whole host of even culture war issues. I saw that grace have the effect of lowering the temperature, removing some of the incentives to go after vulnerable people in this country, in our state. I saw it with my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle who didn’t vote for bills that were deeply personal to me, and yet we still found ways to work together. We still found ways to develop friendships. And look, I know that place is more of a burden on me than it does on them. I know that when you’re asking a marginalized person to extend grace in a conversation, you’re asking much more of that marginalized person. But change making isn’t always easy, and it’s not always fair. And why would we expect that the extra burdens and barriers of marginalization would ceasefire at the point of overcoming the marginalization of creating the change necessary to eliminate prejudice and create equal opportunity in our society. No, that’s where the barriers are going to be greatest. That’s where the burdens are going to be greatest. It reminds me of a line that I feel. I hear it less now, but I used to see it a lot, which is it’s not my job to educate you. And I always thought about that line because on one level I understood it. I mean, it’s probably not your job to educate anyone. And then if you’re in politics, if what you’re trying to do is political change. I always found that line to be almost anti-political. Yeah right that if what you want to do is change a law, change a society, change a heart, and you’re the one who wants to do it. Well, then whose job is it. And who are you expecting to do it. It’s an understandable frustration, but it’s the only way forward. And look, I don’t believe that every person from an underrepresented or unrepresented community needs to always bear the brunt and burden of public education. I don’t believe that every LGBTQ person has to be out and sharing their story, and doing all of that hard work. But for the folks who are willing to do it, we need to let them. And one of the problems we’ve had is that we’ve gone from it’s not my job as an individual person who’s just trying to make it through the day to educate everyone to no one from that community should educate. And frankly, we should just stop having this conversation, because the fact that we are having this conversation at all is hurtful and oppressive, and maybe it is hurtful, but you can’t foster social change if you don’t have a conversation. You can’t change people if you exclude them. And I will just say you can’t have absolutism on the left or the right without authoritarianism, right. The fact that we have real disagreements, the fact that we have difficult conversations, the fact, the fact that we have painful conversations is not a bug of democracy. It’s a feature of democracy. And Yes, that is hard and difficult. But again, how can we expect that the process of overcoming marginalization is going to be fair. And I think the discourse has taken this understandable critique of society and the way we operate and the burdens we place on marginalized people. And we’ve somehow said, well, the one place that we have control over whether we allow for that marginalization is in the strategies we use to overcome it. We’re not going to engage in that because it’s self oppression. And I think that is such a self-defeating and counterproductive approach. I’ve been thinking in the past couple of months, because we are in the most illiberal era of my lifetime in American politics. And I mean liberalism in the sense of supporting or not supporting universal health care, but in terms of due process, in terms of tolerance, in terms of the basic practice of politics and living amidst each other. And it’s also made me think about the need to clearly define what the practice of liberalism itself is. What do you think it is. I think it is the recognition that in a free society, we are going to live and think differently. I think it is the allowance of that disagreement in the public square, and the tussle of that disagreement in the public square and that is uncomfortable. That is not easy. And Yes, there are going to be people in that conversation for whom it’s going to be more difficult and more uncomfortable. But in the internet world, you can’t suppress diversity of thought. It will always bubble up. But it will bubble up if suppressed with an extra bitterness and an extremism fostered in that echo chamber that it’s been suppressed to. It’ll inevitably bubble up like a volcano. And I think that’s what we’re seeing right now. I will say, I think while the left made this mistake of fostering an illiberalism based on a false sense of cultural victory, I think now the right is making the exact same mistake. I think they’re overplaying their hand. I think they’re interpreting the 2024 election to be a cultural mandate that is much greater than what it actually is. And I think that if they continue to do that, there will be a backlash to the illiberalism, the cultural illiberalism, not just the legal illiberalism, the cultural illiberal liberalism of the right, in the same way that there’s been a backlash to the cultural liberalism of the left, I couldn’t I think, agree with that more. We’re going to get to that. I want to talk for a minute about the 2024 election in the aftermath. So there’s been a lot of rethinking and self-recrimination among Democrats. One of the comments that got a lot of attention came right after the election when Seth Moulton, who’s your colleague, Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, said, quote, Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone, rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face. I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I’m supposed to be afraid to say that. What did you think when you heard that. One, that it wasn’t the language that I would use. But I think it came from a larger belief that the Democratic Party needed to start to have an open conversation about our illiberalism, that we needed to recognize that we were talking to ourselves. We were fighting fights that felt viscerally comforting to our own base, or fighting fights in a way that felt viscerally comforting to our own base, rather than maintaining proximity to the public and being normal people. I think the sports conversation is a good one because I think there is. There’s a big difference between banning trans young people from extracurricular programs, consistent with their gender identity, and recognizing that there’s room for nuance in this conversation. And I think the notion that we created this all on or all off mentality, that you had to be perfect on trans rights across the board, use exactly the right language. And unless you do that, you’re a bigot. You’re an enemy. And when you create a binary all on or all off option for people, you’re going to have a lot of imperfect allies who are going to inevitably choose the all off option. And what ends up happening is the left excommunicates will excommunicate someone who not only Seth voted against the ban on trans athletes, but we would excommunicate someone who uses imperfect language. Yes look again. Not language I would use, but we would excommunicate someone who’s saying that there’s nuance in this conversation and uses language that we don’t approve of yet still votes. The quote, the right way is exactly what’s wrong with our approach. And look, Seth’s not going anywhere. But for a lot of everyday folks, if they think how Seth thinks or if they think that there’s room for nuance in this conversation and we tell them you’re a bigot, you’re not welcomed here, you’re not part of our coalition, we will not consider you an ally. The right’s done a very good job of saying, listen, you have violated the illiberalism of the left. You have been cast aside for your common sense. Welcome into our club. And then human nature starts to be. Once you then get welcomed into that club, human nature is well, I was with the Democratic Party on 90 percent of things, maybe against them on 10 percent of things, or in the middle on 10 percent once you get welcomed into that other club, human psychology, you start to adopt those positions. And instead of being with us on 90 percent of things and against us on 10 percent of things, that person now. Welcomed into the far right club starts to be against us on 90 percent of things and with us on only 10 percent of things. And I think that dynamic is part of the regression that we have seen. And not only the regression we’ve seen, but the hardening of the opposition that we’ve seen on trans issues. We have been an exclusionary tent that is shedding in perfect allies, which is great. We’re going to have a really, really miserable, self-righteous, morally pure club in the gulag we’ve all been sent off to. I think this goes to your point in a way. So after he made those comments the times reported that a local party official and an ally had compared him to a Nazi collaborator. There were protests outside his office. I was always struck by which part of his comments got all that attention. It was the part I just read to you. But he also said this having reasonable restrictions for safety and competitive fairness in sports seems like, well, it’s very empirically a majority opinion. He’s right on that. But should we take civil rights away from trans people so they can just get fired for being who they are. No he was expressing opposition to what was about to be Donald Trump’s agenda. Yeah and this space of his divergence from an already an issue that had already been lost. That was the polling was terrible on it. That was where people on the left focused. And his expression of support and allyship, as I saw it, barely ever got reported or commented on. It struck me as telling. I think it absolutely is telling. And I think it’s. The best thing for trans people in this moment is for all of us to wake up to the fact that we have to grapple with the world as it is, that we have to grapple with where public opinion is right now, and that we need all of the Allies that we can get. Because if you again, Seth voted in against the bans, if we are going to defend some of the basic fundamental rights of trans people, we are going to need those individuals in our coalition. If you have to be perfect on every trans rights issue, for us to say you can be an ally and part of our coalition, then we’re going to have a cap of about 30 percent on our coalition. If we are going to have percent plus 1, or frankly, more necessarily 60 percent or more in support of nondiscrimination protections for trans people, in support of our ability to get the health care that we need. By definition, it will have to include a portion of the 70 percent who oppose trans people’s participation in sports. And right now, the message from so many is you don’t you’re not welcome. You and your support for 90 percent of these policies is irrelevant. The fact that you diverge on one thing makes you evil. And it also misunderstands the history of civil rights in this country. I mean, you can’t compromise on civil rights is a great tweet. But tell me which civil Rights Act delivered all progress and all civil rights for people of color in this country. The civil Rights Act of 1957, the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Civil Rights Act of 1968, or any of the Civil Rights Acts that have been passed since the 1960s. That movement was disciplined. It was strategic. It picked its battles, it picked its fights, and it compromised to move the ball forward. And right now, that compromise would be deemed unprincipled, weak and throwing everyone under the bus. And that is so counterproductive. It is so harmful. And it completely betrays the lessons of every single social movement and civil rights movement in our country’s history. And we have an example of a very successful social movement in recent history with marriage equality. Where would we have been in 2007 and 2008, if not only we had not tolerated the fact that Barack Obama was ostensibly not for marriage equality then, but if we had said to voters if you’re not comfortable, even if you vote against the marriage ban, but aren’t quite comfortable with marriage yet, that you’re a bigot and you don’t belong in our coalition, where would that movement have had been. The most effective messengers were the people who had evolved themselves. We had grace personified in that movement, and it worked beyond even the advocate’s wildest expectations in terms of the speed of both legal progress and cultural progress, because we created incentives for people to grow. We created space for people to grow, And we allowed people into our tent, into that conversation who weren’t already with us. You mentioned the period in 2008 when Barack Obama was running for president, and at the very least, his public position. Many of us suspected it was not his private position, but his public position was that he opposed gay marriage. That was the mainstream position at that point in the Democratic Party. And there was a compromise position they all supported, which was civil unions. Is there an analogy to the Civil unions debate or position for you now. I think on the sports conversation, it’s local control. It’s allowing for individual athletic associations to make those individual determinations. And in some cases, they’ll have policies that strike a right balance. In some cases, they’ll have policies that are too restrictive. And I think that is the equivalent to the Civil unions position in that debate by allowing for Democratic voters, independent voters, hell, even some elected officials to take that civil unions position, one that met voters where they were, it gave some of our politicians who needed it an off ramp, so that they didn’t have to choose between being all on or all off. And it allowed that conversation to continue and prevented more harm from being inflicted on to pick up on the polling. So there’s this YouGov polling from January that looked at all these different issues, and there are a lot of issues around trans rights that actually poll great. Yes so protection from trans people against hate crimes plus 36 net approval banning employers from firing trans people because of their identity. Plus 33 allowing transgender people to serve in the military, which Donald Trump is trying to rescind. Plus 22, requiring all new public buildings to include gender neutral bathrooms. This surprised me. Plus seven. Then there’s the other side. Everybody knows that the sports issue is tough in the polling, but banning people under 18 from attending drag shows, that’s popular. Banning youth from accessing puberty blockers and hormones. That’s very popular. Banning public schools from teaching lessons on transgender issues. That’s popular requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that match their biological sex that is popular. When you look at these lists of issues, what do you see as dividing them. What cuts the issues that you could win on now from those that have heavy disapproval. Well, I think that there’s very clearly a distinction that the public makes between young people and adults. I think that there is a distinction that is made in many cases when it comes to what people feel like is government support of or funding of versus. Just allowing trans people to live their lives, allowing trans troops who are qualified to continue to serve, allowing trans people who are doing great jobs in their workplace to continue to work. It all goes back to this notion of get government out. Let people live their lives and let families and individuals make the best decisions for themselves. And I think that should be through line of our perspective. A libertarian approach to allowing trans people to live fully and freely, that there are some complicated questions, but that those questions shouldn’t be answered by politicians who are trying to exploit those issues for political gain. I was struck by your use of the word libertarian there, because when I look at this polling, what I see is something quite similar, which is Americans by and large aren’t cruel, and their view here is pretty live and let live. Yes, they have different views which we can talk about in a minute on minors. But where the question is the government coming in and bothering you. You being any trans person, they don’t really want that. What they don’t want to do is change their lives or think something is changing for them in their society. And maybe those two things are not in all ways possible. Certainly over the long term. But there are a lot of places where they are possible. It seems to me that in 2024 and over the last couple of years, what Republicans did very well, their approach to persuasion was to pick the right wedge issues. And you would think that the entire debate over trans policy in America was about NCAA swimmers this was the biggest problem facing trans people, the biggest problem in some ways facing the country. When it’s a pretty edge case issue and questions like nondiscrimination and access to health care are much more widespread. But what they did was they used their wedge issue and they’re now attacking those majority positions. Trump is attacking discrimination. He wants people discriminated against. He doesn’t want trans people to be able to put the identity they hold and present as on their passports. It’s not a huge winning issue for him. And so there’s this question of picking the right wedge issues. Is there a wedge issue for you that you wish Democrats would pick. Well, listen, I think that we do much better when we keep the main thing the main thing. Defending Medicaid in this moment is the main thing for everybody, for everyone, for everyone. And look, I think abortion to some degree had been a wedge issue that was to the Democrats’ advantage, not to the Republicans’ advantage. But I think we have to reorient the public’s perception of what our priorities are as a party. And I think when we lean into the culture wars and lean into culture war wedge issues, even if they benefit us, they reinforce a perception that the Democratic Party is unconcerned with the economic needs of the American people. When you ask a voter, what are the top five priorities of the Democratic Party. What are the top five priorities of the Republican Party, and what are the top five priorities for them as a voter. Three out of the five issues that are the top issue for that voter appear in what their perception of the top five issues for the Republican Party, only one of their top five priorities, appear in their perception of what are the top five priorities for the Democrats. That’s health. And it was fifth out of five. The top two were abortion and LGBTQ issues. And I don’t care what your position is on those two issues, you are not going to win an election. If voters think that those two issues are your top issues, rather than their ability to get a good wage and good benefits, get a house and live the American dream. And I think we have to in this moment, reinforce what is our actual priority as a party, which is making sure that everyone can pursue the American dream, which has become increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible, that everyone should be able to get the health care they need be able to buy a home, be able to send their child to child care without breaking the bank if they can even get a spot. That needs to be our focus, and I think when we have this purity politics approach to LGBTQ issues or abortion, what we communicate, even if we’re not talking about those issues, is we communicate. Those are threshold issues. And therefore the voter reads that as those are priority issues. And the only way to convince the voter that those are not our priority issues, that’s not what we’re spending our capital and time on, but rather giving them health care and housing is to make it abundantly clear to people that our tent can include diversity of thought on those issues. Something that I notice in the broad coalition of groups and people and funders who identify as or support Democrats is that they all want the issue they care most about to be the issue that gets talked about the most people who fund anything from climate to trans rights, to all kinds of the hotter issues in American life. You could actually imagine a strategy where those groups and that money went to making every election about Medicaid, because Medicaid is just a killer issue for Democrats. And then the people who get elected are better on those other issues, too. But it doesn’t that money, those groups that are organizing what they often want Democrats to do is publicly take unpopular positions on their issues. I think all the time about the ACLU questionnaire that asked candidates and in this case, Kamala Harris. Whether she would support the government paying for gender reassignment surgery for illegal immigrants in prison. Even if your whole position in life is, your point is to make that possible. The last thing you would want is for anybody to claim it out in public. You would want nobody to ever think about that question ever at all. And it’s something I’ve heard Democrats talking about more after the election. Just rethinking on some level, this question of, is the point of all this organizing to get politicians to commit to the most maximalist version of your issue set. Or is the point of this organizing to somehow figure out how to win Senate seats in Missouri and Kansas. So you have very, very, very moderate Democrats who nevertheless make Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader rather than John Thune. I think that there is an incentive from money and from social media, and those also go hand in hand, sometimes with grassroots donations that incentivize the groups to want to show their influence and their effect by having politicians fight the fights that they want them to fight in ways that feel viscerally comforting to their own community that they’re representing. And look, I get that, I understand that. One, we have to be better as elected officials in saying no and saying public opinion is everything. And if you want us to change, you need to help foster the change in public opinion before you’re asking these elected officials to betray the fact that they are, at the end of the day, representatives that have to represent, in some form or fashion, the views of the people that they represent. Like at some point you will represent the people’s positions or they will find someone else who will. And so it is just an unsustainable dynamic for the groups to continue to ask elected officials to take these maximalist positions to ignore where their voters are. They have to do the hard work of persuasion. And there can be there’s always going to be a tension between the groups and elected officials. Everyone has to do their own job, but there has to be some degree of understanding. How do you hold that tension. I always think this is such an interesting question for politicians to work with, because there is the internal and the external push to authenticity. Yeah we don’t want these poll tested politicians. Yeah and it’s also your job to represent. Yes on know she’s personal to you on issues not as personal to you. How do you think about balancing. They elected you versus are their servant. Yeah look, all of these decisions inevitably require a balancing of my own views, my own principles and the views of the people that I represent. But I think one thing you always have to do is you have to go, O.K, here’s an issue that I feel very strongly about. I vote against this. What are the second, third, and fourth order consequences of voting against or voting in favor. You might abstractly agree with something as an ideal, but if you were to pursue that or implement that policy, it would have, in the medium to long term, a regressive effect, because there’s a backlash to pushing too hard or taking too maximalist of a position by the mainstream in our politics. One of the problems we’ve had is that we have said, not only you have to vote the way we want you to vote, but then you have to speak the way we want you to speak. And I always have said, even when I was an advocate, if we can, if we can get the policy vote that we want and the compromise we are accepting is essentially a rhetorical compromise that is a pretty darn good deal. And again, I think we have to be willing to have these conversations out in the open. We have to recognize that there’s complexity, there’s nuance, and that means not just in the policy space but in the political space. And that’s authentic to say, these are some really difficult conversations. And sometimes I’m going to get it right and sometimes I’m going to get it wrong, and sometimes I’m voting exclusively with what I think is the right thing to do, even if my voters disagree. But also sometimes I’m going to have to take a balanced view of this. And that’s democracy. I want to pick up on speech. It’s true on trans and gender issues. It’s also true on a bunch of other issues in the past couple of years that a huge number of the fights that ended up defining the issue were not about legislation, they were about speech. I’ve always myself thought this reflects social media, but I mean, the number of people who have talked to me about the term birthing persons, which I think virtually nobody has used or Latinx was a big one like this. There is in general, this extreme weighting of can you push changes of speech onto the people who agree with you and possibly onto society as a whole, and that the strategy worked backwards from the speech outcome, not the legislative outcome. How do you think about that weighting of speech versus votes. I think look, there is no question in my mind that the vote is much more important than the rhetoric that they use. We have discoursed our way into, if you talk about this issue in a way that’s suboptimal from my perspective, you’re actually laying the foundation for oppression and persecution. And I just think maybe academically that’s true, but welcome to the real world. Like, we are prioritizing the wrong thing. It’s an element of virtue signaling. Like I’m showing. I’m showing that I am the most radical. I’m the most progressive on this issue, because I’m going to take this person who does everything right substantively and crucify this person for not being perfect in language. It’s a way of demonstrating that you’re in the in-group, that you understand the language, that you understand the mores and the values of that group. And it’s a way of building capital and credibility with that in-group. I think that’s what it is. And I just think it’s inherently exclusionary. And I think that that’s part of the thing that’s wrong with our politics right now, which is that all of our politics feels so exclusionary. The coalition that wins the argument about who is most welcoming will be the coalition that wins our politics. I think that’s such an interesting point, and I think probably true. I’d also be curious for your thoughts on this. I think there’s a very interesting way that speech and its political power confuse people, because it’s two things at once. It’s extremely low cost and extremely high cost. So pronouns, for instance, I think are correctly it’s a very, very easy thing. And basically, if you won’t use somebody’s preferred pronouns, I think you’re an asshole. That’s my personal view of it. But having trying to execute a speech change where everybody lists their pronouns in their bio, where every meeting begins with people going around the circle and saying their name and their pronouns. That feels very different to people. It seems small. I mean, you don’t have to pay anything out of pocket. You don’t have to go anywhere. And yet the language we use is very, very important to us. Yeah I think you’re absolutely right. There And I think the thing with pronouns, too, is a prime example of where we’ve lost grace, though. Me calling people assholes, it’s not graceful. Well, no. No, I think there is a difference between someone who’s intentionally misgendering someone. So people who make mistakes. And I think that there has been, whether warranted or not, the perception that people are going to be shamed if they make mistakes. But then I think you’re absolutely right, too, that there is a distinction between treating me the way I want to be treated and everyone changing their behavior and requiring this, again, in-group language that exceeds just calling the person in front of you what they want to be called. And I think it gets to something we were talking about earlier, which is a way that there are two pieces to the politics of this. One is fairly popular, at least for now, and the other is a much tougher lift, which is I think most people have that basic sense of politeness. If you want to be referred to in a certain way, Yes, I might slip up. But if I’m being a decent person, I’m going to try. Yeah versus the move around pronouns to the move for calling, things cisgender. That was a much bigger effort than in some ways, wasn’t described as such. And I feel like there’s been a dimension of the politics here, where things that were very academic arguments became political arguments, and then people were a little bit unclear on what political what the political win would be to destabilize the fundamental gender binary that people understand is operating is touching something very deep in society versus treating other people with respect and courtesy and decency and grace. Yeah is a much is a much easier sell. And I think it’s O.K to want to do the former. But I think people kept mixing up which their actual project was at the end of the day. The thing that we lost is that we’re just talking about people trying to live their lives, trying to live the best lives they can. We got into this rabbit hole of academic intellectual discourse that doesn’t actually matter in people’s lives. We got into this performative fighting to show our bona fides to our own in-group, and we lost the fundamental truth that all of those things are only even possible once you’ve done the basic legwork of allowing people to see trans people as people, when you allow trans people to be seen as human beings who have the same hopes and dreams and fears as everyone else. Once that basic conception of humanity exists, then all the other things, all the other conversations, fall into place. Language inevitably changes across society, across cultures, across time, but it is a byproduct of cultural change. And I just think we started to have what maybe were conversations that were happening in academic institutions or conversations that were happening in the community, and we started having those out in public on social media. And then demand that everyone else has that conversation with us, and then incorporates what the dominant position is in that conversation, in the way they live their lives. And it’s just like, that’s not how this happens. Let’s just talk about human beings who want you to live by the Golden rule. Let’s just talk about the fact that trans people are people who can be service members and doctors and lawyers and educators and elected officials and do a damn good job in that. That is the gateway to everything else. And it has always been in every social movement, the place where it is complicated and the place where not just the politics, but I think the answers are complicated, is around children. And we talked about the NCAA swimmers and the edge case nature of that. But schools are broader, and a lot of what the Trump administration is doing, a lot of what you see Republicans are doing in states is around schools and minors, and that’s tougher. Parents want to know what their kids are doing. On the one hand if you’re a kid with gender dysphoria and taking puberty blockers early matters. On the other hand, there are a lot of things parents don’t let their kids do young because they’re not sure what they’re going to want in a couple of years. How do you think about that set of issues. The leave them alone makes a lot of sense for adults, but we don’t leave kids alone. Kids exist in a paternalist system where their parents have power over them, their schools have power over them. And so the question of policy there becomes very profound. Yeah, I think first off, in that instance, we acknowledge the and rightfully acknowledge the important role that parents play in decisions for their children. Look, you can recognize that there’s nuance here. You can say that there need to be stronger standards of care, that maybe things got too lenient. But ultimately, politicians aren’t the people who should be making these decisions. The family should be making these decisions. The family, in consultation with a doctor, should be making these decisions. And I think that is a fair balance in recognizing the need for every child to get medical care and also the right of parents to make decisions, including health care decisions for their children. But you do see right now in some European countries, the government setting tighter standards, there have definitely been a lot of arguments about whether or not the research was good, whether or not the research was ideologically influenced. So there’s some government role here, some role for professional associations, some context in which families and doctors make these decisions. What is that role. Well, I think you just hit on that distinction, which is that in many European countries, the distinction between the health care system and the government is fuzzier in many cases. You have government operated hospitals here. You have health care systems. You have standards of care developed by providers in those medical associations, and that is where those decisions should be left up to in terms of establishing the standards of care. And then when applying those standards of care, allowing those the application, the practical application of those standards of care to happen between patients, families, and providers, because it’s fundamentally a different kind of system. I think the critique that the fear of the right that I hear that some of these same dynamics towards pushing out people who question the evidence towards there being things you can say and things you cannot say took hold, and that the results of that can’t be trusted, that everything you said is happening in politics is also happening in medicine and elsewhere. I think that we actually started to see a pretty difficult but important conversation within WPATH, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, about the standards of care for youth care before government started intervening, where they started having a conversation about how to adjust the standards of care, recognizing perhaps that they needed to tighten them. And that’s true across health. I mean, standards of care across different forms of care are constantly evolving. That conversation was starting to happen. You cannot tell me that it’s the role of the government to preempt those conversations. Those conversations should not be settled in legislative bodies by politicians who aren’t looking at the data, I don’t understand the data, and certainly aren’t objectively interpreting the data. And look, I think all of this changes, though the conversation changes, I should say, when people understand what it means to be trans, because I think right now we think of it as a choice. We think of it as an intellectual decision, right. Like, I want to be a girl. I want to be a boy, and I want to do this because of these rewards, or I don’t want to do it because of these risks. That’s not what gender identity is. It is much more innate. It is a visceral feeling. It’s not the same as whether you get a tattoo or what you have for dinner. It’s not a decision. It’s a fact about who you are. And I think the challenge in the conversation around gender identity that differs from sexual orientation is that most people who are straight can understand what it feels like to love and to lust, and so they’re able to enter into conversations around sexual orientation with an analogous experience. And the challenge in the conversation around gender identity is that people who aren’t trans don’t know what it feels like to have a gender identity that differs from your sex assigned at birth. For me, the closest thing that I can compare it to was a constant feeling of homesickness, just an unwavering ache in the pit of my stomach that would only go away when I could be seen and affirmed as myself. And I think that because we stopped having that conversation, because we stopped creating space for people to ask questions for people’s understandable, perhaps invasive, but understandable curiosity to be met with an openness and a grace not by everyone, but just the people who were willing to do it. We stopped people having an understanding of what it means to be trans, and it allowed them to start to see it, or it allowed for their pre-existing perception that this is some intellectual choice to manifest. And in some cases, the perfect quote discourse started to reinforce that. See how that we started to get to this place where you couldn’t be like, I’m born this way that we policed the way even LGBTQ people or trans people talked about their own identities to be this perfect academic. Why can’t you say I’m born this way. Because it was. I’m not. No, no, I’m not saying you’re saying it, but I this is AI think there was been aware of there was an academic perception of like people have different people should have agency over their sexual orientation and gender identity, even if it’s not innate, and that there was this acceptance of a mainstream perception of sexual orientation and gender identity that was a one size fits all narrative around LGBTQ people. That didn’t necessarily include people whose understanding was more fluid, or their understanding evolved over time, or for whom they feel like they want to transgress gender norms because of a reason that’s not this innate sense of gender. And I think when you take that capacity for us to authentically talk about our experience away from us, because it’s not academically the purest that creates space and room for every single different lived experience within that umbrella. You give people justification to say or think this is a choice, and if it’s a choice, the threshold to allow for discrimination becomes lower. I’ve known a number of people who’ve transitioned as adults, and it’s always the degree to which most of us avoid doing anything that would cause us any social discomfort at all times is so found how much we live our lives trying to not make anybody look at us for too long that it’s always struck me as it. It must be such a profound need to make that decision to come to your family, to your wife or your husband, to your kids, to your parents. And so this the right wing meme that emerged around it that people are transitioning because they opportunistically want to be in another bathroom. Yeah or another locker room or get some kind of cultural affirmative action. Always struck me as not just absurd, but deeply unempathic not thinking for a moment what it must mean to want that much. And so then it’s interesting to hear you say that there was almost like a pincer movement on that because it hasn’t struck me as a thing, people. I mean, I’m sure there is agency and people make decisions here, but the pull from inside of everybody I’ve known is really profound. Usually they’ve been trying to choose the other way for a long time and eventually just can’t anymore. That’s exactly what my experience was. I mean, it’s funny because sometimes there’s discourse that I the only reason why I’m an elected official is because I’m trans. Like, I see on the right this notion that I’m a diversity hire. I was like, well, voters, voters chose me. It’s kind of an insult to voters that they didn’t choose me because they think that I’m the best qualified or the best candidate or reflective of what they want, but they just chose me because of my identity. But it also just undersells such a larger truth, which is that my life would be so much easier if I wasn’t trans. Now I’m proud of who I am. I’m proud that this is my life experience for a whole host of reasons. But this is all a lot harder because I’m trans. Are there moments where I get a microphone or am I sitting here. If I was a non-trans freshman Democrat, would I be sitting here. Maybe not. Maybe I would maybe not. We probably would be having a different conversation. But navigating this world as a trans person has always been an even more so. Now it’s incredibly hard, and all any of us are asking, or at least all that most of us are asking, is to just let us live the best life we can. A life with as few regrets as possible. A life where we can be constructive, productive, contributing members of society. You might not understand us. It is hard to step into the shoes of someone who is trans, and to understand what that might feel like. But I spent 21 years of my life praying that this would go away, and the only way that I was finally able to accept it was one realizing this was never going to go away. Two becoming so consumed by it that it was the only thing I ever really was able to think about because the pain became too all encompassing. And 3, the only way I was able to come out was because I was able to accept that I was losing any future. I had to go through stages of grief, and the only way I was able to come out was to finally get to that stage of acceptance over a loss of any future. It’s really scary and it’s really hard. And right now, it is particularly scary and hard. And I think to your point earlier, most people are good people and they just want to treat other people with respect and kindness. But unfortunately, in this moment, in our politics, we were recently at something where someone gave us some information. And they said that when a voter was asked to describe the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, it was crazy for the Republican Party and preachy for the Democratic Party. I think that undersells something that’s more true, which is that a voter will look and say the Republican Party are assholes to other people. I don’t like that. But the Democratic Party is an asshole to me. And if I have to choose between the party, that’s an asshole to me because I’m not perfect or a party that’s an asshole to someone else. Even if I don’t like it, I’m going to choose the party that’s an asshole to someone else. When you entered Congress, you were quite directly targeted by some of your Republican colleagues, led by Nancy Mace, on which bathrooms you could use, a thing that would not have happened if you were not a trans legislator. And this is the majority party in the House. You have to work with these people. You’re on committees with them. What has your experience been like. Both absorbing that and then trying to work with people who may or may not have given you much grace in that moment. Well, the first thing I’d say is that the folks who were or are targeting me because of my gender identity in Congress, those are folks who at this point are really not really working with any Democrats and can barely work with their own Republican colleagues. I’ve introduced several bills. Almost all have been bipartisan. I’ve been developing relationships with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Part of my responsibility in this moment is to show that when someone likes me me, gets elected to public office, we can do the whole job. And that means working with people who disagree with me, including on issues that are deeply personal. The folks who are coming after me. I mean, look, that’s been hard, but I know that they’re coming after me not because they are deeply passionate about bathroom policy. They’re coming after me because they are employing the strategies of reality TV. And the best way to get attention in a body of 435 people is to throw wine in someone’s face. That gets you a little attention. But if that person that you’re throwing wine in their face, if they respond by throwing wine in your face, it creates a beef which gets you a season long story arc. I knew that they were trying to bait me into a fight to get attention, and I refused to be used as a political pawn. I refuse to give them not only the power of derailing me, but the incentive to continue to come after me. And this is I think this was a prime example. This was a prime example of how to fight smart, that is demonized on our own side. Because the grace that I didn’t get, it wasn’t just on the right. There was a lot of critique on the left. And I understand when you’re a first, people viscerally feel your highs and they also viscerally feel your lows. But what would me fighting back in that moment have done. It wouldn’t have stopped the ban, and it would only have incentivized further attacks and continued behavior like that. And sometimes we have to understand that not fighting, not taking the bait, that’s not a sign of weakness. It’s not unprincipled. Discipline and strategy are signs of strength. And I think in the social media world, we have lulled ourselves into thinking the only way to fight is to fight. It’s to scream, and it’s to yell, and it’s to do it on every instance. And any time you don’t do it, you’re normalizing the behavior that’s coming your way, which is both a ridiculously unfair burden to place on every single human being to have to fight every single indignity. But by that logic, the young Black students who were walking in to a school that was being integrated in the late 50s and 60s, who were walking forward calmly and with dignity and grace into that school as people screamed slurs at them. By that definition, that student was normalizing those slurs by not responding. Instead, what that student was doing was providing the public with a very clear visual, a very clear contrast between unhinged hatred and basic dignity and grace, which is fundamental to humanity. And I think for me, one of the things that I struggled with after that was the lack of grace that I got from some in my own community who said that I was reinforcing that the behavior of the people who were coming after me, that I was not responding appropriately to the bullying that I was facing when the reality is that behavior has diminished significantly because I removed the incentive for them to continue to do it, because the incentive was so blatantly about attention, and I wasn’t going to let them get the attention that they wanted. You remind me of something I heard Barack Obama say many, many years ago when he was getting criticized for trying to negotiate, trying to reach out to people who by that point, many, many on the left thought he was naive for trying to work with. And he said something like that. He had always felt that the American people could see better if the other side had clenched their fist, if he opened his hand. I thought there was a lot of wisdom in that. Yes, absolutely. I early on in those first few weeks, I had some folks text me as I was responding the way that I was. And they said, you should watch 42, which is the movie about Jackie Robinson. And I am not comparing my experience to Jackie Robinson at all. At all. But there’s a scene in that movie that’s so, I think illustrative of these dynamics, which is he’s meeting with the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Says it’s trying to provoke him into anger. And when he succeeds, the owner says to him, basicall","summary":"Representative Sarah McBride reckons with the trans rights movement’s shortcomings, and how to win hearts and minds through a politics of grace.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-sarah-mcbride.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/17/opinion/17eks-mcbride-image/17eks-mcbride-image-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 09:03:23","author":"Ezra Klein","authors":["Ezra Klein"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.139}]}
