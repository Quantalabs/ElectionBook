Despite Trump’s remarks, the officials were firm in their opposition.\n\nThe Republican president made this comment in a social media post, once again demonstrating his tendency to call for legal action against his Democratic adversaries—a significant deviation from the traditional practice of the Justice Department, which typically maintains its independence from presidential influence.\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” This referred to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Trump was objecting to. \n\nResponding on X, Johnson noted, “This is not the first instance of Trump attempting to unjustly incarcerate a Black man. I’m not going anywhere.” Pritzker, also responding on X, asserted, “I won’t step back. Trump is now pushing for the arrest of elected officials counterbalancing his authority. What’s left on the road to total authoritarianism?”\n\nAbigail Jackson, spokeswoman for the White House, was questioned about the specific crimes Trump believed Pritzker and Johnson had committed, but she did not specify any. However, she accused them of having “blood on their hands,” citing Chicago Police Department data that showed at least five people were killed and 25 shot over the weekend.\n\nJackson further commented, “Instead of acting to curb the crime, these Trump-Deranged individuals prefer to let the violence persist while criticizing the President for trying to make their city safe again.”\n\nNational Guard troops from Texas are positioned outside Chicago, despite a lawsuit by the state and city to block the deployment.\n\nThe troops’ mission is not clear, but the Trump administration has undertaken an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.\n\nTrump has called Chicago a “hellhole,” though police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides. Protesters have skirmished with agents outside a detention center in the village of Broadview, outside Chicago. \n\nA woman in Chicago was shot by a Border Patrol agent over the weekend after she and a man were accused of using their vehicles to strike and then box in the agent’s vehicle. The agent then exited his car and fired five shots at Marimar Martinez, 30.\n\nMartinez and Anthony Ruiz, 21, are charged with forcibly assaulting a federal officer and were ordered to be released Monday pending trial. Martinez’s lawyer, Christopher Parente, claimed body camera footage contradicts the federal government’s narrative of her actions.\n\nTrump’s comment came as former FBI Director James Comey appeared in a Virginia courtroom, pleading not guilty in a case that has intensified concerns about the Justice Department’s efforts to target Trump adversaries.\n\nWhen Trump was campaigning for the White House in 2024 at a time he faced criminal and civil investigations, he told supporters, “I am your retribution.”\n\nThe Justice Department has also opened criminal investigations this year against California Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running for New York City mayor. The three, all Democrats, have all denied wrongdoing and say the investigations are politically motivated.\n\nPritzker, one of Trump’s fiercest critics, has called the president a “wannabe dictator,” comparing his leadership to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The governor has suggested that Trump, who has threatened Chicago with apocalyptic force, suffers from dementia.\n\nPritzker, eyed as a potential 2028 White House contender, has strongly fought any federal intervention along with Johnson, saying it is not wanted or needed in Illinois or Chicago.\n\n“Certainly there’s a lot more going on in the world than for him to send troops into Chicago,” Pritzker told The Associated Press in August during a visit to a South Side neighborhood where a campaign videographer was also in tow. “He ought to be focused on some of the bigger problems.”\n\nPritzker alleges that Trump is trying to militarize cities to affect the outcome of the 2026 election by impeding voting efforts in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.\n\nThe heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune is seeking a third term as governor next year and has sidestepped questions about higher ambitions. Pritzker was among the finalists considered as a running mate for Democratic Kamala Harris’ presidential run in 2024.\n\nTrump has often singled out Chicago and Illinois because they have some of the country’s strongest immigrant protections. Both are “sanctuary” jurisdictions, which limit cooperation between police and federal immigration agents.\n\nJohnson, a first-term mayor, has strengthened those protections with executive orders, including one that bars immigration agents from using city-owned land as staging areas for operations. He calls Trump’s actions unconstitutional.\n\nJohnson has accused Trump of waging a war on Chicago and having an “animus” toward women and people of color. Nearly one-third of Chicago’s 2.7 million residents are Black and roughly one-third are Hispanic.\n\n“He’s a monster,” Johnson told reporters in May. “Period.”\n\nTareen reported from Chicago. Associated Press writer Christine Fernando in Chicago contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday stated that the Illinois&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Suggests Jail for Illinois Governor and Chicago Mayor Over Opposition to Guard Deployment first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-suggests-jail-for-illinois-governor-and-chicago-mayor-over-opposition-to-guard-deployment/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-says-Illinois-governor-and-Chicago-mayor-should-be-jailed.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 21:13:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":367484042,"title":"Creatives Benefit From ‘A Day Of Unreasonable Conversation,’ Which Included Remarks From Fromer Vice President Kamala Harris","text":"Napheesa Collier and Kamala Harris at \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\n“Reasonable people adapt to the world, the unreasonable ones persist in trying to adapt the world to themselves. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable people.”\n\nThis is a quote from George Bernard Shaw and served as the mantra for A Day of Unreasonable Conversation, held recently at The Getty Center in Los Angeles.\n\nThe event is an invitation-only gathering designed to equip culture makers, including television writers, producers, executives, artists, and digital storytellers, for the year ahead.\n\nThe gathering is intentionally non-partisan and solution-oriented, focusing on issues of broad public salience, such as public health, climate, education, and navigating disagreements between those with differing perspectives.\n\nNow in its fourth year, A Day of Unreasonable Conversation has become one of the entertainment industry’s most trusted convenings where Hollywood’s storytellers and public leaders meet to listen. This year’s convening featured more than 500 television creators and 150 top digital storytellers, alongside leaders in philanthropy, advocacy, and government.\n\nThe program was hosted by Atsuko Okatsuka and included conversations with Kerry Washington, Paul “Triple H”, Jay Shetty, W. Kamau Bell, Phil Rosenthal, Sara Gilbert, Terry Crews, Eddie Huang, Karine Jean-Pierre, Mara Brock Akil, Adam Kinzinger, Greg Berlanti, Todd Rose, Don Cheadle, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and more, plus performances by Ruby Ibarra and Linda Perry.\n\nEach segment of the event posed a question, such as “What If We’re Learning All the Wrong Lessons,” “What If No News Is Good News,” and “What If Hope is Not an Illusion” among them.\n\nThe day was capped off by a discussion entitled, “What If We Could Write the Next Chapter,” that featured a conversation about resilience between WNBA player and advocate Napheesa Collier and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nIn addressing the gathered creatives, Harris remarked that right now, “There is a powerful intention and force to divide the communities and the country, and make people feel alone. There is an agenda at play that is causing people to feel very disempowered. And my feeling, and I feel this very strongly, is you can never let anyone take your power from you. And this is a room full of extraordinary, creative people who are opinion leaders. You have a pen, you have a voice, you have a platform.”\n\nThe 49th Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, speaking at \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\nShe went on to say, “And you, as storytellers, are living this. You're not passive observers. You know that. You're living it, and I would ask you that all the emotions that we are feeling. Give those emotions, gift that experience, to those people that you are writing about and writing for.”\n\nLeaning a little forward in her chair, she said, “It gets back to my point about helping people, even if it doesn't change the circumstance. Because there's so much about this moment that is trying to make people feel like they've lost their mind. When, in fact, these motherfuckers are crazy,” which elicited a laugh from the crowd, which Harris joined.\n\nThe 2024 Presidential contender, in discussing losing the election, seemingly made a personal call to action to the audience, saying, “I said it at the end of every rally, ‘I believe when we fight we win.’ I believe that. Deeply,” however, she added, “Sometimes the fight takes a while.”\n\nKerry Washingon leading a discussion at \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation.\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\nOpening the day, Okatsuka said that organizers of the event genuinely hoped that participants would simply give consideration to opposing views and contemplate with the idea that, “Dang, I never thought of things that way.”\n\nRepeated throughout the day was the concept that the best way to change culture is through storytelling.\n\nThis was reiterated by Todd Rose, an American scientist and social entrepreneur, speaking about collective illusions, who said, “There’s no more powerful form of social proof on the planet than storytelling. Even when you know you’re watching fiction, your brain treats those character as your in-group.”\n\nHe points to the 1980’s series Cheers which introduced the concept of the Designated Driver simply using a background actor who simply said, ‘nothing for me, I’m the designated driver.’\n\n“By putting something like that in the background, it gives people permission by lowering the cost of courage,” explained Rose.\n\nBerlanti, a prolific writer/director of multiple TV shows and films, including Arrow, The Flash and The Green Lantern, among others, participated in the panel “What If We Can’t Have Heroes?”\n\nIn a perfect example of the theme of the day — that storytelling can not only inform but evoke strong feelings as well — Berlanti began his comments on the topic… by telling the opening of a story, that he concluded as the panel wrapped up.\n\nHe also remarked that, “Stories have a way of helping shape the world through the unconscious and not just through the intellect. One of the ways you can offer light with both your characters and your own actions, is just to create something that feels true and truthful.”\n\nGreg Berlanti, (center) with Anthony Breznican and Sharmen Obaid-Chinoy, discussing heroes during \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation.\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\nAfter coming off stage, he said that he participated in the day’s event because, “Anything that gets people talking about issues that they might be too intimidated to talk about is helpful, especially at this time. It’s very easy for a lot of individuals to just not take on hard topics and the more we can encourage people, especially writers and showrunners, to do that from multiple perspectives, the better it is for the audience.”\n\nBell, who hosted the documentary series United Shades of America for seven seasons, told the crowd during the “What If American Isn’t Divided – Just Exhausted” segment, “I’ve got bad news for you; it’s on you to stop fascism in America. I mean each and every one of you. But you’re like, ‘I’m not ready!’ You’re in entertainment, you know the hero is never ready! Luke Skywalker wasn’t ready, Harry Potter wasn’t ready, Jesus Christ wasn’t ready. Figure out how you can be better at your job as creators to get the message in the content that your bosses don’t want.”\n\nOf the many creatives in the audience taking in the panels, was Jenji Kohan, creator and showrunner of many series including Weeds and Orange is the New Black. She said that while she couldn’t pinpoint how she’d use the information presented that day in her creative endeavors going forward, everything she’d heard throughout was, “certainly food for thought.”\n\nA Day of Unreasonable Conversation is a program of Propper Daley | BPI in partnership with Invisible Hand, and presented by Imaginable Futures in partnership with Omidyar Network, Stand Together, and Imagine Entertainment, with additional support from New America, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Knight Foundation, Conrad N.

Their commentary has flooded social media in the days since the hunt began, prompting some to come to Swift’s defense and even more to campaign generally about the use of AI. Swift has yet to comment on the backlash, leaving fans to speculate about how the videos were made and whether they used CGI or AI.\nAccording to Ben Colman, CEO and cofounder of AI detection company Reality Defender, it seems “highly likely” some of the promo clips were AI-generated. He cited garbled and nonsensical text in some clips as one giveaway. Representatives for Swift and Google did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\nAI-generated media has become ubiquitous in entertainment and advertising, even as artists and fans scoff at its use. Just last month Pew Research Center published the results of a survey that found nearly half of respondents would like a painting less if they learned it was made by AI; younger adults were even more likely to respond negatively to AI-generated media.\nBy Monday, many of the Life of a Showgirl promo videos had seemingly disappeared from YouTube, and some of the X posts containing them were deleted (searches for “Taylor Swift AI” are also restricted on X as of this writing, a move that was implemented previously to stop the spread of nonconsensual sexually-explicit deepfakes of Swift).\nAs backlash over the videos spread, some Swift fans began sharing posts on X and TikTok using the hashtag #SwiftiesAgainstAI to voice their concerns and call on Swift to apologize if AI was used to make the videos. She has not publicly responded to the fan outcry.\n“I really would like for her to say something,” says Ellie Schnitt, a Swiftie with over 500,000 followers on X. Schnitt is a passionate defender of Swift who supported her new album all weekend, despite its lackluster critical reception. Schnitt considers a lot of the criticism aimed at Swift to be blown out of proportion, but if Swift were using AI, that would be where Schnitt draws a line.\n“Privating [the videos] is not enough,” Schnitt posted on Monday, tagging Swift and using the #SwiftiesAgainstAI hashtag. “You know firsthand the harm AI images can cause. You know better, so do better,” she continued. Schnitt tells WIRED that if Swift did use, or sign off on using, generative AI for the videos that move would seem at odds with the songwriter’s long, public campaign for artistic ownership and fair royalties. Swift has also struggled with her image being subjected to AI manipulation during political campaigns and in deepfake sexual exploitation.\nWhen endorsing Kamala Harris for president in an Instagram post last year, Swift specifically addressed AI-generated images and videos writing, “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.” In response to the album promos, one #SwifitesAgainstAI post revisited this statement and questioned whether Swift had been “lobotomized.”\nOther issues Swifties like Schnitt have with AI include the environmental impact from rapidly increasing demands for electricity and water, as well as the potential for AI to harm critical thinking skills.\n“We are very much losing this battle against common sense when it comes to using generative AI,” Schnitt says, adding that if the videos are AI and Swift apologizes for it, the move could be “a touchstone moment” in the pushback against the technology.\nLobo, who also made a post using the #SwiftiesAgainstAI hashtag, doesn’t think Swift will comment on the backlash. She does think the pop star, whether she used AI or not, will be wary of doing so in the future out of fear of angering her fans. As a contrast to the promos, Lobo’s X post highlighted Swift’s 2017 lyric video for the song “Look What You Made Me Do,” which was designed by a motion design studio. Lots of fans responded to Lobo’s post noting they missed the artistry and attention to detail in some of Swift’s earlier lyric videos.\n“Back then, when she wasn’t even as big as she is now, she was careful enough to hire someone to make something so beautifully and carefully done,” Lobo says. “I have a job that is threatened by AI, and AI just completely disregards the art and turns it into a product.”\nWhile it’s unclear what AI models, if any, were used to generate the promo videos, Reality Defender’s Colman says there are some models trained on non-copyrighted data and others that tread into more unethical territory. But mainstream AI products offered by companies like OpenAI and Google are currently battling to make training their models on copyrighted work legal under fair use, to the dismay of artists who are losing paid work to AI.\nColman says that current generative AI models and a “good prompt” could generate the kinds of images used in Swift’s promos in around two minutes. Many of these kinds of videos are made with diffusion AI models, which produce output comparable to Sora, OpenAI’s video app that has given users the ability to easily deepfake themselves.\nGoogle teased Swift’s scavenger hunt from its official Instagram account, although it’s unclear whether the promo videos that were part of the challenge were made with Google’s AI features. Earlier this year, Google started promoting a tool to convert photos into short, AI-generated videos. The latest iteration is called Veo 3. If the Swift teasers were supposed to entice her fans to use Google’s AI suite, the plan seems to have backfired. This demographic may actually be among the most vocal and least likely people to glom onto AI tools.\nMost of the people involved in the backlash are “huge fans,” Lobo says, they just “don’t want AI to infiltrate what we feel is a safe space.” As long as Swift stays silent, it will remain a question of whether it even did.","summary":"A scavenger hunt campaign to promote Taylor Swift’s new album The Life of a Showgirl resulted in a viral #SwiftiesAgainstAI campaign.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/taylor-swift-swifties-against-ai-viral/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e5828d8c3af7cdfe932788/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Taylor-Swift-AI-Promo-Culture-2239032475.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 20:53:21","author":"Kat Tenbarge","authors":["Kat Tenbarge"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.049},{"id":367491680,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: Liberal media darling under fire after viral interview","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics coverage.

He just compromised it all by putting out a product that attacks individuals who are just trying to make our streets safe.”\nBryan posted a live rendition of the song on July 12, following it with a snippet of a studio version on October 3. The lyrics describe an ICE raid, complete with apparent references to the construction jobs many undocumented workers hold:\n\nI heard the cops came\n\nCocky motherf–kers, ain’t they?\n\nAnd ICE is gonna come bust down your door\n\nTry to build a house no one builds no more, but I got a telephone\n\nThe kids are all scared and all alone\n\nThe bar stopped bumping, the rock stopped rolling\n\nThe middle finger’s rising and it won't stop showing\n\nGot some bad news, the fading of the red, white, and blue\n\nAccording to Google Trends, search interest was quiet for the early months of the song’s existence, before spiking dramatically on Monday. By Tuesday, the song’s lyrics were getting broader attention, perhaps thanks to Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs—who wrote about them on X, quoting a post from Pop Crave about Bryan’s song.\n“Stick to Pink Skies, dude,” McLaughlin wrote, a reference to a song off Bryan’s 2024 album The Great American Bar Scene.\nOn Tuesday night, Bryan responded to the recent attention, claiming in his Instagram Stories that the song was not a reaction to recent events. “I wrote this song months ago,” he said. “This shows you how divisive a narrative can be when shoved down our throats through social media. This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything.” He said that “hits on both sides of the aisle” would be apparent once the full song is released. “Left wing or right wing we’re all one bird and American,” he added. “To be clear I’m on neither of these radical sides.”\nBryan also broadened his comments to discuss the political climate in an era of “violence and heartbreak,” adding, “We need to find our way back. I served this country, I love this country and the song itself is about all of us coming out of this divided space. I wasn’t speaking as a politician or some greater-than-thou asshole, just a 29 year old man who is just as confused as everyone else.”\nThough mainstream country music has long been intertwined with Republican politics—particularly since the height of the War on Terror—the current generation of country stars has a much more ideologically mixed record than outsiders might think. Donald Trump has made overt overtures to Nashville, giving Jason Aldean a prime spot at the Republican National Convention and tapping Carrie Underwood to perform at his inauguration—but many stars prefer to follow the tried and true Dolly Parton strategy of promoting patriotism over partisanship. (As Chris Stapleton put it in an interview with The Guardian last year, “I’m voting for America and a good glass of whiskey.”) Others have been more vocally liberal, like Taylor Swift, who made waves in 2018 by coming out against Tennessee Republican senatorial candidate Marsha Blackburn and subsequently endorsing Democratic presidential candidates. Kacey Musgraves, Jason Isbell, and Maren Morris all endorsed Kamala Harris last year as well.\nBryan is a grassroots phenomenon who got popular through unconventional channels, becoming a streaming juggernaut before he signed a major-label record deal. He decisively entered the mainstream in September 2023, when he got his first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and has proved himself hard to pin down politically. He writes songs about struggling Americans and, as a native of small-town Oklahoma, has a distinct red-state pedigree. At the same time, he’s a close friend of high-profile Democrat Bruce Springsteen—and in 2022, he told the New York Times that he didn’t like when his fans broke out into anti-Joe Biden chants. (In the same interview, Bryan described himself as a “total libertarian.”)\nIn his Tuesday statement, Bryan spoke about the difficulty of living in the public eye. “The last few months of my life I’ve been scrutinized by more people than I ever thought possible,” he said. “I feel like I’ve tried my hardest in so many ways, and it’s so hard to see where my bearings even are anymore. Been falling off a cliff while trying to grow wings at the same time.”","summary":"“Left wing or right wing, we’re all one bird and American,” the singer said on Instagram, after DHS head Kristi Noem complained about his lyrics.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/zach-bryan-opens-up-about-controversial-ice-song-im-on-neither-of-these-radical-sides","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68e6c0a57e626bb128cf5b48/16:9/w_3600,h_2025,c_limit/2226396445","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 20:00:26","author":"Erin Vanderhoof","authors":["Erin Vanderhoof"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.221},{"id":367473192,"title":"Trump says Illinois governor and Chicago mayor should be jailed as they oppose Guard deployment","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, both Democrats, should be jailed as they oppose his deployment of National Guard troops for his immigration and crime crackdown in the nation’s third-largest city. The officials said they would not be deterred.\n\nThe Republican president made the comment in a social media post, the latest example of his brazen calls for his opponents to be prosecuted or locked up — a break from longtime norms as the Justice Department traditionally has strived to maintain its independence from the White House.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social that Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” It was a reference to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Trump was objecting to.\n\nJohnson, in a post on X, said, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested. I’m not going anywhere.” Pritzker, also on X, said” I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, when asked what crimes the president believed Pritzker and Johnson had committed, failed to identify any, but she said they “have blood on their hands” and pointed to Chicago Police Department reports that at least five people were killed and 25 shot over the weekend.\n\n“Instead of taking action to stop the crime, these Trump-Deranged buffoons would rather allow the violence to continue and attack the President for wanting to help make their city safe again,” Jackson said.\n\nNational Guard troops from Texas are positioned outside Chicago despite a lawsuit by the state and city to block the deployment.\n\nThe troops’ mission is not clear but the Trump administration has undertaken an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.\n\nTrump has called Chicago a “hell hole” of crime, even though police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides. Protesters have skirmished with agents outside a detention center in the village of Broadview, outside Chicago.\n\nA woman in Chicago was shot by a Border Patrol agent over the weekend after she and a man were accused of using their vehicles to strike and then box in the agent’s vehicle. The agent then exited his car and fired five shots at Marimar Martinez, 30.\n\nMartinez and Anthony Ruiz, 21, are charged with forcibly assaulting a federal officer and were ordered to be released Monday pending trial. Martinez’s lawyer, Christopher Parente, claimed body camera footage contradicts the federal government’s narrative of her actions.\n\nTrump’s comment came as former FBI Director James Comey appeared in a Virginia courtroom, pleading not guilty in a case that has intensified concerns about Justice Department’s efforts to target Trump adversaries.\n\nWhen Trump was campaigning for the White House in 2024 at a time he faced criminal and civil investigations, he told supporters, “I am your retribution.”\n\nThe Justice Department has also opened criminal investigations this year against California Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running for New York City mayor. The three, all Democrats, have all denied wrongdoing and say the investigations are politically motivated.\n\nPritzker, one of Trump’s fiercest critics, has called the president a “wannabe dictator,” comparing his leadership to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin and joking that the Republican “doesn’t read” anything. The governor has suggested that Trump, who has threatened Chicago with apocalyptic force, suffers from dementia.\n\nPritzker, eyed as a potential 2028 White House contender, has strongly fought against any federal intervention along with Johnson, saying it is not wanted or needed in Illinois or Chicago.\n\n“Certainly there’s a lot more going on in the world than for him to send troops into Chicago,” Pritzker told The Associated Press in August during a visit to a South Side neighborhood where a campaign videographer was also in tow. “He ought to be focused on some of the bigger problems.”\n\nPritzker alleges that Trump is trying to militarize cities to affect the outcome of the 2026 election by impeding voting efforts in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.\n\nThe heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune is seeking a third term as governor next year and has sidestepped questions about higher ambitions. Pritzker was among the finalists considered as a running mate for Democratic Kamala Harris’ presidential run in 2024.\n\nTrump has often singled out Chicago and Illinois because they have some of the country’s strongest immigrant protections. Both are “sanctuary” jurisdictions, which limit cooperation between police and federal immigration agents.\n\nJohnson, a first-term mayor, has strengthened those protections even further with executive orders, including one that bars immigration agents from using city-owned land as staging areas for operations. He calls Trump’s actions unconstitutional.\n\nJohnson has accused Trump of waging a war on Chicago and having an “animus” toward women and people of color. Nearly one-third of Chicago’s 2.7 million are Black and roughly one-third are Hispanic.\n\n“He’s a monster,” Johnson told reporters in May. “Period.”\n\nTareen reported from Chicago.

Meet the largest individual donor to Virginia's disgraced Dem AG nominee","text":"FIRST ON FOX: The largest individual donor to Jay Jones’ flailing attorney general campaign in Virginia is a billionaire heiress who has backed a variety of left-wing candidates and causes along with a recent massive donation backing socialist NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Elizabeth \"Liz\" Simons, the daughter of the late billionaire hedge fund manager James \"Jim\" Simons, donated a total of $750,000 to Jones’ campaign over the past few months in four separate payments, campaign finance records show. The elder Simons founded the successful hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and built up a personal fortune worth $31.4 billion over the course of his lifetime while donating billions of that money to charity. The donations from his daughter are likely to face increased scrutiny after Jones was the subject of a National Review report on Friday that exposed text messages he sent fantasizing about shooting a Republican colleague, former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert, in the head and suggesting his wife should have to watch his young \"fascist\" children die. DEM SENATOR'S HEFTY DONATION TO DISGRACED AG CANDIDATE'S CAMPAIGN COMES BACK TO HAUNT HIM The texts compared Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head. The report has prompted Republicans in Virginia and across the country to call for Jones to drop out of the race, but as of Wednesday afternoon, he is still in the race as Democrats who endorsed him rally around his candidacy. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, who condemned the texts, said he is \"still a supporter\" of his campaign. Fox News Digital reported on Tuesday that Mark Warner, the other Democratic senator in Virginia, also criticized Jones' \"appalling\" texts and said his behavior was \"inconsistent with the person I’ve known,\" but stopped short of calling for him to drop out of the race. His office did not respond to a request for comment on the $25,000 donation to Jones' campaign. Jones has since apologized, calling the remarks \"embarrassing and shameful,\" and said he had reached out personally to Gilbert and his family. GUN CONTROL GROUP GAVE SIX-FIGURE DONATION TO DEM CANDIDATE WHO FANTASIZED ABOUT SHOOTING GOP LAWMAKER In August, Simons, gave $250,000 to a super PAC aligned with Mamdani and has been a prolific donor to a variety of Democratic campaigns and causes. FEC records reviewed by Fox News Digital show that she has given millions of dollars to the Senate Majority PAC, which has close ties to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the House Majority PAC, a fundraising operation aligned with House Democratic leadership. She also gave over $800,000 to a PAC that supported Kamala Harris' failed presidential campaign. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Simons, who joined her husband in forming the Heising-Simons Foundation in 2007 to bankroll left-wing environmentalist, education, and social policy causes, has recently made donations to Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff's campaign, over $100,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and over $40,000 to the Democratic National Committee. Her family foundation is also a member of at least two gun control advocacy organizations, including Fund for a Safer Future and Hope and Heal Fund, which are both controlled by the New Venture Fund, according to the Capital Research Center's InfluenceWatch.

Kelly predicted on the podcast that Reid’s independent podcast would ultimately be unsuccessful because of her toxicity. (RELATED: Joy Reid: GOP Is Upset Because DOJ Dared ‘To Investigate Conservatives’) \n\n“Joy Reid is an insane lunatic who’s truly, honestly, extremely racist. She’s never seen a white person who she likes. The only people who have a possibility of being liked by Joy Reid, if they’re white, are people who will openly subjugate themselves to her,” Kelly said. “Tell her how smart she is.

You would get monsters. You would get demons you don’t even want at Thanksgiving. But we’re raising an America that is mediocre on purpose because we don’t want to tell Donald Trump that he is a fucking failure.

About what the Democrats really wanted to do to Trump if Kamala Harris had won last year’s presidential race.\n\nShe lost, in a landslide, with Trump capturing every swing state, the Electoral College by a huge margin, and the popular vote.\n\nBut the recent disclosure that anti-Trump special counsel Jack Smith, who was tasked by Democrats with running part of their lawfare against Trump, actually spied on GOP senators at the time, prompted a scary idea.\n\n“The disclosure that Jack Smith spied on a member of Congress and 7 U.S. senators is part of a bigger picture: Had Trump not won the election, Smith was going to bring a superseding indictment against the president for seditious conspiracy (something I said for years) and implicate GOP lawmakers, White House aides, and campaign associates. Imagine what would be happening under that lawless, vicious, unaccountable thug had Kamala Harris won. Only part of the hellscape we avoided with Trump’s victory,” she explained.\n\nThe disclosure that Jack Smith spied on a member of Congress and 7 U.S. senators is part of a bigger picture: Had Trump not won the election, Smith was going to bring a superseding indictment against the president for seditious conspiracy (something I said for years) and…\n— Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) October 7, 2025\n\nSmith’s lawfare campaign against Trump faded into oblivion when Trump was elected to his second term.\n\nAnd actually, there already are calls for accountability for Smith’s decision to pursue the telephone records of GOP Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and as well as GOP Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly.\n\nFBI agents involved have been fired, and Sen. Lindsay Graham promised to sue “the crap” out of anyone in the federal government allegedly involved in monitoring his phone records.\n\nGraham said, “Here’s what I believe. If he [Trump] had never announced he was going to run for president, none of this would have happened. They were trying to destroy his comeback. This was all orchestrated by Jack Smith, Alvin Bragg, Fani Willis, Letitia James to destroy this man so he could not win in 2024. I’ve seen this movie before. I am going to look at what happened to me and my fellow senators. If they did this without good reason and without cause, I’m going to sue the crap out of these people.”\n\n“Jack Smith released a document about why he thought Trump was guilty in October, right before the election, violating protocol of the Department of Justice. And October the 24th, about two weeks before the 24 election, Jack Smith released to the public his brief regarding the allegations against Trump. This stinks to high heaven. I’m tired of it. We’ve got new people in town to clean this mess up. And my goal is not to do this to Democrats, to make sure it’s never done to anybody in the future. And those of us that were wronged, if we were wrong[ed], pay a price!”\n\nA commentary at Twitchy noted Sen. Josh Hawley described the actions as being those of “Biden’s Stasi.”\n\nIt said, “Things in the U.S. would be far worse on every level, and now it’s laughable to watch Democrats and the media use the Comey indictment as ‘proof’ that the Justice Department has just now been weaponized. The Left never expected Trump to win the first time, let alone the second, hence the ongoing meltdowns and violent outbursts we’ve been seeing. But at least those people no longer have an ally in the White House.”","summary":"'Imagine what would be happening under that lawless, vicious, unaccountable thug had Kamala Harris won'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/10/hellscape-investigative-reporter-warns-what-dems-had-planned/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/donald-trump-united-nations-escalators-bw.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 17:04:22","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":367443872,"title":"Deroy Murdock slams Harris over book tour remarks: 'Less profanity, more policy'","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nVarney Co October 08, 2025 03:57 \n\n Deroy Murdock slams Harris over book tour remarks: 'Less profanity, more policy' \n Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock reacts to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ remarks about the Trump administration and weighs in on Democrats standing by Virginia Attorney General candidate Jay Jones amid a violent texting scandal.\n\nTags POLITICSWHAT TO WATCHSHOWSVARNEY| LATEST EPISODESVARNEY AND COV-VIDEOS","summary":"Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock reacts to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ remarks about the Trump administration and weighs in on Democrats standing by Virginia Attorney General candidate Jay Jones amid a violent texting scandal.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6382331516112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/f27e45f0-abe2-452f-8e98-01e933e8110b/91651bac-0202-4c67-9abb-175a7f0cc748/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 17:02:38","author":"Virginia Attorney General","authors":["Virginia Attorney General"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":367458298,"title":"Confirmed: Mike Johnson's taste in music is trash","text":"You probably didn’t expect House Speaker Mike Johnson to have good taste in music, but now he’s gone and confirmed it.\n\nReporter Pablo Manríquez of the independent outlet Migrant Insider asked Johnson for his reaction to news that global music phenomenon Bad Bunny would perform at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n“I didn't even know who Bad Bunny was, but it sounds like a terrible decision in my view,” Johnson said. \n\n“It sounds like he's not someone who appeals to a broader audience,” Johnson continued. “And I think, you know, there's so many eyes on the Super Bowl—a lot of young, impressionable children.

The officials said they would not be deterred.\n\nThe Republican president made the comment in a social media post, the latest example of his brazen calls for his opponents to be prosecuted or locked up — a break from longtime norms as the Justice Department traditionally has strived to maintain its independence from the White House.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social that Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!\" It was a reference to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Trump was objecting to. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nJohnson, in a post on X, said, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested. I’m not going anywhere.” Pritzker, also on X, said” I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?\"\n\nNational Guard troops from Texas are positioned outside Chicago despite a lawsuit by the state and city to block the deployment.\n\nThe troops' mission is not clear but the Trump administration has undertaken an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.\n\nTrump has called Chicago a “hell hole” of crime, even though police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides. Protesters have skirmished with agents outside a detention center in the village of Broadview, outside Chicago.\n\nA woman in Chicago was shot by a Border Patrol agent over the weekend after she and a man were accused of using their vehicles to strike and then box in the agent’s vehicle. The agent then exited his car and fired five shots at Marimar Martinez, 30.\n\nMartinez and Anthony Ruiz, 21, are charged with forcibly assaulting a federal officer and were ordered to be released Monday pending trial. Martinez’s lawyer, Christopher Parente, claimed body camera footage contradicts the federal government’s narrative of her actions.\n\nTrump’s comment came as former FBI Director James Comey appeared in a Virginia courtroom, pleading not guilty in a case that has intensified concerns about Justice Department’s efforts to target Trump adversaries.\n\nWhen Trump was campaigning for the White House in 2024 at a time he faced criminal and civil investigations, he told supporters, “I am your retribution.”\n\nThe Justice Department has also opened criminal investigations this year against California Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running for New York City mayor. The three, all Democrats, have all wrongdoing and say the investigations are politically motivated.\n\nPritzker, one of Trump’s fiercest critics, has called the president a “wannabe dictator,” comparing his leadership to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin and joking that the Republican “doesn’t read” anything. The governor has suggested that Trump, who has threatened Chicago with apocalyptic force, suffers from dementia.\n\nPritzker, eyed as a potential 2028 White House contender, has strongly fought against any federal intervention along with Johnson, saying it is not wanted or needed in Illinois or Chicago.\n\n“Certainly there’s a lot more going on in the world than for him to send troops into Chicago,” Pritzker told The Associated Press in August during a visit to a South Side neighborhood where a campaign videographer was also in tow. “He ought to be focused on some of the bigger problems.”\n\nPritzker alleges that Trump is trying to militarize cities to affect the outcome of the 2026 election by impeding voting efforts in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.\n\nThe heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune is seeking a third term as governor next year and has sidestepped questions about higher ambitions. Pritzker was among the finalists considered as a running mate for Democratic Kamala Harris’ presidential run in 2024.\n\nTrump has often singled out Chicago and Illinois because they have some of the country’s strongest immigrant protections. Both are “sanctuary” jurisdictions, which limit cooperation between police and federal immigration agents.\n\nJohnson, a first-term mayor, has strengthened those protections even further with executive orders, including one that bars immigration agents from using city-owned land as staging areas for operations. He calls Trump’s actions unconstitutional.\n\nJohnson has accused Trump of waging a war on Chicago and having an “animus” toward women and people of color. Nearly one-third of Chicago’s 2.7 million are Black and roughly one-third are Hispanic.\n\n“He’s a monster,” Johnson told reporters in May. “Period.”\n\nTareen reported from Chicago.

Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found. \"A turning point\" for global fossil fuel power generation The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.\"That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,\" said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study. At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%. \"The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,\" said Wiatros-Motyka. \"This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.\"The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather. China and India leading the green energy transition Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said. India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.In both nations, emissions fell.\"It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,\" said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. \"This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.\" U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments. Just last week the Trump administration announced that it would be canceling $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 Democratically governed states, in funding cuts announced amid a federal government shutdown. Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy. All of the states affected by the cuts voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and all are represented by Democrats in the Senate.Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants. In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Mr. Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change. Experts warn that Mr. Trump's efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.\"The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they're also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That's going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,\" Gerrard said.Renewables \"still have an opportunity to make inroads into displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,\" said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn't involved in the report. Smith said that while she remained \"very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.\"","summary":"Energy think tank Ember says a slight drop in global fossil fuel power marks \"a turning point,\" as the U.S. and Europe lag behind by China and India in investment.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/renewable-energy-exceeds-coal-power-globally-first-time-ember-analysis/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/21/07820a9f-33b5-4901-a722-f791770cd5eb/thumbnail/1200x630/2aa1457a05e15e73f7c672fc54dd1f34/gettyimages-2192581301.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 16:03:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.135},{"id":367464426,"title":"Nolte: Taylor Swift’s 'Life of a Showgirl' Album Angers the Woke Swifties","text":"The woke demons are online, tearing apart Taylor Swift’s new album over lyrics they find both racist and homophobic.\n\nThere’s much to read between the lines of what motivates these harridans, but let’s start with the whining…\n\nLike everything else she touches, Swift’s new album, The Life of a Showgirl, is a mega-seller. But rather than sitting back and enjoying her latest success, the Woke Gestapo is on a rampage.\n\nAs the New York Post documents, some Swifties appear upset that their goddess might be outgrowing them.\n\nAlthough Taylor Swift is a left-wing Democrat and has made no secret of this, including her endorsement of Kamala Harris, because of the song “CANCELLED!” which contains the lyric, “I like my friends cancelled,” some are wondering if she’s gone MAGA.\n\n“’I like my friends cancelled’ is the most tone-deaf lyric a white billionaire with MAGA friends could release in this climate,” wrote one disillusioned Swiftie.\n\n“MAGA friends” is an obvious reference to Swift’s friend Brittany Mahomes, who committed the sin of “liking” a social media post about the GOP’s 2024 political platform.\n\nIn an obvious reference to Shakespeare’s Ophelia, a character in Hamlet who likely killed herself after the title character spurned her, in Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift thanks the man who saved her from that same fate:\n\nAll that time\nI sat alone in my tower\nYou were just honing your powers\nNow I can see it all (See it all)\nLate one night\nYou dug me out of my grave and\nSaved my heart from the fate of Ophelia\n\nThat was met with this hilariously uptight X post: “[A]s an ACTUAL English major, i refuse to listen to a song that implies Ophelia might’ve reconsidered killing herself if she had just dated a quarterback.”\n\nSwift is also being attacked as racist over her song “Wi$h Li$t,” where she scoffs at the empty dreams of others and asks for life’s simple things:\n\nI just want you (You, you, yeah), huh\nHave a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you\nWe tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do (Ooh), wow\nGot me dreaming ’bout a driveway with a basketball hoop (Hoop)\nBoss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)\n\nThe leftist Word Police have translated this into an act of white supremacy: “I want to have your white babies, and I actually want our entire neighborhood to be racially homogenous,” mewled a TikTokker. “Now Taylor’s calling y’all childless cat ladies because she’s about to pop out some kids.”\n\nAnother critic wrote, “She is free to put out a song about wanting a husband and children and a basketball hoop and a house and a cul-de-sac, [but] she has to accept the context that, if she puts that out right now, it’s going to feel like propaganda.”\n\nOne cat lady summed the album up this way: “Considering how much Taylor has benefitted [from] and marketed on that parasocial relationship with her fans, it would have been nice to get some acknowledgement of the problems that most of us are struggling with right now.”\n\nIs “parasocial” even a word?\n\nThere’s plenty more. You can look for yourself here and here.\n\nObviously, because I’m not a 14-year-old girl or a stunted adult female, my knowledge of Taylor Swift and her music is almost nonexistent. But from what I couldn’t help but be exposed to over the years, here are my thoughts…\n\nTaylor Swift is 35 years old, she’s had no shortage of suitors, she has no children, she’s insanely talented, a brilliant businesswoman, and now feels the ticking of the clock. So, she’s growing up. At long last she’s found a man she wants to marry. With time running out and having conquered all there is to conquer in pop culture, she seems to be thinking about the only thing that matters: family, husband, kids, home, and all the contentment that comes with that.\n\nUnfortunately, too many of Swift’s fans are incapable of growing up — we’re talking about the AWFLs… For in their deranged eyes, growing up means admitting everything they have stood for straight into middle age was wrong. A husband? That’s embracing the patriarchy. Unaborted children? Nevahhh! A basketball hoop? What if the ball knocks over my “In This House” sign?\n\nFor going on 20 years, Swift had been the goddess who affirmed their lonely, bitter, anti-male lifestyle. She was all about her career, all about wrist-flicking the patriarchy, all about the narcissism of self-care.\n\nBut unlike these former worshipers (who are mostly homely, bitter, and impossible to live with), Taylor Swift has options. She’s rich and beautiful, which means she has a banquet of desirable men laid out before her. She’s also smart enough to grow up and grasp the idea that being alone and childless at 40 is no way to live.\n\nMillions of Taylor Swift fans grew up with her. It looks like some have stopped that growth process.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

He doesn’t know if he will finish,” says filmmaker Raoul Peck.\n\nThat’s the struggle that anchors Peck’s latest documentary, “Orwell: 2+2=5,” as the British writer races against tuberculosis to publish his chilling vision of doublethink, thoughtcrimes and memory holes before his death at age 46. \n\nFor Peck, that’s only half the story. Scenes from Orwell’s life blend together with grim footage of our own time, from the battlefields of Ukraine to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“The mistake during the Cold War that people made is [thinking] he wrote exclusively against the Soviet Union or Stalinism,” Peck says. “In fact, he was writing down the very matrix of how an authoritarian developed. What are the signs? What is the language? What are the structures?” \n\nThose questions are familiar to Peck, whose family fled Haiti during the François Duvalier regime. “When you have lived in a dictatorship, you recognize those signs very early on,” he says.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed. To hear the full conversation with director Raoul Peck, listen to the latest episode of the Political Theater podcast. \n\nQ: When did Orwell first come into your world?\n\nA: Of course I read “1984” in school, and “Animal Farm” as well. But Orwell was always a very far away character for me. I’m from Haiti, and then I grew up in Congo under Mobutu. My father was arrested in Haiti twice, and then he had to leave because he knew that the dictatorship would come after him. \n\nBut when I started to immerse myself in this project, I slowly discovered a different Orwell that was closer to my own reality. And I also profoundly understood that, in fact, he was not writing about some sort of future republic. He was talking about his own experience volunteering at 19 to become a policeman in Burma. He was confronted with the colonial forces, and he was on the bad side, and he recognized that. \n\nAnd that brought me closer to him because he did a very humble thing of writing about it in the 1930s, when a lot of African countries were still colonized. There were a lot of dictatorships around the world, but he admitted what he did there, and he was not proud of it, and he criticized his home country about what they were doing in Burma and in India. And so I learned a new Orwell, and that allowed me to make a much more organic and intimate film.\n\nQ: Within the film, you’ve got the aspects of Orwell’s life, but you’ve also got contemporary footage of Ukraine, or what’s going on in Gaza, or in Myanmar with the Rohingya.\n\nA: I can see it in the reactions of the audience. It’s a shock for them, because we have learned how to isolate ourselves and just see our own little bubble. We are being fed by breaking news every day, and thus letting go a more universal look at what is happening in the world.\n\nWhat the film does is to put in the foreground the simultaneity of all those places of war, places of misery, places of ending of democracies. You know, Orwell himself, he plays the story of “1984” in London because he wanted to make sure we understand that kind of system can happen anywhere, including in the Western world, and we are on the verge of looking at such a transformation here.\n\nQ: How does this compare with your film about James Baldwin, “I Am Not Your Negro”? \n\nA: When you’ve never left your country, everything else is sort of obscure, sometimes savage territory. But these men left their own country and learned to know who the “other” is, who are the foreigners, who are the immigrants, who are the illegals, as you would use today as a word, and that changed them. They start reflecting on who they are as a human being, and they start seeing the “other” as fellow human beings. \n\nQ: Just as a thought experiment, if you’re looking at where we’re at now in 2050, do you see 2025 as a tipping point year?\n\nA: No. When I started working on Orwell, I thought Kamala Harris would be president, and the film was as important for me at that time as it is today because the problem didn’t start with the present administration. \n\nThere has been a deconstruction of everything since at least Ronald Reagan. The reorganizing of the whole press, whether it’s TV news, newspapers or the fact that there is no local press anymore, basically, in this country. The fragmentation of society, and it came from the economy as well. People forget, but during the oil crisis, as we used to call it, that’s when they started cutting budgets. They started cutting social programs. \n\nSo I don’t see that as something that suddenly happened because a majority of voters voted for a president. No, I think it had been long in the making. It’s just a sort of acceleration, and then we are looking at the ugliness of it and we can’t look away.\n\nQ: Congress is particularly supine right now, abdicating their own constitutional responsibilities, letting the courts and letting the White House kind of call the shots.\n\nA: I remember in the first Trump term, Republicans in Congress, a few of them started saying something. But then I saw that each time, it was somebody [not running] for reelection. I said, “Oh, my God, this is a problem” — that none of those elected officials dare say something that would go against the prince.\n\nWhen you have lived in a dictatorship, you recognize those signs very early on. You start asking the question, where is this going? Because cutting off dissent, it starts when you can’t really fully tell what you’re thinking. It’s self-censorship because you’re afraid of the consequences of what you’re saying. We talk about freedom of speech in this country as if it’s natural. No, it needs that you act up upon it, that you prove that you have the freedom of speech. Otherwise, it’s just emptiness.","summary":"George Orwell is so iconic that he has his own adjective, but his classic dystopian novel almost didn’t make it to completion.&#160; “He’s trying to finish ‘1984,’ it’s the last year of his life, and he’s in and out of hospitals, sanatoriums.

The governor has suggested that Trump, who has threatened Chicago with apocalyptic force, suffers from dementia.\n\nPritzker, eyed as a potential 2028 White House contender, has strongly fought against any federal intervention along with Johnson, saying it is not wanted or needed in Illinois or Chicago.\n\n“Certainly there’s a lot more going on in the world than for him to send troops into Chicago,” Pritzker told The Associated Press in August during a visit to a South Side neighborhood where a campaign videographer was also in tow. “He ought to be focused on some of the bigger problems.”\n\nPritzker alleges that Trump is trying to militarize cities to affect the outcome of the 2026 election by impeding voting efforts in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.\n\nThe heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune is seeking a third term as governor next year and has sidestepped questions about higher ambitions. Pritzker was among the finalists considered as a running mate for Democratic Kamala Harris’ presidential run in 2024.\n\nTrump has often singled out Chicago and Illinois because they have some of the country’s strongest immigrant protections. Both are “sanctuary” jurisdictions, which limit cooperation between police and federal immigration agents.\n\nJohnson, a first-term mayor, has strengthened those protections even further with executive orders, including one that bars immigration agents from using city-owned land as staging areas for operations. He calls Trump’s actions unconstitutional.\n\nJohnson has accused Trump of waging a war on Chicago and having an “animus” toward women and people of color. Nearly one-third of Chicago’s 2.7 million are Black and roughly one-third are Hispanic.\n\n“He’s a monster,” Johnson told reporters in May. “Period.”\n\nTareen reported from Chicago.

In politics, choosing bold leadership over the path of least resistance is seldom an easy decision, but when it comes to saving America, shirking responsibilities is not an option. That’s why Trump is taking our horribly flawed census and inaccurate reapportionment data head on.\n\nThe president has called for a new census because illegal immigrants shouldn’t be counted. This is simply a matter of Trumpian common sense, even if it’s hard for the left to swallow. By counting illegals in the census, American citizens aren’t receiving the congressional representation they deserve, and this must change. All governors regardless of political party should push for an accurate census so they can best serve their constituents. American citizens and those in the country legally — the hardworking taxpayers who constitute the backbone of our country — must always be prioritized. (RELATED: Trump Orders ‘New And Highly Accurate’ Census Not Counting Illegal Migrants)\n\nHowever, due to the radicalization of the Democratic Party, Trump-hating blue state governors will never adopt the concept of putting America first, so it’s Republican governors who must stand tall and do the right thing. The right thing is to follow Trump’s lead and join the chorus of those who want a new census that reflects the actual population of those living in the United States of America legally. \n\nSimultaneously, GOP governors must reexamine their congressional map and update it immediately if it doesn’t accurately reflect their state. For as long as I can remember, Democrats in deep blue states have been maximizing their representation in Congress by using raw political power in the redistricting process. The left realized long ago that in order to achieve political objectives, every tool in the toolbox must be deployed. Now, it’s time for Republican governors to join Trump and fight back in the all-important effort to save America. \n\nAs we head into the 2026 midterm election season, Republicans hold a razor thin 220 – 215 majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats sense an opening and are scheming to exploit the situation by using every instrument at their disposal. In President Trump’s first term, the left relied on the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax to try to slow him down. This time, it’s by gerrymandering already gerrymandered states that they control. \n\nLook no further than unhinged California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seeks to redraw California’s massive congressional map to negate the new map in Texas. If Democrats win the majority in the U.S. House then Trump’s America First agenda will grind to a halt on Capitol Hill, and impeachment proceedings will begin as soon as left-wing New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries is handed the gavel. Those in positions of power must not allow it to happen. Strong resolve is needed to protect our constitutional republic right now. \n\nTo fully understand what the Democrats are doing, take the deep blue state of Maryland, for example. Just 25 years ago, the Old Line State had four Democrats and four Republicans making up its congressional delegation. Fast-forward to today, and the ratio is seven Democrats to one Republican, and now far left Gov. Wes Moore is trying to get rid of conservative champion and Republican Rep. Andy Harris and the last red district in Maryland. You see, for the left, it’s never enough. \n\nSolid red state governors like Jim Pillen in Nebraska must realize what’s going on before it’s too late and act. Trump carried Nebraska with a commanding 60 percent of the vote in the last election, and yet Republicans have to worry every two years about holding onto the Cornhusker State’s second congressional district. This simply should not happen. Nebraska should have three safe Republican seats in Congress, full stop. Just look at the deep blue Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for example, the mirror opposite of Nebraska. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won 61 percent of the vote there in 2024, but, low and behold, Republicans have no chance of ever winning a single congressional seat, because Democrats have made it an impossibility in the Bay State. \n\nFurthermore, purple states with Republican governors like New Hampshire should not have two Democrats in Congress and zero Republicans. Kamala Harris carried New Hampshire by just 23,000 votes, so Republicans are badly shortchanged by their current congressional map. Gov. Kelly Ayotte should reconsider her position so that New Hampshire’s map accurately represents the will of her constituents. \n\nGov. Joe Lombardo in the battleground state of Nevada should also join the fight. Right now, only one of the Silver State’s four districts has a Republican House member, even though Trump carried the state by 46,000 votes in 2024. And it should go without saying that more red states with Republican governors – like Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana to name a few – must move forward with strengthening their congressional maps to confront the growing threat of the radical left.\n\nWhether we choose to see it or not, these are not normal times. It starts with fixing the inaccurate census and not allowing illegal immigrants and flawed congressional maps to dictate the lives of patriotic American citizens who pay the freight. Bold action is required without delay. \n\nDavid N. Bossie is president of Citizens United. He served as deputy campaign manager for Donald J.

And you all as storytellers are living this. You're not passive observers. You know that. You're living it.\" \"And I'm gonna ask you that all the emotions that we are feeling, give those emotions, give that experience to those people that you are writing about and writing for. It gets back to my point about helping people just put a label on it, even if it doesn't change the circumstance,\" she continued before dropping the line that leaders of the current political climate are \"crazy.\" \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation\" is a one-day invitation-only event hosted in Los Angeles that previously featured speakers such as former first lady Jill Biden and singer Kesha, according to its website. The series aims to \"equip creators of culture — television writers, artists, producers, executives, and digital storytellers — for the year ahead,\" according to its website. When asked about Harris' remarks, White House spokesman Kush Desai took aim at the former vice president's laugh. \"Kamala Harris should listen to an audio recording of her cackle of a laugh before calling anyone crazy,\" Desai said. KAMALA HARRIS PLAYS UP COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS WEDGE WITH BIDEN WIDENS Harris' appearance, which was not listed on her official book tour agenda, also included lamenting election night 2024, when she reported she felt levels of grief that could only be compared to how she felt following her mother's death. \"I couldn’t articulate anything else — I kept saying over and over again, ‘My God, my God,' she said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \"I had never felt that level of pain and grief except that when my mother died, and it was grieving for the country. I knew what was going to happen.\" Harris is on a public event blitz since the release of \"107 Days\" in September, kicking off her book tour in New York City before making stops across the nation to promote the new political memoir that walks readers from former President Joe Biden's attempted 2024 run through her picking up the mantle in an effort to defeat President Donald Trump at the ballot boxes. The former vice president's book tour has included repeated claims that the most recent presidential election was the \"closest\" this century, claiming at a book tour stop in Houston Saturday that Trump doesn't have a \"mandate.\" KAMALA HARRIS BREAKS SILENCE ON BIDEN DROPOUT, ADMITS SHE HAS REGRETS ABOUT HER HANDLING OF SITUATION \"Here’s the other thing that is quite unprecedented — and, it was the tightest, closest presidential election in the 21st Century. He does not have a mandate! That is not a mandate! That is not a mandate!'\" she said during that event. Harris lost both the Electoral College and popular vote to Trump during the 2024 election in a defeat that also included each of the seven battleground states voting in favor of Trump. Harris ended the campaign with 75,019,617 total votes to Trump's 77,304,184 votes, and 226 electoral votes to Trump's 312. The data, however, has not stopped Harris from repeatedly claiming it was the \"closest\" election in the 21st century. \"By the way, what is also historic about that, in many ways — it was the closest election for president of the United States in the 21st Century,\" she said in September 2024 from Howard University's campus in Washington.

PRICE and SOPHIA TAREEN, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, both Democrats, should be jailed as they oppose his deployment of National Guard troops for his immigration and crime crackdown in the nation’s third-largest city. The officials said they would not be deterred.\n\nThe Republican president made the comment in a social media post, the latest example of his brazen calls for his opponents to be prosecuted or locked up — a break from longtime norms as the Justice Department traditionally has strived to maintain its independence from the White House.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social that Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” It was a reference to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Trump was objecting to.\n\nJohnson, in a post on X, said, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested. I’m not going anywhere.” Pritzker, also on X, said” I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, when asked what crimes the president believed Pritzker and Johnson had committed, failed to identify any, but she said they “have blood on their hands” and pointed to Chicago Police Department reports that at least five people were killed and 25 shot over the weekend.\n\n“Instead of taking action to stop the crime, these Trump-Deranged buffoons would rather allow the violence to continue and attack the President for wanting to help make their city safe again,” Jackson said.\n\nNational Guard troops from Texas are positioned outside Chicago despite a lawsuit by the state and city to block the deployment.\n\nThe troops’ mission is not clear but the Trump administration has undertaken an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.\n\nTrump has called Chicago a “hell hole” of crime, even though police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides. Protesters have skirmished with agents outside a detention center in the village of Broadview, outside Chicago.\n\nA woman in Chicago was shot by a Border Patrol agent over the weekend after she and a man were accused of using their vehicles to strike and then box in the agent’s vehicle. The agent then exited his car and fired five shots at Marimar Martinez, 30.\n\nMartinez and Anthony Ruiz, 21, are charged with forcibly assaulting a federal officer and were ordered to be released Monday pending trial.

Just a week after his show was “indefinitely” cancelled, Disney announced that he would return to his regular spot on ABC. The controversy began after the talk show host made a controversial remark about Charlie Kirk.\n\nIn his monologue, Kimmel said that the “MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”. His remarks invited the wrath of the MAGA loyalists. Two days later, Disney “indefinitely” canceled the show. Initially, the channel said, “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.”\n\nKamala Harris on the “power of the consumer” in today’s political climate:\n“Look what happened [with] Jimmy Kimmel. The people spoke with their pocketbooks — and decisions changed quickly.” pic.twitter.com/cxcdyvnckv\n— Pop Base (@PopBase) October 7, 2025 \n\nThen, Disney explained Kimmel’s return. “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.” Since the show returned, Kimmel has enjoyed a newfound popularity. He also delivered a heartfelt monologue upon his return.\n\nKamala Harris could not help but praise him and his fanbase. The former Vice President highlighted how crucial the “power of the consumer” is. “Let’s also remind people not only of their rights as residents, as citizens, as voters, but as consumers,” she said while appearing on a panel.\n\n“Look what happened, for example, with Jimmy Kimmel. The people spoke with their pocket books and decisions changed quickly,” Harris added. “So you know, when we’re feeling overwhelmed, look at recent moments to know that when the people decide to activate, we can make a difference but the fight sometimes takes a while,” said Kamala Harris.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: “According to a new poll, I am more popular than the President of the United States.

Kimmel said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”\n\nSince he returned, reportedly 6.26 million total viewers tuned in for his first show since his suspension.

James Walkinshaw told the Washington Post. “And by the way, the federal employees that I represent saw it as such as well.”\n\nThe Independent has asked the White House for comment.\n\nThere have still been visible changes to the federal workforce. Non-essential services have been suspended. Most federal workers won’t be paid until the shutdown ends, while some who were furloughed may be denied back pay, the president threatened this week, in contradiction with a law he signed in his first term. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump has used the shutdown to further his own policy agenda, such as threatening to cut “Democratic agencies,” cancelling nearly $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in states that backed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and freezing $18 million for infrastructure projects in New York City — home to both Democratic leaders.\n\nIn the days leading up to the shutdown, Trump warned: “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people and cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.” \n\nPrevious government shutdowns have not led to mass layoffs. Still, on the first day of the shutdown, Vice President J.D. Vance warned that mass reductions may be required “to keep the American people’s essential services continuing to run.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump furthered these threats, telling reporters that jobs could be permanently slashed. If the shutdown continues, the cuts will “be substantial.” He added: “And a lot of those jobs will never come back.”\n\nThe president has yet to act on these threats. Several government employees don’t think he’ll carry ever them out.\n\nA State Department employee considers the potential firings an empty threat. “This is stupid, even for them,” he told the Washington Post. “The bar is in the basement, and they have managed to tunnel under it somehow.” \n\nSimilarly, an Agriculture Department worker said she’s grown so accustomed to Trump’s threats to federal workers that she now treats the president’s firing claims as “background noise,” the Post reported.\n\nTrump has backed away from several plans during his second term, giving rise to the “TACO” descriptor. \n\nThe acronym first appeared earlier this year in the context of tariffs. Some Wall Street traders used the term to describe the president’s pattern of making trade policy threats that were likely to cause the stock market to dip before he inevitably walked back on that threat, leading to a rebound. For example, after unveiling his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, the markets plunged. The following week, he ordered a 90-day pause, prompting the market to soar to record highs.\n\nBut Trump has walked back on a number of stances beyond trade policies. The Department of Government Efficiency executed sweeping layoffs cuts in the early days of the administration, only to later rehire hundreds of them. \n\nEven this week, Trump suggested he would negotiate with Democrats, who have demanded health care subsidies, to end the shutdown — but then walked it back, insisting they cave before any discussions take place. He wrote on Truth Social: “I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open.”","summary":"The president threatened to cut agencies and fire government workers, but has yet to act on those vows","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/taco-trump-shutdown-mass-layoffs-b2841704.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/08/12/20/President-Donald-Trump-speaks-to-reporters-before-signing-an-executive-order-in-the-Oval-Office-at-t.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gjzRgbNZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-08 14:19:46","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":367463198,"title":"Tensions build inside David Ellison's Paramount over Israel stance","text":"About 200 people gathered on Paramount's Melrose Avenue lot for a screening of \"Red Alert,\" a four-part scripted drama portraying the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel from the perspective of six victims. The host of the Sept. 30 event was Paramount Chair and Chief Executive David Ellison, who shared how he had chatted with Academy Award-nominated producer Lawrence Bender a few weeks earlier at a memorial service for legendary Hollywood power broker Skip Brittenham. That's where Ellison learned that Bender's Israeli-backed series, \"Red Alert,\" needed a home in the United States. Ellison quickly volunteered. \"It was a fast 'yes,'\" he told the group. On Tuesday, \"Red Alert\" debuted on the company's streaming service, Paramount+, marking the second anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The initial Hamas assault left about 1,200 Israelis dead and more than 250 kidnapped. The high-profile project comes two months after Ellison assumed control of Paramount in an $8-billion buyout by his family, led by billionaire and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners. Since the deal closed Aug. 7, David Ellison has moved to position the company slightly right of the political center, while also taking on polarizing issues. The scion has been unafraid to challenge those in Hollywood who have called for a boycott of Israel. More than two years after the Oct. 7 attack, a deep divide remains in Hollywood over the subsequent Israel-Hamas war. Last month, Paramount condemned an open letter in support of Palestinians, which has gained steam in Hollywood. More than 5,000 people have signed the Film Workers for Palestine letter, including such prominent filmmakers as Adam McKay, Ava DuVernay, Alex Gibney and Hannah Einbinder. The effort called for a boycott of Israeli film festivals, institutions and projects to help spur an end to the war in Gaza. The campaign was designed in the vein of South African boycotts decades ago, which proved to be instrumental in ending apartheid, that country's racial segregation. No other major studio followed Paramount. In its Sept. 12 statement, Paramount said it disagreed with the Film Workers for Palestine call to avoid film screenings or to work with Israeli film institutions. \"At Paramount, we believe in the power of storytelling to connect and inspire people, promote mutual understanding, and preserve the moments, ideas, and events that shape the world we share,\" the company said. \"Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace.\" The Film Workers group accused Paramount of misrepresenting the intent of its pledge, saying it did not target individual filmmakers. But critics counter that filmmakers who engage with Israeli cultural institutions would likely fall under the ban. More than 1,200 industry players including actors Mayim Bialik and Liev Schreiber and Paramount board member Sherry Lansing signed an opposing open letter released by the nonprofit organization Creative Community For Peace that accuses the Film Workers for Palestine of advocating \"arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.\" The Palestinian supporters dismissed the characterization. \"The Film Workers Pledge to End Complicity is an explicitly anti-racist and non-violent campaign that is grounded in international law and the moral clarity of a global majority opposed to genocide,\" the group said in a statement this week. \"It is the first major refusal of the international film industry at large that targets complicit Israeli film institutions and companies.\" \"Red Alert\" was co-produced by a prominent Israeli production company, Keshet Media Group, and received funding from the Jewish National Fund-USA and the Israel Entertainment Fund. The series premiered last weekend on Israel's popular television channel Keshet 12. Keshet produced the Hebrew-language series \"Prisoners of War\" that Showtime later adapted into the award-winning American drama \"Homeland.\" During the late September screening at Paramount, Ellison spoke of the need for such projects as \"Red Alert\" to remember the atrocities as well as stories of survival and heroism. \"We at Paramount, we are here to tell stories that last forever,\" Ellison said. \"We are not here to debate politics or platforms or to argue about east or west. And 'Red Alert' is the very embodiment of that mission, and I couldn't be prouder to support this series.\" Critics note that Ellison's father, Larry, the co-founder of Oracle, is a prominent supporter of Israel, contributing millions to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. Others in Hollywood have found fault with Israel's government and its conduct in the Gaza war, which has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians or combatants. The United Nations, rights groups, experts and many Western governments accuse Israel of committing genocide. Israel denies the charge. During a May 2024 Simon Wiesenthal Center gala in his honor, WME Group Executive Chairman Ari Emanuel sharply denounced Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and called for his ouster. Emanuel's remarks were met with cheers and jeers and some attendees walked out. In his Oscar acceptance speech last year, Jonathan Glazer, director of the Holocaust drama “The Zone of Interest,” asked “Whether the victims of October 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims of this dehumanization — how do we resist?” Weeks later, Steven Spielberg called out the rise of antisemitism as well as the ongoing war. “We can rage against the heinous acts committed by the terrorists of October 7th and also decry the killing of innocent women and children in Gaza,” Spielberg said during an event celebrating the anniversary of the USC Shoah Foundation. Paramount's opposition to the Film Workers' pledge and other recent moves, including buying the Free Press news site for $150 million and installing its founder, journalist Bari Weiss, as the editor in chief at CBS News, has rattled a small group of Paramount employees. David Ellison recruited Weiss, who has been public about her support for Israel, for the prominent role. The division was roiled by Paramount's efforts to settle President Trump's lawsuit over edits to a \"60 Minutes\" interview a year ago with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount this summer agreed to pay $16 million to end Trump's suit, which 1st Amendment experts viewed as a spurious shakedown. Weeks later, Trump appointees on the Federal Communications Commission approved the Ellison family's takeover of Paramount. The employee group, which calls itself Paramount Employees of Conscience, said they have sent two letters to Paramount leaders in the last month to voice their concerns but have not received a reply. In a statement, the group noted that while Paramount+ was distributing \"Red Alert,\" the company had not offered \"equivalent programming about Palestinian experiences of the genocide in Gaza.\" \"How can a company with this supposed creative mission actively ignore, suppress, and silence internal calls for years to champion stories that shed a light on the reality that marginalized and excluded communities, particularly Palestinians, face every day?\" the group asked in a Sept. 17 letter addressed to Paramount's leadership. Paramount declined to comment. The group includes about 30 employees, according to one member who asked not to be identified out of fear of retribution. Paramount employees separately are bracing for a steep round of layoffs, which is expected next month. Ellison's firm Skydance Media and RedBird promised Wall Street that they would find more than $2 billion in cost cuts at Paramount. \"We know the Ellisons are formidable, powerful and have a lot of resources,\" said the Paramount employee. \"But we are here to interrupt a culture of silence.... Silence within the industry becomes complicity.\"","summary":"Paramount Chief David Ellison has embraced Oct. 7 drama 'Red Alert' and challenged those in Hollywood who have called for a boycott of Israel, prompting criticism from a group of employees.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-10-08/paramount-david-ellison-film-workers-palestine-red-alert","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75aa91c/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3250x2161+0+0/resize/1486x988!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9d%2Fe1%2F2c3b8a6e4a739c62a07c6fb88b11%2Fap23109142774864.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 14:00:00","author":"Meg James,Stacy Perman","authors":["Meg James","Stacy Perman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":367399658,"title":"Kamala Harris goes delusional: ‘It is not a mandate, it was not a mandate’","text":"Kamala Harris, the failed Democrat nominee in the 2024 presidential race whose support plunged even as she spent over a billion dollars campaigning for a few weeks, now insists that the vote was the “closest” and “tightest” result in years.\n\nFurther, she claims the decision by American voters, described by many as a landslide, did not give President Donald Trump a “mandate” for the country.\n\nKamala Harris Refuses to believe the American People gave President Trump a Mandate\n“It was the tighest, closest Presidential election in the 21st century.

Trump really is making America great again,\" he joked before shifting his focus to comments Trump made about not paying government employees who were furloughed by the shutdown.\n\n While hosting Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the White House on Tuesday, Trump seemingly implied that he would not follow the law, which mandates that all furloughed employees must receive back pay.\n\n \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about. I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way,\" the president said, prompting Kimmel to ask, \"Why does he always sound like the dumbest member of a crime family?\"\n\n During his conversation with Carney, Trump also painted a picture of the United States as he imagined it under the leadership of his competitor in the 2024 election — former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n \"If we didn't win this election, if we had these people that were running... that were ruining our country, destroying our country with their open borders and men playing in women's sports and transgender for everybody and windmills all over the place...,\" he said, prompting commentary from Kimmel.\n\n \"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I heard that correctly. What was the last item? Windmills all over the place? There would be windmills all over the place. They could have turned the whole country into a little Dutch village,\" the host joked about Trump's comment, hypothesizing, \"I mean, he must have gotten his hair tangled in a windmill at a mini golf course or something.\"\n\n Turning his focus to Attorney General Pam Bondi's Tuesday appearance in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kimmel highlighted her response to questions about Epstein and the heavily demanded files from a criminal investigation. The files are currently classified.\n\n \"There were a lot of questions about the Epstein files. There were no answers about the Epstein files. Bondi answered none of them. You know, the author Michael Wolff, who has interviewed Trump repeatedly, says he's seen about a dozen photographs of Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with topless women. Trump's BF Jeff kept them in his safe and showed them to this guy,\" Kimmel said before showing clips of Bondi seemingly avoiding questions about the alleged pictures.\n\n His response to her dodging the topic: \"Did you eat the Polaroids yourself, attorney general?\"\n\n Regarding ongoing calls for the release of the files, Kimmel said, \"One thing we know for sure is that Donald Trump doesn't want us to see these files, which to me is all you need to know.\"\n\n He continued, explaining, \"I mean, you walk in on your teenager, he suddenly pulls up the covers and slams his laptop shut. I think you have a pretty good idea of why; you don't need to look at his browser history. But for whatever reason, we are still waiting for those files.\"\n\n Kimmel turned his focus to the birthday note that Trump allegedly wrote to Epstein in 2003, which was released by the House Oversight Committee in September.

'It's not the way I speak. And anybody that's covered me for a long time knows that's not my language.' Now, we've been covering Donald Trump for what feels like a very, very long time. And in the interest of fairness, we decided to do a bit of research to see if maybe he's right. Does he use the words and phrases that are used in that letter? That's not for me to say; it's for you to decide for yourself,\" Kimmel announced before playing a compilation of clips that showed Trump repeating many of the words and phrases mentioned in the letter.\n\n After the clip aired, Kimmel sarcastically said, \"Well, I stand corrected: It definitely wasn't written by him.\"","summary":"\"It's every day he says something that would rank right at the top of the most ridiculous things any president has ever said,\" Kimmel said of the president","url":"https://people.com/jimmy-kimmel-skewers-donald-trump-for-epstein-letter-government-shutdown-11826273","image":"https://people.com/thmb/lIgj17M5FXvseld-14TZvonhfhU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(737x247:739x249)/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-100825-9cb945e08f984695af5bbed7e0f2d87f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 13:43:40","author":"Michael Nied","authors":["Michael Nied"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":367362550,"title":"Katie Porter’s Chances of Winning California Governor Election Suffer Blow","text":"Katie Porter’s chances of winning the California gubernatorial election have suffered a blow, according to a new poll.\n\nAccording to polling by Zogby Strategies, while the Democrat is leading among other Democrats ahead of the upcoming primary for the election, she is behind a Republican candidate, conservative commentator Steve Hilton, by six percentage points. This suggests that if the two advance to the gubernatorial election, Hilton might beat Porter.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Porter and Hilton via email to comment on this story outside of normal business hours.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nCalifornia will elect its next governor in 2026 when Gavin Newsom, who has served in the role since 2019, will see his term end. The state uses a jungle primary system, where all candidates, regardless of political party, run on a single ballot for the primary. The two candidates with the most support advance to the general election.\n\nKatie Porter, who has announced her candidacy for governor of California, speaks during an interview ahead of the California Democratic Party’s 2025 State Convention in Anaheim, California, on Friday, May, 30, 2025. \n\nCalifornia, the nation’s most populous state, is reliably Democratic. It backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 20 points last November and hasn’t elected a Republican governor since Arnold Schwarzenegger served between 2003 and 2011. Therefore, any signs that Porter, who is running for the governorship after an unsuccessful Senate bid last year, is seeing a decline in support, will concern Democrats.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe Zogby Strategies poll of 1,000 likely voters found that when campaign messaging is taken into account, Hilton received 29 percent of the vote share while Porter garnered 23 percent. A further 23 percent said they were undecided.\n\nThe survey was conducted between September 7 and 9 and had a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points.\n\nIt comes after footage of Porter threatening to leave a CBS News interview held weeks ago surfaced online. Porter clashed with host Julie Watts about whether Porter would need to win over Donald Trump voters to win the gubernatorial election.\n\nHowever, previous polls have painted a more favorable picture for Porter. An Emerson College poll from August showed Porter leading the primary for California governor with 18 percent, followed by Hilton at 12 percent, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7 percent, and former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5 percent.\n\nA Citrin Center/Politico poll earlier in August showed Porter with 21 percent, Bianco with 15 percent, Hilton with 10 percent. It surveyed 1,445 registered voters from July 28 to August 12.\n\nMeanwhile, Porter was endorsed by pro-choice Democratic organization EMILY’s List on Monday, which could help boost her profile and shore up more support.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nWilliam F. Hall, an adjunct professor of political science and business at Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri, told Newsweek the polling was “somewhat surprising, particularly given the fact that, California has been a solidly blue state, supporting the Democratic Party in elections, for quite some time.”\n\n“Debates over whether the difficulties experienced, statewide in California, due to the widespread devastation, due to the fires, I believe, may be playing a large part in driving this, what appears to be, an unexpected shift voter preference,” he said. “However, notwithstanding this current trend, seemingly away from Democrats and toward Republicans, I would nonetheless be very surprised if this current trend was, anything other than a temporary shift, with a reversal and return back to, ultimately reflect ongoing support for Democratic candidates and their policies, in California and elsewhere, especially going forward toward the 2026 midterm elections.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nCalifornia’s primary is scheduled for June 2026. The gubernatorial election is scheduled to take place on November 3, 2026.","summary":"The Democratic politician is behind her Republican rival, Steve Hilton, according to new polling.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/katie-porters-chances-of-winning-california-governor-election-suffer-blow-10845001","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25151142661716.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 13:20:31","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":367370982,"title":"Vulnerable Harris-district Republican brings in more than $1M as Dems scramble to flip seat","text":"FIRST ON FOX: One of only two House Republicans serving in districts won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last year is preparing to announce that he's brought in more than $1 million in the latest fundraising quarter. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., one of Democrats' top targets in the 2026 midterms, will announce later on Wednesday that he's raised $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2025. His campaign said it was the strongest third quarter the moderate House Republican has had in a non-election year. Lawler's campaign spokesman Chris Russell told Fox News Digital that the numbers show \"our message is winning, and our ground game is unmatched.\" TRUMP FRONT-AND-CENTER IN THESE 2025 ELECTION SHOWDOWNS Russell went on to suggest part of Lawler's platform is campaigning on the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" passed by Republicans earlier this year, and which Democrats have been messaging hard against. \"While our opponents trip over themselves to appease a far-left base, Mike Lawler is building a coalition of working families, labor, law enforcement, Republicans, independents and mainstream Democrats who are fed up with chaos politics and radical extremists,\" Lawler's spokesman said. \"Congressman Lawler delivered on SALT, secured historic tax relief for middle and working-class families and will keep focusing on commonsense solutions that make life more affordable and Hudson Valley communities safer.\" His $1.1 million haul means Lawler's campaign ended the quarter with $2.8 million cash on hand, and $3.9 million raised for the 2026 election cycle so far. HEAD HERE FOR FOX NEWS COVERAGE OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS Lawler's district includes suburbs just outside New York City, which were critical to the GOP's winning and then retaining the House in the 2022 and 2024 elections. New York's 17th Congressional District, which he represents, is currently rated +1 in favor of Democrats by the non-partisan Cook Political Report. The competitive seat has already attracted eight Democrats for a crowded primary to take on Lawler in next year's general election, but it appears he has outraised at least several of them. Army veteran Cait Conley raised over $500,000 in the third quarter, former Briarcliff Manor Mayor Peter Chatzky raised over $340,000, and Rockland County legislator Beth Davidson raised $370,000, according to Politico Playbook New York.

Lawler told Fox News Digital of Mamdani's candidacy in June, \"Frankly, for Democrats, this is a time for choosing. Do they align themselves with a radical socialist who engages in antisemitism, hates the police, believes that illegal immigrants should have free everything, and you know, is basically going to destroy the finances of New York City?\" \"They can't have it both ways,\" he said at the time.","summary":"Rep.

Will it matter?","text":"They seemed to be the ties that would for ever bind.\n\nFor three-quarters of a century, unshakable support for Israel – in the form of military aid and diplomatic backing, and underpinned by broad public sentiment – has been an indelible feature of the US political landscape.\n\nBut Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate in Michigan, tipped by some as a rising star, detected something had changed as he campaigned in 100 towns and cities across what has long been one of the country’s election swing states.\n\n“There’s no doubt that there’s been a change,” he said. “We’ve now lived through genocide, and that is bound to change public opinion in a pretty profound way.”\n\nTwo years after Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023 that killed almost 1,200 – mostly civilians – on the Israeli side and which initially generated a surge in popular solidarity, the views of the American public have indeed undergone a remarkable transformation, polls and analysts say.\n\nFueled by mounting dissent over the war in Gaza, which has left more than 67,000 Palestinians dead and produced searing images of widespread starvation, popular support for Israel has plummeted to previously unseen levels – while sympathy for the Palestinian cause has risen.\n\nThe effect was apparent in Michigan this week when Mallory McMorrow, one of El-Sayed’s Democratic opponents in a three-way party primary to replace the retiring senator Gary Peters, publicly agreed with El-Sayed’s characterization of the conflict as “genocide”.\n\nPoliticians – Democratic and Republican – who would once have bitten their tongues rather than voice the mildest criticism of Israel, now openly decry the long-running Gaza offensive, a small but growing number calling it a genocide.\n\nThis public breast-beating has done nothing to ease the Palestinians’ plight, or interrupt the billions of dollars of US military aid flowing to Israel; several election cycles may be needed for the policy impact to filter through. Yet analysts believe the change in public opinion to be so fundamental as to represent a permanent shift.\n\nSignificantly, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) – for years the most influential pro-Israel lobby group, which has organized primary challenges and boasted of unseating members of Congress deemed too critical or unsupportive – has shown signs of diminishing influence, as senior Democrats reportedly break longstanding ties.\n\nThe seismic shift is even more pronounced among the wider public.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey last week reported that nearly six out of 10 Americans, 59%, now hold a negative view of Israel, while 39% believe it is “going too far” in its war in Gaza – compared with 31% who held the same view a year ago, and 27% who thought this just two months after the war started. A poll from the same organization in 2022 showed 42% with negative views.\n\nThe anti-Israel swing is confirmed by other polls. A recent New York Times/Siena poll showed pro-Palestinians sympathies outscoring support for Israel – albeit narrowly, by 35% to 34%.\n\nAn Economist/You Gov poll in August found that 45% of the public believe Israel is committing genocide – a charge Israel vociferously denies – compared with only 31% who disagreed. About four in 10 American Jews believe the same, according to a new Washington Post poll.\n\nThe change has been more acute among Democrats, where support for Israel is declining among all voter groups – with potentially profound implications for future elections and US foreign policy.\n\n“A debate is brewing among Democrats that is certain to appear in the Democratic presidential primaries, and it will not be a comfortable debate within the party,” said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a recent report on Israel’s eroding support.\n\n“If the next president is a Democrat, there will be a mix of views represented in the White House, and that itself will have an impact on governance,” he continued.\n\nThe shift has propelled upstart candidates who have publicly identified themselves with the Palestinian cause. The most notable has been Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who triumphed in a Democratic primary to become the party’s candidate for New York mayor after championing Palestinian rights.\n\nAnother is El-Sayed, in his campaign to be the party’s Senate candidate in Michigan, a traditional election swing state and home to a significant bloc of Arab American voters who swung in significant numbers to support Donald Trump in last November’s presidential election because of disenchantment with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s support for Israel’s Gaza offensive.\n\nEl-Sayed, a former public health official, said his campaign had revealed an altered view of the conflict irrespective of background.\n\n“I’ve gone to a lot of communities where there are no Arab or Muslim residents and when I when I talk about this issue, there’s a collective sigh of relief,” he said in an interview.\n\n“People think, ‘Finally there’s a politician who’s willing to name the obvious … our tax dollars are being sent abroad to do unspeakable things instead of investing here at home.’\n\n“Over the past few years, we’ve watched as life has become more unaffordable. People are struggling to afford everything from groceries to gas to healthcare, watching their schools crumble.\n\n“So the idea that our tax dollars that could be used to invest in our children here at home are instead being used to destroy other children is beyond the pale for a lot of folks.”\n\n‘The last extremely Zionist-inclined administration’\n\nRepublicans are encountering their own version of skepticism over support for Israel.\n\nWhile voters over 50, according to the Brookings study, remain staunchly supportive of Israel, a drift has been discernible among younger Republicans, many of whom see unconditional backing for Israel as clashing with Donald Trump’s commitments to avoid foreign entanglements.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right member of Congress from Georgia, made headlines in July by labelling Israel’s actions in Gaza “genocide”, several weeks before Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont, did the same.\n\nTrump has taken note. Talking to the Daily Caller in September, the president – who last week unveiled a plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, standing alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – said Israel had lost political influence in Washington.\n\n“Israel was the strongest lobby I’ve ever seen. They had total control over Congress, and now they don’t,” he said.\n\nGrowing restiveness among his Maga base may have spurred Trump into trying to end the war with greater urgency, although the results remain to be seen.\n\nSome supporters say the disenchantment is generational.\n\nCurtis Mills, executive director of the American Conservative, a magazine originally founded to oppose the US-led invasion of Iraq, and which has long railed against the US alliance with Israel, said Trump’s presidency could be “the last baby boomer, conservative, extremely Zionist-inclined administration”.\n\n“The US has been involved in foreign policy adventures at the behest of the Israeli cause for decades, and it hasn’t worked for the United States – it’s worked for Benjamin Netanyahu,” he said. “For people under 40, 30, or even 20, when it’s the Middle East, again, again, again, the gag reflex is going into full effect. And I think it’s becoming bipartisan.”\n\nHe continued: “The average age of a congressman is in the mid-60s, so this is not going to be expressed in legislative power today or even in the next Congress. But for under-50s, I think the Israel issue is dead on arrival.\n\n“It is unlikely that the [next] Republican [presidential] candidate will be nearly as pro-Israel as previous Republican candidates have been.”\n\nFor now, the clearest signs of a sea change may be in Washington, where Aipac – long the dominant pro-Israel lobby group – is losing ground to traditionally smaller organisations.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, had accepted the endorsement of J Street, a center-left group that has criticised Netanyahu’s government and favors a two-state solution to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\n“For a long time, Aipac was the biggest kid on the block,” said Galston, of the Brookings Institution. “It will be a more equal fight in the next cycle.”\n\nMarshall Wittmann, Aipac’s spokesman, cited a Senate vote in July defeating a motion backed by Sanders seeking to halt US arms sales to Israel as proof that Congress remains pro-Israel. While senators voted against the resolution to block the sale of assault rifles, a majority of Democrats present in the chamber, voted in favour.\n\n“Polls fluctuate, but the reality is that Israel is fighting a just and moral war against a barbaric enemy that savagely attacked the Jewish state on October 7 and continues to hold 48 hostages,” he wrote in an email. “It is entirely consistent with American interests and values to stand with a democratic ally as it battles Hamas and other Iranian terrorist proxies.”\n\nBut Galston predicted that future policymakers would not see Israel in same David-and-Goliath image that once shaped the US view.\n\n“Joe Biden will surely be the last [Democratic] president whose views were shaped by the early years of Israel, its astonishing victory in 1967 [in the six-day war], and by the fact that Israel was a beleaguered underdog for decades,” he said.\n\n“That has all changed.”","summary":"Fueled by dissent over the war in Gaza, the US public’s views are changing – and support for the Palestinians is rising\n\nThey seemed to be the ties that would for ever bind.\n\nFor three-quarters of a century, unshakable support for Israel – in the form of military aid and diplomatic backing, and underpinned by broad public sentiment – has been an indelible feature of the US political landscape.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72a6556e129db36e9d0e604371a9897077e0af49/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 13:00:33","author":"Robert Tait","authors":["Robert Tait"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":367429264,"title":"Did Kamala Harris write herself out of the 2028 race&quest;","text":"Two absolute essentials must accompany any candidate who seeks to make a serious run for president, or even lesser but still powerful jobs like governor or U.S. senator:\n\nNo one can make a serious run without serious funding. So multiple sources of big money are a must. So are major allies. Not only do they go on the road as surrogates at times, but they recruit other supporters, some of whom provide the first essential, big money.\n\nFor a candidate to alienate the most powerful individuals in their political party even before a race gets going seriously is an unheard-of no-no.\n\nBut that is what former Vice President Kamala Harris may have done in her campaign memoir “107 Days,” published in a season when many candidates issue bland autobiographical tomes that purport to carry important messages aimed to draw millions of voters. Most don’t attract many voters, while also containing few important messages.\n\nThe new Harris book is different. It’s almost like a deliberate effort to alienate potential supporters and snub her nose at the money they might be capable of raising.\n\nTake her complaint about Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who she briefly considered as her vice presidential running mate in 2024: He was initially reluctant or non-committal when she asked for his endorsement just after ex-President Joe Biden gave up the Democratic nomination for his office and handed it off to Harris.\n\nDid Pritzker want a day or two to determine whether the party would accept Biden’s edict and quickly anoint Harris as the candidate? Did he want to be offered an incentive?\n\nBoth would have been reasonable responses to Harris’ quick ascension.\n\nBut his pace did not satisfy Harris, a fact now announced in print. So much for Pritzker’s support if Harris runs again in 2028.\n\nAnd there’s her response to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, her fellow endorsee of former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, and her longtime supposed friend and stablemate (they’ve shared campaign consultants).\n\nShe claims he didn’t take her first call after Biden dropped out, texting back “Hiking. Will call back.” He didn’t do that. So even though he did issue a full endorsement within hours, that was too slow for Harris, who apparently expects her colleagues to ask “how high” the moment she says “jump.”\n\nIf this sounds like minor byplay, that’s what it should have been. It probably wasn’t worth a mention in her book, or any other, but reflects an irritability that hasn’t worked well for any modern presidential candidate except Donald Trump. The rest have all tried to appear universally amiable.\n\nHarris sprinkled other, similar, bon mots though her book. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, whom she considered for vice president, is “overly ambitious (and) confident,” Harris writes, and “would want to be in the room for every major decision.” Shouldn’t any veep want that?\n\nIf someone wanted to alienate powerful Democrats, it would be difficult to do it more thoroughly than Harris seems to have tried to do. Mark Kelly, senator from Arizona, “lacks political battle scars.” Does that mean he’s too popular, for he certainly has other kinds of scars as the steadfast, supportive husband of onetime assassination target Gabby Giffords.\n\nAll of which raises the question of whether Harris really wants to run for president again. Would she have criticized so many powerful Democrats if she were hungry for both their support and the further backing they could bring along in 2028?\n\nHarris plainly didn’t want to be governor of California, or go through the rough campaign that she’d need to win that job. Now she’s also given voters plenty of reason to wonder how much she wants to be president.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.","summary":"Did Kamala Harris write herself out of the 2028 race&quest;","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/10/06/did-kamala-harris-write-herself-out-of-the-2028-race/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LDN-L-KAMALA-HARRIS-1001-01.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 12:33:38","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":367429260,"title":"Newsom and Trump prepare for damage control following government shutdown","text":"As the country goes through its first government shutdown in nearly seven years, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Trump find themselves in a vulnerable moment that could make-or-break their standing with voters in the months ahead.\n\nIndeed, the stakes are high across the aisle as the shutdown begins to creep its way into the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans through mass layoffs, increased insurance costs, and cuts to funding for vital programs.\n\nAnd in California – a state that employs over 150,000 federal workers – these repercussions will likely be felt the hardest.\n\nFor the last decade, California has steadily expanded access to healthcare coverage, implementing tools like auto-enrollment and “shop-and-compare” that have made attaining financial help easy. Now, the shutdown puts that – and more – in danger.\n\nMost jarringly, California officials warned that, due to expiring Obamacare subsidies, monthly premiums may double, causing as many as 400,000 people – almost a quarter of total enrollees in the state – to drop out of the nation’s largest health insurance marketplace.\n\nBut Californians aren’t the only ones bracing for impact – blue states nationwide are also in jeopardy of feeling the shockwaves from the shutdown as President Trump targets Democrat-backed programs while shielding those that align with his own priorities, like mass deportation and tariff efforts.\n\nIndeed, it’s important to note that the negatives of the shutdown for Democrats don’t come without a long list of positives for Trump and his Republican base: reducing the size and scope of government, accelerating the ability to impose time limits and work requirements on Medicaid, and curbing excessive federal spending. \n\n“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,” the president said in the Oval Office Tuesday. “Cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.”\n\nHowever, Trump’s gamble carries real risks for the future of the Republican party. If ordinary Americans – especially conservatives – feel that the shutdown has gone on too long, he could be viewed as putting ideology over stability, undermining the very political advantage he hopes to build.\n\nIt is this high-risk, high-reward formula that defines what one former Trump official has called his “strategic” approach: an attempt to inflict maximum pain on Democrats in the hopes that it’ll add to the chaos already surrounding the party.\n\nAnd after the bombshell book drop by former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party is in no need of any more internal disarray and scrutiny.\n\nPut another way, it’s crucial that Democrats successfully handle the consequences of the shutdown. If not, they are in peril of deepening the wounds they’ve been trying to heal since November.\n\nFor Newsom specifically, the shutdown presents an opportunity to cement himself as the only Democrat able to fight back against Trump – an effort he’s been working towards since the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\nJust after the midnight funding deadline last night, Newsom mocked the president’s signature social media style, writing on X that Trump is “a very weak man” in all-caps.\n\nNonetheless, it’s clear that Newsom is ready to put a stop to MAGA’s antics – the question that remains is whether the governor will be the leader Democrats need to do so.\n\nWhile early numbers show Newsom leading in three of the five most recent polls compiled by RealClearPolitics – averaging a 5.5-point advantage– how he tackles the shutdown could prove to be yet another do-or-die moment in his career.\n\nIf he manages it well, Newsom could be seen as a Democrat who offers real, effective solutions to the nation’s most hard-hitting problems – natural disasters, social tensions, economic crises, and now a government shutdown.\n\nFollowing the release of Harris’ “107 Days,” it’s evident that the Democratic electorate is looking for a standard-bearer who can unite Americans in times of need, not divide them further. \n\nAnd if Newsom can prove to do just that – while also maintaining moderate, common-sense stances on pertinent issues like the economy and immigration – he may have what it takes to make a true bid for the Oval Office.\n\nAlthough it’s too soon to see the effects of the shutdown on Newsom and Trump, whether good or bad, they’re sure to be critical in determining who will call the White House home come 2028.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Newsom and Trump prepare for damage control following government shutdown","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/10/06/newsom-and-trump-prepare-for-damage-control-following-government-shutdown/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LDN-L-FIRE-6MO-CHANGES-0706-AP.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 12:32:59","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":367359176,"title":"Sunrise Movement’s New Focus: Fighting Authoritarianism","text":"This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.As the Trump administration cracks down on both environmental policies and progressive activism, the Sunrise Movement, the youth-led climate justice organization that popularized calls for a Green New Deal, is widening its mission to fight authoritarianism.\n\n“Every day, Donald Trump is seizing power and shredding the Constitution,” Sunrise’s executive director, Aru Shiney-Ajay, wrote in an open letter to Sunrise members, funders and allies. “What ordinary people do in the coming months will determine whether he and his billionaire cronies can cement their grip on power and turn this country into a playground for the rich and powerful.”\n\nUnlike the majority of Sunrise’s past work, its newer efforts will not necessarily center the climate crisis. But Stevie O’Hanlon, a co-founder and spokesperson for Sunrise, said the projects will aim to build a world where climate action is possible.\n\n“In order to win the bold action that we’ll need to prevent climate catastrophe, we’re going to need a country where we have the right to dissent and protest,” she said. “How are we going to win on climate under authoritarianism?”\n\nOne key focus will be campus organizing to urge schools to resist Trump’s attempts to control their curricula and rules around political dissent, the letter from Shiney-Ajay says. Another will be garnering rapid responses to the administration’s deployment of troops and immigration policies to cities, and attempts to “infringe on our First Amendment rights.” And a third expansion area will be training young activists to “recognize authoritarianism” and resist it using nonviolent tactics.\n\nThe missive formalizes work already underway at Sunrise. Last month, the group helped organize student walkouts at four Washington, DC, universities to protest Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and their intimidation of activists and immigrants. Two weeks later, the organization staged a comedy show-cum-demonstration outside ABC’s New York headquarters in response to the network’s temporary suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”.\n\nChapters have been taking on localized fights for free speech and immigrant rights, as well. At Duke University’s Sunrise chapter, activists have focused on protecting a beloved campus bus driver whose temporary protected status was revoked by the Trump administration last month—and who subsequently lost his job of 20 years. They are also urging school officials to overturn anti-protest policies and developing pro-worker campaigns alongside labor justice groups.\n\n“In order to win a Green New Deal, climate justice, labor justice, racial justice, etc…we’re gonna need to defeat authoritarianism,” said Artivista Karlin, a junior at Duke University who organizes with the campus Sunrise chapter, who said that under Trump, the US has seen an “unprecedented manifestation of fascism.”\n\nFuture Sunrise Movement efforts could include nationwide efforts to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, campaigns to back city officials standing up to Trump, and actions to resist Republicans’ cuts to healthcare programs. The organization will also build toward a mass student mobilization on May 1, 2028, when United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain has called for a general strike.\n\nThe refocus comes seven years after Sunrise captured national headlines when its members stormed the office of then incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi. Joined by then freshman New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the group demanded the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the creation of good jobs, and the strengthening of social programs across the US. The policy platform, which they called the Green New Deal, helped inspire some of Joe Biden’s green policies, most notably the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nO’Hanlon sees the new tactics as an outgrowth of the fight for a Green New Deal, which highlighted how climate is intertwined with all other major social issues.\n\n“The Green New Deal is critical for laying out an alternative world from the one that Donald Trump is portraying,” she said. “We’re going to keep talking about that, keep fighting for that vision, but in the short term, we need to also be confronting, their assault on our communities and on our rights.”\n\nThe shift also comes as climate concerns slip slightly down the list of electoral concerns in favor of economic issues, though evidence shows most people still want to draw down emissions. “My guess is you’re not going to see a lot of politicians using the word ‘climate,’ because people see that as a nice-to-have [concern], not a must-have, and right now they’re in the must-have mode,” Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, told reporters in New York last month.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris last year came under fire for messaging around the threat Trump poses to democracy, rather than economic concerns, with some blaming the shift for her loss of the 2024 election. But O’Hanlon says concerns about authoritarianism feel more potent to Americans amid current attacks from the administration, and that Sunrise’s new campaigns will be far more concrete than Harris’s.\n\n“A lot of the messaging on the Harris campaign was focused on this abstract idea of democracy, of saving democracy, but I think most people in this country feel like democracy is pretty broken,” she said. “When you’re talking about saving democracy, then people understand that as saving a broken political system that very, very few people think is working, and Donald Trump was able to position himself as the person who is going to disrupt and change the broken system.”\n\nSunrise, by contrast, will focus on the need for major changes, including the removal of corporate interests such as the fossil fuel industry from politics.\n\n“We’re being very clear that yes, we need to defend rights to free speech, [but] we also need to be serious about overhauling our democracy so that we are not in a situation where someone like Donald Trump can consolidate power in this kind of way ever again,” O’Hanlon said.\n\nThe expansion comes amid an all-out assault from the White House on both green protections and progressive organizing. Since January, the president has rolled back hundreds of environmental rules demolished Biden-era incentives for carbon-free technologies. In recent weeks he also designated the decentralized antifascist movement, antifa, a “terrorist organization,” and issued a memorandum aimed at reining in what he calls the radical leftwing domestic “terror network.”\n\nLast week, Trump said George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who funds the Open Society Foundations (OSF), is “a likely candidate” for prosecution for unspecified charges. Sunrise obtained $2.1 million from the foundations between 2019 and 2023, OSF’s website shows.\n\n“We will raise our voices against this authoritarian abuse of power,” Shiney-Ajay said.\n\nTrump this week also posted Trump 2028 hats on social media, indicating interest in a potential, unconstitutional third term. “We are just seeing outright disrespect for our constitutional rights, and we can’t accept that,” said O’Hanlon.","summary":"This story was originally published by&#160;the Guardian&#160;and is reproduced here as part of the&#160;Climate Desk&#160;collaboration.

But don't forget that former President Joe Biden's administration also weaponized the state against its enemies. It just did so quietly, behind the scenes, and with the approval of much of the media. The Biden administration not only leaned on tech companies to muzzle critics of the powers-that-be, but it also turned due-process-free watchlists into means of harassing people it didn't like.\n\nWeaponized Watchlists\n\nOn September 30, \"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the results of an internal investigation uncovering widespread abuses committed by Biden administration officials, who weaponized the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) against innocent American citizens,\" according to a TSA press release.\n\nThe Biden administration is accused of adding people who \"resisted mask mandates on airplanes nearly six months after the CDC relaxed its indoor mask mandate\" to watchlists that subjected them to extra security. It also watchlisted not just participants in the January 6, 2021 riot, but also those merely suspected of traveling to the Washington, D.C. area in sympathy with the protesters. \"This targeted campaign of harassment continued through June 2021, six months after the events in question, despite no clear or immediate threat to aviation security.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n\nWith regard to the specifics of those watchlist inclusions, Sen. Rand Paul (R–Ky.) released documents acquired by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee held a September 30 hearing on the \"weaponization of the Quiet Skies program,\" a TSA watchlist scheme terminated after it was found to have been abused for political purposes.\n\nIt's been reported that former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D–Hawaii), now the Director of National Intelligence, was placed on the Quiet Skies watchlist. The Biden administration claimed her inclusion was, in part, because she attended a Vatican event organized by a suspicious European. But she and many others believe it was retaliation for her criticism of then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Journalist Matt Taibbi reports that Gabbard's name was on the list alongside three unnamed Republican members of Congress who also offended the powers that be. But you didn't have to have a high profile to get on a watchlist.\n\nNo 'Specific Information?' Watchlist Them Anyway\n\nA January 15, 2021 TSA document released by Paul directs that \"Placement on the TSA Watchlist (Deny Boarding) is appropriate for…individuals who unlawfully entered the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021,\" engaged in violent conduct at the Capitol, possessed weapons there, or threatened government personnel and others. The behavior described is disturbing, but as is customary with the government's watchlists, there's no provision for due process; we're supposed to assume that whoever sticks names on the watchlists gets it right without mistake or malice. Even more concerning is that \"individuals responsible for organizing or inciting seditious conduct\" were also supposed to be barred from air travel, despite the difficulty of proving such a rarely charged crime in a court of law.\n\nThe same document prescribed placement on the TSA Watchlist (Enhanced Screening) for \"individuals suspected of traveling to the National Capitol Region in conjunction with the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and who are believed to pose an elevated risk of domestic terrorism, but for whom there is a current lack of specific information relating to unlawful entry into the U.S. Capitol, violent acts in support of the January 6, 2021 attack, or incitement of the same.\" That is, the feds couldn't prove that some people might have been involved in the January 6 riot but decided to screw them over anyway.\n\nDesignated for \"placement on the TSA Watch List (Security Notification)\" were those who \"harass or threaten the harassment of security personnel, flight crew, or passengers in conjunction with either the Presidential transition or requirements to wear personal protective equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The mask wars took to the air even though the cloth masks forced on most people did little or nothing to prevent transmission (well-fitting N95 masks work, but few people had them).\n\nWhen Incompetence Meets Malice\n\nThe problem with watchlisting people accused of, but not proven to have engaged in, crimes—or those merely suspected of being in the vicinity—is illustrated by the case of Christine Crowder. Her husband, Mark Crowder, a senior air marshal, told the Senate Quiet Skies hearing that, in the course of his duties, \"I discovered my wife, Christine…had been flagged in the system as a domestic terrorist, falsely accused of entering the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\" Crowder brought the situation to the attention of his superiors but was told to let the situation run its course. At one time, he said, as an air marshal on a flight with his wife, the team surveilling her had to coordinate with him.\n\nOverall, he warned, \"politically motivated priorities diverted critical resources from genuine security threats.\" He described what he saw as \"a weaponization of federal law enforcement to harass and intimidate citizens exercising their constitutional rights.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time we've seen watchlists abused—and the failure of their inadequate-to-nonexistent safeguards. The ACLU has long warned that \"the U.S. government maintains a massive watchlist system that risks stigmatizing hundreds of thousands of people—including U.S. citizens—as terrorism suspects based on vague, overbroad, and often secret standards and evidence.\" In the past, people were most often placed on the lists because of unproven allegations of Islamist terrorism. Now political activities can get people labeled as \"domestic violent extremists\" and placed on the lists.\n\nWatchlists are such easy tools to abuse. You open your mouth one day, and suddenly your life becomes much more difficult—and there's no easy appeal because you haven't been found guilty of anything. You're just harassed until your tormenters get bored and move on.\n\nIt's understandable that those who were watchlisted and subject to surveillance, like those who were muzzled by behind-the-scenes pressure brought on private companies to suppress criticism of the last administration, are enraged by these revelations. Who wouldn't want payback?\n\nWhat we don't need, though, is a return round of politicized prosecutions and targeting of foes of the current White House and its allies. That doesn't end the problem, it normalizes it. The people who did the targeting should be punished. More importantly, though, their toys should be taken away: no more watchlists, no more leaning on private companies. Anything that even looks like the targeting of people should require due process. Then, maybe, we can stop the cycle of targeting and retaliation.","summary":"The former Biden administration is accused of punishing critics without due process.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/10/08/tsa-watchlists-were-used-as-tools-of-political-warfare/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tsa-security-checkpoint-man-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 11:00:58","author":"J.D.

However, while attending A Day of Unreasonable Conversation summit in Los Angeles on Monday, Harris drew attention to herself not because of her book but because of her comment on the Trump administration. \n\nTalking about the current US government, Harris said, “[T]here is so much about this moment that is trying to make people feel like they’ve lost their minds, when in fact, these [expletive language] are crazy.” The usage of such crude words evoked laughter from the left-leaning audience but was naturally not very well taken by The White House.\n\nWhen White House spokesperson Kush Desai was asked about Harris’ remarks, he did not hold back. Talking to TMZ, Desai said, “Kamala Harris should listen to an audio recording of her cackle of a laugh before calling anyone crazy.”\n\nIt should be noted here that Harris’ laughter has been a talking point about her personality in various stages of her personal and political life. Even during election campaigns, her burst of cackles was subjected to scrutiny, and it was even questioned if those showed her honest emotions or were just a quirk.\n\nHowever, Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff has a very different opinion about her laugh. Talking about how he fell in love with her laugh, Emhoff had said, “She called me back and we talked for an hour. We laughed — you know that laugh! I love that laugh,” as The New York Post reported.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nRegardless of what people’s opinion remains about Harris’ cackle, she has been doing that for years now, and it has become a part of who she is. Despite various kinds of negative comments, Harris has not stopped commenting on the Trump administration during her book tour.\n\nAt a San Francisco event on Sunday, Harris said, “Part of this moment requires us to also debunk some of this stuff they’re trying to sell the American people: to scapegoat, instead of owning up to the responsibility that the powerful have to have some level of concern and care, if not just basic curiosity for the well-being of other people.”\n\nThe last election was a disaster for the Dems after Joe Biden pulled out of the campaign. In 107 Days, Harris has talked about her failed presidential campaign and has also commented on her dynamics with fellow Democrats.\n\nHowever, Harris’ book has not sat well with a number of Democrats who have felt that they have been portrayed in the wrong light. Despite the clear disappointment of some of her party members, Harris has gone ahead with promoting the book and also ensuring to bash the Republicans through all the promotional events.","summary":"Kamala Harris is bashing the Trump administration on her book tour.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-calls-trump-team-crazy-in-cuss-filled-rant-white-house-mocks-her-laugh-in-response","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kamala-Harris-is-promoting-her-new-book.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 10:41:30","author":"Pramila Tripathi,The White House","authors":["Pramila Tripathi","The White House"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.065},{"id":367408528,"title":"Bari Weiss is a weird and worrisome choice as top editor for CBS News | Margaret Sullivan","text":"If you’re old enough to have admired CBS in its heyday, watching its decline has been painful.\n\nDecades ago, it was dubbed the Tiffany Network – home of the great journalist Walter Cronkite (“the most trusted man in America”), and innovator of the top-flight magazine program, 60 Minutes.\n\nEven outside its news division, the network was a place where the variety-show host Ed Sullivan could break down racial exclusion by inviting outstanding Black entertainers to his Sunday night program; that was controversial in an era of intense racial turmoil. The CBS news department had some of the best journalists in the nation, and the corporation itself exuded a sense of public mission.\n\nBut on Monday, when Bari Weiss was named editor-in-chief of CBS News, it was the latest turn in the network’s confounding departure from its roots.\n\nGiven her lack of experience in news, “placing Weiss at or near the helm of a television news division makes no more sense than it would have, a generation ago, to have given such a role to William F Buckley of the National Review or Victor Navasky of The Nation,” wrote Richard Tofel, an astute media observer, formerly of the Wall Street Journal and ProPublica, mentioning conservative and liberal opinionators of their era.\n\nWeiss – a staunch Zionist and a fierce opponent of supposed wokeness and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives – famously left the New York Times opinion section, claiming she had been bullied by her colleagues for her beliefs. She started a Substack newsletter and eventually founded the wildly successful website Free Press.\n\nHer rise has been meteoric. She “has ascended the mountain of journalism on a slingshot”, Jessica Testa of the New York Times put it this week.\n\nTo her many critics, her appointment was just one more step on the shameful path that CBS has trod since Donald Trump was elected to a second term.\n\nThe network caved to the US president when its parent company, Paramount, settled a lawsuit it could have won, sending millions of dollars for a future presidential library. Trump claimed that he was harmed during last year’s presidential campaign by the editing (actually, quite routine) of a 60 Minutes interview of his then rival Kamala Harris. Not only did the company settle the case, but now it has decided not to edit taped interviews with political figures on its Sunday morning Face the Nation – a dubious idea at best, and another piece of capitulation to Trump.\n\nThe longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes quit a few months ago, saying he feared the loss of his prized editorial independence; and the network’s evening newscast ratings continue to lag their competitors. Recently, the company named an ombudsman for CBS News – someone with no news experience – to monitor claims of bias, but with no arrangement to communicate regularly to the public, as normal news ombudsmen or public editors have.\n\nOthers were much harsher than Tofel in their criticism, noting that Paramount paid an astonishing $150m for Weiss’s site, Free Press. Paramount is led these days by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest people, and Weiss is very much his pick to led CBS News; the corporate press release said she will, among other things, “reshape editorial priorities”. She will report directly to Ellison, rather than to the CBS News president, a more traditional arrangement.\n\n“Like Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the deal can be understood as part of a broader elite project to smudge the lenses through which many people see the world,” wrote the Defector’s Patrick Redford. “By installing Weiss, the richest people in the world have taken another step toward ushering in the toothless, acquiescent future of mainstream media they’ve always wanted.”\n\nCertainly, that is something that Trump and his allies have worked relentlessly for.\n\nRedford called it “yet another victory of marketing over its natural enemy, journalism”.\n\nAs she took the helm, Weiss sent around a friendly-sounding note to the news staff that had one particularly notable line. Among her “core journalistic values”, she wrote, is “journalism that holds both American political parties to equal scrutiny”.\n\nSounds good, but the two parties are far from equal these days.\n\n“CBS should brace for a heavy dose of bothsiderism,” wrote Oliver Darcy in his Status newsletter, observing that the Free Press has, as its central thesis, “that Trump and his supporters are largely right about the cultural rot of the woke-elite” and liberal overreach (wokeness) is a bigger problem than Trump’s existential threats to American democracy.\n\nAs independent media gains influence, it may not matter very much any more who leads a major TV network. Certainly, it matters far less now than in the years when CBS ruled the airwaves.\n\nBut it is telling that Weiss – such a polarizing provocateur herself – has been chosen to reinvent the most mainstream of legacy networks at this fraught and dangerous time in the US.\n\n Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture","summary":"When Weiss was named editor-in-chief, it was the latest turn in the network’s confounding departure from its roots\n\nIf you’re old enough to have admired CBS in its heyday, watching its decline has been painful.\n\nDecades ago, it was dubbed the Tiffany Network – home of the great journalist Walter Cronkite (“the most trusted man in America”), and innovator of the top-flight magazine program, 60 Minutes.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/08/bari-weiss-cbs-news","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45640ee2baefce165a9153403b5123ae7f12c742/88_0_879_703/master/879.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2lt","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 10:00:29","author":"Margaret Sullivan","authors":["Margaret Sullivan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":367408502,"title":"If a four-year-old can pronounce a name correctly, so can a politician | Arwa Mahdawi","text":"Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who is likely to be New York City’s next mayor, became a household name this year – but that doesn’t mean Andrew Cuomo knows how to pronounce it.

Perdue is now Trump’s ambassador to China, a job he’s clearly earned through diplomacy and respect for other cultures.\n\nOf course, Trump himself repeatedly mispronounced “Kamala” while running against her. Although, to be fair, he does have trouble getting his mouth to work properly and has botched basic words like “origins” (oranges in Trumpspeak) and “suspected”.

In general, defendants like Comey who are told to self-surrender are released on their own recognizance, meaning they aren't required to post bail, but they sometimes can be forced to pay a \"recognizance bond\" if they don't show up to court, said Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.And the judge could set either a trial date or a date to hear motions. There is some speculation that Comey will file a motion to have the charges dismissed, either by alleging he is a victim of vindictive prosecution or by arguing the U.S. attorney who brought the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was appointed invalidly. But it's not clear what his lawyer, former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, will do.\"Patrick Fitzgerald is a hell of a lawyer, and I would not want to pre-guess what strategy he's going to follow here,\" said Epner.The arraignment will take place in open court, but cameras aren't allowed.Typically, defendants are also booked on the same day that they surrender for their arraignment, which would involve authorities taking photos and fingerprints and checking for outstanding warrants, according to Epner.Even though Comey's lawyer was issued a summons, FBI leadership considered carrying out a \"showy\" arrest and \"perp walk\" before his arraignment, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News last week. Some FBI supervisors pushed back on the plan, and one was suspended, a source said.Epner said: \"I can't imagine a magistrate signing an arrest warrant at this point.\"Where is Comey's arraignment taking place?Comey will be arraigned at a courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, which is part of the Eastern District of Virginia. The case is likely being heard there because the charges are based on a 2020 Senate hearing that Comey attended remotely from his Virginia home.If the case goes to trial, Comey will face a jury pool made up of residents of the Washington, D.C., suburbs — an area that generally disfavors President Trump. Some 62.6% of voters in the eastern district's Alexandria division voted for Democrat Kamala Harris last year, and 34.1% voted for Mr. Trump. The division includes Alexandria and several other cities and counties in northern Virginia.Who is the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan?The case against Comey is being overseen by Halligan, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who was sworn into the role just days before Comey was indicted.A former Florida insurance lawyer, Halligan previously worked as a personal attorney to Mr. Trump, and was part of his defense team in a federal case accusing him of mishandling classified documents. More recently, Halligan worked as a White House aide.She took over the office after the resignation of former acting U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert.In an unusual move, Halligan has handled parts of the prosecution herself so far. She personally signed Comey's indictment and appeared in court when the grand jury returned the indictment.Two assistant U.S. attorneys from the Eastern District of North Carolina were also added to the case Tuesday: Gabriel Diaz and Nathaniel Lemons.Who is Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald?Comey is being represented by Fitzgerald, a well-known attorney who retired as a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in 2023.Fitzgerald was named special counsel in George W. Bush's administration, to investigate a 2003 leak that revealed the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame. He also served as U.S. attorney in Chicago for more than a decade, overseeing the prosecution of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Who is Judge Nachmanoff?Nachmanoff was assigned to oversee Comey's case. He was nominated to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in a 52-46 vote. Three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting yes: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.Nachmanoff previously worked in the district as a public defender and magistrate judge. While in the latter role, he oversaw the 2019 arraignment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two players in Mr. Trump's first impeachment who were charged with campaign finance violations.Mr. Trump has attacked Nachmanoff, writing on Truth Social that Comey \"was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he's off to a very good start.\"What is Comey charged with?The first count accuses him of making a false statement in a September 2020 Senate hearing. Prosecutors allege Comey falsely asserted he had never authorized an FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton. In a testy back-and-forth five years ago, Comey told Republican Sen. Ted Cruz that he stood by testimony he gave in 2017 in which he said he didn't approve any anonymous sources.The indictment does not explain the substance of the alleged leak or specify which FBI staffer Comey is accused of giving permission to leak.Cruz's questions focused on an incident in which Comey and his onetime deputy, Andrew McCabe, gave inconsistent stories about a 2016 Wall Street Journal article on one of the FBI's Clinton probes. McCabe said he told Comey after the story came out that McCabe had authorized staffers to talk to the Journal, but Comey says McCabe told him no such thing. The Justice Department's internal watchdog sided with Comey and found McCabe lacked candor.In a CNN interview, McCabe said he hasn't been approached by the FBI in connection with the Comey probe and doubted the indictment was about him, noting that he didn't ask Comey for permission to release information to the media because he didn't need permission.Comey has also been probed by the Justice Department's watchdog for releasing memos on his interactions with Mr. Trump to his friend, Daniel Richman, who shared their contents to the New York Times. The watchdog found Comey violated FBI policies but didn't leak classified material.The second count against Comey accuses him of obstructing a congressional proceeding by \"making false and misleading statements\" in the same 2020 hearing.And in a rare move, the grand jury declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress in the 2020 hearing, relating to testimony Comey gave lawmakers that he didn't remember getting a tip from the intelligence community referring to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump.Many critics believe the Comey indictment is the result of Mr. Trump's determination to punish a longtime political foe. The president fired Comey in 2017, and the two have traded barbs since then. Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey before he was charged, and the president celebrated the indictment shortly after it was handed down.Before Comey was charged, some staff in the Office of the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia circulated a memo arguing charges should not be brought, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.The Justice Department has defended its handling of the case. After Comey was indicted, Bondi said in a statement the move \"reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"","summary":"Former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime foe of President Trump, will appear in Virginia for an arraignment, in his first court appearance since being criminally charged.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-james-comey-arraignment-doj-trump-what-to-expect/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/26/cbf6a58f-b8f4-4f0f-b014-f03ee8282d34/thumbnail/1200x630/e084d842dcaac8c3aafdf23475ba9740/ap25268839866933.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 10:00:13","author":"Joe Walsh","authors":["Joe Walsh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":367346320,"title":"'I don't want this all on camera,' gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter says in testy interview","text":"Former Rep. Katie Porter, the 2026 gubernatorial candidate who has a narrow edge in the polls, raised eyebrows Tuesday when footage emerged of her apparently ending a television interview after becoming irritated by a reporter's questions. The footage shows CBS Sacramento reporter Julie Watts asking Porter, a Democrat, what she would say to the nearly 6.1 million Californians who voted for President Trump in 2024, and the UC Irvine law professor responding that she didn’t need their support if she competed against a Republican in the November 2026 run-off election to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom. After Porter highlighted her experience winning a closely divided Orange County congressional district, she grew palpably irritated by Watts’ follow-up questions about her dismissiveness about needing support from voters who supported Trump. “I feel like this is unnecessarily argumentative. What is your question?” Porter said. Watts responded that she had asked every other candidate similar questions in relation to Proposition 50, the redistricting ballot measure that Newsom and other California Democrats put on the ballot in a special election in November. Porter said she would seek every vote she could win, but then grew testy over follow-up questions. “I don't want to keep doing this. I'm going to call it,” Porter said, saying she objected to multiple follow-up questions. “I want to have a pleasant, positive conversation. … And if every question you're going to make up a follow-up question, then we're never going to get there.” She later said, “I don’t want this all on camera.” Porter, a protege of Mass. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, won election to Congress in 2018 and gained attention for grilling executives and her use of a white board to explain complex policies. The 51-year-old unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2024 and returned to teaching law at UC Irvine. On Tuesday night, Porter’s campaign said that the interview continued for an additional 20 minutes after the heated exchange but did not offer further comment. The former congresswoman’s Democratic rivals in the 2026 gubernatorial race seized on her comments, and Democratic strategists not associated with any candidate in the race also cringed. “When you’re governor, you’re governor of everyone, not just the people in your party. It’s a bad look to say you don’t want or need votes from certain Californians, even those you really disagree with,” said Elizabeth Ashford, who served as a strategist for Govs. Jerry Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger as well as former Vice President Kamala Harris when she was the attorney general of California. “But, also, even good candidates have bad nights,\" Ashford added. \"This was a miss for Katie, but not every interview is going to go great.”","summary":"After a reporter asked Porter what she would say to those who voted for President Trump, the gubernatorial candidate said she wouldn't need their support.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-10-08/katie-porter-interview","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4298c5e/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2F5e%2Fa5c8dd744280912aeade62ff6fed%2F1502626-pol-me-califo","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 10:00:00","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.302},{"id":367280276,"title":"Kamala Harris blasts Trump administration after revealing surprising comment he made to her in private","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris was allegedly cheered by fans after she skewered the Trump administration with a telling four-word statement amid the American leg of her book tour. The admission comes after she revealed what the President allegedly said to her in a 'private' phone call.\n\nThe 60-year-old is currently touring the United States promoting her new political memoir, 107 Days — a book chronicling her failed 2024 Presidential campaign that ensued after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race due to a ‘defense of democracy’.\n\nDescribed by Simon & Schuster CEO Jonathan Karp as one of the bestselling memoirs of the 2020s, 107 Days offers a postmortem of Harris’s unsuccessful run against the Republican ticket, the current sitting US President, Donald Trump.\n\nPromotion for the autobiography has already thrown up some interesting soundbites, including a confession that losing to the father-of-five was ‘as painful as the death of her mother’ and that she believed her political opponent to be a ‘con man’.\n\nNow, the Democrat is going viral for slamming the Trump administration, referring to them as ‘m***erf***ers’\n\nWhile speaking at the Day of Unreasonable Conversation summit in Los Angeles on Monday (October 6), Harris said: “We are living history right now, and you all storytellers are living this. You’re not passive observers, you know that.\n\n“You’re living it, and I would ask you that all the emotions that we are feeling — give those emotions, give that experience to those people that you are writing about and writing for. It gets back to my point about helping people just put a label on it, even if it doesn’t change the circumstance.”\n\nShe continued to tell the gathered crowd in The Getty Center: “Because there is so much about this moment that is trying to make people feel like they’ve lost their minds, when in fact, these m***erf***ers are crazy!”\n\nIt’s reported that fans of the politician began cheering and clapping, causing her to laugh.\n\n“I call this ‘The Freedom Tour,'” she added after the crowd had died down.\n\nThe event, co-chaired by (500) Days of Summer actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, screenwriter Greg Berlanti, and Simpson Street producing partners Kerry Washington and Pilar Savone, also saw Harris discussing Election Night.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the California native explained that she couldn’t ‘articulate anything’ after conceding to Trump.\n\n“I kept saying over and over again, ‘My God, my God.’ I had never felt that level of pain and grief except when my mother died, and I was grieving for the country. I knew what was going to happen,” she confessed.\n\nHarris also used the opportunity to touch on current censorship fears in Hollywood after Jimmy Kimmel’s long-running show was temporarily pulled from the air after he commented on the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“I don’t envy some of the folks who are here, who are in a situation where you are being subtly or maybe not even so subtly being sent signals that now is not the time to speak a certain level of truth with certain level of candor,” she admitted.\n\n“Every person has to make that decision for themselves, right? But there will always be risk associated with speaking truth.”\n\nHarris’ Day of Unreasonable Conversation appearance comes after the stepmom-of-two revealed in 107 Days a surprising comment Trump made to her in private.\n\nThe incident took place following the second assassination attempt on the President’s life, for which Ryan Wesley Routh was found guilty on September 23, despite entering a not-guilty plea. The ex-VP claimed that during a phone call she and Trump had after the September 2024 incident, he promised to be ‘nicer’ to her.\n\nHe allegedly said: \"How do I say bad things about you now? I'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.”\n\nThe businessman is also said to have announced his daughter, Ivanka Trump, as a ‘big fan’ of her.\n\nKamala Harris’ 107 Days is available to purchase now.","summary":"![CDATA[The ex-VP made the confession on stage in Los Angeles]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/kamala-harris-trump-administration-private-comment-039046-20251008","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt32c6ee9c8f35fda5/68e61e87f1c93f162045bf10/kamala-harris-trump-blast.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 09:31:15","author":"Ella Scott","authors":["Ella Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":367284530,"title":"Katie Porter nearly storms out of CBS interview: ‘I don’t want all this on camera’","text":"Newly-released footage of California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter threatening to walk out of a CBS News interview has gone viral in which the Democrat is seen growing flustered by a question and almost tearing her mic off. \n\nThe interview with journalist Julie Watts of CBS News California Investigates, which was conducted last month, hit a snag when the reporter asked the former representative about her prospects of winning over Republicans in the state as she seeks to succeed the term-limited Gavin Newsom.\n\n“What do you say to the 40 percent of California voters, who you’ll need in order to win, who voted for [President Donald] Trump?” Watts asked Porter.\n\n“How would I need them in order to win, ma’am?” Porter responded, seemingly unhappy with the question but chuckling for the camera, before going on to express certainty that she could pick up the remaining 60 percent of non-Trump votes.\n\n“I have stood on my own two feet and won Republican votes before, and that’s not something every candidate in this race can say,” Porter said, referring to her time representing “purple” Orange County.\n\n“But you just said you don’t need those Trump voters,” Watts countered, causing the ex-congresswoman to throw up her hands and say the interview was becoming “unnecessarily argumentative.”\n\nWhen the reporter insisted she had put the same question to all of Porter’s rivals in the race without issue, the latter responded: “I don’t want to keep doing this, I’m going to call it. Thank you.” She then reached for the mic pinned to her lapel and attempted to remove it.\n\nWatts asked if she was serious about terminating the interview, and Porter complained that she was being hit with “seven follow-ups to every single question you ask,” commenting that she had never had to “end an interview” before.\n\nWhen the reporter stood firm and insisted it was her job to ask challenging questions, Porter said: “I don’t want to have an unhappy experience with you and I don’t want this all on camera.”\n\nResponding to the clip being circulated online on Tuesday evening, Watts said on X: “So… looks like 3min of this 30 min segment has gone viral. I hope you’ll want the full segment.”\n\nMedia pundit Mehdi Hasan reacted by expressing dismay that a politician should expect “pleasant positive conversations” rather than substantive questioning by journalists. At the same time, Megyn Kelly gloated: “Are there other terrible interviews with Katie Porter? This is the most entertaining, unifying thing since Tiger King!”\n\nPorter, who lost her bid for the Senate to Adam Schiff last year, is bidding to become California’s first-ever female governor and has attracted the support of the influential grassroots campaign group EMILYs List, which backs female candidates who support abortion rights.\n\nThe progressive, a well-known face nationally from her time in Washington, currently holds a slight lead in the polls ahead of next June’s primary, having benefited from former vice president Kamala Harris’s announcement in August that she would not run. \n\nThirty percent of registered voters who said they would have voted for Harris now plan to support Porter, according to a recent Politico survey. \n\nSixteen percent of that group said they would transfer their support to former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and 11 percent said their next choice was the state’s former health and human services secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nHowever, Porter could face stiffer competition if California Sen. Alex Padilla ultimately decides to enter the race to replace Newsom, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028.\n\nOn the Republican side, her challengers include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton.","summary":"Former congresswoman running to replace term-limited Gavin Newsom angered by question about how she plans to win over Golden State’s Donald Trump voters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/katie-porter-cbs-interview-california-b2841481.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/08/8/09/Katie-Porter.png?crop=2308,1538.7,x0,y18.4&trim=18,0,51,0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 08:54:17","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":367233578,"title":"What are the charges against Boosie Badazz?

Lobbyists Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl will be working on the rapper's case.Boosie Badazz, whose real name is Torence Ivy Hatch Jr., was arrested in May 2023 in San Diego after he was seen with a firearm in an Instagram post. As per Complex, the rapper had decided to take a plea deal, hoping to get probation. However, the case was dismissed before the deal could be reached, as the court cited that it was unconstitutional to prevent convicted felons from possessing a firearm. While the rapper thought that this was the end of it, federal prosecutors re-filed the case, with the initial ruling being overturned.On August 26 this year, Badazz pleaded guilty to a federal count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The sentencing will take place on November 21, with the government reportedly seeking 24 months in prison. The decision is up to the judge.Amidst this, LegiStorm reported on October 7 that Boosie Badazz has hired Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl to push for a pardon from Donald Trump. The two lobbyists, meanwhile, are themselves facing a court case, with sentencing set to take place on December 1 this year. In 2020, they were convicted of sending around 85,000 robocalls in Black areas during the presidential election. They spread false information in an attempt to discourage people from voting via mail.

You think you'll get 60 percent? Everyone who did not vote for Trump will vote for you?'\n\nPresident Trump won just 38 percent of the vote in the Golden State to Kamala Harris' 58 percent.\n\n'If it is me versus a Republican? I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump,' Porter said, after laughing at Watts' initial question.\n\nWatts then pointed out that California's electoral system involves a 'jungle primary,' in which several candidates from all parties contest one primary, with the top two candidates moving on to the general.\n\nPorter was pressed on what would happen were her general election opponent to be another Democrat.\n\n'I don't intend that to be the case,' she responded.\n\nWatts wondered how she could be sure that a Democrat-on-Democrat general wouldn't happen.\n\nPorter, growing increasingly annoyed, said she would build the support and cited her experience representing Orange County in Congress, as its a swing district.\n\n'But you just said you don't need those Trump voters,' Watts retorted.\n\nPorter finally began to crack, starting to gesture with her hands and questioning Watts' interview. \n\n'Well you asked me if I needed them to win. I feel like this is unnecessarily argumentative, what is your question?'\n\nWatts then returned to the original topic, which was that she wanted to know what she'd say to Trump voters against Newsom's redistricting efforts.\n\nPorter said: 'I'm happy to say that, it's the 'do you need them to win' part that I don't understand.'\n\nAs she continued to try and explain herself, she finally became fed up with the questions.\n\n'I don't want to keep doing this, I want to call it.

Not with seven follow-ups to every single question you ask.'\n\nWatts said that 'every single candidate' had gone through a similar interview, with Porter responding: 'I don't care.'\n\n'I want to have a pleasant, positive conversation in which you ask me about every issue on this list and if every question, you're gonna make up a follow up question, we're never going to get there,' she continued.\n\nPorter indignantly claimed she 'never had to do this before' as she was daring herself to walk out on Watts, who again pointed out that every other candidate had done the same interview. \n\n'I'm me. I'm running for governor because I'm a leader, so I am going to make-' she said before Watts asked: 'So you're not going to answer interview questions from reporters?'\n\nWatts tried to bring the interview back to her list of questions but Porter refused. \n\n'I don't want to have a negative experience with you and I don't want this all on camera,' Porter said.\n\nWatts agreed that she didn't want to have a negative experience either but she would 'love to continue to ask these questions so that we can show our viewers what every candidate feels about every one of these issues that they care about and redistricting is a massive issue.'\n\nThe clip was blasted across social media and pounced on by her electoral rivals on both sides.\n\nFellow Democrat Xavier Beccera wrote: 'I’m not interested in excluding any vote. Every Californian deserves affordable health care, safe streets, a roof over their head and a living wage.'\n\nRepublican Steve Hilton added: '15 years of one party rule. This is what you get. It's time for change in California.'\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Porter for comment. \n\nPorter, who left Congress in 2025 after a failed Senate bid, has been the subject of controversy in recent years. \n\nLast year, she obtained a temporary restraining order against her ex-boyfriend after accusing him in court of abuse and harassment that she said caused her to fear for her safety and well-being.\n\nThe California Democrat petitioned for a domestic violence restraining order on Tuesday with the Orange Country Superior Court, court records show.\n\nPorter alleged her romantic partner of several years sent her, her family and her staff more than a thousand text messages and emails over three months, according to the filing reviewed by Politico. \n\nJudge Michael Perez approved the order Tuesday afternoon ordering Willis to make no contact and stay away from the congresswoman and her children until another hearing in mid-December. \n\nHe also ordered Willis not contact her current and former employees or her co-workers about her, but he denied requests for restraining orders for adults she does not live with including her mother, according to the documents reviewed by Politico.\n\nIncluding in the case filing were details about threats against Porter, 50, to call Child Protective Services to remove her children from her custody. \n\nIt also detailed attempts to extort Porter for thousands of dollars and make 'defamatory' false allegations like her having genital herpes. She submitted test results to the court to prove she did not have the sexually transmitted disease, Politico said. \n\nPorter left Congress after an unsuccessful run for Senate. \n\nShe was first elected to Congress in the 2018 midterms and has represented first California's 45th district and then 47th district since 2023. \n\nIn Congress, she built a name for herself in House committee hearings where she went head-to-head with witnesses and using a whiteboard as a prop.\n\nFollowing her election loss to Senator Adam Schiff in November, Porter wasted no time in throwing her hat back in the ring. \n\nShe is currently campaigning for the 2026 California gubernatorial election, with current Governor Gavin Newsom term-limited next year.","summary":"Reporter Julie Watts asked what she would say to Californians who voted for Donald Trump, whom she'll 'need to win.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15172165/Katie-Porter-clashes-journalist-grilled-Trump-supporters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/08/06/102799443-0-Porter_became_furious_at_the_line_of_questioning_and_criticized_-a-43_1759900840025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 05:26:47","author":"Editor,Stephen M.
