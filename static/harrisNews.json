At the height of a nationwide conversation about Black men finding themselves victim to disproportionately harsh sentences, police brutality, and fatal encounters, Harris's record as District Attorney and Attorney General was skewed with out of context data and outright distortions. She was given the moniker \"Cop-mala\" by those who were justifiably frustrated by a lack of police reform, accountability, and overall change in the criminal justice system.But the truth has since been exposed, and based on the enthusiasm I'm seeing, large numbers of Black men will enthusiastically back Vice President Harris. She was a progressive prosecutor for the time period she was D.A. and has been an integral part of an administration that has gotten results for Black men, women, and families.One of the major distortions that has always made rounds when Vice President Harris's name is invoked is that she allegedly put \"1,500 Black men in prison for marijuana\" as Attorney General of California. This statement is misleading at best. Most prosecutions of drug offenses occur at the local level. And marijuana-related admissions dropped precipitously during her time in office, from 817 marijuana-related admissions in her first year to 137 in her last. As District Attorney, she oversaw 1,956 felony marijuana convictions but just 45 saw state prison time, which is far fewer than the 135 during the tenure of her predecessor. Harris led the way with one of the nation's first prison diversion programs for first time, low level drug offenders called \"Back on Track.\" She was also part of a Biden Administration that pardoned all federal convictions for simple marijuana possession.The Biden/Harris Administration has also delivered for Black families on the economy. We've had the lowest Black unemployment and the fastest Black small business growth in three decades. Furthermore, the Biden/Harris administration cut Black child poverty in half with the American Rescue Plan in 2021.The Vice President also recognizes that education is the fast route to class mobility, and has been part of an administration that has supported Black education. Firstly, this administration has added $900 to the maximum Pell grant award. 60 percent of Black undergraduate students receive Pell grants to pay for their education. Harris is a proud alumna of Howard University in Washington, D.C. She understands that 70 percent of Black doctors and 80 percent of Black judges attend an HBCU. For that reason, this administration provided $16 billion to HBCUs since 2021. By contrast, the Trump administration provided a much more modest $255 million per year.Black men also have some of America's worst health outcomes. More Black men have health insurance than ever before due to increased enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's health coverage program.Were it not for a major family emergency, I would have been part of the nearly 50,000 Black men to join a Zoom call hosted by my colleague and friend Roland Martin and the \"Win With Black Men\" nonprofit in support of VP Harris. The energy was described to me as \"electric\" by a friend who is not particularly politically engaged. The call raised $1.5 million. Most importantly, it shows that Black men will not be fooled with disinformation.We are not voting for Vice President Harris because she is a Black woman. We are voting for our own interests and those of our families.Dr. Jason Nichols is an award winning senior lecturer in the African American Studies Department at the University of Maryland College Park and was the longtime editor-in-chief of Words Beats & Life: The Global Journal of Hip-Hop Culture.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"We are not voting for Vice President Harris because she is a Black woman.

O’Connor answered The Post’s questions just four days after Biden abruptly ended his campaign for a second term as fellow Democrats called on him to step aside over his apparent mental decline — after Biden repeatedly appearing confused in public, which medical pundits said could be due to Parkinson’s. “Are you Dr. O’Connor?” a Post reporter asked the presidential physician on the White House driveway as he walked past the press briefing room. “I don’t know. I don’t know,” he sheepishly replied — before making clear he was indeed the elusive doctor and proceeding to answer questions about the commander-in-chief, whose quest for a second term collapsed following his dismal June 27 debate performance against former President Donald Trump. “How’s the president’s health?” The Post asked. “It’s excellent,” O’Connor insisted with a smile. “Are you going to come to the briefing room to address us?” The Post inquired. “Probably not,” answered O’Connor, who has never been allowed to brief the press during Biden’s more than three years in office — in a break from historical norms. “Could that change before the end of his term?” the journalist followed up. “I hope not,” O’Connor said, as he seemed to recognize that he would be unable to cross the driveway just north of the West Wing due a cordon established following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrival at the White House moments earlier. “And how is his mental cognition?” The Post asked. “It’s excellent,” the doctor insisted with a smile. “Is there a reason you didn’t perform a cognitive test on him?” the reporter pressed. “We don’t need to. He’s here every day,” O’Connor claimed. As O’Connor turned to walk away, The Post followed and asked, “Dr. O’Connor, is there anything to that speculation that there might be something related to Parkinson’s that he has?” “No,” O’Connor said. “No, he’s good.” “And the [Parkinson’s] specialist’s visits to the White House, did that have anything to do with that concern?” The Post added. “No,” O’Connor said. “He’s seen him three times, my letter was clear.” Biden did not address swirling questions about his health in a Wednesday night address to the nation on his decision to step aside and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement on the Democratic ticket — saying only that it was time to “pass the torch.” Biden insisted last week that he would forge ahead with plans to stand in the Nov. 5 election — saying in a BET interview taped last Tuesday that he’d only drop out “if I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, you got this problem and that problem.” Republican leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), have called on Biden to resign as president rather than serve out his term, which ends Jan. 20. “If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” Johnson said Sunday. Many medical experts said in the past month that they believe Biden likely has Parkinson’s or a related condition. “I could’ve diagnosed him from across the Mall,” neurologist Dr. Tom Pitts told NBC this month — calling Parkinson’s “one of the easier movement disorders to diagnose” and pointing specifically to Biden’s “rigidity” and “shuffling gait,” and “slow movement.” He also said “hypophonia” or using a “small, monotone voice … over time is a hallmark of Parkinson’s.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — President Biden&#8217;s physician Dr. Kevin O&#8217;Connor defended his boss&#8217; &#8220;excellent&#8221; cognitive fitness Thursday as Republicans urge him to resign — insisting the president does not have Parkinson&#8217;s or a related disease in what may be his first interview since Biden took office.

Vice President Harris is the current choice (as shown by all the polls and spark in fundraising). What can be more democratic than that? Also, even in the primaries, Democrats did vote for Harris to be the vice-presidential nominee. And what is the job of the vice president? To backstop the president when necessary.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his leadership team had hoped to pass all 12 bills that fund the government before the long August recess, setting up negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate on how to keep the government open ahead of a shutdown deadline on Sept. 30. But that goal now looks out of reach with the House not returning until Sept. 9, leaving just three weeks to avert a shutdown. The House has already passed five funding bills and had planned to take up four more this week. But leaders managed to push through only one of them — focused on the Department of Interior — and yanked three others over intraparty disputes and the GOP’s minuscule three-seat majority. “They can’t pass their own bills. They haven’t been able to pass their own bills all Congress. This is nothing new,” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla. Both the House and Senate need to pass all 12 bills to fund the government for the 2025 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. A stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, to temporarily keep the lights on is now likely with the election fast approaching. The House’s final vote before departing town on Thursday was a non-binding GOP messaging bill, strongly condemning “border czar” Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s likely presidential nominee, for failing to secure the border. A half dozen vulnerable Democrats joined all Republicans in voting yes. “Extreme MAGA Republicans have been in the majority for over 18 months. Can anyone name a single thing that extreme MAGA Republicans in the House have done in order to make life better for the American people? … You can’t,” Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters, nodding to a fiery floor speech from GOP Rep. Chip Roy last fall where he lamented that there was not “one thing” Republicans could campaign on. “They are incapable of governing,” Jeffries added. Perhaps the most significant piece of legislation passed by Congress this year was the $95.3 billion emergency supplemental that sent a fresh infusion of military aid to a trio of allies: Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Johnson shepherded that package through the House in April, and attached legislation that would force the Chinese owner of TikTok to sell the popular video-sharing app after the election or risk a ban in the United States. Biden signed it into law. That same month, Johnson also secured the renewal of a powerful U.S. surveillance program — known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA — despite objections from his right flank. And the House overwhelmingly passed a $78 billion tax package — negotiated by Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore. — that includes an expansion of the child tax credit, though it’s held up in the Senate. Asked about the stalled government funding process, Athina Lawson, a spokesperson for the speaker, pointed out the House has made more progress on its appropriations, or funding, bills than the Senate. “The House has made significant progress in advancing FY25 appropriations bills. The House Appropriations Committee has diligently moved all 12 bills out of committee and the House has passed 75% of government funding for the upcoming fiscal year while the Senate has yet to even consider a single appropriations bill,” Lawson said. “The House will continue its successful effort to responsibly fund the government for FY25 when it returns from its district work period.” Republicans had hoped to pass all 12 bills early to avoid another stopgap bill or, worse, getting jammed up with a massive omnibus funding bill by the Senate right at the deadline. Roy, a Texas Republican and Freedom Caucus member, said the House “should have gotten all of them passed … before we left town.” But this time, he said Democrats were also to blame: “Talk to the Senate, talk to the White House.” Separately, the Senate next week is poised to pass a pair of popular bipartisan bills aimed at protecting children online, including from social media companies. But with the House now gone, the lower chamber won’t take them up until September at the earliest and possibly not until the lame-duck session after the Nov. 5 election. Johnson has expressed general support for the children’s privacy bills. “Obviously, I believe in the purpose of the legislation,” he said. “I think it’s really important but there’s a couple of questions we have about the details, but I think we can work it out and I’d like to get it done. As they left for recess, Jeffries’ message of GOP chaos and dysfunction was echoed by rank-and-file Democrats, including some members who are facing tough re-election bids this fall. “This is the exact type of chaos and do-nothing Congress that I fully believe the American people are going to reject in 2024,” said freshman Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich. “We have to pass these appropriations bills. We have to do the farm bill, we have to get something done on immigration. The American people know it, they feel it. And this type of chaos is just not gonna stand.” Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., argued that much of what House Republicans have done this Congress is use their majority and oversight powers to beat up on President Joe Biden, and now direct their attacks at his likely replacement at the top of the ticket. “The Republicans spent the majority of this Congress on a completely bogus impeachment investigation of President Biden where they found no evidence of wrongdoing, much less any high crime or misdemeanor,” Goldman told reporters. “And as soon as he drops out, and Vice President Harris becomes the presumptive nominee, now all of a sudden all of their attention and their floor time is focused on sullying her up with false accusations.” “It’s just continuing to use the official authority and official resources of Congress for partisan political electoral purposes, which is improper,” Goldman continued, “but it has been what the Republicans have done all term long, and it is the only thing that they can actually get passed.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — House Republican leaders have canceled next week’s work session and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The House Goes on Recess Until September with Few Accomplishments for the Public first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-house-goes-on-recess-until-september-with-few-accomplishments-for-the-public/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-07/240725-Mike-Johnson-ch-1028-c82826.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:32:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":252631598,"title":"Trump Will Headline Bitcoin 2024 Conference—His Latest ‘Crypto President’ Rebrand Effort","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Former president and one-time bitcoin detractor Donald Trump will speak at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee, this weekend alongside other political figures, looking to further his rebrand as a “crypto president” ahead of Election Day. Trump will speak at the conference on Saturday. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Characterized as the world’s largest bitcoin conference, the three-day event hosted at the Music City Center convention complex features a wide range of speakers such as independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., political commentator and comedian Russell Brand and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The conference features educational panels, networking opportunities and entertainment experiences such as a Karate Combat/Influencer Fight Club viewing and a screening of a bitcoin movie, “God Bless Bitcoin,” which features interviews with people such as billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. Trump will give a 30-minute keynote address Saturday during the conference’s final day, in a speech that will likely attempt to court voters and capitalize on support he has already received from key cryptocurrency figures like the Winklevoss twins. Kennedy, who owns between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of bitcoin, will speak Friday afternoon, as the presidential candidate has championed cryptocurrency as a way for the middle class to insulate itself from inflation. Tickets to the conference are pricey, starting at $699 and reaching as high as $21,000 for a single ticket—though prospective attendees can get tickets at a 21% discount if they purchase them with bitcoin.

Surprising Fact Edward Snowden, the whistleblower behind one of the largest classified documents leaks in the history of the National Security Agency, is expected to speak Friday from Russia, and has called the cryptocurrency “the most significant monetary advance since the creation of coinage.” Tangent Bitcoin traded down more than 2% at just under $65,000 Thursday afternoon, having mostly plateaued in the last three months, posting gains of a fraction of a percent. It has surged more than 53% since the start of the year. Big Number $1.8 million. That is how many dollars worth of bitcoin Trump supporters donated to the Republican nominee through the end of June, according to The Wall Street Journal. Key Background The bitcoin conference has historically been used by public figures and companies as an event to announce partnerships and initiatives. In 2021, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, announced at the event that the country would be making bitcoin a legal tender. Attendance has been inconsistent in recent years, as 25,000 people appeared at the convention in 2022 (when the crypto market experienced one of its worst crashes ever) and 12,000 attended in 2023, according to Bloomberg. Bitcoin 2024 has yet to share attendance numbers, though big-name speakers like Trump could generate more tickets than prior years. What Has Donald Trump Said About Bitcoin? Trump has increasingly warmed up to cryptocurrency as Election Day draws closer, ditching the skepticism he had for it years ago. While president in 2019 he said he was not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, calling their values “highly volatile and based on thin air” in a tweet. He also told Fox News in 2021 bitcoin “just seems like a scam,\" saying he did not like it “because it's another currency competing against the dollar.\" Since then, Trump has embraced cryptocurrency, allowing supporters to donate to his campaign with bitcoin and selecting a running mate in JD Vance, R-Ohio, who supports and owns at least $100,000 worth of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market may benefit from Trump winning in November, with bitcoin remaining “sensitive” to the election as its price is “positively correlated with the probability” of a Trump victory, according to Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani. Trump’s Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, is likely to adopt the regulation-centric crypto policies of her former running mate, President Joe Biden.

The circumstances were such that he was damned if he did, and damned if he didn’t. He backed out because he was showing signs of senile dementia. At 82, it was perhaps not possible to prevent signs of normal brain aging to show themselves. Orientation as to time, place and person can go, while there may be difficulties with language. Biden showed the sort of hesitations characteristic of language difficulty during his debate with Republican contender Donald Trump, himself 78. During a recent NATO Summit he mixed up names, showing an almost classic disorientation as to person. It is not known if a diagnosis of senile dementia has been made, but it can be assumed that the medical staff of the White House would have administered the necessary tests. It is strongly possible, especially in view of his age, that even if a diagnosis has not been made, no one can rule it out in the future. If a diagnosis has been made, the prognosis does not rule out death during the second term, because while dementia is a sign that the brain is degenerating, it also means that other bodily functions will be affected, and as the degeneration progresses, death will also occur, between three to 12 years after onset. That is what happened to President Ronald Reagan, who experienced symptoms in 1992 or 1993, and died in 2004, by that time confined to his bed, and after having retired from public life years before. However, he had left office in January 1989, and at that time he was just short of his 78th birthday, and was at the time the oldest person ever to have held office. It is something of an irony that Reagan’s term covered the Soviet ‘gerontocrats’, the old men who succeeded to the Secretary Generalship of the USSR. Brezhnev was 76 when he died in office in November 1982, having taken office in 1964 at 58. He was succeeded by KGB chief Yuri Andropov, who was 68, and who died in February 1984, essentially the next winter. He was then succeeded by Yuri Chernenko, who was 73. He died in March 1985. At that point, the Politburo apparently panicked, and elected as Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev, who was 54. He was destined to preside over the dissolution of the USSR. Similarly, Biden has seemingly anointed Vice-President Kamala Harris as his replacement. After his tweet of endorsement, she should be a shoo-in, because at the nominating convention, scheduled next month to be held in Chicago. Biden had won a majority of delegates in the primaries. While those delegates will not be bound to him any longer, they will probably mostly vote as he wishes. It would almost appear as if she is being presented as a sacrificial lamb to Trump, because it was perhaps decisive that donors were now baulking. Getting those donors back is a task in itself. She would therefore have to campaign initially against those who would probably not have supported her nomination in more ordinary circumstances. She has very little time left to campaign, It may be that unlike other Democratic possibilities, she will not have to fight to establish name recognition, but the odds seem tilted against her. However, her heading the ticket means that one of the main fears, which was leading Democrats facing contests in November, of Biden damaging other Democrats running for re-election, is removed. Whether or not Harris brings any add-on is not relevant at this stage. What matters is that she is not Biden. She is 60, which might mean a generational change, but still makes it doubtful whether she can appeal to young people. She is not that far from the age at which senile dementia strikes, after all. She was picked to be Vice-President because she united so many minorities. Her father was black, her mother was Indian and she was a woman. True, she left Asian Americans and Native Americans, as well as the LGBTQ+ groups unrepresented, but then nobody’s perfect. How white male Republicans like Trump will react is another matter. Trump has already reacted, stating that she will be easier to beat than Biden. She complicates issues. Obama was elected because the USA was ready for a black President. Hillary Clinton was not elected, probably because the USA was not ready for a woman President. Harris has thus got two obstacles to overcome when approaching white male voters. The USA gets its Presidents later than ever, because of the progress made in medicine. However, it also increases the chances of someone losing it while President. There is a mechanism for the Vice-President to take over, but as the past weeks have shown, it is hard enough persuading someone not to run, let alone displace the President. The USA faces the danger of becoming a gerontocracy. Actually, after the presidential debate, Trump looked increasingly like a winner. While his own performance was miserable, it was typical. At least he showed no signs of senile dementia, though he is 78, and would be Biden’s age at the end of his term, in January 2029. The effects of dementia on his already ebullient character are truly unpredictable. Harris seems to be the sacrifice made for other Democratic candidates. This was clearly implied by Biden saying that what he is doing, he is doing for the good of the party and the country. Even if Trump can’t be stopped, Biden by removing himself might avoid a total train wreck. Biden has become the first US President since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 not to contest for re-election. Johnson was trying for a third term, for which he was eligible, but decided that the anti-war movement was going to lead to his defeat. He announced that he was not going to run after his won the New Hampshire primary by only 49 percent to 42 percent, in March 1968. His vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, then campaigned, but was not the frontrunner, that being Robert F. Kennedy, but he won the nomination after RFK was assassinated. Humphrey then lost the election to Richard N. Nixon. Coincidentally, the nominating convention is to be held in Chicago, as in 1968. Again, the omens are not good for Harris. The 1968 Convention was marred by anti-Vietnam War protests. Instead of the coverage boost, there were unfortunate images on TV juxtaposed of protester-police battles, and the convention failed to be positive for Humphrey or any other Democratic candidate. A factor against the Democrats then, but absent then, was the third-party candidacy of George Wallace, the Alabama Governor, who drew off Democrat votes in the South, throwing many states into the Republican tally. Though Biden’s policy on Gaza causes much anguish and concern, riots like those of 1968 are not expected. However, it will be a concern for voters, though not for uncommitted voters. It is thought that voters who are already Democratic ill consider the issue, but there is no real choice, just as there was not in 1972. Both Democrat and Republican nominees were pro-war, though it was the Democratic party which produced the only genuinely anti-war candidate, Harris does have the advantage of being able to run on Biden’s record, just as he ran on the record of his President, Barack Obama. However, the circumstances under which she is being plunged in the fire is something the USA needs to think about, because one medical opinion is that Biden entered the White House while already suffering some symptoms of dementia. It is the age at which Trump is set to return for another term. The USA gets its Presidents later than ever, because of the progress made in medicine. However, it also increases the chances of someone losing it while President. There is a mechanism for the Vice-President to take over, but as the past weeks have shown, it is hard enough persuading someone not to run, let alone displace the President. The USA faces the danger of becoming a gerontocracy. Are congressional ages going up along with presidential? That study has not yet been done, vital as it might have now become.","summary":"AT PENPOINT US President Joe Biden used the opportunity for introspection at his home in Delaware to take what was probably the most painful decision of his life: not to run for re-election.

Harris, the father of presumptive Democrat presidential nominee and Biden shotgun rider Kamala Harris slammed the “fraudulent” claims she made around her racial and cultural background in 2019, during her short-lived run for the presidency, accusing his daughter of bringing shame to the Harris family name “in the pursuit of identity politics.” Kamala Harris claimed in a 2019 interview on The Breakfast Club radio program, the very same program on which Hillary Clinton made her infamous hot sauce remarks, that despite her career as an anti-marijuana prosecutor, she supports its legalization and used to smoke it while listening to rap music because “half my family is from Jamaica, are you kidding me?” The interview came shortly after Harris, who is the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, announced her run for the Democrats’ 2020 presidential nomination on Martin Luther King Jr. day, casting herself as an African-American as she has throughout her political career, despite her lack of ancestral links to the formerly enslaved population of the United States. “My dear departed grandmothers…as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their graves right now to see their family’s name, reputation, and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not, with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics,” Donald Harris said a statement he made to the Jamaica Global Online. “Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty.” Related: Even BLM Opposes Kamala Harris Donald Harris’s remarks have resurfaced in the days since Joe Biden announced he’s dropping out of the 2024 Presidential Election and endorsing Harris, his Vice President, who was unable to poll outside of the low single digits among her own party when she ran for their 2020 nomination. Because of the Harris campaign and the corporate media’s hyper-fixation on her racial and ethnic background, the fact that her paternal ancestors were slave owners has also resurfaced in recent days. According to a report from The Irish Times, Ms Harris is the daughter of Donald J Harris, who was born in Jamaica, and Shyamala Gopalan Harris from India. Genealogical research carried out by Northern Irish historian Stephen McCracken reveals Ms Harris’s four-times-paternal-great-grandfather Hamilton Brown was born in Co Antrim [Ireland] in 1776. Brown emigrated to Jamaica, then a British colony, and became an enthusiastic slave owner on the sugar plantations that were the mainstay of the island’s economy. He opposed the abolition of slavery across the British Empire in 1832 and went to Antrim to replace his slaves with workers from his native county. … Brown received almost €11 million in modern money in compensation from the British government for [the emancipation of] his slaves.

Initial steps include denying her role as ‘Border Czar’ and downplaying her reputation as the ‘most liberal’ Senator.","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris and her team plan to refute that she was ever in charge of the migration crisis at the southern border. It comes as Republicans are set to make Harris’ role as Joe Biden’s ‘border czar’ one of their main points of attack in her battle for the White House with Donald Trump. As Democratic strategists try to reinvent Harris’ record for the campaign a government transparency organization also deleted a webpage which had declared her the most liberal Democrat in the Senate . Immigration and the border was Harris’ first big task as vice president and House Republicans on Thursday passed a resolution condemning her leadership on the issue. In March 2021, President Joe Biden and his administration were already struggling with an escalating immigration crisis. Migrants were pouring across the southern border, detention centers filled up with unaccompanied minors, and stories about ‘kids in cages’ began filtering into the public consciousness. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary at the time, repeatedly insisted that it was ‘not a crisis’. Republicans hammered Biden’s lack of enforcement, demanding that the president take the issue seriously and visit the border. The White House felt it necessary to do something, some kind of sign to the public and the media that the president was tackling the problem. To stave off criticism Team Biden offered up Vice President Kamala Harris as the solution. The president and vice president stood together in the State Dining Room of the White House as Biden announced his intention to put Harris in charge of the migrant crisis. Her chief goal, Biden stated, was to lead the diplomatic effort with Mexico and Central American countries to address the ‘root causes’ of migration. ‘I can think of nobody who — who is better qualified to do this,’ Biden said, citing Harris’ record as a California Attorney General. It was not an unfamiliar task, Biden noted, recalling that as vice president, he had stepped up for President Barack Obama to work with leaders to stem migration on the southern border. But Biden knew he was throwing Harris into a leadership vacuum, when he had no interest in getting involved personally in a politically fraught situation. ‘I gave you a tough job,’ Biden said, looking at Harris who smiled wryly at him. ‘And you’re smiling, but there’s no one better capable of trying to organize this for us.’ Republicans could not believe that Biden had given the task of securing the border to Harris, and the vice president and her team were deeply resentful of what Biden’s staff had done to her politically. Although Harris tried to narrowly define her role in the crisis, media outlets correctly recognized what Biden was doing. ‘Biden makes Harris the point person on immigration issues amid border surge’ read a headline in Politico. ‘Biden taps VP Harris to lead response to border challenges,’ the Associated Press wrote. ‘Biden puts Harris in charge of border crisis,’ read the headline of an article by Axios. To many, Harris’ first event on the issue demonstrated she was unprepared to handle the crisis, as she cited the show “Cheers” to make her point on migration. ‘You know, to use a phrase from an old television show, “Cheers”, you know, “where everybody knows your name,”’ she said, reciting words from the show’s theme song. She explained, “Most people don’t want to leave home.” Republicans saw Harris’ weakness and began driving home her failures. House Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. put Harris’ face on a carton of milk and described her as ‘missing at the border.’ Biden did not help. After saddling Harris with the politically explosive issue, he used an event with congressional Democrats to say that Harris would do a ‘hell of a job’. But the Vice President was not having it. She interrupted Biden to remind him that she was only handling the ‘root causes’ of migration. Facing ongoing pressure, Harris was sent to Guatemala to host an event on addressing the crisis and telling migrants not to come to the United States. ‘Do not come. Do not come,’ she said repeatedly. ‘The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. I believe if you come to our border, you will be turned back,’ she said. However, millions of migrants did not listen. Harris was also beset with criticism after she dismissed the idea of visiting the border in bizarre fashion during an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. Asked about not having been to the border she said: ‘…And I haven’t been to Europe. I don’t understand the point you’re making.’ She laughed at the question. In September 2022, Harris was sent by the administration to talk about the issue on Meet the Press. When anchor Chuck Todd asked Harris whether she believed the border was secure, she replied, ‘We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration.’ Republicans said that was not true and repeatedly challenged her claim. As Republicans ramped up criticism of Harris, and Biden, for refusing to visit the border, the president’s team finally decided to send Harris to release some of the pressure. In June 2021 she visited the border – days after former President Donald Trump scheduled a visit to highlight the administration’s failures. Harris said: ‘I’m glad to be here. It was always the plan to come here.’ Trump declared victory. He said: ‘After months of ignoring the crisis at the Southern Border, it is great that we got Kamala Harris to finally go and see the tremendous destruction and death that they’ve created.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her team plan to refute that she&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Uncovering the scheme to manipulate Americans about Kamala and distort her narrative.

Alec Lace appeared on the network on July 5 to discuss the future of the Democratic party after President Joe Biden’s debate stumble — commentary that devolved into racist and sexist remarks about the presumptive Democratic nominee. Lace suggested that Harris ascended to power by sleeping her way to the top. “Kamala Harris — she’s the original ‘Hawk Tuah’ girl — that’s the way she got where she is. And the party’s going downhill if it’s in her hands,” Lace said. His comment refers to a viral TikTok clip in which a woman is asked the question, “What’s one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?” “You gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thang,” the woman replies, alluding to oral sex. Social media users took to X to fume about Lace’s offensive remarks. “Beyond disrespectful. Is he not a dad? Imagine someone spoke this way about his daughter/son in the future smh,” one user wrote. Lace’s Instagram bio says he is a father of four and the host of the podcast “First Class Fatherhood.” Another remarked: “Alec lace should never be allowed on tv again. That was absolutely disgusting.” The Independent has emailed a representative for Lace for comment. On Wednesday, he addressed his controversial Fox Business appearance — but fell far short of an apology. Lace responded to the online hate he has received in a post on X, clarifying that he appeared on the show before Biden exited the 2024 race. “Comparing Donald Trump to Hitler is dangerous and 100x worse than comparing Kamala Harris to the Hawk Tuah girl,” he continued, adding: “So save me your fake outrage.” Separately, Lace admitted he “may have been wrong,” before doubling down on his initial claim: “Monica Lewinsky might hold the title but I believe Harris was with Willie Brown prior. Need a fact check on that.” Harris briefly dated Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco, at the beginning of her political career in the 1990s, prompting some critics to attribute her success to her ties to Brown. The former mayor addressed the claims in a 2020 op-ed in theSan Francisco Chronicle titled: “Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?” He wrote: “I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov Gavin Newsom, Sen Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.” In the same July 5 clip, Lace disparaged White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Harris in one breath: “There’s the DEI press secretary telling you that the DEI vice president is the future of the party here. And so the future looks kind of dim for the Democrats.” Lace isn’t the first to suggest Harris was a “diversity, equity and inclusion” hire. Earlier this week, Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett said on CNN: “When you go down that route, you take mediocrity, and that’s what they have now as a vice president…100 per cent. She was a DEI hire.” Former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka also referred to the vice president as “colored.” On Wednesday, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade took heat after he appeared to describe a Black sorority as “colored” hours before Harris was supposed to deliver remarks to the group. The network has denied that Kilmeade used the term, and instead claimed Kilmeade said “college.” Harris — who has been the presumptive Democratic nominee for president for less than a week — has also been the subject of misogynistic comments, namely about her intelligence. Numerous Republicans have claimed she has a “low IQ,” while former president Trump called her “dumb as a rock.”","summary":"Alec Lace also called Harris and the White House press secretary ‘DEI’ hires","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-hawk-tuah-girl-b2585899.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/25/16/SEI214048480.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kcUdu91l-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:19:14","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":252631034,"title":"Mystery beast found dead sparks ‘chupacabra’ theories   ","text":"New York Post See All Videos Recommended Singapore Airlines passenger killed after flight hit by severe turbulence Stage collapses during campaign rally in Mexico Man vs. croc!

Each state has its own rules for naming replacements when elected officials leave office. Those rules carry significant political stakes in a year when former President Donald Trump has already selected Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris considers her own choice for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Here are the rules in some states that have VP contenders: Pennsylvania If Harris picks Gov. Josh Shapiro, he can remain in office as governor while he campaigns for vice president. If he ultimately were elected, Shapiro would have to resign as governor before the Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration. Shapiro, 51, is in his second year as governor. Constitutionally, Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis would be tapped to serve the remainder of Shapiro’s four-year term, which ends in January 2027. Davis ran on the 2022 general election ticket with Shapiro after Shapiro endorsed him in a separate primary for the lieutenant governor’s office. Davis, 34, would become the youngest governor in the country and the first Black governor of Pennsylvania, as well as its second-youngest ever. He is already the youngest lieutenant governor in the nation and the first Black lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania. A new governor would be elected in the November 2026 election. Ohio If Vance is elected, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine would have the job of appointing his replacement. His appointee would serve from Inauguration Day until Dec. 15, 2026, under state law. A special election for the last two years of Vance’s six-year term would be held in November 2026. DeWine has said he would pick someone who would work hard for Ohio and also be capable of running — and winning — in 2026. The race for the next full six-year term would take place in 2028. A Senate vacancy would present DeWine with the opportunity to alleviate a bottleneck at the top of the political pecking order of aspiring Ohio Republicans. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Attorney General Dave Yost are already positioning to face off in a 2026 gubernatorial primary, and three other sitting statewide officeholders who are Republicans face 2026 term limits and are weighing their futures. Also, Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno is running this fall for Ohio’s other Senate seat against incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper already must leave his current job in January because the state constitution limits him to two consecutive four-year terms. He is one of the many governors on Harris’ short list. Another constitutional provision offers the potential for Cooper’s out-of-state campaign travels as a Harris running mate to complicate matters back home. The constitution says that “during the absence of the Governor from the State … the Lieutenant Governor shall be Acting Governor.” The current lieutenant governor, who is elected separately from the governor, is Republican Mark Robinson. Robinson is running for governor against Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein, and the provision could help Robinson carry out favored policy choices during the final weeks of his campaign. But could Robinson replace significant Cooper policies permanently? That’s highly unlikely, one political expert said, based on the governor’s previous travel history and modern transportation and communications. The idea is “almost like a fun parlor game,” said Chris Cooper, a Western Carolina University political science professor unrelated to the governor. “It’s a quirky part of our state constitution, but in terms of public policy it’s just not going to be meaningful.” If Robinson issued an executive order that Roy Cooper didn’t like, the governor could just undo it when he returned, Chris Cooper said. And while the GOP-controlled General Assembly could convene in Cooper’s absence and pass a bill that Robinson could quickly sign, Republicans already have veto-proof majorities to enact bills largely whenever they choose. Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has raised his national profile by winning a second term last year in heavily Republican Kentucky. Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman would take Beshear’s place in Kentucky should the governor resign to become vice president. She would serve out the remainder of his term, which ends in late 2027, and could run for a full term in that year’s election. Beshear and Coleman ran as a ticket in their successful campaigns in 2019 and 2023. There is debate within Kentucky political circles about Coleman’s ability to appoint a successor as lieutenant governor. It’s an “open question” because Kentucky’s constitution “doesn’t address the issue specifically,” says University of Kentucky law professor Joshua A. Douglas. This isn’t the first time that Kentucky’s succession rules have come under scrutiny. Republican lawmakers this spring passed a measure to have a vacant U.S. Senate seat filled by a special election, overriding Beshear’s veto. The bill removed the governor from a role in filling a vacancy. It came amid heightened scrutiny about the health of Kentucky’s senior senator, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, though bill supporters said it was unrelated. Arizona As he is looked at as a possible Democratic VP contender, Sen. Mark Kelly is no stranger to Arizona’s process for replacing candidates. He won a special election in 2020 for John McCain’s old seat. If the former astronaut is chosen as vice president, Democratic Arizona Gov. Kate Hobbs would have to appoint a replacement from the same party as Kelly. That person would serve until a special election in 2026 to fill the last two years of Kelly’s term. In December 2018, Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey appointed Republican then-Rep. Martha McSally to the McCain seat, which had been filled for a few months after McCain’s death by GOP Sen. Jon Kyl. In an example of how a Senate seat can eventually change party control, Kelly beat McSally during a 2020 special election that was considered among the most competitive Senate races in the country that year. Kelly went on to be reelected in November 2022. ___ Associated Press Writers Bruce Schreiner, Gary D. Robertson, Marc Levy, Julie Carr Smyth and Jonathan J. Cooper contributed to this report.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his leadership team had hoped to pass all 12 bills that fund the government before the long August recess, setting up negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate on how to keep the government open ahead of a shutdown deadline on Sept. 30. But that goal now looks out of reach with the House not returning until Sept. 9, leaving just three weeks to avert a shutdown. The House has already passed five funding bills and had planned to take up four more this week. But leaders managed to push through only one of them — focused on the Department of Interior — and yanked three others over intraparty disputes and the GOP’s minuscule three-seat majority. “They can’t pass their own bills. They haven’t been able to pass their own bills all Congress. This is nothing new,” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla. Both the House and Senate need to pass all 12 bills to fund the government for the 2025 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. A stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, to temporarily keep the lights on is now likely with the election fast approaching. The House’s final vote before departing town on Thursday was a non-binding GOP messaging bill, strongly condemning “border czar” Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s likely presidential nominee, for failing to secure the border. A half dozen vulnerable Democrats joined all Republicans in voting yes. “Extreme MAGA Republicans have been in the majority for over 18 months. Can anyone name a single thing that extreme MAGA Republicans in the House have done in order to make life better for the American people? … You can’t,” Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters, nodding to a fiery floor speech from GOP Rep. Chip Roy last fall where he lamented that there was not “one thing” Republicans could campaign on. “They are incapable of governing,” Jeffries added. Perhaps the most significant piece of legislation passed by Congress this year was the $95.3 billion emergency supplemental that sent a fresh infusion of military aid to a trio of allies: Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Johnson shepherded that package through the House in April, and attached legislation that would force the Chinese owner of TikTok to sell the popular video-sharing app after the election or risk a ban in the United States. Biden signed it into law. That same month, Johnson also secured the renewal of a powerful U.S. surveillance program — known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA — despite objections from his right flank. And the House overwhelmingly passed a $78 billion tax package — negotiated by Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore. — that includes an expansion of the child tax credit, though it’s held up in the Senate. Asked about the stalled government funding process, Athina Lawson, a spokesperson for the speaker, pointed out the House has made more progress on its appropriations, or funding, bills than the Senate. “The House has made significant progress in advancing FY25 appropriations bills. The House Appropriations Committee has diligently moved all 12 bills out of committee and the House has passed 75% of government funding for the upcoming fiscal year while the Senate has yet to even consider a single appropriations bill,” Lawson said. “The House will continue its successful effort to responsibly fund the government for FY25 when it returns from its district work period.” Republicans had hoped to pass all 12 bills early to avoid another stopgap bill or, worse, getting jammed up with a massive omnibus funding bill by the Senate right at the deadline. Roy, a Texas Republican and Freedom Caucus member, said the House “should have gotten all of them passed … before we left town.” But this time, he said Democrats were also to blame: “Talk to the Senate, talk to the White House.” Separately, the Senate next week is poised to pass a pair of popular bipartisan bills aimed at protecting children online, including from social media companies. But with the House now gone, the lower chamber won’t take them up until September at the earliest and possibly not until the lame-duck session after the Nov. 5 election. Johnson has expressed general support for the children's privacy bills. \"Obviously, I believe in the purpose of the legislation,\" he said. \"I think it’s really important but there’s a couple of questions we have about the details, but I think we can work it out and I’d like to get it done. As they left for recess, Jeffries’ message of GOP chaos and dysfunction was echoed by rank-and-file Democrats, including some members who are facing tough re-election bids this fall. “This is the exact type of chaos and do-nothing Congress that I fully believe the American people are going to reject in 2024,” said freshman Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich. “We have to pass these appropriations bills. We have to do the farm bill, we have to get something done on immigration. The American people know it, they feel it. And this type of chaos is just not gonna stand.” Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., argued that much of what House Republicans have done this Congress is use their majority and oversight powers to beat up on President Joe Biden, and now direct their attacks at his likely replacement at the top of the ticket. “The Republicans spent the majority of this Congress on a completely bogus impeachment investigation of President Biden where they found no evidence of wrongdoing, much less any high crime or misdemeanor,” Goldman told reporters. “And as soon as he drops out, and Vice President Harris becomes the presumptive nominee, now all of a sudden all of their attention and their floor time is focused on sullying her up with false accusations.” “It’s just continuing to use the official authority and official resources of Congress for partisan political electoral purposes, which is improper,” Goldman continued, “but it has been what the Republicans have done all term long, and it is the only thing that they can actually get passed.”","summary":"Republican-led House leaves for August recess, passing a messaging bill criticizing Kamala Harris on the border, having failed to pass some government funding bills.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-leaves-town-september-little-show-voters-rcna163638","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240725-Mike-Johnson-ch-1028-c82826.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:15:20","author":"Kyle Stewart,Scott Wong","authors":["Kyle Stewart","Scott Wong"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":252632200,"title":"Alex Thompson: Why Did Biden Drop Out?","text":"The past month has been one of the most tumultuous in modern American political history: a devastating face-plant in a televised presidential debate, an attempted assassination of an ex-president favored in the polls to win reelection, a COVID-19 infection of the sitting president and his subsequent exit from the race, and an endorsement and loads of money pouring into the campaign of a previously unpopular vice president.

The meeting came a day after the Israeli prime minister gave a fiery speech to Congress as thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside. The Israeli leader faces pressure both at home and abroad to bring an end to the Israel-Gaza war, now in its ninth month. Mr Netanyahu said he had known Mr Biden for 40 years - and that the president had known every Israeli PM over the last half a century. \"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" he said. Mr Netanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Mr Biden \"on the great issues before us\" over the next several months. The US president joked that Golda Meir was the first Israeli PM he had met, and that Yitzhak Rabin, a successor, was there as an assistant. The meeting between the two men follows months of tension over the war in Gaza, with Mr Biden in May reportedly telling Israel that \"enough is enough\". Mr Netanyahu in June said it was \"inconceivable\" that the Biden administration \"has been withholding weapons and ammunition\" to Israel. At a news briefing, national security spokesman John Kirby said that Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu discussed the urgent need for a hostage release deal, the potential of conflict spilling over into Lebanon, the threat of Iran and the need to reach \"compromises\" in peace talks. While Mr Kirby added that \"gaps remain\" in the US-Israel relationship, the countries have a \"healthy relationship\". \"By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything,\" Mr Kirby said. \"He [Mr Biden] is very comfortable with the relationship he has with the Prime Minister.\" Mr Netanyahu also plans to meet Vice-President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee after Mr Biden announced he was stepping down from his re-election campaign. Speaking in the House chamber on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu defended Israel's war in Gaza, while attempting to rally support from US politicians. \"Our enemies are your enemies,\" he said, and condemned protesters as \"Iran's useful idiots\". The White House pushed back on Mr Netanyahu's characterisation of the protesters, with Mr Kirby saying that \"it's not a phrase we would use\" and \"not a reflection of what we think\" of the \"mostly peaceful\" protests. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of Washington to accuse Mr Netanyahu of being a \"war criminal\". Their loudspeakers and chanting could be clearly heard from the White House as Mr Netanyahu arrived on Thursday. Police arrested 23 people, including five inside the Capitol building. Mr Netanyahu's speech was occasionally met with rapturous applause, mostly led by Republicans. The Gaza war has deepened political divides in Washington, and led to infighting among Democrats whose progressive wing has been critical of US support of Israel. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was spotted sitting in the audience holding a sign that read \"guilty of genocide\". Ms Harris did not attend Mr Netanyahu's speech due to scheduling conflicts, the White House said. Instead, she spent part of the day speaking to a crowd from the historically black sorority Zeta Phi Beta. Ms Harris has expressed steadfast support for Israel. However, such a stance has been politically costly for the Democrats. Hundreds of thousands of protest votes were cast against Mr Biden during the presidential primaries by those wanting him to stop sending military aid to Israel. Some of those angered by his war stance see Ms Harris as a chance to mend the fracture in the party, and win back the votes. Mr Netanyahu is expected to visit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on Friday.","summary":"Gaza war was a priority at a meeting held after the Israeli PM gave a fiery speech to Congress.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3eppp0n57o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5a32/live/ffed63c0-4aad-11ef-9d7d-8f2c8d9c3d2a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:10:58","author":"Brandon Drenon & Bernd Debusmann Jr At The White House","authors":["Brandon Drenon & Bernd Debusmann Jr At The White House"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":252631224,"title":"How Trump could replace JD Vance if the Ohioan's terrible polling continues","text":"Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has had a rough week and a half since he was announced as former President Donald Trump's vice presidential candidate. While Trump insists he's sticking with Vance, the senator's poor polling combined with Vice President Kamala Harris' momentum has led some to ask: Could Trump replace Vance? And if so, how would it work? For those wondering, the answers lie in recent history and the fine print of Republican Party rules.It's still technically possible that Trump could choose a new number two. But such a decision would have to happen very soon.The Democratic and Republican National Committees have separate rules governing how they fill vacancies of presidential or vice presidential nominees. Under Rule 9, the Republican National Committee explains how it fills a vice presidential vacancy \"which may occur as the result of death, declination, or otherwise.\"The rule allows the party to reconvene its national convention if it chooses or to move ahead with a vote of the smaller group of Republican National Committee members who would determine Vance's replacement.Time arguably poses more complications than the specific rules, said Amy Dacey, former Chief Executive Officer at the Democratic National Committee and current Executive Director of the Sine Institute of Policy & Politics at American University.\"I think sometimes what people forget is that people start voting in September,\" Dacey told Business Insider. \"There's an early vote in some states in September. So this is not just a November election. And the worst case scenario would be for your nominees not to appear on a ballot in a state.\"Crucially, the rule explicitly applies to a scenario in which Vance voluntarily steps aside, according to Kenneth Mayer, a recently retired political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He told Business Insider that there's no precedent for forcibly ripping the nomination away from a vice presidential candidate after the convention.Mayer also told Business Insider that impending state deadlines pose a significant issue, and that the complications only snowball once ballots are printed. It would be, he said, \"extraordinarily disruptive\" both logistically and politically to replace Vance as the vice presidential nominee.Among Vance's biggest problems are his numbers — he is the least-liked vice presidential candidate on the heels of their convention since 1980, a CNN polling analysis found.Almost 80% of staffers and leaders disapproved of the Vance pick, according to a survey that Punchbowl News conducted at the Republican National Convention. Most of those asked thought that Trump should have gone with Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, instead.Though Trump has consistently stated his support for Vance, some in his orbit are reportedly questioning whether the Ohioan was a wise pick now that Harris will almost certainly be the Democratic presidential nominee. Trump has faced similar situation before. In 2020, there were rumors he would replace former Vice President Mike Pence on his ticket. Trump denied those reports. \"If I did, that would be a great act of disloyalty because he's been great,\" he said.A representative for Vance declined to comment on the record, and Trump's team did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Trump reaffirmed his support for Vance on Thursday, telling Fox News that Vance was \"doing a great job.\"\"He is fantastic. No, it wouldn't have mattered,\" Trump said when asked if knowing about Vice President Harris' candidacy would have changed his strategy.Left unsaid is that if a president or presidential hopeful were to replace their running mate, it would become an immediate scandal, one that risks overshadowing an entire election. Democrats did as much in 1972, when George McGovern dropped his vice presidential nominee, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, after only 18 days together on the ticket.Eagleton resigned under pressure after the public found out he had been treated for depression. The debacle is in part responsible for the extensive vetting process that modern vice presidential picks endure, as McGovern selected Eagleton at the last minute and with little scrutiny.Politics and journalism have undergone seismic shifts in the half-century since the Eagleton episode, but a similar level of chaos and speculation would likely arise should Trump make a similar choice.\"Rule Nine and the RNC rules don't cover what the practicality of this would be and how it would affect the Trump campaign,\" Mayer said. \"It would be hugely damaging. It's just hard to recover from something like that.\"","summary":"Trump continues to express his support for JD Vance, but it's still technically possible for him to choose a new VP in a messy mad-dash effort.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-donald-trump-could-replace-jd-vance-vice-president-poll-2024-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/66a29a58aab37011780a95af?width=1136&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:10:34","author":"Alice Tecotzky,Brent D.

The protesters poured red liquid onto the street, saying it symbolized the blood of those killed in Gaza. They chanted, “Arrest Netanyahu,” and brought in an effigy of Netanyahu with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The jumpsuit reads, “Wanted for crimes against humanity.” More than 39,000 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war in October. Dozens of Israeli hostages remain in Hamas captivity. In an address to Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu defended Israel’s conduct during the war, as thousands of demonstrators massed near the Capitol, marching through city streets carrying Palestinian flags and calling for Netanyahu’s arrest. Outside Washington’s Union Station, protesters removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place to massive cheers in the crowd. They sprayed graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus. In a statement Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, spoke strongly about the protesters’ actions. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent, and we must not tolerate it in our nation,” she said. “I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.” The number of protesters Thursday was significantly smaller than the day before. Hazami Barmada, who described herself as a grassroots activist, spoke through a megaphone of Biden’s decision not to see reelection and to pass the baton to Harris. “Biden did not voluntarily leave the race, Joe Biden was pushed out of the race,” she said. “And Kamala Harris still needs to prove her humanity” before earning the trust of pro-Palestinian voters. “I’m not going to give you my vote until you show you share the ideals that the Democratic Party is supposed to believe in,” she said. At one point, a young man with an Israeli flag draped over his shoulders walked into the middle of the protest circle and posed for the journalists’ cameras as the crowd jeered. Police worked to keep the two sides apart. As police led the man away — he wasn’t detained — Barmada shouted, “See, they even want to occupy our protests. Even our land isn’t enough!” As police cleared the way, the protesters later marched through city streets toward the National Mall. ___ Ashraf Khalil And Olla Mokhtar, The Associated Press","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Protesters against the Gaza war held a “die-in” across from Lafayette Park and the White House on Thursday as President Joe Biden met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In a televised address Wednesday night, the president framed his choice in almost existential terms. The defense of democracy, Mr. Biden said, “is more important than any title.” He did not utter former President Donald Trump’s name, but the implied warning was clear: that, in Mr. Biden’s view, electing his predecessor to another term could imperil American democracy. The Oval Office – where this reporter had the privilege of witnessing history as the only print journalist present – was packed. Much of the space was consumed by the equipment and crew broadcasting Mr. Biden’s speech and running the teleprompter. Biden aides squeezed in. Seated along the wall were his wife, children, grandchildren, and spouses. The only non-family member accorded that honor was decadeslong adviser Mike Donilon. The “restricted press pool” included a print reporter, a still photographer, and a network TV camera-person. It was like being on a TV set. But the import could not have been more real. The last time an American president opted not to run for a second term was in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced his decision from the same room, as the nation was embroiled in war abroad. Mr. Biden spoke faintly, haltingly, solemnly. The speech was laced with pride and a sense of what might have been, had he felt able to continue his campaign. He highlighted what he sees as the main accomplishments of his presidency, a reprise of his campaign pitch. In a preview of many more “farewell” moments to come, Mr. Biden cited the nation’s post-pandemic economic recovery, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., reducing illegal border crossings (after they surged in his term), battling climate change, and appointing diverse leadership in his administration. Winning the 2020 election was itself a major triumph, in Mr. Biden’s eyes. And preventing his predecessor from retaking the White House remains his overarching goal. “I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and still do, that the soul of America was at stake,” the president said. “America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.” Now Mr. Biden is making the case to elect his vice president, Kamala Harris, who almost certainly will carry the Democratic torch to November, amid a remarkably fast transformation of the Biden campaign into the Harris campaign. “I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris,” the president said toward the end of his remarks. “She’s experienced, she’s tough, she’s capable.” Mr. Biden didn’t say “vote for Vice President Harris,” reflecting his apparent desire to maintain a bit of separation between official duties and politics. On Sunday, when he released the letter announcing his decision to step aside from his reelection campaign, he did not endorse Ms. Harris as his replacement for the Democratic nomination. That came a half hour later in a social media post. But Wednesday’s speech was not devoid of politics. Mr. Biden has spent more than 50 years in the highest levels of elective office, and it infuses his being. He clearly relishes the game. And now, as much as he wanted to defeat Mr. Trump again, he decided to put “personal ambition” aside, as he put it. His badly faltering debate performance last month against Mr. Trump eventually left little choice but to leave the race, under pressure from his own party. Speaking at her regular briefing Wednesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Mr. Biden’s exit “has nothing to do with his health.” But, his recent bout with COVID-19 aside, the president’s increasing frailty in recent months has become impossible for even his most loyal allies to avoid. His childhood stutter, which he noted in his address, has been evident more frequently. Mr. Biden faces calls from some Republicans to resign the presidency itself, but his aides scoff at the idea, asserting that he has the acuity and stamina necessary to finish his term. Mr. Biden finished his remarks with a call for national unity – and a final implied warning of what a second Trump term might bring. “Let’s act together, preserve our democracy,” he said. The broadcast over, aides and family burst into applause. First lady Jill Biden walked over to the Resolute Desk, and stood beside her husband. Moments before, daughter Ashley seemed close to tears as she reached for her mother’s hand. Mr. Biden addressed the room. ”This has been the honor of a lifetime,” he said, followed by other words of gratitude. As this reporter was exiting the Oval Office, per the staff’s instruction, more applause could be heard – both from inside the presidential suite and outside in the Rose Garden. Staff had been attending a watch party there and eating ice cream, the boss’s favorite treat.","summary":"President Biden’s address to the nation sealed his historic exit from the presidential race, while framing the coming election in almost existential terms.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/0725/A-reporter-s-view-Inside-the-Oval-Office-at-a-pass-the-torch-moment?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2024/07/0725%20NBIDEN%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:06:39","author":"Linda Feldmann","authors":["Linda Feldmann"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.362},{"id":252632056,"title":"House Republicans vote to rebuke Kamala Harris over administration’s handling of border policy","text":"WASHINGTON — House Republicans are moving quickly to emphasize Vice President Kamala Harris’s role in the Biden administration’s handling of the U.S. border with Mexico, passing a resolution Thursday that condemns her performance in the job. The resolution, which is purely symbolic, echoes an attack line that Republican Donald Trump has taken against Harris since she rose to become the likely Democratic presidential nominee. All House Republicans and six Democrats in tough reelection races voted for the resolution. President Joe Biden tasked Harris early in his administration with addressing the root causes of migration. Border crossings eventually became a major political liability for Biden when they reached historic levels. Since June, when Biden announced significant restrictions on asylum applications at the border, arrests for illegal crossings have fallen. It remains to be seen whether the border will become a political liability for Harris as it was for Biden. But Republicans say Harris did not do enough to clamp down on illegal immigration in a role they characterized as “border czar.” “The result of her inaction has been record high illegal crossings, overwhelmed communities, and an evisceration of the rule of law,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Trump, if elected president, has pledged deport millions of people and has made anti-immigration rhetoric a central focus of his campaign. The House vote showed some early signs of cracks in the confidence that Democrats have so far bestowed on Harris. The six Democrats who voted for the resolution — Reps. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Mary Peltola of Alaska and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state — were mostly members from battleground districts and had previously been critical of Biden. The measure called for “elected officials who understand the gravity of the crisis at the border and who will execute the policies to fix the border crisis.” Golden said in a statement that he would “continue to be critical of this administration” when it comes to the border. Caraveo, who endorsed Harris this week, said in a statement that Harris would “stand up to party leaders when they’re wrong.” As vice president, Harris was tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to deal with issues spurring migration in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as pressing them to strengthen enforcement on their own borders. The Biden administration wanted to develop and put in place a long-term strategy that gets at the root causes of migration from those countries. Most House Democrats tried to defend how Harris has handled the job. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the resolution was “fake and fraudulent” and that Harris was never appointed “border czar,” as the measure stated. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who is the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Harris “was narrowly tasked with developing agreements that could help bring government and private sector investments to those countries that are sending migrants to the United States.” Jayapal said Harris successfully recruited “billions” of dollars in investments for Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Democrats also repeatedly pointed out that Republicans rejected a border and immigration deal that the White House negotiated with Senate GOP leadership earlier this year. Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, who won a special election this year on a campaign that focused on border security, said Harris has some potential strengths on the issue. He said Harris’ relationship with Mexico’s president-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum, and Harris’ past as a prosecutor could prove to be assets when it comes to the border. “I think now she has to emphasize the fact that she recognizes that the southern border is a problem,” Suozzi said. « Previous","summary":"Six Democrats also voted for the resolution, including Rep.

Vance told delegates: “Tonight is a night of hope. A celebration of what America once was and, with God’s grace, what it soon will be again.” He lambasted globalization and pledged to restore the ability of the American economy to create more jobs and be an energy-producing economy.When choosing Vance, the Republicans’ presidential nominee Donald Trump opted to escalate the stature of a rising star of the right wing of politics in the US and to intensify the appeal of the populist movement. It is Trump who has boosted that conservative-populist trend in American life since he first ran for president against Hillary Clinton in 2016. But Trump needs a successor, someone who can carry the torch of his Republican campaign in the years to come. He sees in Vance a political figure for whom he can serve as a political uncle as they campaign ahead of the Nov. 5 election against the Democratic successor to President Joe Biden, likely to be Vice President Kamala Harris.Trump selected Mike Pence as his running mate eight years ago. But Pence was a former governor of Indiana and part of the Republican establishment. Trump now wants to move further away from the establishment Republicans who were previously the dominant faction of the party. The establishment wing promotes the traditional Republican Party views of fiscal conservatism and support for a bigger US military. Nevertheless, its foundations have been shaken as it has compromised more on issues of government spending, abortion, taxes and frequent American military interventions abroad.Trump wants to undermine the set of beliefs espoused by the Republican establishment with the help of the man he hopes will be his future vice president. The essential attitude of the conservative-populist pursuit in American politics, as manifested by both Trump and Vance, is that these policies are depriving the American people of their liberties and freedoms. High taxes mean that people cannot do what they want with their money and America’s wars overseas mean that the US government is more interested in what is happening in other countries than on what is good for America and the American people. Repeatedly, Trump and Vance affirm their desire to “Make America Great Again.” And to follow “America First” policies.Vance is a disciple of MAGA. There are reports that he is a good friend of Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Trump. According to NBC News, President Trump was leaning toward North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his pick for running mate. That’s when Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump chimed in. “Don Jr. and Eric went crazy: ‘Why would you do something so stupid? He offers us nothing’,” a long-time Republican operative familiar with the discussion told NBC News. “They were basically all like ‘J.D., J.D., J.D.’,” the operative said.There have also been reports that Vance may approach his old acquaintances in Silicon Valley, California, who are known for their very liberal views and pro-Democratic Party stances. He will seek to neutralize them and convince them that the Trump agenda for the Republican Party and for the whole of the US would also fit with their own interests.The selection of Vance also reveals that Trump thought about other candidates and later dismissed them. He could not nominate Nikki Haley because she was his rival in the Republican primaries and always campaigned against him. He dismissed other choices like Burgum because he signed a law in his home state that banned almost all abortions. Vance is pro-life too. However, he never had the chance to sign a law determining what the rules on abortion should be.Vance’s age may also have been a positive factor that appealed to Trump. He will turn 40 in August. This could help Trump reach young voters, who are usually more liberal in their outlook. If Trump can siphon off a segment of them to vote for him, this will make it easier for him to return to the White House.Vance started out as a critic of Trump. Now, he is his running mate. This could also be a demonstration of the success of Trump. He convinced a former political enemy to support his views. Trump now aims to turn more of his critics into political allies. Since Vance was in the Marines, he will help Trump reach out to military men and women and their families. Trump can even do well with intellectuals thanks to the nomination of Vance, who is the author of a best-selling book titled “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.” He wrote it in 2016. It is a personal memoir of what he called “Appalachian values.” It is about growing up poor in Kentucky and what his family faced when living in Ohio, confronting many social and economic problems. While this book appeals to intellectuals, it will also resonate well with the American middle class. This could make Vance a real asset to Trump’s 2024 campaign.","summary":"Maria Maalouf At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week, J.D.

Desmond mistakes the newsreel cameras that will record her arrest for those of a studio that will capture her starring role in a new movie. Her delusion comes to mind while contemplating how California will fare if, as now seems almost certain, Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic nominee for president this year. It’s no secret that California, by far the most populous state, is not held in high esteem by those who live elsewhere. In fact, a 2023 study found that California is the fifth most disliked state, behind Illinois, New Jersey, New York and West Virginia. “A staggering nine of California’s western neighbors hate their guts,” the semi-serious study said. “Is it the water stealing thing? Whatever is, California doesn’t have a lot of friends around. Maybe a fruit basket would help.” Non-Californians, especially those who live in socially and politically conservative states, tend to see California as a dystopia of crime and deviant behavior, unaffordable living costs and ruinous taxation. The negative image is a relatively recent phenomenon. For decades, even before World War II, California was seen as a place of new beginnings and boundless opportunity. In 1980, its movie star former governor, Ronald Reagan, was elected president and four years later easily won a second term. However, as the nation’s politics polarized, California became one of those places that people on the other side of the political teeter-totter loved to hate. President Joe Biden’s historic announcement that he would drop his bid for a second term and throw his endorsement to Harris changes the dynamics of what would have been, and probably still is, an unpredictable contest. Former President Donald Trump was preparing to depict Biden as a doddering old man, incapable of governing, but now he will likely face Harris, who is two decades younger. He must devise a new strategy to prevail in the half dozen or so swing states whose voters will ultimately decide which contender secures the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House. One element of that strategy will be to demonize California, where Harris was born and where she climbed the political ladder from San Francisco district attorney to state attorney general, U.S. senator and finally vice president. There’s no shortage of fodder for a “California is a cesspool” campaign in those swing states, most of which have little in common with California. Video images of California’s squalid encampments of homeless people and smash-and-grab store robberies, its embrace of undocumented immigrants, its tight gun control laws and its high gasoline prices could be potent political ammunition. Trump will almost certainly claim that electing Harris would visit those California conditions on the nation as a whole, with illegal immigration perhaps being the most powerful potential issue in those decisive states. Harris will, of course, pound on Trump’s many problems, including his conviction on felony charges and other pending criminal cases. She has been the Biden administration’s point person on using abortion rights to attract swing voters in the wake of the Supreme Court’s repeal of its Roe v. Wade decision. This is not going to be a positive campaign. This is going to be a mudslinging duel to the finish, and California’s image will be a major weapon. Is California ready for its close-up?

Netanyahu’s first White House visit since 2020, when former President Donald Trump was in office, comes at a time of growing pressure in Israel and the U.S. to find an endgame to the nine-month war that’s left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza and some 1,200 dead in Israel. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden was using the meeting to reiterate his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved. “The gaps are closable,” Kirby said. He added, “But it’s going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.” Harris is scheduled to meet separately on Thursday with Netanyahu and is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages, who were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war. The Israeli leader is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee Trump. Biden greeted Netanyahu in the Oval Office, where the Israeli leader thanked the president for his service. The conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they’ve known each other. “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting. Biden thanked Netanyahu and joked that his first meeting with an Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, in 1973 soon after he was elected to the Senate came when he was only 12. A U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for the 81-year-old Democrat, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him. Following their talks, Biden and Netanyahu will meet the families of American hostages. For Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander-in-chief. She’s being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn’t done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel. A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is “no daylight between the president and vice president” on Israel. Harris’ last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she’s taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu. Netanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas. Netanyahu, in a fiery address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, offered a robust defense of Israel’s conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping “Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.” The Israeli leader spent scant time discussing the ongoing negotiations. “Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,” Netanyahu told American lawmakers. “Our fight, it’s your fight. And our victory will be your victory. ” Netanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration’s support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But Netanyahu also went out of his way to note actions that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran’s aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Netanyahu is set to travel to Florida on Friday to meet with Trump. Netanyahu also slammed protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran’s “useful idiots.” The Secret Service beefed up security at the White House ahead of Netanyahu’s visit, erecting additional fencing and barriers near the White House campus. Harris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,” Harris said in a statement. “I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.” Protesters massed near the White House on Thursday and chanted, “Arrest Netanyahu,” and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders. Trump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu’s address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015. White House officials said that her absence wasn’t a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. She’s also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president’s residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street. Harris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she’s been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel. She used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.

Jared Golden ‘absolutely not’ committed to supporting Kamala Harris","text":"Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, said Thursday he has not decided whether to support Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in her race against former President Donald Trump. Golden told a reporter for Axios Thursday that he is “absolutely not” committed to backing Harris and has to first hear more about her vision for the country. Golden released a written statement after the Axios story was published, saying that “our choice in leaders should never be a knee-jerk decision driven solely by party.” “I expect to have to work to earn Mainers’ votes and our candidates for president should expect the same,” Golden said. “Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just a few days and I look forward to learning more about what kind of leader she would be.” Golden also described what he would like to hear from Harris as she hits the campaign trail. “My hope is that she leans into her record as an attorney general and prosecutor and affirms her commitment to public safety and the rule of law – from going after the white-collar criminals who rip off the working class to securing our border and stopping the flow of deadly fentanyl into our communities,” he said. “I am curious to know her plans to lower costs for Mainers, protect Social Security and Medicare, safeguard our children’s future and prosperity and maintain America’s leadership on the world stage.” Golden has been distancing himself from his party as he runs for reelection. He published an Op-Ed saying he’s “OK” with another Trump presidency and released a TV ad highlighting his past efforts to work with Trump and Republicans. Trump has won the rural and more conservative 2nd Congressional District in the last two presidential elections. And Golden is facing a Trump-endorsed opponent this year, state Rep. Austin Theriault, a Fort Kent Republican and former NASCAR driver. “Jared Golden has gone full Washington as he changes his positions in desperation to win in November,” Theriault said in a written statement. Theriault said the Golden “took the position of every other slippery Washington politician who refuses to disclose who they’re supporting for president. As I grew up in Fort Kent, I learned to put people over politics – and Jared Golden’s not doing that right now. I’m running to bring more balance and less extremism to Congress.” Golden was part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to salvage key provisions of a bipartisan border security bill, which had been described as one of the strictest proposals in decades after Trump urged Republicans to walk away over concerns it would boost President Biden’s reelection chances. Golden had expressed concerns about Biden’s ability to serve another term and wondered whether the president’s lapses during a widely panned debate with Trump was an off-night or a sign of a bigger problem. But he stopped short of calling on Biden to withdraw from the race, which Biden did in dramatic fashion on Sunday. Golden told Axios during an interview on Capitol Hill that he is confident that Harris would be able to serve a full term and “that’s a positive step in the right direction, I think, from the perspective of the American people. They at least have a clear choice.” Golden’s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives is one of the most competitive in the country. And Republicans believe they have the wind at their backs after Golden changed his position and announced his support for an assault weapons ban following the mass shooting in Lewiston, which could weaken his support among gun owners, an important voting bloc. Golden, a former Marine from Lewiston, has been highlighting his independence from Democrats. He has opposed Biden’s policies more than any other House Democrat. His first TV ad of the cycle seems like it could have been written by a Republican. It highlights Golden’s breaks with Biden over spending and electronic vehicle mandates, and declares Biden to be “unfit to serve a second term.” The ad highlights Golden working with Trump and Republicans to secure the border while supporting police and increased domestic gas and oil production. Golden hasn’t regularly attended House Democratic caucuses in nearly three years, including one earlier this month about how Biden’s flagging campaign would impact down-ballot races. Golden gave a pre-recorded address to the state Democratic convention in May, citing an out-of-state family obligation. He was not present at Monday’s meeting when state delegates going to the national convention threw their support behind Harris.

Ryan Giggs' pregnant girlfriend Zara Charles offered a glimpse of her growing bump as she departed a hair salon in Cheshire on Thursday The mother-to-be opted for a tight white T-shirt and black cycling shorts as she departed the salon following a two-hour appointment This will be Ryan's third child, as the football ace already has son, Zach, 17, and daughter, Libby, 19, from his 10 year marriage to Stacey Cooke, while Zara has a daughter from a previous marriage. The baby is supposedly due later in 2024, with a source telling The Sun: 'Ryan and Zara are thrilled at the prospect of becoming parents again. 'They have a very solid, loving relationship and are building a long-term future together.' Insiders claim Ryan's ex wife Stacey - who divorced Ryan back in 2017 - has also given her blessing as well as their children. A source told The Sun: 'Ryan was nervous about what his kids would think but they've got to know Zara over the last few years and really like her. They're happy because they know he's happy... 'But they've joked that he might struggle with the early mornings and lack of sleep. Ryan and Zara are thrilled at the prospect of becoming parents again, they have a very solid, loving relationship and are building a long-term future together.' Another source told the publication: 'Stacey approves of Zara. Her and Ryan have been through a lot but they have moved on and she's only interested in him being happy, because that makes him a good dad to their kids. There is no animosity.' Stacey and Ryan divorced in 2017 after it was revealed he had been having an eight-year affair with his brother's wife, Natasha.

The marriage survived the affair - as well as Ryan, 50, cheating with Big Brother star Imogen Thomas - but they separated in 2016. According to Leiper Gupta Family Lawyers, the divorce could have cost Ryan £20million, but the pair's lawyers said they remained 'firm friends'. Ryan and Zara's exciting news comes after the former footballer returned to work as Director of Football at Salford City, the club he co-owns, after being cleared of assaulting former girlfriend Kate Greville in 2023.

But for world leaders, Joe Biden’s decision to end his reelection campaign signaled something even more profound. It is the passing of an era. Mr. Biden is the last in a long line of U.S. presidents viscerally wedded to America’s post-World War II vision of itself and its place in the world: as architect, leader, and linchpin in a web of alliances dedicated to promoting and protecting democratic friends over autocratic rivals. Key U.S. allies – above all, Ukraine – know that the real-world impact of Mr. Biden’s departure from office will still depend on who wins in November. Donald Trump has shown disdain for the vision of American leadership – rooted not just in power and self-interest but also in values – put in place after the world war, and for the overseas alliances forged along the way. Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s vice president and now Democratic candidate for the presidency, has stood shoulder to shoulder with her boss on Ukraine. She is likely to stay broadly on the path he has charted over the past four years. Yet the continued commitment to Ukraine that Ms. Harris feels, along with many fellow Democrats and some Republicans, comes from a different place than Mr. Biden’s. It has been shaped by a very different world, one in which politicians from both major parties have increasingly come to recognize the practical limits of America’s ability to deploy its resources, reach, and power overseas. And it comes from a different age. Mr. Biden, born in 1942, grew up in an America whose idea of itself was shaped by Washington’s extraordinary vision of U.S. leadership after the world war. Despite the postwar impulse of many Americans to retreat from the world – as one top U.S. diplomat put it at the time, to “go to the movies and drink Coke” – the United States extended billions of dollars in Marshall Plan aid to the battered economies of Western Europe, formed the transatlantic NATO defense pact, and championed its support for free nations, free-market economies, and free trade worldwide as the best way to “contain” Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union. In the decades since, U.S. foreign policy has not always matched that lofty vision. America has allied itself not just with democrats but with dictators, too. It has fought wars – Vietnam in the 1960s and ’70s, Afghanistan after 9/11, and Iraq in the early 2000s – that caused huge casualties and ended in chaotic retreats. But the ideal – the assumption that America had a special role in the world and a responsibility toward its allies and the world – was the North Star for American politicians who came of age politically in the postwar years. Even the younger ones. John F. Kennedy is remembered for a 1961 inaugural address urging citizens to rededicate themselves to moving America forward. But at its core, his speech was about America’s special postwar place in the world. “The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans,” he declared, “born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace.” They would be “unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed” – whether at home or “around the world.” This expansive view of American leadership, and the sense that it was key to defining what America is, has been an article of faith for Mr. Biden. It was critical in his response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Other presidents might well have opposed Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked assault on a neighboring state. They might well have responded with U.S. sanctions and urged allies to follow suit. That was pretty much the approach taken by then-President Barack Obama, a child of the 1960s, to Mr. Putin’s first attack on Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. Mr. Biden’s response has been of a completely different order. He brought to bear the full weight of his office in assembling and leading key allies, in Europe and beyond, in providing sustained financial and military support for Ukraine’s fighting forces. The closest recent parallel also came under a U.S. leader whose view of America was forged by the world war: Republican President George H.W. Bush’s response to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s attempted annexation of Kuwait in 1990. Mr. Bush, who fought in the world war, took a similarly personal lead in assembling a coalition of some 30 countries, including Middle East rivals, behind a U.S.-led invasion to dislodge the Iraqis six months later. It’s not yet clear how long and how assertively America will hold to Mr. Biden’s pledge to back Ukraine for “as long as it takes” once he has left office. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one of dozens of leaders to pay tribute to Mr. Biden after his decision, made clear his understanding of the president’s indispensable personal role in helping Kyiv fight back. “We sincerely hope that America’s continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or allowing its aggression to pay off,” he said.","summary":"Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race marks the end of an era of U.S. leaders who saw America’s global role as key to its sense of self.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2024/0725/biden-speech-trump-us-america-world-war-2?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2024/07/0725%20NBIDEN%20BIDENMEANING%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:54:37","author":"Ned Temko","authors":["Ned Temko"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.412},{"id":252631744,"title":"Six Democrats in tight races join GOP in criticizing Harris record as ‘border czar’","text":"House Republicans, joined by six Democrats, passed a resolution strongly condemning “border czar” Vice President Kamala Harris on her “failure to secure the southern border.” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), GOP Conference chairwoman, introduced the resolution that garnered a 220-196 vote. While border patrol officials recorded over the past few weeks the lowest numbers of illegal migrant crossings, Harris’s role in addressing the root problem of migration from Central American countries was brought back to light following President Joe Biden’s endorsement of her as the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris’s campaign team is mobilizing, having raised more than $100 million since she entered the race as a presidential candidate. In response, Republicans are looking to remind the public about the three-year period when more than 8 million illegal migrants crossed the border following Harris’s speech in which she told migrants “do not come.” Harris was never appointed to be a “border czar,” but she was tasked with “finding the root cause of migration,” which led to her being “known colloquially as the Biden administration’s ‘border czar.’” “No matter what congressional district you go to, the number one issue facing Americans is Kamala Harris’s open border crisis,” Stefanik said on the floor. “The American people deserve elected officials who understand the gravity of the crisis at the border.” Here are the six Democrats who have sided with Republicans on pinning the border crisis on Harris. Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) Serving in Congress since 2019, Golden has a record of voting against his party on border security bills. Back in 2022, he introduced legislation that aimed to strengthen Customs and Border Protection recruitment in rural areas. Although Golden has a strong record of supporting border security, he also faces a tight reelection, as the Cook Political Report labeled his race a “political toss-up.” In 2020, former President Donald Trump won Golden’s district. Golden was already on the record saying he wouldn’t commit to supporting Biden due to his health and age concerns and said at least Harris was “capable of finishing the next four-year term.” He then contradicted himself Thursday when he said, at this time, he is “absolutely not” committing to voting for Harris and is “going to wait and see what she puts forward and what her vision for the future of the country is.” Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-CO) In her first term as a representative, similar to Golden, Caraveo’s race has been deemed a tight one. However, despite condemning Harris for failing to secure the border, Caraveo has supported Harris’s run for the presidency. “I’m eager to elect her as the 47th President of the United States come November,” Caraveo said. Rep. Don Davis (D-NC) Davis is another freshman representative who has been a major critic of the Biden administration’s approach to securing the southern border. Davis was one of 14 House Democrats in March to denounce Biden for his handling of the border crisis. In April, Davis visited the border himself. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) Perez, another freshman representative, joined Golden and Davis in May, saying Biden’s executive order on asylum was not good enough. ​​“Border security must be the top national security priority for President Biden,” the statement read. “These proposed changes do not give the Border Patrol the authority it needs to bring order to our southern border, and the proposed changes will not be enough to stop the drug cartels from trafficking fentanyl over the border and into communities across America.” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) Currently facing criminal charges for bribery, Cuellar is another House Democrat who has joined in on blaming Harris for her lack of action at the southern border. Cuellar’s district includes cities and towns along the U.S.-Mexico border. In March, he launched a Democratic border security group. “It’s important for Democrats to talk about strong border security and still be respectful of immigrants’ rights,” Cuellar told reporters in March. “For so long, the Republicans have had a narrative about the border being a dangerous place and out of control. And I think it’s important that Democrats also have a narrative about border security.” Rep. Mary Peltola (D-AK) Elected in 2022, Peltola has made stopping the spread of fentanyl central to her time in office. She has crossed the aisle multiple times to vote with Republicans in favor of securing the border. “No one can deny we face an ongoing crisis at our southern border. Currently, fentanyl flows across it and all the way up to Alaska, where it continues to tear families and communities apart,” Peltola said in a statement. “We must take real action to address our ongoing border crisis — that’s why I voted to pass this measure and stop cartels in their tracks.”","summary":"House Republicans, joined by six Democrats, passed a resolution strongly condemning “border czar” Vice President Kamala Harris on her “failure to secure the southern border.” Rep.

During a CBS \"60 Minutes\" episode on Oct. 25, 2020, CBS News anchor Norah O’Donnell brought up the Democratic California Senator's liberal voting record, noting how progressive it is to the point where her and even then-presidential candidate Joe Biden clashed on some issues. \"You’re considered the most liberal United States senator,\" O’Donnell told Harris. \"Somebody said that and it was actually Mike Pence on the debate stage,\" Harris said, laughing. TRUMP SAYS HE 'WOULD BE WILLING TO DO MORE THAN ONE DEBATE' WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS However, O’Donnell was unwilling to write off the charge as a conservative smear, pushing back, \"Well actually, the nonpartisan GovTrack has rated you as the most liberal senator.\" The anchor listed off the issues where Harris had displayed her liberal bent as compiled by U.S. Congressional database GovTrack.us. The self-described \"government transparency website\" scored Harris as the \"most liberal compared to all senators\" in 2019, outranking even Sens. Bernie Sanders, Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, Mass., at the time. \"You supported the Green New Deal, you supported Medicare for all, you’ve supported legalizing marijuana,\" O’Donnell adding, noting, \"Joe Biden doesn’t support those things.\" She then asked if Harris would bring those liberal policy points of hers to the White House. Harris replied, \"What I will do – and I promise you this, and this is what Joe wants me to do, this was part of our deal – I will always share with him my lived experience as it relates to any issue that we confront. And I promised Joe that I will give him that perspective and always be honest with him.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The anchor asked if that would be a \"socialist or progressive perspective.\" Harris laughed and said, \"no.\" Since Harris has become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for 2024, her opponents have tried to remind voters about her liberal record. Former President Trump’s campaign recently told Fox News Digital that Harris is \"dangerously liberal.\" TRUMP SAYS BIDEN 'IS NOT FIT TO SERVE': 'WHO IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS?' While Trump’s campaign has kept Harris’ liberal record in the spotlight, the same website O’Donnell cited in her Harris interview four years ago has not. Earlier this week, GovTrack confirmed to Fox News Digital it had removed its 2019 web page that ranked Kamala Harris as that year's \"most liberal\" U.S. senator sometime within the last two weeks. The web page with the ranking was recently deactivated, and its link now displays a \"Page Not Found\" message. The Internet Archive shows the page was deleted some time between July 10 and July 23. Biden dropped out of the White House race and endorsed Harris on July 21, and she has since quickly consolidated party support to become the presumptive 2024 nominee. GovTrack founder Joshua Tauberer told Fox News Digital the page was removed because the company adopted a policy \"several years ago\" to end its single-year ratings of lawmakers and only do ratings based on Congressional sessions, which are two years.

Schumer, the nation’s highest-ranking Jewish lawmaker, was the last of the top congressional leaders to denounce the demonstration nearly 24 hours after it occurred outside of Union Station on Capitol Hill. “What happened at Union Station was vile, offensive, wrong,” Schumer posted on social media. “Hamas is a terrorist organization. Exalting them and burning Union Station’s American flag is disgraceful. Defacing public property is illegal. Hateful, antisemitic messages and threats against Jews have no place here.” Pro-Palestinian protesters, some of whom espoused support for Hamas with flags and graffiti on statues, burned American flags erected outside the popular Union Station travel hub and replaced them with Palestinian ones. Some altercations turned violent when police intervened to quell the vandalism and arrest individuals, including some demonstrators who attempted to physically drag officers away. The White House and Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, denounced what Harris labeled “unpatriotic protesters.” “I condemn the burning of the American flag,” she said in a statement. “That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.” Thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators swarmed the streets of the nation’s capital on Wednesday. At times, police said they were forced to deploy deterrents like pepper spray against agitators who threatened security perimeters around the Capitol, where Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress. U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan Police were assisted by officers from other agencies in preparation for the protests, including as far away as the New York Police Department. In addition to burning the American flag, demonstrators burned Israeli flags, chanted “Allahu Akbar,” graffitied a Christopher Columbus statue with “Hamas is coming,” and burned an effigy of Netanyahu. Roughly 100 House Democrats and more than two dozen Senate Democrats boycotted Netanyahu’s speech to protest his handling of the war in Gaza. Schumer attended, but he and Netanyahu declined to embrace with a handshake and simply nodded to one another. Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD), prior to Schumer’s condemnation, accused Democrats of “running scared” from their constituency. “I think it’s internal Democrat politics. I think they’re afraid of those voters,” Thune said. “I just think they are running scared of that constituency in Michigan and other places around the country that gets radicalized to the point of what you saw happening yesterday at Union Station.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Rep.

Donald Trump posted a video soundtracked by Don Toliver’s “Attitude” featuring Charlie Wilson and Cash Cobain to his TikTok account on Wednesday (July 24). The clip finds the former president blasting Vice President Kamala Harris by utilizing some of his previous soundbites attacking the probable Democratic presidential nominee while “Attitude” vocals thump in the background. “KAMALA, YOU’RE FIRED,” Trump captioned the video. Toliver has yet to publicly react to Trump’s TikTok. Billboard has reached out to reps for Don Toliver and Charlie Wilson for comment. With just over 100 days until the election, the twice-impeached former president takes several shots at Harris in the TikTok clip. “You’ve been terrible at everything you’ve done. You’re ultra-liberal and we don’t want you here. We don’t want you anywhere,” 45 spews. Fans were stunned to hear the worlds of the Cactus Jack artist and Trump colliding. “He saw Kamala use brat for promo and had to lock the f–k in,” one person wrote on X. Another chimed in, “We’re living in a simulation!” “Attitude” appeared on Don Toliver’s Hardstone Psycho album in June, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 — his highest since 2021’s Life of a Don. The Cash Cobain-produced single reached No. 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 16 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Kamala Harris has also had her share of music moments since Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21. Charli XCX endorsed the Democratic front-runner, claiming that “Kamala IS brat” after her acclaimed LP, and Harris HQ returned the favor by changing her X banner to the signature Brat lime-green tint with black text.

Daniel Miller, who fronts the Texas Nationalist Movement, says a Harris victory would ‘fuel’ his group’s goal — the withdrawal of Texas from the US, or ‘Texit.’ According to Miller, the Democrat’s track record on immigration and climate change would leave millions more Texans wanting to opt out. Secessionist feelings are already high in Texas — nearly a third of residents want to leave the US, polls show — even though the US Constitution does not allow it. ‘If Harris wins, expect Texit support to surge,’ Miller told DailyMail.com. It would deepen ‘polarization,’ expand the federal government’s reach in Texas and ‘fuel the desire for independence,’ he said. ‘People here see this political charade for what it is,’ Miller added. ‘Her favorability hovers somewhere between leprosy and a colonoscopy, and yet she’s hailed by the mainstream media as the second coming of JFK.’ Vice President Harris looks set to become the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Republican Donald Trump in November. President Joe Biden, under pressure over his poor debate performance, on Wednesday confirmed he would not seek reelection, saying he would ‘pass the torch to a new generation.’ This has focussed attention on the record of Harris, a former California Senator and attorney general who, if elected, would become the first woman and person of black and South Asian heritage to become commander-in-chief. She’s fought hard to cut America’s emissions of planet-heating gases, sponsored the hard-line Green New Deal resolution, and was instrumental in passing Biden’s historic climate bill. Those are popular in Harris’ native California and Washington DC — but less so in Texas, which yields 42 percent of America’s crude oil and 27 percent of its natural gas, says Miller. The same goes for the Democrat’s record on immigration, he adds. She was nicknamed the ‘border czar’ of the Biden administration, and for years failed to stop the growing influx of asylum seekers across into Texas and other frontier states. ‘Harris bears much responsibility for the border crisis and immigration, which combined are the number one concern for Texans,’ says Miller. The Lone Star state’s 30-million-and-growing population wants ‘self-governance’ and to keep a distance from Washington, he says. ‘Any federal policies that undermine our values will push more Texans towards Texit,’ he adds. His comments come in a divisive election year, and amid the runaway success of Civil War, a dark thriller about the US spiraling into conflict between the capital and breakaway states. Texas was an independent country 200 years ago, and growing numbers of its residents want that status back. The separation, dubbed Texit, takes its name from Britain’s ‘Brexit’ from the European Union. Miller says his movement, created in 2005, has never been so close to achieving its goal. He wants the state legislature to pass a law allowing a referendum on breaking away. The US Constitution, however, has no clause allowing states to do this — indeed, the secession of Southern states including Texas in 1861 led to the Civil War, the bloodiest war in US history. It’s getting more popular thanks to the influx of asylum seekers at the border with Mexico, he says. Texans feel they’d do a better job of managing the frontier without the federal government tying their hands, he says. ‘A Harris presidency not only continues but extends that Biden legacy,’ says Miller. ‘If you thought Biden was bad for Texas, her administration is going to be orders of magnitude worse.’ Across the US, about 23 percent of people want their state to bust out of the union. Those sentiments are felt strongest in Alaska, Texas, California, New York, and Oklahoma, recent YouGov polling showed. The survey showed that 31 percent of Texans want out — though Miller says it’s an undercount. Alaska is the most pro-independence state, with 36 percent of residents wanting the Last Frontier to call it a day and leave the union. Democrat-run California and New York are next in line to abandon ship, with 29 percent and 28 percent of residents favoring secession, respectively. Oklahomans (28 percent), Nebraskans (25 percent), Georgians (25 percent), Floridians (24 percent) and Washingtonians (24 percent) are also eyeing the door. At the other end of the spectrum is Connecticut, with just 9 percent of its relatively content residents seeking an out. The interest in secession has been showcased by the success of the movie Civil War, which grossed $69 million in the US, according to Box Office Mojo. The tense thriller sees a nation that’s collapsed into full-blown armed conflict. The military powers of Texas and California have united as Western Forces, which are descending on Washington, DC. They seek to overthrow an authoritarian US president, played by Nick Offerman. Meanwhile, fictional Reuters photographer Lee (Kirsten Dunst) and reporter Joel (Wagner Moura) take to the road with the aim of reaching the capital before it falls to rebels.

Park Police Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Kenneth Spencer told The Post in an interview a day after the unhinged riot that just 29 of his officers had faced down the terrorist-sympathizing mob outside Union Station – which is just blocks from the Capitol. “We were primarily alone,” said Spencer, a 15-year veteran who revealed that years of “empty promises” to beef up the agency’s shoestring budget have gone unfulfilled by Congress and the Interior Department, which primarily deals with the nation’s rural national parks rather than civil unrest in big cities. “Especially in the DC area, everybody’s so understaffed just like we are,” he explained. “We have a huge mission. We’re the agency that protects First Amendment rights when people come to visit DC.” But his officers are also “protecting major soft targets, terrorist targets in Washington, DC, New York and San Francisco,” despite his force falling under the non-law enforcement agencies of the Interior and the National Park Service. “If you remember in 2020, we were the agency that was in front of the White House, and we had 52 officers injured over those riots,” Spencer recalled of the demonstrations after the death of George Floyd. “We held the line and everything, but we were so badly understaffed then,” he added, noting there had been budgetary cuts in the intervening years. “We have fewer officers now … We’ve just been neglected.” Rioters tagged monuments with graffiti messages such as “Hamas is coming” and tore down US flags, burning and trying to replace them with Palestinian banners in opposition of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress. During his speech, the Israeli leader mocked Ivy League university protesters and other anti-Israel demonstrators for playing into the hands of Iran’s terrorist proxies — noting that some have received direct funding to do so. “When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you — you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots,” Netanyahu thundered. Other DC rioters manhandled the outnumbered Park Police officers, while others started throwing objects that had “a very strong smell of feces” but never struck anyone, according to Spencer. Just 10 were arrested, an agency spokesperson confirmed, with two occuring away from the clash at Columbus Circle outside the train station, while another nine were taken into custody by DC police. House National Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in anticipation of the protest on Thursday morning, warning the agency to “immediately address the USPP’s requests and provide additional officers and support.” “I don’t see how you could classify that as a peaceful protest, but if the Park Police only had 29 officers there to deal with that crowd, I would say they did a remarkable job of keeping things under control as well as they did,” Westerman told The Post. A National Park Service spokesperson said that “no resource requests” had been made or declined before the demonstration. Westerman added that the House Oversight Committee was weighing an investigation into the riot and any potential ties to foreign terror groups, before taking a swipe at Democrats — including Vice President Kamala Harris — for enabling years of destructive demonstrations. “It’s way too little, too late for them to come out and condemn things,” he said. Harris condemned the “despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric” of the Union Station riot in a statement on Thursday morning. The GOP committee chairman, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and others trekked out to Union Station after dark to put the US flags back on the polls, which were replaced the following morning. “Some of the national icons and the property, burning the flags, everything that we’re supposed to do and protect — we weren’t able to effectively do it,” Spencer lamented. “It’s not the boots-on-the-ground, it’s not their fault,” he clarified. “I’ve done everything in my power to address this with Congress, DOI, [National] Park Service, even the White House. Nothing’s been done.” “If 2020 were to happen again in front of the White House or in front of the Capitol or the Lincoln Memorial — anywhere downtown in Washington, DC — we are not going to be able to complete our mission,” Spencer warned. “It’s not sustainable.” The Metropolitan Police Department charged five people with crowding, obstructing or incommoding for blocking the flow of traffic near the Capitol building, including Chloe Moussa, 22, Lance Rami Farouk Lokas, Page Thorin, 24, Anam Hussain, 23, and Aiya Bettinger, 20. All except Thorin and Hussain hailed from states outside of the DC metro region from states including Florida, North Carolina and Hawaii. Two others were arrested and charged for crossing a police line — and two more for assaulting a police officer at Columbus Circle, one of whom was a 15-year-old minor from Ohio. US Capitol Police also coordinated with the Park Police but made no arrests at Union Station. Six people who disrupted Netanyahu’s speech were taken into custody by Capitol Police, including Michael Levy, 41, Carmit Palty Katzir, 45, Gil Dickmann, 32, Leat Ruben, 37, Alon Gat, 37, and Shahar Mor, 52.","summary":"It was a sh-t show.

Vance Had Sex With a Couch?","text":"Vice presidential hopeful JD Vance would like to be having a brat summer, but he is instead facing accusations of pushin’ the cushions of an unfortunate sofa. Social media has been inundated with jokes and memes suggesting Vance once pleasured himself between two couch cushions. What goes on between a man and his couch is between him, God, and whatever sexy sectional he chooses to victimize. While we can’t definitively state that Donald Trump’s running mate has never engaged in some furniture fornication, the viral allegation that Vance wrote about having sex with a couch in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy is false. On July 15, the day the Ohio senator was confirmed as Trump’s 2024 running mate, X (formerly Twitter) user @rickrudescalves wrote that they “can’t say for sure but [Vance] might be the first vp pick to have admitted in a ny times bestseller to f***ing an inside-out latex glove shoved between two couch cushions (vance, hillbilly elegy, pp. 179-181).” While Vance’s memoir contained plenty of gross generalizations about blue-collar, working-class Appalachians, he did not actually describe a sexual tryst with a hapless piece of upholstery. Regardless, the claim took off with a vengeance. Things escalated on Thursday when the Associated Press posted, then deleted, an article fact-checking the allegation. The piece was headlined: “No, JD Vance Did Not Have Sex With a Couch.” A spokesperson for the AP told Semafor that the story had been retracted because it hadn’t gone through the standard editing process at the wire service, and that the Associated Press was investigating how it made it to publication. While the couch-sex debacle is silly, it’s not helping Vance recover from a series of early campaign stumbles. Earlier this week, the senator was widely mocked for awkwardly joking that Democrats will accuse anything of being racist. “I had a diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today and I’m sure they’re going to call that racist, too,” he said at a rally on Monday. The cringey attempt at humor has also found its way into couch-related content: Vance was also widely criticized after a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson in which he attacked Kamala Harris as a “miserable cat lady” whose lack of biological children made her unfit to serve in elected office. Vance’s past comments about abortion and Trump have also been widely circulated. The comments about Harris, in particular, were met with widespread backlash by voters, commentators, and social media users who not only pointed out that Harris has two stepchildren but that attacking childless Americans — whatever their reasons for not reproducing — as inferior was a perilous message for a party already struggling to with the issue of reproductive rights and freedoms. Again, we don’t know if Vance actually enjoys pushin’ the cushions, but if his concern is that the country needs to produce more children, that’s definitely not how they’re made.","summary":"The viral allegation that Trump's VP pick wrote about pleasuring himself between two couch cushions is funny, but false","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jd-vance-couch-sex-rumor-explained-1235068142/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JD-Vance-Couch.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:46:11","author":"Nikki McCann Ramirez,Nikkimccannramirez","authors":["Nikki McCann Ramirez","Nikkimccannramirez"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":252629428,"title":"La campaña de Kamala Harris contempla a J.B. Pritzker como candidato a la vicepresidencia","text":"La campaña presidencial de Kamala Harris llamó el miércoles al gobernador J.B. Pritzker para evaluar su interés en ser candidato a la vicepresidencia, el primer indicio que el gobernador de Illinois está en la lista de los demócratas que se están considerando para unirse a la candidatura. La llamada marcó la primera vez que Pritzker hablaba con la campaña sobre el papel desde que Harris anunció su candidatura, según una fuente con información sobre la conversación. En su participación en el programa “The Lead with Jake Tapper” de CNN el miércoles por la tarde, se le preguntó a Pritzker si está siendo considerado como compañero de fórmula de Harris, y el gobernador respondió que no podía hacer comentarios sobre “conversaciones privadas”. Cuando Tapper le preguntó si aceptaría el puesto número 2 en la candidatura si se lo ofrecían, Pritzker respondió: “Bueno, creo que ya lo sabes, me encanta ser el gobernador de Illinois. “La gente de Illinois me ha honrado con ese cargo en las dos últimas elecciones. Y sabes, sería reacio a hacer un cambio, pero sería difícil resistirse a una llamada y a ser considerado si la candidata me llamara para preguntarme si quiero ser considerado para la vicepresidencia”, dijo Pritzker a CNN. Una portavoz de Pritzker dijo el miércoles que “el comentario del gobernador habla por sí solo”. El martes, Pritzker dijo en el programa “Morning Joe” de MSNBC que no se le solicitó material de investigación de antecedentes. “Me encanta ser el gobernador del Estado de Illinois, y he estado en campaña luchando duro para que ganen los demócratas. ... Estoy muy interesado en asegurar que Kamala Harris sea la próxima presidenta de Estados Unidos”, dijo Pritzker el martes. Horas después, Pritzker dijo a Erin Burnett, de CNN, que “obviamente tendría que considerarlo si se lo piden”. La consideración para la vicepresidencia llega tras días de barajeo entre Pritzker, el gobernador de Carolina del Norte, Roy Cooper; el gobernador de Pensilvania, Josh Shapiro; el gobernador de Kentucky, Andy Beshear; el senador estadounidense Mark Kelly, el secretario de Transporte, Pete Buttigieg, entre otros. Pritzker, que tiene ambiciones presidenciales, no aspiraba a ser vicepresidente, pero se mostró abierto a la posibilidad después que la vicepresidenta anunciara su candidatura para encabezar la candidatura. El gobernador demócrata, a pesar de haber hecho campaña durante meses para el Presidente Joe Biden y de haber aparecido en la televisión nacional, sigue teniendo dificultades para aumentar su perfil fuera de Illinois, según las encuestas. Pero como demostró en su campaña a gobernador de 2018, que inició asombrosamente 18 meses antes del día de las elecciones, una gran cantidad de dinero puede ayudar a elevar su perfil. Pritzker, el multimillonario heredero de la fortuna Hyatt, ha invertido $323 millones en sus dos campañas. Y se le considera un candidato favorable a la campaña de Harris para ayudar a acortar, o impulsar, cualquier diferencia en la recaudación de fondos. También cuenta con una base leal de colaboradores, dispuestos a saltar a la acción cuando él esté listo. Pritzker, de 59 años, es un adicto a la política y tiene profundos vínculos con los demócratas de California. Nació en Palo Alto y creció en el estado en la década de 1970. Pritzker mantiene una relación cercana con la ex presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, residente en San Francisco y amiga íntima de la madre de Pritzker. Pritzker perdió a su madre, que sufría de alcoholismo, en un espantoso accidente de automóvil cuando él tenía 17 años, sólo 10 años después de que su padre muriera de un ataque al corazón a los 39 años. Pritzker ha atribuido a su madre el mérito de haberle inculcado su interés desde muy joven por el derecho al aborto y el activismo progresista. Su historial como gobernador se alinea con las prioridades demócratas. En su primer mandato, el demócrata de la Gold Coast firmó cuatro presupuestos, proclamó mejoras en los malos resultados financieros del estado y firmó leyes que elevaron el salario mínimo, legalizaron la marihuana y consagraron el derecho a abortar en Illinois en un momento histórico. Y lideró al estado a través de la devastadora pandemia. En enero de 2023, firmó una ley para prohibir las armas de asalto en Illinois, una medida que hasta ahora ha sobrevivido a varios desafíos legales. Como posible vicepresidente, Pritzker podría hacer gala de sus habilidades prácticas en campaña. Durante la primera campaña de Pritzker a la gubernatura, sus colaboradores se enteraron de que el entonces recién llegado a la política no podía salir de una habitación sin estrechar la mano de todas las personas.

The rapper took to X to share a 20-minute Spaces rant, expressing empathy that following President Joe Biden’s dropout from the presidential race, Vice President and potential Democratic nominee Kamala Harris “has 70, 80 days to change people’s perspective of her.” She continued, “I always knew how people are when it comes to women, but the disrespect? Listen, if you don’t like her as a politician, that’s you. But if you disrespect her because she’s a woman?

Netanyahu arrived in the U.S. on Monday after being invited by members of Congress to address lawmakers during a joint session. Harris, who became the likely Democratic nominee for president after Biden withdrew from the race, was not present to greet Netanyahu on the tarmac when he arrived. The Israeli prime minister delivered his address to Congress Wednesday, where he detailed the horrors of the country's war against Hamas. Harris declined to preside over the address and instead attended a sorority event in Indiana. Anti-Israel protests broke out across Washington D.C. ahead of Netanyahu's big speech, where agitators burned the American Flag, called the Israeli prime minister a \"war criminal,\" and vandalized a Liberty Bell replica with pro-Hamas writing. ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS BURN AMERICAN FLAGS, ACCUSE NETANYAHU OF BEING ‘WAR CRIMINAL’ AS HE ADDRESSES CONGRESS A leader from the Republican Jewish Coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that works to lobby for conservative interests, has said that if Harris is elected, he expects her to follow in President Biden's footsteps regarding Israel moving forward. \"If you thought Joe Biden was bad on issues of top concern for pro-Israel voters, Kamala Harris is far worse,\" Sam Markstein, RJC national political director, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"It took her a full day to issue a weak condemnation of the pro-Hamas mobs that burned American flags and chanted vile antisemitic slogans at Jews in Washington, D.C. – with zero mention of any concrete action she would take to hold them accountable. It should be easy to condemn antisemitism – the real question is what she will do to confront it, and her statement speaks for itself,\" Markstein added. \"Clearly, her priorities are not our priorities – and if elected, we can expect more of the same.\" Harris condemned the protests in a statement Thursday: \"Yesterday, at Union Station in Washington, D.C., we saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric. I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.\" Netanyahu's U.S. visit comes at a critical moment in Harris' campaign, as she works to replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket and make her case to voters just four months before Election Day. GOP LOOKS TO REVOKE VISAS FROM PARTICIPANTS IN VIOLENT PROTESTS AHEAD OF NETANYAHU ADDRESS Harris has said that she supports Israel's right to defend itself since the October 7 attack, but also highlighted calls for a ceasefire in the region. The vice president met with Benny Gantz, a rival of Netanyahu and member of Israel’s wartime cabinet, in March. That same month, Harris became the first administration official to call for an \"immediate ceasefire\" in the conflict. But anti-Israel protests erupted on college campuses across the country in the spring, and in June, Harris expressed sympathy for the agitators. \"They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,\" Harris said in an interview with The Nation. \"There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don’t mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Kamala Harris and the Democrats will reap what they’ve sowed in this election – from undermining the US-Israel relationship to unprecedented lows and overseeing a spike in antisemitism to record high,\" Markstein said. \"The Jewish community is more energized than ever to help elect Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States to restore law and order to our cities and colleges so that American Jews can walk the streets and campuses without fear.

But the data suggest a strategic running-mate choice could help the Democrat in some of them. That’s the takeaway from five fresh Emerson College surveys taken July 22 and July 23, the two days immediately after President Biden withdrew from the race. “In Arizona, 49% support Trump and 44% support Harris. In Georgia, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Michigan, 46% support Trump and 45% Harris. In Pennsylvania, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Wisconsin, 47% support Harris and Trump respectively,” says the polling memo released Thursday. In Arizona, Harris isn’t helped by 57% of respondents disapproving of Biden’s job performance. An expanded field also hurts Harris. When Robert Kennedy Jr., Libertarian Chase Oliver, Green Party hopeful Jill Stein and Cornel West are factored in, Trump’s lead stretches: 48% to Harris’ 40%. Harris could be boosted in the state by selecting Sen. Mark Kelly, a favorite of Barack Obama, as her VP, however, as 36% of respondents said the former astronaut would be her best selection. Whether he could deliver the state is a more open question. Turning to the Peach State, Biden’s 51% unfavorability is also a drag on the likely Democratic nominee, whose deficit increases to 3 points in the expanded field. And it’s unclear any vice-presidential hopeful will help her: Sen. Bernie Sanders, an unlikely choice, tops the hypothetical field with 17%. Michigan presents some contrasts. Harris and Trump are tied at 44% in the expanded field, with the veep outperforming her two-way numbers. And the polling suggests she should make Gretch happen in the veep slot, with 27% of respondents picking Gov. Whitmer as their favorite running mate. Pennsylvania is another battleground Harris may be helped in by picking the state’s governor, as 40% of respondents want the popular Josh Shapiro to be her running mate. Shapiro is +18 when it comes to job-performance approval in the state, suggesting he could be a major boon. Without Shapiro, Harris is down by 2 points to Trump whether in a two-way matchup or an expanded field, so a strategic pick may make the difference there. Turning to Wisconsin, it’s notable the race is tied regardless of whether the matchup is polled as Harris-Trump or the expanded field. Though there are differences among the candidates in the polling, there are also prevalent trends, including a gender gap. In all five states, Harris leads with women and Trump with men. And in most cases, the candidate who is behind isn’t close. The Republican is up by double digits in all five battlegrounds with his own gender, and Harris leads by 9 or more points in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the blue-wall states. This polling also suggests the “double hater” phenomenon is in effect with Harris and Trump, regarded unfavorably along with President Biden by more than 50% of respondents in all five states. These polls track with previous battleground-state surveys showing that swing states could go either way in November. A North Star Opinion survey conducted between July 20 and 23 shows Trump up by 2 points in the Keystone State in a head-to-head battle with Harris. A Landmark Communications poll conducted Monday in Georgia shows Trump with 45.8% support, just 1.5% above Harris in a six-way race.","summary":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is holding an edge against Vice President Kamala Harris in most of the states actually up for grabs in November.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/slew-of-swing-state-polls-show-donald-trump-with-battleground-edge-over-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-vhb4ook3i-1721930295326.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721915932&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wPb0Y7rU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:42:16","author":"A.g.

Trump, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, as her fresh candidacy was quickly reuniting a Democratic Party that had been deeply fractured over President Biden. Just days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Ms. Harris as the presumptive nominee, with only 14 percent saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process. Her swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Mr. Trump’s significant advantage over Mr. Biden of only a few weeks ago. Ms. Harris was receiving 93 percent support from Democrats, the same share that Mr. Trump was getting from Republicans. Overall, Mr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in a head-to-head match.

Presumably, much of the merchandise with this slogan will have little relevance for the rest of the presidential campaign. However, the claim of a lawsuit, let alone a \"Breaking News\" story about it, appears to have been made up.The image used in the post on X was pulled from an unrelated Fox News story about a Trump merchandise seller published in 2021. Business owner Keith Lambert shared the photo from one of his \"Let's Go Brandon\" stores in New England.There have been no reports that Lambert is planning to sue the president over losing money on merchandise purchases.Newsweek has contacted an associate of Lambert for comment.There are no other legitimate news stories about such a lawsuit.

A new survey of more than 5,000 members of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee obtained by RealClearPolitics shows a newly energized Democratic base. Enthusiasm for the Democratic presidential ticket more than doubled between the first debate, a historic low point for the left when President Biden s diminished acuity was on full display in Atlanta less than a month ago, and the moment Harris replaced Biden, a swap accomplished in less than 72 hours. Those who were very enthusiastic spiked from 34% post-debate to 78% with Harris today, while those not enthusiastic at all plummeted from 33% to 5%, said Ethan Jasny, a quantitative analyst with the organization. Our PCCC membership generally tracks with Democratic voter sentiment broadly. This spike in enthusiasm is a key indicator in a year when base turnout could be determinative to who wins the White House. The depression on the left was palpable each week Biden refused to go quietly. Internal data from the progressive group quantifies that melancholy but also the subsequent bounce back. For instance, after Atlanta, 66% of PCCC members reported fears that Democrats would lose the White House. Fast forward three weeks: The number of progressives afraid of losing the Oval Office drops to just 27%. The White House will take notice of those numbers. The PCCC has pull inside the administration. Earlier this year, co-founder Adam Green was meeting with top Biden advisors urging them to have Biden read from a more progressive script. Talk less about Bidenomics, he told the West Wing, and more about taxing billionaires to pay for Social Security. Biden took some of that advice during his State of the Union address with mixed results. For the vice president, now the presumed Democratic nominee, progressive populism is a more natural language. During her time in Congress, Harris was ranked the most liberal member of the Senate by the government transparency group GovTrack in 2019. While the polling data will likely intrigue the Harris campaign, it will serve only as confirmation. They have relied on a different barometer: cash. The vice president brought in more than $81 million in donations in the first 24 hours after declaring her candidacy. As the conservative Washington Examiner observed, though, she had to violate her 2020 pledge to do it: She cashed checks from lobbyists and corporations. Those concerns are secondary to what progressives see as an existential election to save democracy itself. The left sees November as a binary choice, and the progressive polling includes another result that will delight the Harris campaign. According to the survey, the number of Democratic voters considering a third-party alternative to Biden and Trump after the debate, 17%, plummeted to just 8% after Harris became the standard bearer of her party. Republicans looking from the outside in at both the money and the positive polling have sounded the alarm. For their part, the Trump campaign insists any bump is just a result of the Harris honeymoon. When voters learn of her record, a policy portfolio to the left of Biden, GOP operatives insist, the electorate will adjust. Among progressives at least, they love it and her. We expect this downward trend in third-party flirting to decrease as more voters learn about her, said Jasny.","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/07/25/harris_delivers_jolt_of_adrenaline_to_progressives_enthusiasm_surges_151334.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:38:00","author":"Philip Wegmann,RealClearPolitics","authors":["Philip Wegmann","RealClearPolitics"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":252629206,"title":"Trump quickly moves to define Harris as 'more left than Bernie Sanders'","text":"CHARLOTTE, N.C. - In his first campaign event since the presidential race was upended, former President Trump didn't waste any time in trying to define his new opponent. At a rally in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he derogatorily called \"lying Kamala Harris.\" Harris has succeeded her boss, President Biden, as the presumptive Democratic Party nominee after Biden - in a blockbuster announcement on Sunday - dropped his re-election bid and endorsed his vice president. TRUMP HOLDS FIRST RALLY AFTER 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE TRANSFORMED The embattled president's immediate backing of Harris ignited a surge of endorsements of Harris by Democratic governors, senators, House members and other party leaders. By Monday night, the vice president announced that she had locked up her party's nomination by landing the backing of a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention. She also hauled in a staggering $129 million since Biden's announcement, her campaign touted on Thursday morning. IT'S A MARGIN OF ERROR RACE BETWEEN TRUMP AND HARRIS Trump, speaking to a packed arena in Charlotte, aimed to paint Harris as the \"most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.\" He charged that she \"has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office.\" And pointing to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the far-left champion and two-time runner up for the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump argued that Harris is \"more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Can you believe it?\" Throughout his more than hour and a half stream of comments, Trump repeatedly slammed the vice president over border security and crime, two top issues in the 2024 election. The strategy by Trump, his campaign, and allied groups, is simple: Define Harris, who is not nearly as well known to Americans as Trump and Biden, before Harris has the chance to define herself. Trump campaign spokesman and senior adviser Steven Cheung said that the former president's team was ready to go on offense the moment Harris succeeded Biden as the Democrat's standard-bearer. \"There wasn’t any surprise. We were prepared for it. We had all our assets ready. We had all our content ready. It didn’t surprise anyone,\" Cheung told reporters ahead of the Trump rally. Longtime Republican consultant David Kochel emphasized that both the Trump and Harris campaigns are \"in a race to define\" the vice president and that most Americans \"know so little about her record … It’s go time for both sides.\" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns who remained neutral in the 2024 Republican primary, noted to Fox News that \"Trump’s got a big megaphone.\" He offered that Trump's slights are \"not without merit,\" as he noted that Harris \"did run to the left of Biden\" in the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination race and that \"she had one of the most liberal records in the Senate when she was there.\" Harris is pointing to her hefty law enforcement resume as she spotlights Trump's numerous legal controversies, including his 34 felony convictions two months ago in the first criminal trial of a former or current president. \"As many of you know, before I was elected as vice president, before I was elected as a United States senator, I was the elected attorney general of California. Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds,\" Harris said Monday at an event at her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. \"Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,\" she emphasized as she pointed to Trump's multiple lawsuits and criminal cases, many of which are ongoing. Harris repeated the line of attack the next day at a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Trump responded at Wednesday's rally, saying \"I don’t think people are going to buy it.\" And he argued that the vice president \"was one of the worst prosecutors in history\" and that \"she destroyed San Francisco.\" The former president touted his support for law enforcement and landed the backing of the National Association of Police Organizations, as the group's president, Michael McHale, joined Trump on the podium to formally endorse the GOP nominee. The Harris campaign panned Trump's performance, with spokesman Ammar Moussa calling it \"an unhinged, weird and rambling speech\" and arguing that \"the American people won’t be fooled or distracted\" by Trump's salvos. The jabs by Trump come as Harris is in the process of taking full control of the Biden campaign, cementing her nomination, which will formally come as early as next week during a virtual roll call ahead of the Democratic convention, and choosing a running mate by early next month. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Harris is enjoying plenty of earned media during this seemingly honeymoon phase of her fledgling campaign, when it comes to paid media, the Trump campaign and its aligned groups currently have a massive advantage. Trump's air superiority will likely be short-lived, as the Harris campaign appears to be working to produce and air spots as soon as possible. \"She needs to be on the air with some pretty compelling bio stuff,\" Kochel emphasized. Ahead of the rally, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said that even though Trump is now facing a new opponent at the top of the Democrats' ticket, the GOP's strategy \"does not change … at all.\" \"We have been running our race, and we are going to continue to run our race,\" Whatley, a former North Carolina GOP chair whom Trump installed as RNC chair in March after clinching the Republican nomination, emphasized in a Fox News interview. Whatley, speaking at the rally site at Charlotte's Bojangles Coliseum, noted that Trump and the RNC will relentlessly tie Harris to Biden's policies on border security, fighting inflation, crime and other top issues in the 2024 election. \"The Democrats not only have a messenger problem, they have a message problem. And Kamala Harris is doubling down on every single one of Joe Biden's failed policies. It's the Biden-Harris administration, the Biden-Harris campaign. And she is picking up that mantle,\" Whatley argued. Fox News Mark Meredith and Jennifer Johnson contributed to this story.

On Sunday, Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis, told CBS-58 in Wisconsin that he believes “a lot of Democrats feel they have to stick with her because of her ethnic background.” Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., accused Harris of being a “DEI hire” in a CNN interview on Monday and claimed that Biden wanted to pick a Black woman as a vice president: “When you go down that route, you take mediocrity.” DEI – which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion – refers to the initiatives and programs intended to address discrimination against historically marginalized groups within schools, businesses or government agencies, according to industry experts. In a 2020 debate, Biden stated that he would “pick a woman to be vice president,” not declaring a specific race. In a later interview with ABC News that August, Biden added that he “didn’t feel pressure to select a Black woman.” “The government should look like the people, look like the country,” said Biden in the interview. “Fifty-one percent of the people in this country are women. As that old expression goes, ‘women hold up half the sky,’ and in order to be able to succeed, you’ve got to be dealt in across the board.” In another 2020 interview, with MSNBC, when asked about who his potential running mate might be, Biden said, “I am not committed to naming any (of the potential candidates) but the people I’ve named, and among them there are four Black women.” DEI has been increasingly used as the basis for criticizing or questioning the qualifications of women, people of color, people in the LGBTQ community, and other marginalized groups in positions of authority. These initiatives have been the target of conservative legislation nationwide, with lawmakers claiming they promote racial division and unfair advantages for marginalized groups. Those in favor of DEI initiatives say these programs aim to remedy longstanding forms of inequality, such as pay inequity, inaccessibility in the workplace, discrimination in hiring practices, and more. Harris, who is currently the vice president, was a U.S. senator for four years, California’s attorney general for six years, San Francisco’s district attorney for about seven years, and got her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. In an interview on NBC News Now, Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy said the DEI attacks on Harris are “stupid and dumb.” “I disagree with DEI, but she’s the vice president of the United States,” said McCarthy. “These congressmen that are saying it, they’re wrong in their own instincts.” Since joining the race, Harris has garnered support from Democratic legislators, advocacy groups and others across the country. Her campaign has raised $100 million since entering the race for president on Sunday, according to her campaign. About 58,000 people also signed up to volunteer for the vice president’s campaign, a figure that is more than 100 times its average daily signup rate, according to the campaign.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is facing criticism centered on her race from&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Understanding DEI: Republicans criticize Kamala Harris using a term that experts say is often misinterpreted first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/understanding-dei-republicans-criticize-kamala-harris-using-a-term-that-experts-say-is-often-misinterpreted/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:36:39","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.235}]}
