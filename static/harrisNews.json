The former vice president and 2024 Democratic Party nominee said people right now are feeling like “they’ve lost their minds” living under this administration.\n\n“We are living history right now, and you all storytellers are living this,” Harris said. “You’re not passive observers, you know that. You’re living it, and I would ask you that all the emotions that we are feeling — give those emotions, give that experience to those people that you are writing about and writing for. It gets back to my point about helping people just put a label on it, even if it doesn’t change the circumstance. Because there is so much about this moment that is trying to make people feel like they’ve lost their minds, when in fact, these mothaf–kas are crazy!”\n\nShe added: “I don’t envy some of the folks who are here, who are in a situation where you are being subtly — or maybe not even so subtly — sent signals that now is not the time to speak a certain level of truth with a certain level of candor. There will always be risk associated with speaking truth. It’s just a fact. And because truth often when spoken with the intent of bringing daylight, sunshine, to an issue – not for the sake of being provocative, but because it just must be told – truth can often be difficult to speak and even more difficult to hear. And so this moment, where there are so many lies and so much misinformation, the battle to tell truth is more profound than it’s ever been, because the counter forces that are spreading this information are so rampant, and ubiquitous.”\n\nHarris’ recent media tour promoting her book, “107 Days,” has led to a number of soundbites and ratings. When she dropped by “The View” back in late September, she explained that she thought the differences between her and former president Biden were obvious despite constantly being asked.\n\n“I didn’t fully appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference between me and President Biden. I thought it was obvious,” Harris said. “And I didn’t want to offer a difference in a way that would be received or suggested to be a criticism and, you know, in the campaign full time, I was pointing out the differences!”\n\nHer appearance on the show also boosted it to the biggest audience “The View” had enjoyed since June.","summary":"\"This moment, where there are so many lies and so much misinformation, the battle to tell truth is more profound than it's ever been,\" the former vice president adds\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris Slams Trump Administration on Book Tour: &#8216;These Mothaf&#8211;kas Are Crazy!&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/kamala-harris-slams-trump-admin-book-tour/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/KamalaHarris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 22:37:10","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":367144404,"title":"Why ‘fed up’ Napheesa Collier went scorched earth on WNBA commissioner","text":"Napheesa Collier rocked the sports world during her fiery exit interview — and now she’s explaining why. \n\nSitting down with former Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday, the Lynx star elaborated further on her decision to torch WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert in her end-of-season media availability on Sept. 30.\n\nCollier, 29, stood by her decision to pull back the curtain and blast the “worst leadership in the world” for poor officiating and stalled CBA negotiations — explaining that the persisting issues in the league had gone on long enough.\n\n“I am on the union for CBA negotiations … and for so long, I felt like I saw what was going on behind closed doors,” Collier told Harris at the “A Day of Unreasonable Conversation” summit. \n\n“For so long, we tried to have these conversations and move the needle. … And I saw nothing was changing.”\n\nThe 2024 Defensive Player of the Year recounted private conversations with Engelbert during her scathing tell-all press conference following Minnesota’s playoff loss to the Phoenix Mercury.\n\nCollier alleged that the WNBA commissioner said “Caitlin [Clark] should be grateful” for the WNBA and that “players should be on their knees thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.”\n\n“I think I just got to the point where I was fed up,” Collier told Harris. “Whether I was going to get annihilated for this or people were gonna support me, I felt like what I was doing was right.\n\n“I felt like it needed to be said. “I felt like it was something that needed to be done.”\n\nCollier was scheduled to meet with Engelbert next week, but the Minnesota forward canceled the meeting after the commissioner denied making the comments that Collier listed in her fiery media address.\n\nESPN reported that Engelbert’s denials have “pretty much pushed the relationship beyond repair.”\n\nThe WNBA Players Association is pushing for higher salaries and increased revenue sharing as part of the CBA negotiations.

Each door displayed a QR code that unlocked video hints to unravel a code phrase, which fans needed to look up on Google. This journey concluded at the lyric video for the album’s kickoff track, “The Fate of Ophelia.”\n\nAs fans deciphered the video hints, some noticed peculiar text, blurred images, and objects behaving in unexpected ways. Under the hashtag #SwiftiesAgainstAI on X, discussions arose about the possibility of the videos using generative AI.\n\nSwift hasn’t directly endorsed the campaign featuring the orange doors, leaving her degree of involvement in producing the clips uncertain. These clips briefly appeared as Shorts on her YouTube channel.\n\nCurrently, the Shorts are not accessible on Swift’s YouTube platform. However, her latest video for “The Fate of Ophelia” and the 12 lyric videos from the “Showgirl” album remain available, none of which incorporate AI.\n\nA representative for Swift did not provide comment for the story. Google did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA victim of AI-created deepfakes, Swift has openly stood for artists’ rights to their creations. This stance potentially fueled fan disappointment regarding the promotional videos, as AI frequently trains on data that includes copyrighted materials.\n\nSome fans pointed out that Swift appeared to use hand-painted props on the set of the music video for “The Fate of Ophelia,” noting that the music icon has long been very thoughtful about the presentation of her work. \n\n“When so much effort has been put into the rest of the album rollout … I think it is very, very lazy and disappointing to use generative AI to create videos a human being very much could have done,” Rachel Lord, a self-described fan of Swift, said in a TikTok video. \n\n“I think it’s very important that we as fans talk about how much we disagree with this, because if we don’t talk about it, they’re just going to continue with it,” she said, emphasizing that she’s not “hating on Taylor.”\n\nThe controversy arose amid some mixed reviews for Swift’s latest album, which topped Spotify charts and sold 2.7 million copies in its first day of release. While many have praised the upbeat bops on “The Life of a Showgirl,” others have said the tracks lack the kind of lyricism they have come to expect of Swift.\n\nSwift’s diehard fan base has traditionally come to her defense amid any backlash. The AI speculation and the subsequent criticism, however, appeared to come just as much from her fans as her detractors.\n\nIn a Reddit post about the orange door promo clips in the popular r/TaylorSwift community, a moderator wrote: “The videos are most likely AI generated. We typically do not allow AI content, but given that this is somehow related to the album push we are clearly going to keep this thread going.”\n\nSeveral are calling on Swift — who has not commented on the AI speculation — to make a statement about the matter.\n\n“Dear @taylornation13, We expected a decent album promo but we noticed that the promotion on cities were made by A.I,” wrote one X user who describes themself as a “taywarrior” and Swiftie in their bio. The post had been viewed more than 1.3 million times as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“A.I has a large impact on the environment and wildlife because of its LARGE water consumption and more,” the user added. “Please learn better next time. #SwiftiesAgainstAI.”\n\nThe use of AI in media production has been a polarizing subject in the entertainment industry. As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into film, TV and music production, artists have railed against the technology due to concerns over labor displacement as well as AI companies’ scraping of human-made work without consent or compensation.\n\nOutside of vocal pushback from artists and studios, AI image, video and music generators have been hit with numerous copyright infringement lawsuits from authors, artists, news outlets, mass media companies and music labels.\n\nSome of Swift’s defenders have argued that the seemingly AI-generated quirks in the videos might be explained with computer-generated imagery. Others have insisted that CGI would not cause objects to morph, blur or disappear when the camera moves.\n\nSwift has not condemned the use of AI usage as a whole, but she has previously condemned its misuse. In a 2024 Instagram post endorsing Kamala Harris for president, Swift addressed President Donald Trump’s attempt to tout an AI image of her.\n\n“Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,” Swift wrote. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTaylor Swift’s fans are used to scouring her videos and social media&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Fans Eager for Taylor Swift&#8217;s Clarification on AI Use in Recent Promo Videos first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/fans-eager-for-taylor-swifts-clarification-on-ai-use-in-recent-promo-videos/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Taylor-Swift-fans-want-her-to-clarify-whether-AI-was.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 21:34:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.06},{"id":367140052,"title":"Republican Senator Blast NFL Booking &#039;Second-Rate&#039; Bad Bunny for Super Bowl","text":"Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio has joined a growing chorus of conservatives denouncing the NFL’s decision to book Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl LX halftime performer, calling it a “partisan” and “insulting” move that disrespects American traditions.\n\n“The NFL made a decision that was clearly partisan,” Moreno said in an interview with independent journalist Nicholas Ballasy. “Why else would you pick, you know, some second-rate musician to play in our greatest sporting event? It makes no sense whatsoever. I thought the guy’s Saturday Night Live appearance was insulting to the country.”\n\nMoreno, a first-term senator and outspoken ally of President Donald Trump, argued that the halftime show should “bring the country together” rather than, in his view, highlight divisions. \n\n“I hope they reverse course and bring a great American performer in there that brings pride into America,” Moreno said, calling Bad Bunny’s booking a product of “Trump derangement syndrome.”\n\nSenator Bernie Moreno speaks to reporters in Washington, D.C., after a Senate vote on February 19, 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Images)\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nBad Bunny—born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio—has been Spotify’s most-streamed artist worldwide for four consecutive years. His 31-show residency in Puerto Rico this year generated nearly $700 million for the local economy and made global headlines. The NFL called him “the most popular artist on Earth” when announcing his upcoming performance on September 28, underscoring both his commercial power and cross-cultural influence.\n\nBut the announcement also sparked backlash from conservative commentators, who criticized Bad Bunny’s political views, including his past criticism of Trump and support for Puerto Rican independence. The reaction intensified after his recent Saturday Night Live appearance, where he opened his monologue in Spanish and joked, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.” What was meant as playful confidence quickly became a rallying point for his critics.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nMoreno is one of the last GOP politicians to criticize the NFL’s decision to have Bad Bunny headline the next Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called his SNL monologue “perverse” and urged Congress to pass her bill making English the official national language before the game, something Trump has already claimed to do by executive order.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said ICE agents would be “all over” the event. On Fox News, Tomi Lahren accused Bad Bunny of “hating America, hating President Trump, hating the English language.” Even Trump weighed in, calling the NFL’s choice “absolutely ridiculous” before admitting he didn’t know who Bad Bunny was.\n\nWhile the NFL has faced criticism in recent years over political controversies surrounding its halftime shows, the decision to feature Bad Bunny also aligns with its commercial ambitions. The show will be produced by Roc Nation, the company founded by Jay-Z, as part of a partnership launched in 2019 to diversify the league’s entertainment lineup and appeal to younger and more global audiences.\n\nBad Bunny during his monologue on “Saturday Night Live” on October 4, 2025.\n\n“What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring,” Jay-Z said in a statement. “We are honored to have him on the world’s biggest stage.”\n\nStill, the prospect of having Bad Bunny perform in the same stadium as the president has drawn attention. The Puerto Rican rapper supported Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election and declined to tour the continental U.S. this year, citing concerns for his fans’ safety amid intensified ICE crackdowns.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, on X: “Bad Bunny says America has four months to learn Spanish before his perverse, unwanted performance at the Super Bowl halftime.”\n\nFormer NASCAR driver turned conservative commentator Danica Patrick, on X: “Oh fun. No songs in English should be allowed at one of America’s highest-rated television events of the year…not just for sports.”\n\nAmílcar Barreto, a political science professor at Northeastern University, told Newsweek: “If you’re thinking about music culture right now, he’s at the top of the summit. But by doing it in Spanish, he’s challenging the idea that English is the only legitimate language in American life. That’s why it reads like a provocation—it’s not just music.”\n\nAmelia Tseng, linguistics director in the Department of World Languages and Cultures at American University, told Newsweek: “It’s controversial because language is a symbol of identity, and we’re in a moment of cultural battle over who America is. The Super Bowl is a giant stage for American identity. But it’s important to recognize that America is, and ...","summary":"Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio criticized the NFL’s decision to book the rapper as the Super Bowl LX halftime performer.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-moreno-blasts-nfl-bad-bunny-super-bowl-second-rate-10842999","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25272465003757.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 21:13:38","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":367139120,"title":"FBI Says Jack Smith Monitored Private Calls of Nearly a Dozen GOP Senators During Jan. 6 Probe","text":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Former special counsel Jack Smith allegedly monitored the phone calls and personal messages of multiple Republican members of Congress during his probe of President Donald Trump’s efforts to contest the results of the 2020 presidential election, Fox News reported.\n\nRepublican Sens.

Andy Harris, R-Md., previously told The Daily Signal he considers the subsidies “a COVID-era insurance company giveaway scheme.”\n\nHe added, “The insurance companies have made billions of dollars off the enhanced tax credits. It’s about time to return to the pre-COVID level of tax credits with the original [Affordable Care Act] tax credits.”\n\nWhen those surveyed are told that “these subsidies go directly to insurance companies, not to Americans using the health care system,” 61.8% of respondents say they are less likely to support their extension.\n\nAdditionally, when informed that “extending the federal health insurance subsidies will cost taxpayers $400 billion over the next 10 years,” a 50.6% majority of respondents say they are “less likely to support” extending “federal subsidies for health insurance companies.”\n\nThe survey’s polling sample included 44.9% of respondents who said they voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 election, and 47.5% saying they voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"A week into the federal government shutdown, Senate Democrats are demanding the extension of expiring enhanced health care premium tax credits, claiming the credits, enhanced...

For example, just hours into the shutdown, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (and Project 2025 author) Russell Vought announced that Team Trump would hold back $18 billion in infrastructure funding that had previously been approved for New York City “to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.” (In response, New York governor Kathy Hochul said, “We are definitely being punished, not just for being a blue state but for being the home of the leaders.”) Later that day, Vought said the administration would cancel nearly $8 billion in clean energy funding (which he called “Green New Scam funding”), a move that affects projects in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. According to The New York Times, which spoke to a source familiar with the matter, “the Department of Energy considered more extensive cuts, totaling about $20 billion in a broader roster of states led by both parties,” but decided against it.\nWhile administration officials have insisted that they are merely trying to save the taxpayers money, and absolutely not targeting blue states out of, say, spite, the message from the president has been…slightly different. For one thing, he called the prospect of further cutting “Democrat agencies” an “unprecedented opportunity,” and posted a video on Truth Social last week that featured Vought as the grim reaper coming for Democrats. “By and large, during a shutdown a president seeks to minimize the pain on the American public. That’s not the case this time,” Senator Alex Padilla told Politico. “Donald Trump, Russell Vought, and [White House deputy chief of staff] Stephen Miller and everybody around him are very intentional about exploiting the shutdown to make it more painful for people and constituencies that they deem the enemy. That’s absolutely un-American.” Matthew Lawrence, a law professor at Emory University, told the Times Trump’s actions are without precedent, saying, “I can’t think of a historical parallel of an administration publicly cutting funds in a shutdown like this.”\nOf course, the president’s targeting of blue states via budget cuts comes as he has ordered the National Guard to Washington, DC; California; Chicago; and Oregon. On Sunday, the president told US naval recruits, “We have to take care of this little gnat that’s on our shoulder called the Democrats,” days after he told military generals to “handle” the “enemy from within.” (Over the weekend, Judge Karin Immergut—a Trump appointee—twice blocked the administration’s attempt to deploy National Guard troops in Oregon, writing in her first decision, “This is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law,” and saying the DOJ’s arguments for doing so “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power—to the detriment of this nation.” On Monday, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a suit against the Trump administration to block it from sending Guard members from elsewhere in the country into the state and from federalizing the Illinois National Guard; a judge gave the administration until Wednesday night to respond.) The National Guard has also been deployed to Memphis, though the move has been welcomed by Governor Bill Lee. (Memphis mayor Paul Young says he is “certainly not happy” with the deployment.)\nOn Monday, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin defended the administration’s deployment of the National Guard to cities that do not want the military presence—like Chicago—saying Democratic leaders are “aiding and abetting domestic terrorists.”","summary":"Oregon, Illinois, and California are among the targeted states.

That election was winnable. Did you know that there are 250,000 gun owners in New Jersey that are not registered to vote? If simply every Second Amendment supporter got registered and voted, we would flip New Jersey from blue to red.\" Presler is on a \"flip it red\" mission in the Garden State, registering voters and promoting GOP candidate Jack Ciaterelli's campaign against Democrat candidate, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in an off-year election that could add to the Democratic Party's mounting woes following 2024's ballot box losses or preserve the party's legacy in the longtime blue state. Presler is the founder of Early Vote Action, a PAC he operates that focuses on voter registration and rallied support for President Donald Trump's campaign and the GOP in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania during the 2024 election. The Republican activist spent months criss-crossing the Keystone State to rally support for the Trump–Vance ticket before the battleground ultimately threw its support behind the GOP on Election Day. BLUE STATE GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEES TRADE BARBS OVER CRUCIAL ISSUE WEEKS AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY Presler has since crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey, where he's targeting the longtime blue state with conservative activism. \"We just won a landslide victory for Donald Trump, winning all seven swing states and winning the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with our work at Early Vote Action. In December of 2024, I announced that we were going to focus next on helping to flip the New Jersey governorship from blue to red. So we have currently, 14 full-time staff on the ground across New Jersey's 21 counties. We have been working tirelessly all throughout 2025, helping to register voters. And our message is: leave no county untouched,\" he said, explaining he and staff are not only focused on deep blue counties ahead of the election, but also on reinvigorating voters in rural and right-leaning counties. New Jersey is in the midst of a \"Lord of the Rings\" or \"Star Wars\" moment, Presler said, saying voters have the chance to \"save their state\" and pointed to data showing how Republican support has increased in the state. \"This is their opportunity to save the state. This election in 2025 is gonna be seen as a referendum. The final opportunity, this is your ‘Lord of the Rings,' This is your ‘Star Wars’ moment when people have the chance to save their state,\" he said. CIATTARELLI UNLOADS ON MIKIE SHERRILL IN NJ TOWN HALL, CITING IMMIGRATION AND NAVAL ACADEMY: ‘NOT A CENTRIST’ New Jersey voted to elect former Vice President Kamala Harris as president nearly a year ago. Trump, however, made big inroads with Garden State voters, flipping five counties red, and improved on his 16-point loss in the state during the 2020 election to a six-point loss in 2024. \"Every month besides June, when that party switching was happening, Republicans have gained in an off-year election when the Democrats are spending more money than us and in a blue state. That shows me that I think the tide is changing, and I think that we have wind at our backs,\" he said. Presler rattled off that New Jersey voters have become increasingly incensed by the state's notoriously high property taxes, its spiraling energy rates and even its ongoing ban on plastic bags at checkout lines that have spurred some residents to abandon Democrats in favor of the GOP ticket. \"Republicans, we must be that common-sense home, that common-sense party, that we are going to bring down property taxes, which is hurting New Jersey families — and that's the number one issue that I hear about,\" he said. \"That we wanna bring down electricity prices, the number two issue that hear about from voters. And voters also want the third common-sense issue, which is law and order. They want us to deport and arrest criminal illegal aliens that are committing crimes against New Jersey voters. And from being on the ground this last year in 2025, I think you're gonna see a huge amount of independent and Democrat voters vote for Jack because of those three common sense policies.\" The activist pointed to one former Democrat voter and teacher he chatted with at a fair in Sussex County, New Jersey — a rural area of the state that borders both New York and Pennsylvania — who remarked Democrats had become so \"extreme\" in their views that he left the party and is considering casting a red vote.

And so that just shows me that Democrats are fleeing their former party. And they're looking for a new home.\" Gen Z, the youngest American generation that is able to vote, played a pivotal role in delivering Trump a victory in 2024, with Presler saying male Gen Zers, specifically, are moving more to the right in New Jersey's gubernatorial election. The GOP activist pointed to another resident he chatted with during the Monmouth County, New Jersey, Fair over the summer, an 18-year-old who was not yet registered to vote. \"When I am talking to a voter, I really want to get into the mind and the head of the voter. And I was just asking him some questions. ‘Hey, would you like to own a home one day?' And he was saying, ‘Yeah I want to but gosh the property’ — he said this, not me — 'the property taxes are so high here,'\" Presler recounted. \"As I'm just talking to him, I'm really discerning most of his beliefs. I think all of them really are congruent with the Republican Party. And so I'm courting him, and I'm asking for his vote for Jack Ciattarelli, and I am asking him to register to vote. And it's young men like that man that I think you're going to see who carried Donald Trump to victory in 2024, a lot of those some voters are gonna come out this year,\" he added. NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR'S RACE: DEMOCRAT SHERRILL LEADS REPUBLICAN CIATTERELLI BY SIX POINTS IN 2026 BELLWETHER Sherrill is in the midst of facing a campaign scandal after a report in September revealed that the United States Naval Academy blocked Sherrill from taking part in her graduation amid the cheating scandal. The Democrat House lawmaker slammed the release of the report and said she was banned from walking at her graduation because she declined to report classmates who were involved in the scandal. \"Mikie ‘Cheating Scandal’ Sherrill,\" Presler called Sherrill. \"She voted against (the Laken Riley Act). She has no plan to bring down property taxes. She has no plan to bring down electricity crisis prices. And she doesn't know where she made her money, $7 million worth in stock trades. … In fact, I would argue that those are the reasons why Democrat turnout is gonna be depressed. Their candidate is uninspiring versus Jack Ciattarelli.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Sherrill's campaign Tuesday morning regarding Presler's remarks but did not immediately receive a response. On the flip side, Presler said, Trump-endorsed Ciattarelli is offering voters policies that would bring taxes and electricity prices down, ending New Jersey's ban on plastic bags, opposing offshore wind to protect marine life, among other policies.

'Please. He's got nice hair, but I'd rather bleed from the eyes than take his advice on crime. Your aunt's Facebook page has more credibility.' \n\nAs for former President Joe Biden, Kennedy holds no punches - painting him as a frail leader who was surrounded by tofu-eating 'weenie-wokers' who were 'convinced of their superior intellect and values'.\n\nHe describes Biden's advisors as 'aggressive and prissy' and 'moral snobs'.\n\n'Their attitude seemed to be that everything in America is poisoned and everything in America needs to change,' he writes. 'And they, with their infallible instincts, believed they were just the ones to change it.' \n\nIn one anecdote that captures Kennedy's defiant humor, he recalls one Oval Office visit with Biden in which he took great delight in dragging out his conversation with the president, while his anxious aides became desperate to usher him out. \n\nKennedy was there to discuss his Dump Opioids Act, but then decided to inquire about Biden's German Shepherd, Major, which was known to bite a number of Secret Service agents: the dog was later removed from the premises.\n\nHe describes Biden's advisors as looking at him 'like I stole Christmas and Thanksgiving.'\n\n'One kept touching my elbow, trying to guide me outside...I kept ignoring him. This was fun.' \n\nLater, when Biden invited him to the Cabinet Room, Kennedy recalls watching the president walk across the Oval Office in a painfully slow manner. \n\nHe writes that it was like 'an old lady crossing the street on her way to church.'\n\n'My impression of Biden that afternoon was that he had reached the stage of his life where what he most wanted to do was sit around, talk to people, and tell stories about the old days,' he adds. \n\n'And when he tired of doing that, he wanted soup and an early bedtime.' \n\nKennedy, a former lawyer who was raised in the small city of Zachary, Louisiana, served as the state's treasurer for 17 years, before becoming a US Senator in 2017.\n\nHe admits that while he was used to the bareknuckle tactics of Southern politics, nothing prepared him for the madness of Washington D.C.\n\n'When you're elected to the United States Senate, you're pretty much on your own from day one', Kennedy writes. \n\n'I learned pretty fast that in Washington, D.C., normal is just a setting on the clothes dryer.' \n\nKennedy's baptism by fire came when Democrats began clamoring for Trump to be indicted for allegedly working with Russia to win him the 2016 election, claims he denied strongly.\n\nThe claims about collusion 'became an obsession, particularly with the media,' he says. \n\n'For them, it was like Will Smith slapped Chris Rock every day. A manic frenzy.\n\n'It was around this time that I first began noticing just how thoroughly some of my Democratic colleagues had lost perspective.\n\n'When the topic was Trump, everything they served up came with a side order of crazy.\n\n'The politicians weren't alone. The media, which had always leaned left, was in many ways worse than the Democrats.\n\n'...they took a hard left and kept driving. In giving up any attempt at objectivity or impartiality, they became an unrecognizable shell of their former selves,' he writes. \n\nBut despite the political circus, Kennedy quickly got used to Senate life including its quirks and traditions, such as how only milk and water are allowed on the chamber floor.\n\nDebate is tightly regulated, and Kennedy chafes at the fact the Senate Majority Leader, currently John Thune, has complete control over what comes to the chamber floor for a vote.\n\nBut he describes being a senator as the 'hardest job I've ever had - and the best.' \n\n'Most nights, when I come home to my little Capitol Hill apartment, I've got two wheels down and my axle dragging.\n\n'But it's a good kind of tired. I might complain, but it's like complaining on a yacht. I'll do this job until I run out of gas or my people tell me to come home.' \n\nStill, Kennedy has managed to put his imprint on the US Capitol, decorating his office with a 12-foot stuffed alligator and bringing Cajun food for work lunches.\n\nHe also quickly got the measure of other Republican senators such as Marco Rubio, now the Secretary of State and Ted Cruz of Texas. \n\nKennedy describes the two as characters that could 'talk a dog off a meat wagon' because they are so persuasive.\n\nHe also takes jabs at other senators, including his friend and GOP ally Lindsey Graham with whom he sometimes clashes.\n\n'We don't agree on everything, especially some aspects of foreign policy,' he says of Graham, before making a swipe at his notoriously hawkish stance. \n\n'If you want to stump Lindsey, just ask him to name a country he wouldn't bomb,' Kennedy quips.\n\nHe pokes fun at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who describes 'like a five-year-old in a Batman costume on a sugar high' when he cuts loose.\n\nAnd Susan Collins and Jeanne Shaheen, the moderate Senators from Vermont and New Hampshire, who are Republican and Democrat respectively, earn Kennedy's grudging respect.\n\n'They're very, very earnest,' he writes, adding: 'Imagine a cross between a hall monitor and a class valedictorian. I honestly believe that Susan and Jeanne think \"WTF\" stands for Well, That's Fantastic'.\n\nKennedy goes on to mock Democrat John Fetterman - infamous for wearing sweatpants, shorts, and hoodies at the US Capitol - saying he looks like he has just 'paused his videogame to come vote on a bill'. \n\nOf Kamala Harris, he writes that the former vice president reminded him of 'first-year attorney taking a deposition.' \n\nHe also shares anecdotes of heated arguments between senators that have turned ugly, such as when Graham once shouted, 'F**k you, Bob!' to former Republican Senator Bob Corker. \n\nHe recalls a similar exchange of F-bombs between Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican and the late Senator John McCain.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, McCain told Cotton: 'F*** you, Cotton'. Cotton fired back: 'F*** you too, McCain. Just f*** you'.\n\nKennedy appears to prefer humor rather than crass language, once joking to a reporter that Thune had a tattoo of the Backstreet Boys on his lower back - within earshot of Thune himself.\n\nEven Trump doesn't escape Kennedy's wit and willingness to speak frankly.\n\nThe two men worked together on the sale of the 5G phone band auction after Kennedy realized that the profits were going to be taken by private companies.\n\nAfter Trump intervened, the government took over the sale and has so far netted $50billion for taxpayers.\n\n'Trump can be cruel, sometimes he is wrong, and he and I are unalike in many ways,' Kennedy wrote.\n\n'I've acknowledged that. But we are alike in our appreciation of candor.\n\n'The president and I are both willing to work near a hot wire, but the president sometimes touches the wire.\n\n'He asked me one time how I liked his tweets. My response, which I thought was diplomatic, was: \"Mr. President, I like them. I also like steak. But I don't like eating eight of them at one time\".' \n\nThat 2023 trip to China left Kennedy with a chilling insight into President Xi, who he met at a long table full of his advisors.\n\nDuring the meeting, he writes Xi's expression 'never changes', like he was 'playing poker for his life.' \n\n'Here's what sticks with me most about that trip: President Xi is a hard man,' Kennedy writes.\n\n'In America, when you lose your support, you get voted out. In China, when you lose your support, you get killed. Maybe that's why Xi has shark eyes.\n\n'They don't show anger or violence. They also don't show humanity. They don't show anything.","summary":"Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana takes aim at everyone from Donald Trump to Chinese President Xi Jinping - and Democrats in new memoir, How to Test Negative for Stupid.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15170059/Outspoken-Senator-John-Kennedy-tears-Trump-Biden-tofu-eating-wokesters-blistering-no-holds-barred-memoir.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/07/15/102779583-0-image-m-92_1759848288773.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 17:37:00","author":"Daniel Bates,Editor","authors":["Daniel Bates","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":367084898,"title":"Here’s how Trump could screw federal workers even more","text":"If you thought that the GOP’s government shutdown couldn’t get any worse, think again. \n\nA draft memo from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed federal employees may not be guaranteed pay for their forced time off—an explosive shift likely to ignite backlash from federal workers and lawmakers alike.\n\nAxios first broke news of the draft, which Daily Kos has not reviewed. It’s unclear how seriously the idea is being considered, but it would mark a dramatic escalation in President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign against Senate Democrats—denying back pay to about 750,000 federal workers until the shutdown ends.\n\n“This would not have happened if Democrats voted for the clean CR,” a senior administration official told Axios.\n\nThe draft memo argues that the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) has either been misinterpreted or is “deficient” because it was amended nine days after Trump signed it into law on Jan. 16, 2019.\n\nThe Trump administration’s stance hinges on a single phrase added during that amendment—that furloughed workers shall be compensated “subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse.” In plain English, that means that Congress would need to specifically allocate the money.\n\nTo the White House, it’s a technical distinction with significant implications. \n\n“If it [GEFTA] was self-executing [in future shutdowns], why did Congress do that? It’s precedent,” the senior official said, calling any other interpretation “ridiculous.”\n\nGEFTA has long been understood to guarantee back pay for furloughed employees after a government shutdown. \n\n“Does this law cover all these furloughed employees automatically? The conventional wisdom is: Yes, it does. Our view is: No, it doesn’t,” another senior White House official said.\n\nRelated | The shutdown is Republicans’ fault—so why are voters mad at Democrats?\n\nTrump originally signed the law during the 2019 shutdown—which was the longest in U.S. history—to ensure that workers received their pay once the government reopened. Before that, Congress typically had to pass one-off bills to authorize back pay, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers in limbo for weeks.\n\nOther than those who are furloughed, federal employees will continue working without pay until the standoff is resolved. Their first partial paychecks arrive later this week, according to CNN—and for many, they’ll be the last until the shutdown is resolved.\n\nThe existence of the draft memo also clashes with Trump and other GOP leaders’ public assurances. Over the weekend, while celebrating the Navy’s 250th birthday at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, Trump told sailors not to worry about delayed pay.\n\n“I want you to know that despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” Trump said. “Don’t worry about it. It’s all coming.”\n\nThe draft memo also contradicts the Trump administration’s own recent statements. Both the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Personnel Management said in September that furloughed workers would automatically receive back pay once the shutdown ends.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the new analysis, the American Federation of Government Employees told CNN that it conflicts with OPM’s earlier assurance that workers would be repaid “on the earliest date possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.”\n\nUnions and government advocates argue that the White House is misinterpreting the law’s intent—and targeting federal employees to raise the political stakes. \n\nThe Trump administration has already outlined other hardball tactics: OMB Director Russ Vought has floated mass firings of federal workers—which legal experts say would be illegal—and announced $8 billion in energy cuts across 16 states—all of which voted for Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nSpeaking to Axios, one Trump adviser summed up the mindset bluntly: “Trump will take his chances in court. Why not?”\n\nFor now, the GOP’s shutdown drags on—and Trump appears determined to make federal workers the ones who pay for it.","summary":"If you thought that the GOP’s government shutdown couldn’t get any worse, think again. \n\n\n\nA draft memo from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed federal employees may not be guaranteed pay for their forced time off—an explosive shift likely to ignite backlash from federal workers and lawmakers alike.\n\n\n\nAxios first broke news of the draft, which Daily Kos has not reviewed.

We cannot simply allow this court to continue to do that which it has done. They don’t focus on precedent, they focus on personnel. And by that, I mean, you know, they think, 'Alright, we've got six votes and we can now do things that are inconsistent with precedent, long-term precedents that have been put in place,' to the detriment of our democracy, to the detriment of fairness — and that means political fairness as well as economic fairness.

Eighteen years is enough for anybody to serve on the Supreme Court, and that has huge support by Republicans, by Democrats, by independents.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris said in October 2024 that she supported some form of Supreme Court reform. \"There is no question that the American people increasingly are losing confidence in the Supreme Court and, in large part, because of the behavior of certain members of that court and because of certain rulings, including the Dobbs decision and taking away a precedent that had been in place for 50 years, protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body,\" she said during a campaign town hall. \"So, I do believe that there should be some kind of reform of the court, and we can study what that actually looks like,\" Harris added.

The Senate confirmed her via voice vote in 2019. Immergut was involved in a probe pertaining to the salacious scandal that indelibly marked President Bill Clinton's White House tenure. \"I was hired by Ken Starr almost five months after Attorney General Reno sought to expand the OIC’s authority to investigate whether Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury, obstructed justice, or intimidated witnesses in connection with the civil sexual harassment case in Jones v.

Only 13 percent of men and women over 50 said they would support a woman candidate.\n\nThe survey of 801 registered voters through the university’s Women and Politics Institute was performed online from September 3-6 and has a 3.5-point margin of error.\n\nDespite wide majority support for more women in politics, the survey reveals paradoxical thinking among voters, who trust women on critical issues and want to see more of them in office while “persistent bias” and narrow expectations emerge when it comes to envisioning them as president.\n\nExpectations for a “first female president” are narrowly defined, with the picture of a married Democratic mother under 65 with political experience as a model candidate, the survey found.\n\nWomen candidates also face a “double bind” where survey respondents want women to be both “tough” and “likable” in standards that are not typically applied to their male counterparts, the poll found.\n\nRepublican men are more likely to believe women achieve leadership roles due to alleged hiring quotas or through manipulation, while women are more likely to see structural barriers and an “old boys’ club” as well as negative media scrutiny and self-doubt as key deterrents that prevent more women in politics.\n\nThe survey — arriving nearly one year after former Donald Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race — also found that respondents are divided on whether her candidacy has made it easier or harder for a woman to become president.\n\nDemocratic, Republican and independent women were nearly evenly divided on the question, though 45 percent of Republicans overall — including 47 percent of Republicans over age 65 — believed her loss has made it less likely the country will elect a female president.\n\nNearly 60 percent of Democratic voters, however, said her campaign will make it more likely that a woman president will be elected in the future.\n\nThe survey also noted that while only one-third of voters listen to “bro culture” podcasts — the so-called “manosphere” media that put Trump in front of millions of young listeners in 2024 — they are overwhelmingly popular with people under age 50. More than three-quarters of people aged 50 and older did not listen to those podcasts within the last year.\n\nFour in five of those who listen to those podcasts believe they affected the election’s outcome.\n\nEighty-two percent of listeners say those podcasts affected the results “a great deal” or “a fair amount.” Only 16 percent overall said they have no impact.","summary":"Most voters want to elect more women, but sexist double standards emerge when picturing them as president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/president-woman-poll-young-voters-b2841066.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/06/16/26/BESTPIX-Kamala-Harris-Book-Tour-In-Los-Angeles-x9tszilf.jpeg?crop=7723.5,5149,x3.7,y0&trim=0,4,0,3&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/GsnJ32UN-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-07 15:16:20","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.204},{"id":367067394,"title":"‘107 Days’: Kamala Harris’s memoir reveals her ‘ideal’ vice president – and why she thinks she lost","text":"It is downright eerie to read, right now, Kamala Harris’s memoir of her 2024 presidential campaign. These events feel so far away now, when we read them from within the frequent shocks of the Trump presidency, from troops on the streets of Washington to the indictment of former FBI director James Comey. But the chapter titles – beginning “July 21. 107 Days to the Election” – remind us the election was just last year.\n\n“It says a lot about how traumatised we both were by what happened that night that Doug and I never discussed it with each other until I sat down to write this book,” Harris reflects about election night: her campaign at an end and Trump triumphant.\n\nThe book is not the whole story – not by a long shot. But her words about these events resonate with a ring of truth.\n\nThe first chapter, Sunday, July 21, covers the day Joe Biden – who disintegrated before our eyes in his catastrophic debate with Trump – withdrew from the race, with no road to victory.\n\nHe did want to endorse Harris, but “not for a day, maybe two”. She told him that would be “ruinous”. She argued that she was not just “the candidate in the strongest position to win” but “the only person” who would preserve Biden’s legacy. “At this point, anyone else was bound to throw him – and all the good he had achieved – under the bus.”\n\nShe draws on her call notes to supply the reactions of various senior Democrats to the news that day, from Bill Clinton (“Oh my god, I’m so relieved!”) to Gavin Newsom:\n\n“Hiking. Will call back. (He never did.)”\n\nThroughout, Harris is relentlessly sharp in recollecting the campaign – and very candid on all the principals, including the love of her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nIt takes courage to write about such an agonising, devastating defeat – after a historic, exhilarating campaign – so quickly and so personally. Memoirs are rarely written this quickly. (We are still waiting, five years later, for the second volume of Barack Obama’s memoirs.)\n\nIn writing this book, she got by with a little help from a “special friend”: Pulitzer Prize-winning Australian author Geraldine Brooks. Harris’ acknowledgements note her deep appreciation of working with Brooks, whose “ferocious and brilliant artistic insights were indispensable.”\n\nThe book fully reflects that. And who knows? Brooks, one day, might collaborate with Kamala on an inaugural address.\n\nCandid, but loyal to Biden\n\nHarris is candid about Biden’s decline, but still essentially loyal.\n\n“On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump at his best,” she writes. “There was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern.”\n\nBob Woodward, the dean of presidential journalists, reached the same conclusion in his last book, War.\n\nHarris writes:\n\n“Of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition.”\n\nThe choice, she says, should not “have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”\n\nIn other words, this was a decision his family and associates did not want to make. But it was imperative the national interest be placed above Biden’s personal interest.\n\nThe Harris campaign kept the core of Team Biden. “I didn’t have time to build a new plane; I had to fly the aircraft available.”\n\nOne of Biden’s closest advisors, Mike Donilon (criticised in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s recent Biden book, Original Sin), left Harris’ campaign two weeks in.\n\nShe describes him, during Biden’s 2024 campaign, filtering poll data and presenting “the numbers in soothing terms […] really there was nothing to see here”. At these briefings (which “made no sense to me”), she writes, “Doug had wanted to stop sitting next to me because he got tired of me kicking him under the table when I asked a question and got a non-answer.”\n\nPete Buttigieg ‘too big of a risk’ as VP\n\nHarris delivers the goods on her vice-presidential search. She admits Pete Buttigieg (a personal friend) was her first choice and the “ideal partner” – but the then transportation secretary, with his husband and children, was “too big of a risk” for “a Black woman married to a Jewish man”.\n\nJosh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, came across to her as wanting a co-presidency. “At one point, he mused that he would want to be in the room for every decision […] I had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two.”\n\nShe viewed Senator and retired astronaut Mark Kelly of Arizona very favourably, but was afraid the Trump attack machine would try to take him down on his (excellent) military service record – just like the Republicans did to John Kerry in 2004. The man who led that effort, Chris LaCivita, was now a top Trump campaign aide.\n\n“Could a captain, used to deference and respect, adapt to an opponent’s national campaign specifically designed to disrespect him, to cut a hero down to something small?”\n\nOf course, the military service slander she feared with Kelly was employed against her eventual choice. Minnesota governor Tim Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, was accused by vice president JD Vance of “stolen valour” for his misstatement, while arguing for an assault weapons ban, that “these weapons of war that I carried in war” had no place on civilian streets, though he didn’t serve in combat.\n\nHarris found the chemistry she wanted with the “genuinely self-deprecating” Walz: an all-American decent guy next door, with great values and common sense. “He had no fixed ideas about what the role of vice president would be, saying he would do whatever I found was most useful for him to do.”\n\nShe writes that her senior staff favoured Walz, “to a person”, as did her sister – while husband Doug Emhoff, interestingly, leaned towards Shapiro.\n\nWe will never know if Shapiro or Kelly would have carried their swing states, perhaps changing the outcome of the election.\n\n‘Don’t ever let them make you cry’\n\nTrump’s outrages on the campaign trail were rife. Harris takes us behind the scenes to reveal her reactions to key moments, like Trump’s infamous statement to the National Association with Black Journalists: “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black.” (Her mother is Indian; her father Jamaican.)\n\nTo campaign aide Brian Fallon, who wanted her to “punch back with a big speech about my racial identity”, she retorted:\n\n“Today he wants me to prove my race. What next? He’ll say I’m not a woman and I’ll need to show my vagina?”\n\nHarris takes us into her July 25 meeting with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu during her campaign. She also tells us she believes Israel was right to respond to “the atrocities of October 7”, but criticises the “ferocity” of Netanyahu’s response, including “the number of innocent Palestinian women and children killed and his failure to prioritise the lives of the hostages”. She was tough.\n\n“I interrupted to reiterate the need for an immediate ceasefire and a day-after plan that gave Palestinians some kind of political horizon.” Netanyahu did not like what he was hearing – especially from her. “He wanted Trump in the seat opposite him. Not Joe. Not me.”\n\nHarris does acknowledge Biden gaffes, like when he put on the MAGA hat of a Trump supporter he was joking with, who offered it to him. Her internal monologue went: “Don’t take it […] Don’t put it on.” Then: “He put it on.” That photo carried the caption, “Biden endorses Trump over Harris.” A bad day on a trail that had only 107 days.\n\n“As any woman in a public-facing job knows, it takes us longer,” she writes about the two hours she needed to get ready on the campaign trail – make-up, hairstyling, “more complicated apparel choices”. Women are still judged on these seeming trivialities, she writes, over “the consequential matters we’re engaged in”.\n\nShe relates a conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “They used to call me this – this ugly bird. And at first it hurt me deeply.” Angela leaned towards Kamala. “Don’t ever let them make you cry.”\n\nHarris never does.\n\n‘I know Donald Trump’s type’\n\nHarris’ speeches hit Trump where it hurts. As California’s attorney general, she told crowds:\n\n“I took on predators of all kinds […] Predators who abused women, who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game. So hear me when I say […] I know Donald Trump’s type.”\n\nThe crowds “exploded” at this line, she writes.\n\n“There are phrases in English that do a lot of work for you. ‘I know his type’ is one of them. We’ve all said it about someone of low character whom we’ve personally known.”\n\nShe had big rallies. And big money. She was fully competitive.\n\nHarris told America what Day One of President Kamala Harris would look like. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.”\n\nBy contrast: “On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.” Does anyone following American politics today doubt that?\n\nBy her own account, the wisest advisor in her campaign was David Plouffe, who ran Barack Obama’s successful 2008 campaign. But like a Shakespearean ghost, Plouffe’s warnings haunt this play. He counselled her that Trump was doing better than in 2016 and 2020, and the assassination attempt had pushed his turnout up 20%. “Whatever you think his turnout will be, add ten per cent.”\n\nHer campaign strategists were not happy about Harris’ continued praise for Biden in her speeches, urging her to stop. Plouffe put it bluntly: “People hate Joe Biden.” Harris quotes those words twice.\n\nWhy does she believe she lost?\n\nThis is her verdict: “One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency.”\n\nTrump got three million more votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. Harris got six million fewer votes than she and Biden did in 2020.\n\nAll that Harris was proud of – the landmark legislation on infrastructure, health care and clean energy – would not deliver their full benefits before the election. In the run up to November, she writes, inflation and interest rates were high, and there was no immediate relief.\n\nHarris wanted to talk directly to Trump supporters, but it never happened. She wrote:\n\n“I wished I could ask every one of them. What are you angry about? What about me makes you angry? Is it your health care, your grocery bills, a backbreaking job that doesn’t pay what you’re worth – and what can I do to help you?”\n\nShe did not reach them.\n\nShe combated Trump’s strength on immigration and border issues, and the issue of Gen Z facing a future without good prospects. An anti-trans campaign ripped across the country: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” It was reported more than US$21 million was spent by Trump and Republicans on anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ television ads as of October 9 2024.\n\nHarris peaked in mid-September. She never had a lead clear of the polls’ margin of error.\n\nOn election day, she believed she would win.\n\nBruce Wolpe is Non-resident Senior Fellow, United States Study Centre, University of Sydney.\n\nThis article first appeared on The Conversation.","summary":"This is her verdict: ‘One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency.’","url":"https://scroll.in/article/1087266/107-days-kamala-harriss-memoir-reveals-her-ideal-vice-president-and-why-she-thinks-she-lost","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/204290-dngvtgebpk-1730948141.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 15:00:00","author":"Bruce Wolpe,The Conversation","authors":["Bruce Wolpe","The Conversation"],"language":"en","source_country":"IN","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":367052166,"title":"Two years after October 7, we've forgotten Hamas's unconscionable barbarism... and blamed Israel. It's suicidally stupid: JOSH HAMMER","text":"I stood in Kfar Aza, an Israeli kibbutz abutting the Gaza security fence, three months after October 7.\n\nI saw tattered children's toys and warped kitchen utensils strewn throughout barren streets, bloodied interior home walls, harrowing printouts of the last WhatsApp messages exchanged between husband and wife.\n\nThe houses looked like a tornado had ripped through them. It was soul-crushing to see such horrors up-close.\n\nHow quickly the world has forgotten Hamas's unconscionable barbarism.\n\nThe Jews of southern Israel may have been their immediate target, but make no mistake: Hamas's real goal on Oct. 7, just as it had been for al-Qaeda 22 years earlier on 9/11, was nothing less than the unraveling of Western civilization itself.\n\nIf the West is defined by human dignity and equality under the rule of law, then the opposite—wanton carnage under the rule of jihad—represents an existential threat.\n\nTragically, Western elites quickly exposed themselves as morally confused by the contrast between Israel and Hamas—between liberty and tyranny, order and chaos and life and death.\n\nDozens of Harvard student groups signed a letter holding Israeli Jews 'entirely responsible' for their own murder. Zohran Mamdani, the likely next mayor of New York City, called to 'dismantle' Israeli 'apartheid' before the blood of Oct. 7 was even dry.\n\nThose elites are still confused today - two years later.\n\nDozens of hostages, both dead and alive, are still rotting in Gaza—Hamas's worthless words to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nThe U.S. recognized foreign terrorist organization shows no real intention of disarming, fleeing the Gaza Strip, or revising its infamous 1988 founding charter—which calls for the death of all Jews and for jihad against all 'infidels.'\n\nIn apparent reward for such intransigence, such first-world countries like Canada, Australia, Britain, and France decided to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian-Arab state.\n\nIn the U.S., the Democratic Party is turning decidedly against not just Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but the very idea of Zionism, the belief that Jews ought to have a state inside their ancient homeland.\n\nCocksure Gen Z podcast bros are turning against the idea that Israel has a right to defend itself—just like any other nation.\n\nBut Israel doesn't have the luxury of caring much about such faux-moral hysteria. And that's a good thing. Though the job remains not quite yet finished in Gaza, consider what the Jewish state has accomplished over the past two years.\n\nHamas is grievously wounded—a shell of its pre-Oct. 7 self. Hezbollah, the one-time Shiite terrorist kingpins of Lebanon, has been all but eliminated. Along the way, Israel executed a masterful mass pager attack that will be analyzed by spymasters for decades, neutralized notorious jihadist leader Hassan Nasrallah, and neutered numerous top jihadis with multimillion-dollar U.S. State Department bounties, such as Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil.\n\nIsrael has brought the Houthis of Yemen to heel, thus freeing the Red Sea of a modern-day Muslim piracy menace. The Jewish state struck Hamas leaders inside previously untouchable Qatar, thus reasserting the venerable Zionist principle that Israel hunt down its enemies no matter where they are. And Israel—joined in prolific fashion by the Trump administration—delivered a crushing blow to the Iranian regime's nuclear program.\n\nOverall, the Middle East is safer than it has been in decades—thanks largely to Israeli resolve and America's support.\n\nConsider all the good that might never have happened, had cackling Kamala Harris prevailed last November over Trump. Hamas and Hezbollah would still be viable. The mullahs of Iran would still be racing toward the bomb. Perhaps Bashar al-Assad, the butcher of Damascus, might have still been in power in Syria.\n\nBut now, when it comes to Israel finally finishing off the enemy that started this conflict once and for all, Israel is suddenly ordered—by an 'international community' whose insatiable meddling has contributed to the chaos—to stop.\n\nThe usual suspects all say Israel is committing 'genocide' in Gaza. It's a ludicrous charge—a 21st-century blood libel. Nothing could be further from the truth. As John Spencer of West Point has documented, Israel's civilian-to-combatant death ratio is the most humane in the history of urban warfare.\n\nBut only two years after Oct. 7, much of the world has deemed—enough is enough. But why, exactly? Because the domestic politics became too difficult? Because people are tired of arguing on Facebook? Because they'd love for the TV images of war and rubble to stop?\n\nFor Israel, this war has been raging since its re-founding in 1948. Certainly, enough is enough for them—and that means fully eliminating the terrorist, medieval, seventh-century Islamist threat on its border. And what does Israel ask for in return? Merely to not be thrown under the bus in trade negotiations and at international fora, like the United Nations?\n\nThat is a very small price to pay for an ally that does more of America's dirty work—and more of the West's dirty work—than any other nation around. Israel is the tip of the spear against the three hegemonic forces that seek to destroy us all: wokeism, Islamism, and global neoliberalism. As Israel goes, the broader West will follow.\n\nEveryone wants to see the war in Gaza come to an end. But the war can only end with Hamas disarmed, out of power, and evicted from Gaza. Right now, Hamas is yet again stringing along Western leaders. They're trying to fool President Trump too. Will they succeed?\n\nLet's hope, for all of our sakes, that the answer is no. The stakes are too high—for liberty, for order, and for life.\n\nThere can be no better way to honor the victims of the Oct. 7 massacre two years ago than this: Keep calm and let Israel destroy Hamas once and for all.","summary":"Make no mistake: Hamas's real goal on Oct. 7 was no less than the unraveling of Western civilization itself.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15167243/October-7-hamas-israel-josh-hammer.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/07/15/102777311-0-image-a-8_1759848247140.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/10/02/2912515185734337126/1024x576_MP4_2912515185734337126.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-07 14:45:02","author":"Editor,Josh Hammer","authors":["Editor","Josh Hammer"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":367067400,"title":"Why talk of a ‘stalemate’ in Ukraine misses the bigger picture","text":"Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, talk of a “stalemate” in Ukraine has become a convenient Western refrain – the kind of phrase that sounds sober while disguising strategic drift. In reality, what looks static on the battlefield conceals deep political movement, both in Washington and in the war itself.\n\nTrump’s early approach to the conflict was loud but logical: impose a ceasefire along existing lines, freeze the situation, and move on. His mix of threats and incentives – sanctions on one hand, the promise of renewed partnership on the other – echoed the same objectives the Biden administration privately pursued in 2024.\n\nThe difference was style. Biden lacked the political strength and health to launch a diplomatic campaign; Kamala Harris might have, had she succeeded him. Trump, by contrast, acted decisively. He made his will known to the generals, the allies, and the public in his usual unfiltered fashion.\n\nWhen efforts to force India and China to participate in an oil embargo failed over the summer, Washington pivoted to negotiation. The White House began floating the idea of a broader “security guarantees” deal – a truce embedded within a larger settlement. The battle today is over what those guarantees would mean in practice.\n\nA personal, centralized policy\n\nTrump has stripped away layers of bureaucracy, bringing Russia policy directly under his control and that of a few loyal aides. There is little expert machinery around it. The military-to-military channels that should be discussing demobilization or verification measures remain idle.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration is trying to present Moscow with a finished product – a ready-made Western consensus hammered out with Western Europe and Kiev – and demand that Russia either accept or face the consequences.\n\nAt the same time, Washington is ratcheting up pressure: verbal barbs like calling Russia a “paper tiger,” leaks about longer-range missiles, and renewed attempts to isolate Russian oil exports through India. In every respect, Ukraine is marching in lockstep with the United States, from political messaging to targeting decisions.\n\nTrump’s central claim is that America can now afford to step back – that Western Europe, armed with pooled resources and US-made weapons, can sustain Ukraine indefinitely. In this vision, Washington sells the arms, the EU pays the bills, and Russia bleeds slowly.\n\nIt is a neat theory, but delusional in practice. The US remains deeply embedded in the war’s infrastructure. American satellites guide Ukraine’s drones and artillery; American communications systems knit together its command structure. Efforts to substitute British OneWeb for Starlink have gone nowhere.\n\nAlthough Brussels (and London) covers much of the cost, the US still funds tens of thousands of troops deployed across the continent, as well as the logistics chain that keeps them active. This drains resources from the Pacific at a time when Washington is already stretched thin against China.\n\nThe promised “pivot to Asia” has again become a slogan without substance. China’s military power has grown exponentially since Obama’s era, while the US industrial base struggles even to meet Ukraine’s short-term needs.\n\nWestern Europe’s financial strain\n\nTrump’s claim that Western Europe can fund Ukraine alone also falters under scrutiny. Of the $360 billion pledged to Kiev by early 2025, more than $134 billion came from the US. Even by official figures, Ukraine’s 2026 defense needs exceed $120 billion, half of which remains unfunded.\n\nAs Trump insists that future American supplies be paid for at market rates, EU costs could easily double. Dreams of using frozen Russian assets are unlikely to fill the gap – their confiscation would trigger legal chaos and provoke retaliation against Western European holdings in Russia. The debates over “reparation loans” may sound bold, but they only reveal the bloc’s growing desperation. \n\nWhile the front lines appear static, Ukraine’s military and social fabric are fraying. Desertion and draft evasion are climbing at exponential rates: over 250,000 criminal cases for abandonment or desertion have been opened since 2022. Even the amnesty program launched last year lured back barely a tenth of those who left.\n\nFormer commander Valery Zaluzhny himself admitted that the “stalemate” is breaking – but in Russia’s favour. Moscow’s forces, aided by superior drone technology and heavier firepower, are advancing through thinly held positions. FPV drones alone now account for up to 80 percent of Ukrainian casualties.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia’s production advantage is expanding. Its defense industries have adapted to sanctions with unexpected speed, delivering both standard weapons and new low-altitude air-defense systems designed to neutralize small drones. Air superiority, if achieved, could transform the war overnight, and it is Russia, not Ukraine, that is closest to that threshold.\n\nA dangerous temptation\n\nIn this climate, Washington and Kiev are tempted to raise the stakes. The idea of using Western-made missiles to strike deep into Russian territory has moved from the fringe to the discussion table. The Biden team flirted with this option; Trump, less cautious and more theatrical, might yet cross that line.\n\nSuch escalation would drag the conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders and invite responses that neither Washington nor Brussels could control.\n\nTo call this situation an “impasse” is to misunderstand it. The war is not frozen but evolving – technologically, politically, and strategically – in ways that favor Moscow. Ukraine’s Western backers are trapped by their own contradictions: a war they cannot win but dare not end, a financial burden they cannot sustain but fear to drop.\n\nThe United States, for all its noise about disengagement, remains enmeshed in the conflict it pretends to mediate. Europe, meanwhile, is discovering that moral grandstanding is no substitute for industrial power.\n\nWhat appears to be a stalemate, then, is really the slow unwinding of a Western strategy that mistook endurance for success. The front may look still, but history – as ever – is moving beneath it.\n\nThis article was first published by the magazine Profile and was translated and edited by the RT team.","summary":"This is the war the West can’t win, can’t end, and can’t afford \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/626032-war-west-cant-win/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.10/article/68e5111f2030274833118de4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 14:44:36","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":367070446,"title":"October 7 and the Rotting of the Soul of the American Left","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters Signup \n\n BREITBARTThis Video Title Has Been Overridden By Editorial Staff And Should Be Used Instead Of The Original\n\n BREITBART\n\nSchumer Shutdown\nTrump’s Crime Crackdown\nRIP Charlie Kirk\nDeportations\nMidEast Peace Plan\n\nOctober 7 and the Rotting of the Soul of the American Left\n\n Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nFrances Martel7 Oct 2025 \n\nIsrael / Middle East\nNational Security\n\nAssata Shakur\nCharlie Kirk\nfar-left extremism\nFar-Left violence\n\nKamala Harris\nradical Islam\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\nCountry Star Zach Bryan Unleashes Anti-ICE Tirade Song\nTrump Urges 'Troublemaker' Greta Thunberg to 'See a Doctor'\nPortland Dismissed Charges Against Journalist Nick Sortor\nTrump Says Diddy Asked Him for a Pardon on Prostitution Charges\nRep.

Somebody who has zero experience in television news or even hard news for that matter... but with a clearly defined political agenda,” said another staffer. “It’s hard to see this as anything more than an attempt to bend the knee completely.”\n\nThey added: “It’s early days and we don’t know exactly how it’s going to pan out … or what she will do with her role, but she is the last person who should be brought in to CBS.”\n\n“It’s been 18 months of lurching through reported mergers, legal threat, lawsuits, settlements, firings, yet another round of new leaders,” said a third CBS News employee. “Here we go again – having to introduce and prove ourselves to new leaders with more perceptions and less actual understanding of the ebbs and flows of this organization.”\n\nWeiss did not participate in the network’s daily 9am editorial call on Monday, though CBS News president Tom Cibrowski, who will stay on and work with Weiss, said she would attend future meetings.\n\n“The room looked pretty stone-faced,” an employee who participated said. Cibrowski, an ABC News veteran who only recently took over as president, told employees that they could contact him directly with questions.\n\nWeiss, who carved out a reputation as a provocative opinion writer and burgeoning media operator, has no experience working in broadcast television. David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount and son of billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison, said her appointment was designed to help make CBS News “the most trusted name in news”.\n\nWeiss “brings a passion for reaching broad audiences through rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum”, David Ellison assured CBS News employees on Monday, hailing her “restless desire to build, believe, and innovate”.\n\n“I’m in mostly in wait and see mode,” a fifth staffer told the Guardian. “Pessimistic and skeptical, but willing to see what she does.”\n\n“That being said”, they added, “the price tag is pretty indefensible” as the newsroom braces for a fresh round of cuts.\n\nThe news network’s rank-and-file has been grappling with sustained uncertainty at the top for more than a year. Newsroom leaders have come and gone, and network parent company Paramount recently faced criticism for paying $16m to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump, who had claimed a pre-election interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, was falsely edited. Many legal experts had widely dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment.\n\nThe unusual structure built around Weiss’s new position has also raised eyebrows. She will report directly to Ellison, rather than Cibrowski or George Cheeks, who leads Paramount’s TV business.\n\n“It is still unclear to me how she is going to actually work,” a former CBS News insider said. “I am not sure there is any other network that has this structure. It is unclear to me … exactly how she is going to wield this power.”\n\nA sixth current CBS News employee said they are curious to see whether Weiss makes any critical editorial appointments. “Ruling by edict from the top won’t be enough to change things,” the person said. “She’ll need lieutenants in the trenches cracking whips over our heads.”\n\nWeiss, in her own memo to CBS News staffers, said she plans to spend the next few days and weeks getting to know them. “I want to hear from you about what’s working, what isn’t, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world.”\n\nEnding on a magnanimous note, Weiss wrote: “I’m profoundly honored to join you – and I can’t wait to get started.”","summary":"Six network employees expressed a mix of emotions over the appointment in conversations with the Guardian\n\n\nWho is Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News?\n\nCBS News staffers are coming to terms with the news that controversial commentator Bari Weiss is their new editor-in-chief, as the storied network’s owner Paramount Skydance acquires her Substack-based publication the Free Press in a reported $150m deal.\n\nIn conversations with the Guardian, six current network employees expressed a mixture of apprehension, skepticism and frustration over the appointment, though several stressed they wanted to wait to see what it would really mean for their network – and themselves.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/07/cbs-news-staffers-react-bari-weiss-appointment","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e619dbbc8ce2d36af522eb582ae8c2985dd676/499_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 14:03:36","author":"Jeremy Barr","authors":["Jeremy Barr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":367026514,"title":"Scaramucci says Trump ‘has gotten the drug of power’ and no longer has Kushner reining him in","text":"Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House Director of Communications in President Donald Trump’s first term, has said he believes his former boss is no longer the man he once knew “because he has gotten the power drug.”\n\nSpeaking to Joanna Coles on The Daily Beast Podcast, Scaramucci, 61, said the change in Trump has come about because, metaphorically speaking: “He’s smoked the ganja, the crack crystal of power.

In Gaza, tragically, there have been 730 days of failure and none of success. Indeed, the destruction, the death toll and the spillover of the conflict into other countries is a monument to shame diplomacy and what remains of international law. Arguably, it is the profession’s lowest point since 1939.\n\nSome will claim failure is inevitable since this conflict is now so embedded and impervious to compromise that it can only be settled at the barrel of the gun, in essence through the repression or erasure of one side.\n\nYet, however entrenched the mutual hatreds, a consensus is building across the west that this conflict was desperately mishandled, including by European leaders who initially ceded responsibility to a US Democratic administration that romanticised modern Israel, misread how its government might react to the horror of 7 October – and how that would polarise the west.\n\nIndeed, the mea culpas and self-justifications have been streaming out of Joe Biden’s former team. In her book on her doomed bid to become president, Kamala Harris writes: “I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on this issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians. But he couldn’t do it: while he could passionately state ‘I am a Zionist’, his remarks about innocent Palestinians came off as inadequate and forced.”\n\nShe adds that Benjamin Netanyahu never repaid the loyalty that Biden had shown because he wanted Donald Trump in the seat opposite him.\n\nAt its most generous, the Democrats misread the power dynamics. “We did not act like a superpower,” Andrew Miller, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian affairs, said recently. “Instead of beginning from the proposition that these were problems we could solve, we persuaded ourselves that there was little we could do to move our regional ally Israel.”\n\nTrump did not have that inferiority complex. He used his unpredictability as his greatest diplomatic weapon but, like Biden, his special envoy Steve Witkoff became bogged down in trying to find a formula that guaranteed the release of all the hostages without Israel resuming the fighting, as it did in March this year.\n\nAs successive variations of the Witkoff proposals emerged, France and Saudi Arabia took matters into their own hands, deciding to use a UN conference on a two-state solution as a vehicle for gripping the diplomacy in a different way. The US monopoly on the peace process was broken and the neglected issue of Palestinian self-rule was finally addressed.\n\nThe ‘day-after’ plan\n\nBefore the conference, initially due to be held in June but delayed by a month by Israel’s attack on Iran, Emmanuel Macron extracted a letter from the Palestinian Authority (PA) president, Mahmoud Abbas, that endorsed a plan for the day after a ceasefire under which Hamas would be disarmed and debarred from holding office and a transitional body of experts would be formed to govern Palestine “under the umbrella” of a reformed Palestinian Authority. The notion of reform of the PA, often an empty diplomatic vessel, was this time given specifics, including a commitment by Abbas to much-delayed elections and internal change. An international force would be introduced.\n\nMany versions of the “day after” plan for Gaza had been circulating since 2024 – one by American and Israeli experts published by the Wilson Center, another drafted by the Rand Corporation, a set of principles issued by the United Arab Emirates and a plan from Egypt. The Saudi-French plan incorporated many of these ideas into what became the New York declaration, passed by the UN conference in July and endorsed by the UN general assembly in September, with Israel and the US voting against.\n\nOne European diplomat said: “Although there was a lot of media heat about the issue of recognising Palestinian statehood, that was not where the serious diplomatic breakthrough was. We managed to convince the Americans to link the commitments to the ceasefire to a plan for what happens afterwards – and to realise that focusing on a ceasefire on its own would not work.”\n\nIn reference to the US’s over-reliance on Israeli firepower to impose its will, the diplomat said: “We also convinced them they could not go on rolling the dice and thinking it will come up double six.”\n\nCritical to the process was a meeting in the White House in late August where Jared Kushner, Tony Blair and Witkoff convinced Trump that mass expulsions of Palestinians from Gaza was neither necessary nor wise.\n\nOne of those present said: “Trump had no illusions about Netanyahu’s reliability and had invested in the Middle East states. He was persuaded that for states such as Jordan and Egypt the spectre of waves of Palestinian refugees spilling over their borders was a red line. Trump agreed to take mass enforced displacement off the agenda.”\n\nThe other big message out of the meeting was that for the first time it became feasible to try to merge White House and French thinking. Speaking at Harvard University last month, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: “President Trump asked some of his close advisers to go to the Arab countries, to go to France, to go to the UK, to gather all the ideas that all of us have been putting together for months and years for what a day after plan would look like.”\n\nThe aim of the two-state solution conference and the general assembly vote, Barrot said, was to remove the obstacles to the two-state solution, including by Arab states condemning the 7 October attacks and endorsing the declaration’s exclusion of Hamas from Gaza.\n\n“Until that vote, there was no international condemnation of Hamas, no international call for its disarmament, no international goal for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza and Palestine,” Barrot said. “This is done. We have changed the mindset. Everyone now sees Hamas for what they are: a terrorist organisation.”\n\nThe second obstacle, he explained, was to overcome Arab governments’ reluctance to state publicly that they had a goal of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nBarrot said the new UN text went further than ever before. “We got them … to say that they aspire not only to have a normal relationship with Israel, but to enter into a common regional architecture in the model of Asean in Asia or OSCE in Europe,” he said. “We got them to say things they never said.”\n\nSo, contrary to appearance, the weeks and days leading up to the general assembly was about the Arab states reaching out to Israel. Far from being rewarded, Hamas, an opponent of a two-state solution, was being ostracised from political power in Palestine, a fate its battered leadership has reluctantly accepted.\n\nThe Trump plan\n\nBut for Israel the New York declaration, with its clear references to a Palestinian state and a role for a reformed Palestinian Authority, remained unacceptable. So when Trump revealed his plan to the Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the general assembly, the declaration had become the benchmark against which it was to be judged by the Arab and Muslim states.\n\nThe Trump plan, largely prepared by Blair and Kushner, was necessarily thin, ambiguous and stripped of a timetable. The Arab states had misgivings, but advocates such as Blair argued that if the plan was more specific it would lose the required broad support and critical momentum. The lack of immediate leaks delighted western diplomats since it suggested the Arab states thought they could work with the plan.\n\nBut while the Arab states left New York, Netanyahu stayed in New York, holding two lengthy weekend meetings with Witkoff. After Israel’s attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar on 9 September – a personal betrayal of Witkoff and Qatar – Netanyahu was persona non grata in the White House. Yet the Israeli prime minister extracted further concessions.\n\nThe amnesty to Hamas members was only available to those who handed over weapons in front of international observers and committed to peaceful coexistence. More detail was added about the destruction of Hamas infrastructure. Moreover, the withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces was blurred, and by the end the IDF would have to withdraw only to a security buffer zone encompassing more than 17% of Gaza until the strip “is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.\n\nThe process for this withdrawal “will be carried out according to criteria, and with a timeframe, to be agreed upon between the IDF, the international stabilisation force, the guarantors and the United States”.\n\nAfter the plan’s publication, Netanyahu in a video message assured his domestic audience that Israel’s red lines were protected: Gaza separated from the West Bank, no return by the PA to Gaza, no path toward a “two-state solution” and no removal of Israel security forces from the majority of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn trying to assuage the extremists in his coalition, Netanyahu was also doing all he could to persuade Hamas to reject the plan, so he could pursue the military offensive into Gaza City.\n\nA ‘yes’ from Hamas\n\nEven though the plan did not have a timeline for when the board of technocrats would hand power to an elected Palestinian government, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt urged Hamas to accept many of the unsatisfactory ambiguities that could be addressed later. The war would end.\n\nDiplomats said this message was received best not by the Hamas political wing in Doha but by the Hamas fighters inside Gaza, a new younger cadre steeped in the sacrifices made. With wording crafted by Qatar, the Hamas answer was in effect a “yes, but” that was open to many interpretations. Trump, to Netanyahu’s utter dismay, chose to take the Hamas response as an unqualified “yes”. The key was that Hamas was willing to relinquish its greatest bargaining chip: the remaining hostages.\n\nTahani Mustafa, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that since the 7 October attack Palestinian politics has shifted to a more transactional outlook. “Palestinians are looking to someone that can make life bearable, keep them on their land and improve their living conditions. The very bare minimum is what people are asking for. Most Palestinians on the ground have resigned themselves to their fate.”\n\nOn this basis, the technocratic body to be chaired by Trump, but likely to be dominated by Blair with some figures from the Palestinian diaspora, could derive its legitimacy through its effectiveness.\n\nBlair will be working against the destabilising backdrop of imminent elections in both Israel and Palestine. One of the body’s first tasks will be to build a relationship with Palestinian politics. Blair has close relations with the elites of the Middle East but none with the street, and he may leave to others such as Egypt the task of mediating an intra-Palestinian dialogue on Palestinian unity, a dialogue led by China, that the ageing and authoritarian PA president has sought to sabotage.\n\nIf elections do occur as promised, it could produce a change. The last time elections were attempted, in 2021 in the West Bank, the democratic appetite was there with 36 lists formed outside the established factions. The key question is what will happen if the elections produce a result that Blair’s technocratic board do not like.\n\nAs the Gaza war has continued with ever worsening devastation, Israel’s reputation has been shattered. In the Arab world, Israel is now seen as a greater threat to security than Iran. In the global south it is likened to apartheid South Africa, and across Europe the demonstrations and accusations of genocide continue. Growing majorities of American Jews and Democrats disapprove of Israel’s actions.\n\nRobert Malley, a US negotiator at the time of the Oslo accords, has just co-authored a book on the impossibility of rational diplomatic answers to the conflict. He said external would-be peacemakers had been “so focused on whether we can get them to agree on what it would mean if there was a Palestinian state, just words on a piece of paper, without coming to terms with the nature of this conflict, the nature of this beast – which was a historical clash of narratives.\n\n“From the Israeli perspective, they won in 1948. They won in 1967. And the Palestinians believe that they were victims of a historic injustice in 1948, 700,000 Palestinians expelled, loss of their land.\n\n“And so for us Americans to come in and say, ‘well, let’s just paper over these differences, forget about the right of return, forget about Israeli historic grievances and Palestinian historic grievances, put a bow around it and call this peace’ – that was never going to fly with the parties.”","summary":"In two years there have been many versions of a ‘day after’ plan for Gaza and many obstacles to overcome\n\nGeorge Mitchell, the great US advocate for the Northern Ireland peace agreement, described diplomacy as 700 days of failure and one of success.

So, whatever you think of Jared, Jared was a safer pair of hands, he was a lot more rational.\n\n“We used to call him the goaltender, meaning he would block the insane shots on net from Donald Trump, and a lot of the policies that we’re seeing right now were blocked by Jared or Gary Cohn or Steven Mnuchin or John Kelly in ‘Trump 1.’”","summary":"Short-lived White House communications director claims president is ‘marveling at the fact that he can bully people that are powerful and they kowtow to him’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-power-anthony-scaramucci-maga-b2840872.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/07/11/36/Anthony-Scaramucci.png?crop=1785,1190,x0,y148&trim=148,0,148,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DFKYgyaf-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-07 13:09:35","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":367106938,"title":"SNL Mocks JK Rowling For Dissenting From Left-Wing Trans Orthodoxy","text":"NBC Saturday Night Live\n\n12:20 AM ET\n\nMICHAEL CHE: Kamala Harris has released a new book that explains how she lost the 2024 Election.

Immergut, a Trump appointee with deep roots in Oregon’s legal system, has twice ruled against the former president’s recent attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Oregon. Her decisions have drawn sharp criticism from Trump and his allies, highlighting ongoing tensions between judicial independence and executive authority.\n\nWhy Is a Trump-Appointed Judge Ruling Against Him?\n\nIn a political twist that’s both ironic and instructive, a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump has halted his own efforts, not once, but twice, to send National Guard troops into Oregon.\n\nJudge Karin J. Immergut issued two separate rulings over the weekend, temporarily blocking Trump’s attempts to:\n\nDeploy California National Guard units to Portland, and\n\nFederalize Oregon’s own National Guard, bypassing state control.\n\nHer rulings emphasize constitutional limits on federal power, particularly in matters involving state-run military forces. According to her Saturday decision, the administration’s justification “risk[ed] blurring the line between civil and military federal power, to the detriment of this nation.”\n\nThis is not merely a story about legal interpretation, it’s a revealing case study in the independence of the judiciary, even when judges are chosen by partisan leaders.\n\nWho Is Judge Karin J. Immergut?\n\nJudge Immergut, 64, is no stranger to high-stakes legal battles or national controversy.\n\nCareer Snapshot\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, NY\n\nAlma Maters: Amherst College (undergraduate), UC Berkeley (law)\n\nCurrent Position: U.S. District Judge for the District of Oregon (appointed 2019)\n\nPrevious Roles:\n\nU.S. Attorney for Oregon (2003–2009)\n\nMultnomah County Circuit Judge (2009–2019)\n\nAssociate Independent Counsel during the Clinton impeachment probe (1998)\n\nA Judge With Bipartisan Experience\n\nWhile Trump nominated her to the federal bench, Immergut has worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations. She began her public-sector career under George W. Bush and took part in Kenneth Starr’s Clinton investigation.\n\nHer Senate confirmation in 2019 was relatively smooth, she advanced from the Judiciary Committee with only two dissenting votes (Sens. Kamala Harris and Mazie Hirono) and was confirmed by voice vote.\n\nWhat Do Her Rulings Say?\n\nImmergut’s two recent decisions are centered on federal overreach and constitutional boundaries. In essence, she argued that:\n\nDeploying National Guard troops from California to Oregon required more legal justification than the administration provided.\n\nAttempting to federalize Oregon’s own National Guard circumvented state authority and threatened the foundational principle of state control over militias.\n\nThese rulings reinforce a key tenet of American law: the military cannot be used domestically without strict legal guardrails.\n\nTrump’s Reaction: A Judge “Ashamed of Himself”?\n\nFormer President Trump responded with visible frustration and factual error.\n\n“I appointed the judge, and he goes like that… That judge, he ought to be ashamed of himself,” Trump told reporters.\n\nNotably, he repeatedly misgendered Immergut, referring to her as a man. He also blamed those who advised him on judicial appointments, saying: “I wasn’t served well by the people that pick judges.”\n\nStephen Miller, Trump’s former senior adviser and current Deputy Chief of Staff, escalated the rhetoric by calling the ruling a “legal insurrection” in a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWhy This Matters: More Than Political Theater\n\nAt first glance, this may seem like a typical partisan flare-up. But the implications go much deeper:\n\n1. Judicial Independence Is Holding\n\nImmergut’s rulings signal that federal judges, even those appointed by presidents with specific political agendas, are not bound to loyalty. They are bound by law.\n\nThis undermines the narrative that appointing a judge guarantees favorable rulings.\n\n2. Federal vs. State Power Is on the Line\n\nThe rulings touch on a centuries-old constitutional tension: how much control the federal government should have over state-run institutions, including the National Guard.\n\n3. Legal Pushback Could Shape 2024’s Political Landscape\n\nWith Trump running again in 2024 and signaling similar tactics if reelected, rulings like these may become the judicial blueprint for states resisting federal pressure.\n\nWhat’s Next for Judge Immergut?\n\nIn May 2024, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Immergut to a seven-year term on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). This court handles highly classified national security cases, suggesting a high level of trust in her discretion and legal acumen.\n\nShe’s also set to teach at Stanford Law School in 2025, offering a course titled “The Role of the Special Counsel: From Watergate to Jack Smith.”\n\nGiven her prominent role in both local and national judicial systems, Immergut is likely to remain a significant figure in debates over executive power.\n\nFinal Thoughts: A Judge’s Oath Trumps Political Loyalty\n\nJudge Immergut’s rulings serve as a reminder that lifetime federal appointments are designed to insulate judges from political pressure — even from the presidents who appoint them.\n\nWhile Trump’s disappointment may be loud, the legal message is quiet but clear: Constitutional limits don’t bend for political expediency.","summary":"TL;DR Federal Judge Karin J.

But plenty of other beer fans are comfortable sticking with what they know, and that’s not a bad thing, especially when those beers are so tasty.\n\nSo here’s a list of beers you can rely on, all available in 12- or 16-ounce cans. These selections are also found widely up and down the Front Range and year-round or mostly year-round.\n\nSka Brewing Mexican Logger\n\nSka Brewing has been making this Mexican-style lager for more than 20 years, first as a seasonal release on tap, then as a canned offering throughout the state during the warmer months, and now as a year-round beer in its core lineup. The reason for its popularity isn’t surprising: It tastes a lot like the No. 1-selling beer in America, Modelo Especial, not to mention beers like Pacifico and Corona. Knowing it is made by a Durango company makes it taste just a little better, though, and feel just a little bit crisper. At 5% ABV, you can have a couple while you’re mowing the lawn, grilling out back or settling into the kiddie pool for a siesta.\n\nUpslope Craft Lager\n\nIf cowboys and cowgirls drank craft beer, this is what they’d order in a saloon by saying, “Gimme a cold one.” And it would go down so smoothly, they’d be on their second pint before they’d even finished their first. A silver-medal winner at the Great American Beer Festival in 2019, Upslope Craft Lager is brewed in Boulder with Saaz hops and is 4.8% ABV.\n\nCrooked Stave NZ Pils\n\nSitting alongside its friends, an East Coast-style IPA and a West Coast-style IPA, Crooked Stave’s NZ Pils, like many of its beers, takes a popular style and elevates it. The brewery started with a traditional German-style pilsner and then added Motueka hops from New Zealand in order to give the beer some tropical hoppy flavors and aromas, along with a mellow citrusy bite. Lighter in feel than an IPA, it is also lower in alcohol than many, coming in at 5.4%.\n\nWestbound & Down Brewing Infinity Pils\n\nIt’s hard to go wrong when it comes to Westbound & Down Brewing, which primarily brews IPAs and lagers. But among its acclaimed beers, Infinity Pils stands out because it straddles the line between both of those styles. Part of a new wave of light pilsners that feature more or different varieties of hops than are typically used in them, this 5.4% ABV Great American Beer Festival gold-medal winner is brewed using Mosaic, Citra and HBC 586 hops to give it very tropical notes. But because this is a lager, those notes come in like an island breeze, rather than a gale.\n\nWibby Brewing Volksbier Vienna Amber Lager\n\nSome of the best ales these days are lagers. Which is funny since the two are distinctly different kinds of beers with different histories and processes for brewing. My point, though, is that lagers have exploded in number in the past five years, and you can now find a dozen or more different styles or variations on styles on the shelves in Colorado at any time. One of those is the rich and malty Volksbier Vienna lager made by Wibby Brewing, which comes across almost like an amber or red ale, with its rounded sweetness and smooth-drinking feel.\n\nOdell Brewing 90 Shilling Ale\n\nOne part nostalgia, one part relief from the overwhelming number of IPAs and lagers out there, 90 Shilling is an OG Colorado beer that both commands respect and fades into the background — a perfect combination when what you are doing is more important than what you are drinking. First brewed in 1989, this Scotch ale is one of the Fort Collins brewery’s oldest and most renowned offerings. Coming in at 5.3% ABV, it is amber in color, has a rich aroma and is bound to please.\n\nOdell Brewing Sippin’ Pretty Fruited Sour\n\nLoaded with flavors of guava, elderberry and acai and aromas of pineapple and mango, Odell’s Sippin’ Pretty is fruit punch in a can — and with its ruby red color, it looks the part, as well. Slightly tart and slightly sweet (and just 4.5% ABV), it’s a refreshing change from classic beer styles when you require something different.\n\nRatio Beerworks King of Carrot Flowers\n\nThe cantaloupe-colored Saison, brewed with elderflower and pressed carrot juice, is a Great American Beer Festival gold medal winner — as well as the beer that former Vice President Kamala Harris walked out the door with when she visited Ratio in March 2024. Smooth, and boasting a touch of sweet vanilla and a balanced profile, King of Carrot Flowers has gotten more and more popular over the years, to the point where Ratio now brews it year-round.\n\nOskar Blues Dale’s Pale Ale\n\nSay what you will about Oskar Blues (and people have plenty to say) but it’s been making a Colorado classic for a long time. The company, which went from tiny brewpub to statewide superstar to a venture-capital-backed conglomerate — and now a division of the Monster energy drink company — was the first craft brewer to put beer in a can (and in a can it remains). Dale’s Pale Ale was that beer. Brewed with Cascade, Centennial and Comet hops, it’s a tribute to old-school IPAs, blasting out a much-loved piney profile, backed by aromatic maltiness. It’s recognizable anywhere.\n\nCerebral Brewing Rare Trait IPA\n\nRare Trait was one of the first beers that Cerebral made when it opened just off Colfax Avenue in 2015, and it is still the brewery’s flagship beer, so much so that Cerebral celebrates it with an entire week of variations each year. But Rare Trait was also one of the first hazy, or New England-style, IPAs to be made in Colorado, and it remains one of the best. Loaded with a heady mix of Mosaic, El Dorado and Mosaic hops (a combination that has come to define hazy IPAs), it is almost entirely without bitterness while being rich and full on the palate.\n\nOuter Range Brewing In the Steep\n\nAromatic, charismatic and loaded with orange juice-like flavor, In The Steep is a straightforward beer in the sometimes complicated world of hazy IPAs. Brewed with the most popular hop variety used today, it’s a smoothly drinkable — almost pillowy soft — beer with a sweet undertone and no bitterness whatsoever. It’s one of the few beers from Frisco’s Outer Range that is widely available on a fairly consistent basis, and it’s worth buying whenever you see it.\n\nDenver Beer Co. Graham Cracker Porter\n\nIt’s hot outside, so we’re not thinking about stouts right now. But we are thinking about camping, and it’s hard to beat Graham Cracker Porter as a campfire beer, especially since it actually does have strong notes of graham crackers in it. This was one of the first two beers that Denver Beer Co. brewed when it opened way back in 2011 and has been one of the company’s best beers ever since, winning multiple awards and becoming a standard for people all over the state. Coming in at 5.6% ABV, GCP tastes like graham cracker crust in a can.\n\nSubscribe to our new food newsletter, Stuffed, to get Denver food and drink news sent straight to your inbox.","summary":"You'll just keep reaching for beers like Wibby Vienna, Odell 90 Shilling and Outer Range In the Steep.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/10/07/best-colorado-beers-2/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TDP-L-WibbyBrewing070125-cha-564.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 12:00:04","author":"Jonathan Shikes","authors":["Jonathan Shikes"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.471},{"id":367002444,"title":"The only two Dems running for governor in 2025 are former roommates with mirroring political careers","text":"The only two Democrats running for governor of their respective states this year are a pair of House lawmakers with a cozy friendship that was forged after they both won their first elections in 2018. Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger and New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill have emerged as prospective shining stars within the Democrat Party as they look to cinch gubernatorial victories in November amid ongoing internal turmoil within their party following 2024's presidential election. The pair share a bond going back to their first terms in Congress, including rooming together as freshmen lawmakers on Capitol Hill, they previously told various media outlets. \"I feel incredibly fortunate,\" Sherrill told Elle magazine in June of their friendship. \"Because who would’ve guessed when we entered Congress together that of the only two statewide races going on in the entire country all these years later, I’d be in it with a good friend of mine.\" DEM GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE SLAMMED AS THE 'KAMALA HARRIS OF NEW JERSEY' AS ELECTION SLIDES INTO HOME STRETCH Both Spanberger, 46, and Sherrill, 53, were first elected to Congress during the 2018 midterm cycle, which marked the nation's most recent \"blue wave\" election, when Democrats flipped the House and gained 40 seats. The pair first met during the height of their first congressional campaigns when Sherrill's sister worked as one of Spanberger’s \"super volunteers,\" the gubernatorial hopefuls told Elle in June of their friendship. Spanberger is a former undercover CIA officer and Sherrill a former Navy pilot who forged a friendship over their shared focus on national security while on the campaign trail and upon their elections to the House, the outlet reported. \"I think we had visions that we’d be hanging out,\" Sherrill said of their friendship after winning their House elections in 2018. \"Little did we know that as frontline members of Congress, there would be no hanging out. There was lots of late-night policy work, though.\" TOP GUBERNATORIAL RACE ROCKED BY ALLEGATIONS OF LEAKS AND DIRTY TRICKS AMID IMPROPER MILITARY RECORDS RELEASE \"Which, ultimately, I think can be fun!\" Spanberger added. After moving to D.C. apartments on the same floor of a building on Capitol Hill in 2019, the pair decided to rent a shared apartment for the days they spent in the city, the Washington Post reported in 2024. \"Some people seem to have fun in Congress,\" Spanberger told the Washington Post at the time. \"Speaking for both of us, while we’re here, we’re away from our families. We just work from the time we get up to the time we go to bed, and it’s meeting, meeting, meeting.\" Spanberger noted the loneliness of spending a chunk of each month in a D.C. apartment where \"the only sound is your own\" before the two moved in together and \"drank a lot of coffee, occasionally took a sauna and resolved to make more visits to the gym,\" the outlet reported. The pair told both Elle and the Washington Post that they gravitated toward other female lawmakers from the 2018 election cycle — specifically, a group of five women dubbed \"the badasses\" by CNN during their freshman year — who shared national security and military backgrounds, noting they bucked the \"every man for himself\" mindset of D.C. VIRGINIA GOV. YOUNGKIN WARNS AGAINST DEM CANDIDATE'S CENTRIST LABEL, SAYS SHE'LL END COOPERATION WITH ICE \"And I remember thinking, ‘Well I’m glad I’ve entered with this group of women, because we’re going to be able to work together.’ And that was true,\" Sherrill said of working with like-minded female lawmakers. \"Mikie and I are both the eldest of three sisters,\" Spanberger told Elle of the pair's work ethic on Capitol Hill. \"So that’s the essential piece.\" Spanberger threw her hat in the Virginia gubernatorial ring first, announcing a run in 2023 while forgoing a re-election effort to retain her seat in the House. NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR'S RACE: DEMOCRAT SHERRILL LEADS REPUBLICAN CIATTERELLI BY SIX POINTS IN 2026 BELLWETHER If elected, the self-described moderate would become the state's first female governor. Spanberger is facing off against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to succeed Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited. Sherrill announced her run to serve as the Garden State's next governor in November 2024. She is facing off against Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli to succeed New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who is term-limited from running a third campaign. The off-year 2025 elections are viewed as a bellwether for the midterms in 2026, and could deliver Spanberger and Sherrill Democrat star status if they prove victorious amid their party's fallout from the 2024 presidential election. The Democratic Party was thrown into a tailspin after then-President Joe Biden dropped his re-election effort at the end of July 2024, leaving his running mate, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, 107 days to pick up the mantle and rally renewed support for the Democrat ticket. President Donald Trump ultimately won the popular vote and the Electoral College, sweeping all seven battleground states and leaving the Democratic Party in disarray as it looks for new leaders ahead of the midterms and 2028 federal election.

Truly one of the best to ever do it and keep doing it!'\n\nThe photo showed a vinyl of the album, two pieces of merchandise and a special letter from Swift herself.\n\n'If you're reading this, you're someone who has shown love, someone I admire, and ultimately someone I'd want to celebrate with as we welcome 'The Life of a Showgirl' into the world,' the letter read.\n\n'I hope you like these gifts and record!'\n\nThe praise from Brittany came after fans were convinced that Swift's new song 'CANCELLED!' was about the Chiefs WAG following her Donald Trump controversy .\n\nBrittany has struck up a close friendship with the songstress since she began dating - and ultimately got engaged - to Kelce .\n\nAnd listeners of the pop star's new album, believe that one track in particular is about her close friend.\n\nIn track 10, entitled 'CANCELLED!', Swift sings: 'Good thing I like my friends cancelled // I like them cloaked in Gucci and scandal.'\n\nSwift also croons in the song: 'But one single drop, you're off the roster // Tone-deaf and hot, let's f***in' off her.'\n\nThe lyrics come just over a year after her friend Brittany came under fire for liking a social media post from Trump, who was then running for his second presidential term.\n\nWhile it was unclear what Brittany was specifically agreeing with, as Trump's Instagram post outlined a slew of different GOP platforms, she faced tons of backlash afterwards.\n\nThere were also suggestions that she and Swift had fallen out, with the liberal singer seemingly on the other end of the political aisle (Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president last fall).\n\nBrittany later doubled down on her approval of Trump's Instagram post by re-posting another post from preacher and author Shane Pruitt.\n\n'Contrary to the tone of the world today…' the post began.

And when other people go through it, you kind of find yourself thinking about how they're probably going to get smarter because of this. If they can get through it, if they can be tough enough, they can actually learn some things through this process.'\n\nOther fans believe the song is about Blake Lively amid her legal battle with Justin Baldoni.\n\nNonetheless, Swift and Brittany have remained close friends as they recently celebrated the latter's birthday together.\n\nThe Chiefs lost to the Jaguars on Monday night as Mahomes threw a critical interception which was returned 99 yards for a touchdown.","summary":"The pop star's 12th studio album has broken multiple streaming records , with fiance Travis Kelce referenced frequently throughout.

Together, the two defeats have reignited debate over gender and electability in US politics.\n\nThe report, “She Leads: Progress and Persistent Barriers for Women in Politics,” was released earlier this week and revealed lingering resistance to the idea of a female president despite broad support for women in politics.\n\nOne in five respondents said they or someone close to them would not vote for a woman for the nation’s highest office. The reluctance is even stronger among voters under 50, with 25% of women and 20% of men saying they would not support a qualified female candidate. By contrast, only 13% of voters over 50 shared that view.\n\nRespondents highlighted that they trust women more on social issues, but tend to favor men when it comes to national security and international affairs.\n\nThe ‘Harris Effect’ remains a point of contention and voters are divided on whether the former vice president has made it easier or harder for a woman to become president. Republicans and independents tend to believe it has made it more difficult, the research suggests.\n\nThe survey, commissioned by the American University’s Women and Politics Institute, was conducted in September 2025 by Benenson Strategy Group. The poll of 801 registered voters had a 3.5-point margin of error, according to the press release.\n\nEarlier polling showed higher levels of optimism. A YouGov survey for The Times in July 2024 found 54% of Americans believed the country was ready for a female president, down from 63% in 2015.","summary":"Read Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/626012-harris-hope-female-president-poll/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.10/article/68e4ddd185f5401b99521036.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 10:44:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":366953070,"title":"Trump blasts ‘crazy’ NFL over Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show","text":"Speaking to Newsmax’s Greg Kelly late Monday, Trump said he had “never heard of” Bad Bunny. “I don’t know who he is, I don’t know why they’re doing it — it’s, like, crazy,” he said. “They blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment.

The conventional wisdom is: Yes, it does. Our view is: No, it doesn't,\" a senior White House official said.\n\nFriction point: The White House's stance revolves around the law's amended version, which added a phrase saying furloughed workers shall be compensated \"subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse.\" That's a technical phrase for shutdown.\n\nTo the White House, that means money for those workers needs to be specifically appropriated by Congress. The joint resolution containing that amendment to the law specified that the U.S. government would pay \"obligations incurred\" during that 2019 shutdown.\"If it [GEFTA] was self-executing\" in future shutdowns, \"why did Congress do that? It's precedent,\" the White House official said, calling any other interpretation \"ridiculous.\"\n\nWhat they're saying: Those who represent federal workers or advocate on their behalf say the White House is misreading the clear intent of the law.\n\n\"There is no legal authority to support that interpretation of the statute,\" said Nekeisha Campbell, labor attorney with Alan Lescht & Associates.\"When the language of a statute is plain, courts must apply it except in the rare circumstance when there is a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, or when a literal application would frustrate the statute's purpose or lead to an absurd result.\" \"The law here is quite clear. The caveat is, if you follow the law,\" said Sam Berger, senior fellow at the Center for Policy and Budget Priorities. He called the amended language a simple recognition of the appropriations process, not a restriction on compensating furloughed workers.\n\nBetween the lines: The White House believes that although furloughed workers aren't guaranteed back pay unless specified by Congress, non-furloughed government employees who are now working without pay are automatically entitled to back pay after the shutdown.\n\nState of play: The White House analysis of the law reflects the administration's multipronged effort to make the shutdown unbearable for Democrats. \n\nFederal workers overwhelmingly made campaign contributions to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last year, Trump Republicans note.The furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers each day follows the administration's widespread, DOGE-led cuts to the federal workforce earlier this year.\"This is not being done simply as a pain-point for Democrats,\" a second senior administration official told Axios. \"We're seeking clarity.

Hamas and its proxies are at their weakest in decades.\n\n“Israel changed the landscape militarily; it created an enormous set of possibilities,” career diplomat Dennis Ross, who was a top Middle East adviser in the H.W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama administrations, told the Washington Examiner. “But you have to have a political strategy to take advantage of it.”\n\nCivilian Casualties in Gaza\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned in remarks made on Dec. 2, 2023, less than two months after Oct. 7, at the Reagan National Defense Forum that Israel was at risk of making the same mistakes the United States made in the Middle East this century.\n\n“Israel is in a hard fight against a cruel enemy, in one of the most densely populated areas on Earth. But democracies like ours are stronger and more secure when we uphold the law of war. So we will continue to press Israel to protect civilians and to ensure the robust flow of humanitarian aid,” he said. “I learned a thing or two about urban warfare from my time fighting in Iraq and leading the campaign to defeat ISIS.”\n\n“Like Hamas, ISIS was deeply embedded in urban areas. And the international coalition against ISIS worked hard to protect civilians and create humanitarian corridors, even during the toughest battles. So the lesson is not that you can win in urban warfare by protecting civilians. The lesson is that you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians,” he continued. “You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”\n\nIsrael’s military has ordered civilians to evacuate various parts of Gaza before increasing the tempo and intensity of ground operations in certain areas, often making people leave areas they’ve previously been told to go to. There’s been an ongoing bombardment of Gaza as well, making it difficult for civilians to move throughout the enclave safely.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, which Hamas controls and is therefore a notoriously unreliable reporter, has reported that more than 60,000 people have been killed, a total that does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month that “the ratio of non-combatant to combatant casualties is less than 2 to 1 in Gaza.”\n\nThere have been instances where Hamas has put out statements regarding casualties that Israel disputed, and haven’t borne out. Weeks into the war, Israel was blamed for bombing the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital and was quickly condemned, leading to mounting international pressure. U.S. intelligence later confirmed that it was actually a misfired rocket from a Palestinian armed group. \n\nDespite the difficulties of urban warfare and fighting an enemy that is willing to embed near civilian populations, Israeli forces still have to follow the laws of war. \n\nThere are ongoing debates among experts, government, and non-government organizations about whether Israel’s actions constitute genocide, violations of international law, and war crimes, all of which Israeli leaders deny.\n\nThe true extent of the destruction in Gaza is largely unknown because international journalists do not have access to the besieged enclave. \n\nThe International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, acts that both the Biden and Trump administrations strongly disagreed with, while the court also issued warrants for three senior Hamas officials for the Oct. 7 attack, all of whom Israeli forces have since killed.\n\nIn July, two Israeli human rights advocacy groups accused the government of committing a genocide in Gaza, becoming the first to do so.\n\nA major moment in the war was when Israel ended the second temporary ceasefire in March of this year and stopped allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza as a way to put more pressure on Hamas to agree to the proposal on the table. It also meant cutting off aid to Palestinian civilians.\n\nFormer Ambassador Barbara Leaf told the Washington Examiner, who was a senior State Department official during the Biden administration, including when the attack occurred, said this decision to stop in flows of aid into Gaza as the moment “things have really sharply tipped against Israel,” because “the open discussion by many governments for the first time was that Israel was, in fact, driving things, whether deliberately or not, driving things to such an end that people were starving to death.”\n\nIn the U.S.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden decided to implement a “bear hug” strategy with Netanyahu in the aftermath of Oct. 7, in which he embraced the prime minister fully as a way to hopefully gain additional sway over how Israel carried out its war.\n\n“Biden called himself a Zionist, so he emotionally and instinctively was supportive of Israel,” Ross said.\n\nAs Austin noted, the U.S. was quick to warn its Israeli counterparts about the growing number of Palestinian civilian casualties. Those warnings came repeatedly, publicly and privately, but Israel continued its efforts to destroy Hamas.\n\nBiden ultimately decided to pause one shipment of 2,000 lb bombs that Israel could use to target Hamas’s underground tunnel infrastructure over concerns about the civilian toll if Israeli forces invaded the southern Gaza city of Rafah, but continued providing them with other military equipment.\n\nLeaf said Biden didn’t go further in halting military equipment to Israel due to the threats they faced from Hezbollah, Iran, and the Houthis.\n\nAdham Sahloul, former special adviser in the Biden administration at the Pentagon and USAID, and now an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told the Washington Examiner he and others across the interagency felt “a strong understanding” that Netanyahu “was incentivized to keep this conflict going for his own political future.”\n\nBiden refused calls from his own party to withhold additional, if not all, military support to Israel. Those calls have become more common among Democrats, while support for Israel has dropped across party lines in the United States over the last two years.\n\nSocial media has been a major factor in shaping Americans’ understanding of the war as well. There have been videos online showing the devastation after Israeli strikes, including the bodies of those killed. Protests supporting Palestinians popped up on college campuses across the country, in which students demanded that universities cut ties with Israel, that the government end military support for Israel, and that they do more to try to end the conflict. Protests dogged Biden’s reelection campaign before suspending it, hampering former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign.\n\nAs far as weapons go, there is a provision within the Foreign Assistance Act that prohibits the U.S. government from selling arms to governments and militaries accused of a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights.\n\nThe U.S. has not found Israel to violate Section 502B, though some experts believe the threshold enshrined in law may have been met.\n\n“Along with Section 620I, Section 502B prohibits US arms sales and covered military aid to Israel in light of the Israeli government’s consistent and widespread violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Gaza and the West Bank,” John Ramming Chappell, a legal adviser for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, told the Washington Examiner. “Independent human rights investigators in Israel and internationally have documented extensive war crimes, extrajudicial killings, and torture carried out by Israeli authorities. The frequency and intensity of abuses appear to satisfy the ‘consistent pattern’ standard laid out in Section 502B.”\n\nInternational condemnation\n\nIsrael’s isolation on the world stage was never more pronounced than last month at the U.N. General Assembly, when dozens of foreign leaders walked out in protest as Netanyahu was set to address them.\n\nThe backdrop of his speech at the UNGA was that several countries, including many that have strong ties with Israel, decided to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Portugal all decided to recognize the country of Palestine last month.\n\nBoth U.S. and Israeli officials argued that granting Palestinian statehood amounted to rewarding Hamas for the Oct. 7 attack.\n\n“You know what message the leaders who recognize the Palestinian state this week sent to the Palestinians? It’s a very clear message: murdering Jews pays off,” Netanyahu said during his address to the mostly empty room. “Well, I have a message for these leaders: when the most savage terrorists on Earth are effusively praising your decision, you didn’t do something right. You did something wrong, horribly wrong.”\n\nIsrael has long had a contentious relationship with the U.N., in particular the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Israel has accused UNRWA staff members of being Hamas members, and in January, it banned the organization from operating on its territory.\n\nNetanyahu’s standing has fallen to such a degree that his flight from Tel Aviv to New York for the UNGA took a more circuitous route in an apparent effort to avoid flying in the airspace of countries that could enforce the outstanding ICC warrant. Netanyahu’s flight flew the length of the Mediterranean Sea and over the Strait of Gibraltar, according to flight tracking data, while his flight would normally fly over several European countries.\n\nIsrael announced its intent to carry out operations in Gaza City in August, one of the last remaining areas of the strip it didn’t occupy, which led to widespread criticism.\n\nGermany decided to suspend the export of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza in response, following several other European Union member states, like Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, the Netherlands, Malta, and Sweden.\n\nCloser to home, Israel has at times angered its Arab neighbors, with whom it is not in direct conflict, such as Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf countries.\n\nBefore the Oct. 7 attack, the U.S. was on the verge of securing a historic deal that would see Saudi Arabia and Israel normalize, and that would have been a significant building block on top of the first Trump administration’s Abraham Accords. The deal quickly fell apart after Hamas’s attack.\n\nAnother key country in the region is Qatar, which has been a mediator between Israel and Hamas with Egypt and the United States. Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, but it also houses Hamas political leaders who live outside Gaza.\n\nIsrael targeted senior Hamas officials in a strike in Doha, the first time it conducted a military operation in Qatar since the start of the war. President Donald Trump tried to stop the operation when informed, but it was too late.\n\nNetanyahu, while in the White House with Trump, apologized to the Qatari prime minister for killing a Qatari service member in the attack. Trump issued an executive order the same day that announced, as U.S. policy, it would now regard “any armed attack” on Qatar “as a threat to the peace and security of the United States.”\n\nAaron David Miller, a long-time State Department Middle East official, said the agreement “goes farther than we’ve ever gone before in guaranteeing Qatar’s security. It has Article 5-like language,” referencing one of NATO’s founding principles. “I think that’s a huge mistake, but that’s my personal opinion. But it was done, obviously, to get the Qataris back in the mediating business.”\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the U.S.-Qatar agreement “is a political-security collapse of the gravest magnitude,” adding, “after the October 7th massacre, in which our finest sons and daughters were murdered, raped, and kidnapped, the government, through its diplomatic failure, has led us to the recognition of a Palestinian state, a U.S.-Qatar defense alliance, and we have yet to see how things will unfold with Syria and Turkey.”\n\nMomentum to end the war?\n\nDuring Netanyahu’s visit to the White House, where he apologized to the Qatari prime minister, President Donald Trump unveiled the newest ceasefire proposal. Netanyahu had already provided input on the deal that Trump announced had Israeli support and that Hamas needed to approve it.\n\nThe 20-point plan that Trump announced would have Hamas release all of the 48 remaining hostages, living and deceased, within days in exchange for the release of 250 Palestinians serving life sentences in Israeli prisons and another 1,700 Palestinians who have been detained since the war began.\n\nIn their response to the proposal, Hamas said they agreed to some of the conditions and are willing to negotiate other points. But it’s unclear if Hamas military leaders in Gaza would be willing to disarm and give up governance of Gaza.\n\nLeaders from across the globe have come out in support of the proposal.\n\nBoth Trump and Netanyahu have warned that Israel’s operations will intensify if Hamas does not reach an agreement.\n\nIndirect talks began on Monday in Egypt with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, “We want to move very quickly on this, and the president wants to see the hostages released as soon as possible.”\n\n“That’s how the president’s team feels, so we can get some momentum, get the hostages out, and then move to the next part of this, which is really ensuring that we can create a lasting and durable peace in Gaza, and ensure that Gaza is a place that no longer threatens the security of Israel or the United States,” she said.","summary":"When Hamas launched the largest terrorist attack in Israel&#8216;s history two years ago, killing 1,200 people, the world was collectively stunned and outraged.

She was a top opinion editor at the New York Times, where she melded liberal views – she couldn’t stand Donald Trump – with more conservative stances, such as believing the Democrats have moved too far left on some issues. Weiss resigned after three years, following what she described as \"bullying by colleagues.\" \"Intellectual curiosity\" was \"now a liability at the Times,\" she said, and some colleagues \"called me a Nazi and a racist…Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery.\" BARI WEISS JOINS CBS NEWS AS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, PARAMOUNT BUYS FREE PRESS FOR $150 MILLION CBS, now controlled by the billionaire Ellison family, along with parent company Paramount, is a very different place.

With the new CBS buying Free Press for $150 million, Bari will be pretty wealthy – and that fueled the online backlash. Many libs are outrageously portraying Bari as a right-wing nutjob. Jamelle Bouie, an ultra-liberal columnist at the Times: \"A heartwarming story of how being an unethical and talentless hack is no barrier to your success when you are willing to endlessly flatter the ratchet views of rich dipshits.\" Walker Bragman: \"Bari Weiss is a misinformation-peddling right-wing operative. She is totally unqualified for this job.\" Nikole Hannah-Jones, author of the Times’ hugely controversial 1619 Project: \"Zero news experience. Never been a reporter.\" Well, let’s look at a former CBS News president, Sean McManus, who I know quite well. He took a series of production and management jobs in sports, became president of CBS Sports, and then was handed the news division as well. He’s never been a reporter either. I don’t recall anyone questioning his credentials. So that’s a bogus argument. And how incompetent could she be to build from scratch an organization that is worth a small fortune? \"The values that we’ve hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America’s promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,\" she posted yesterday.

It means building on a storied legacy—and bringing that historic newsroom into 2025 and beyond. Most of all, it means working tirelessly to make sure CBS News is the most trusted news organization in the world.\" That may take a while. A Pew Research survey found 39 percent trusting CBS News and 23 percent distrusting it. Bari, who also worked at the Wall Street Journal, founded the Free Press with her wife, Nellie Bowles, creating a must-read site with a vast array of opinions and 1.5 million subscribers (some of them paid). In our \"Media Buzz\" interview this year, Bari confirmed that she sobbed at her desk when Trump won the White House in 2016. \"Look, I'm the first to admit that I was a sufferer of what conservatives at the time called TDS, Trump Derangement Syndrome, and I was alarmed and really nervous about everything I was reading,\" And now? \"What I didn't see was that Trump was going to do a lot of policies that I agreed with. I thought the Abraham Accords were historic and excellent. I thought his policy vis-a-vis Iran was excellent. The economy was better. \"And look, the argument that the country would unravel and democracy would die in darkness and Trump would be this authoritarian, Hitlerian power, it was impossible to make that argument in the run-up to this election only because Americans had lived through four years of him and things didn't fall apart.\" CBS NEWS STAFFERS RECEIVE NEW MARCHING ORDERS, URGED TO TREAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS EQUALLY So how did she wind up at the Times in the first place? \"Howie, I was a diversity hire,\" she said, not really joking. Bari started getting plenty of speaking invitations from conservatives, and recalls one in particular: \"A consistently liberal Jewish lesbian from Pittsburgh. Who's a journalist, and I was being invited to the Federalist Society. It seemed kind of insane.\" I asked her whether hanging out with zillionaires as she was raising money had changed her. She said she didn’t think so but understood how others might view it differently. Anyone who doubts her knowledge of how television works should look at her \"Honestly\" podcast. Her guests have ranged from Marco Rubio to Rahm Emanuel, from Amanda Knox to Mike Huckabee, from Andrew Cuomo to Amy Coney Barrett. Her finesse, and knowledge of movies, were recently on display in her 98-minute video podcast with Woody Allen.

But she also pressed him aggressively on the accusations, which he denies and were never proven, of child sexual abuse and how that scandal affected his life. When Woody was awkwardly silent, she just waited him out. That’s why the left-wing sliming of the \"consistently liberal\" Bari Weiss, perhaps tinged by a bit of jealousy, is missing the mark. But reshaping the battered CBS News will be no small challenge.","summary":"Former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss becomes CBS News editor-in-chief as the network acquires her Free Press media company for $150 million.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-critics-target-bari-weiss-after-cbs-news-editor-in-chief-appointment-announcement","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/bari-weiss-november-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 07:00:53","author":"Howard Kurtz","authors":["Howard Kurtz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":366854690,"title":"\"Coaches and players were complaining\" - Napheesa Collier gets 100% real with Kamala Harris about taking on Cathy Engelbert","text":"Napheesa Collier has opened up to former United States Vice President Kamala Harris on why she decided to take on WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert.

You can get transparency overnight. But trust is not built overnight, and (Engelbert has) lost it. She can't get it back overnight.\"The current CBA is set to expire at the end of the month. If both sides can't agree on a new deal, the WNBA will have a lockout. NBA commissioner Adam Silver remains confident that a new CBA is going to happen.","summary":"Napheesa Collier has opened up to former United States Vice President Kamala Harris on why she decided to take on WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/wnba/news-coaches-players-complaining-napheesa-collier-gets-100-real-kamala-harris-taking-cathy-engelbert","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/10/55cb3-17598044463443-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 04:18:46","author":"Juan Paolo David","authors":["Juan Paolo David"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":366854692,"title":"\"Think about how close Kamala Harris came to winning\": Asmongold says he would strip voting rights from 85% of population","text":"Twitch and Kick streamer Zack \"Asmongold\" has gone viral on social media after stating that he would strip voting rights from 85% of the population, adding that people should \"think about how close Kamala Harris came to winning\" the 2024 US Presidential election.On October 6, 2025, a one-minute-27-second video from the Texan's recent Just Chatting Twitch stream surfaced on X and Reddit, in which he stated that if he had the power, he \"would disenfranchise 85% of the population instantly.\"While expressing his belief that people would \"thank\" him for \"removing this burden\" from them, Asmongold said:\"If I had my way, I would disenfranchise 85% of the population instantly.

To contribute, click here.\n\nAs you have already read about in this publication for the last year, Minneapolis has an important election for mayor, City Council, Park and Recreation Board and Board of Estimate and Taxation this year. One of my neighbors reached out and asked for a helpful voter guide of my perspective being in Minneapolis DFL politics for 14 years, back to Jacob Frey’s first campaign for a seat in the Minnesota state Senate.\n\nI agreed to share my thoughts as the former chair of the Minneapolis DFL from April 21, 2024, to my exit on April 30, 2025. As many know, I had no role in planning this year’s city convention, other than Target Center being ranked last on the contracts I had received quotes for. There are admirable qualities and constructive criticism for each candidate, and with my experience with all the candidates, I hope to offer you some perspective that may not have been available yet.\n\nThe Rev. DeWayne Davis brings hope, kindness and optimism to his run for mayor. The creator John O’Sullivan asked “The Fall of Minneapolis” reporter Liz Collin in a podcast interview recently if she loved Minneapolis and what she loved about Minneapolis, and she had a hard time answering what she loved about the city, its people and its diverse culture. Davis clearly and unapologetically loves Minneapolis. He loves talking to everyday people at church picnics and Open Streets. He will grab your shoulder and share how much your story is not alone. It’s refreshing to have somebody who lives and walks the ethos of love thy neighbor.\n\nDavis’ campaign got off to a rocky start. He announced before the 2024 election and was in some ways betting on Vice President Kamala Harris winning the election. He has been known to value a healthy work-life balance. That is admirable for everyday people who are not running to be chief executive of the largest city in the state, but hard to understand when the mayorship is really a 24-hour shift if the buck stops with you.\n\nMayor Jacob Frey has had many accomplishments as mayor. As council member for downtown and as mayor for the whole city, he passed and defended the Minneapolis 2040 Plan, and we have built thousands of units of multifamily housing that would not have otherwise been built. Frey’s biggest obstacle hasn’t been a progressive City Council, it’s been the Federal Reserve. The cost of financing new multifamily housing has doubled since he was last elected.\n\nI recently ran into a storied developer who has built many affordable apartments in my neighborhood of downtown. He acknowledged there had been many setbacks with high interest rates and sky-high rents in places like New York City, which has a much tougher time building new housing. The marginal investor dollar from a bank or fund is going to go to cities that have the most return on investment, and that’s not Minneapolis. The affordable housing that is getting built is publicly supported, like Groove Lofts in the Northstar Center. With the work of City Council Members Katie Cashman and Michael Rainville and support from the state of Minnesota, there are now hundreds of affordable apartments on the skyway, close to return-to-office jobs. Were it so easy to fill the vacant office space that wasn’t yet converted.","summary":"An insiders perspective on the mayors race in Minneapolis","url":"https://www.startribune.com/mpls-voter-guide-candidates-davis-frey-fateh/601487115","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/7UKWKNWVW5B7JML5MRANOKBWVQ.JPG?&w=1200&ar=1.91:1&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 03:11:42","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.406},{"id":366825328,"title":"Who is Karin Immergut, the Judge Who Blocked Trump's Oregon Troop Plan Twice in Two Days?","text":"A federal judge appointed by President Donald Trump has twice ruled against him in recent days, blocking his efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Oregon. Late on Sunday, Judge Karin J Immergut issued a temporary restraining order halting Trump's plan to send California National Guard units to Portland, Oregon. It was the second time in two days she had sided against the administration. On Saturday, Immergut also blocked the President from federalising the Oregon National Guard, warning that the administration's arguments for doing so \"risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.\" Trump Lashes Out at His Own Appointee The infuriated the President, who said: \"I wasn't served well by the people that pick judges.\" \"I appointed the judge, and he goes like that,\" Trump told reporters. \"So, I wasn't served well. Obviously, if he made that decision — Portland is burning to the ground. You have agitators, instigators, all you have to do is look at your television… It's burning to the ground. The governor, the mayor, the politicians, they're petrified for their lives. And that judge, he ought to be ashamed of himself.\" Trump repeatedly referred to the judge as a man during his remarks. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also attacked the ruling, calling it a \"legal insurrection\" in a post on X. formerly Twitter. Who is Judge Karin J Immergut? Immergut, 64, is a long-serving legal professional with decades of experience in Oregon's judicial system. Born in Brooklyn, New York, she attended Amherst College and earned her law degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1987. She began her career at the law firm Covington & Burling in Washington, DC, before serving as an assistant US attorney in California from 1988 to 1992. Immergut has spent much of her professional life in Oregon. She worked as an assistant US attorney there from 2001 to 2003 before being nominated by President George W Bush to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, a position she held until 2009. Also Read: Trump Just Sent Troops to Oregon — Here's Why California Governor Newsom Says It's 'Authoritarian' From 2009 to 2019, she served as a judge on the Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland, overseeing felony cases, complex civil matters and death penalty proceedings. In her 2019 questionnaire for the Senate Judiciary Committee, Immergut wrote that she had presided over roughly 250 trials and hundreds of civil motions. \"I have also handled dozens of judicial settlement conferences in both civil and criminal cases,\" she said, noting her work on the court's drug diversion program aimed at rehabilitation. The Senate confirmed her 2019 appointment to the federal bench by voice vote, after the Judiciary Committee advanced her nomination by 20–2. Only Democratic Senators Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Kamala Harris of California voted against her. Part of the Clinton Impeachment Probe Immergut briefly stepped into the national spotlight in 1998 when she worked as associate independent counsel for Kenneth Starr during the investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. She was one of two lawyers who personally interviewed Monica Lewinsky about her relationship with the president. Critics accused the team of asking invasive questions, but Immergut later defended her approach. She said she needed \"very detailed information about those [sexual] contacts because the perjury allegation was dependent on the details of the President's testimony.\" In May 2024, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Immergut to a seven-year term on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), which reviews government requests to conduct electronic surveillance and searches in national security investigations. Judges on the court undergo additional background checks to handle classified material. She is also listed to teach a Stanford Law School course in 2025 titled \"The Role of the Special Counsel: From Watergate to Jack Smith.\" Immergut's rulings mark the latest judicial pushback against President Trump's attempts to deploy federal forces to US cities. Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois and officials in Oregon have called Trump's deployment plans unconstitutional, setting up an intensifying legal and political showdown.

We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,\" the former vice president wrote in her new book, 107 Days.\n\nKamala added, per the first excerpt shared by The Atlantic, \"The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"Why Kamala Harris Never Urged Joe Biden to End His Reelection BidIn 107 Days, Harris admitted for the first time that she could not tell Joe to step aside despite the heightened concerns over his health and age.\n\n\"During all those months of growing panic, should I have told Joe to consider not running? Perhaps,\" Harris wrote. \"But the American people had chosen him before in the same matchup. Maybe he was right to believe that they would do so again.\"\n\nShe explained: \"And of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don't let the other guy win.\"\n\nJill, on the other hand, declared she was \"all in\" on her husband's bid to maintain his position as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. She told a military crowd in Wilmington, North Carolina, she would back Joe as \"he has always supported [her] career.\"How Kamala Harris Reacted When Joe Biden Barely Mentioned Her in His Oval Office AddressHarris watched Joe's Oval Office exit speech at a hotel, calling the former president's address a \"good one\" that drew \"on the history of the presidency to locate his own place within it.\"\n\nHowever, she took notice of how he barely mentioned her, with her staff pointing out \"it was almost nine minutes into the 11-minute address\" before they heard Harris' name.\n\n\"I want to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country,\" she quoted Joe, adding, \"And that was it.\"Joe Biden's Team Failed to Defend Kamala Harris PubliclyHarris' relationship with the White House and Joe's staff seemed troubled, as she wrote about the alleged profound distrust they held toward her.\n\n\"When Fox News attacked me on everything from my laugh, to my tone of voice, to whom I'd dated in my 20s, or claimed I was a 'DEI hire,' the White House rarely pushed back with my actual résumé: two terms elected D.A., top cop in the second-largest department of justice in the United States, senator representing one in eight Americans,\" she pointed out.\n\nShe also dropped her complaints and expressed frustrations with the White House communications team for failing to fight back and defend her against bad press.\n\nPer Harris, she \"often learned that the president's staff was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around [her].\" Although the stories were \"unfair or inaccurate,\" she alleged Joe's inner circle \"seemed fine with it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more,\" Harris added.Joe Biden's Inner Circle Resented Kamala Harris' PopularityIn her account, Harris said people around Joe \"didn't like the contrast that was emerging,\" recalling how his inner circle was not pleased when the polls showed her rising popularity during the then-president's 2024 campaign.\n\nShe mentioned her Selma, Alabama, speech about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza in her book, noting it was \"vetted and approved\" by the White House and the National Security Council. According to Kamala, the West Wing was reportedly displeased when the address went viral.\n\n\"I was castigated for, apparently, delivering it too well,\" she divulged.\n\nHarris wrote: \"Their thinking was zero-sum: If she's shining, he's dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well. That given the concerns about his age, my visible success as his vice president was vital. It would serve as a testament to his judgment in choosing me and reassurance that if something happened, the country was in good hands. My success was important for him. His team didn't get it.\"Joe Biden's Debate Blunder Stemmed From ExhaustionAlthough Harris criticized the reelection bid's \"recklessness\" and the resentment from Joe's aides, she still defended the ex-POTUS while writing about his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.\n\n\"Many people want to spin up a narrative of some big conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden's infirmity,\" she shared. \"Here is the truth as I lived it. Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president. On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best.\"\n\nRather than attributing it to cognitive decline, Harris suggested Joe's fumble was due to fatigue as the debate happened \"after two back-to-back trips to Europe and a flight to the West Coast for a Hollywood fundraiser.\"\n\nShe strongly highlighted in the book: \"I don't believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.\"","summary":"Kamala Harris' new book, '107 Days,' uncovers shocking moments from her whirlwind presidential run during the 2024 election.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/kamala-harris-book-107-days-biggest-bombshells-joe-biden-reckless/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/AEdkWCEt4/0x0/kamala-harris-new-book-107-days-biggest-bombshells-1759740417991.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 00:30:00","author":"Angilene Gacute","authors":["Angilene Gacute"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":366825780,"title":"Democratic strategist admits some in party have ‘charisma of watching paint dry’ as they think of ways to reach young men","text":"Democrats are going all out to reach young male voters, after the GOP ate into its traditional advantage with young people during the 2024 election.\n\nStrategies have ranged from the party working with influencers to cover the DNC to surprisingly criticisms of leading Democratic candidates and officeholders.\n\n\"Young men are looking for someone they can have a beer with - someone relatable,\" Democratic strategist Joe Jacobson told Reuters. \"Democrats have good policies, but if your messenger has the charisma of watching paint dry, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nAfter the 2024 election, when the young male vote for Trump rose to 46 percent, up seven points from the previous cycle, many in the Democratic Party went searching for answers.\n\nOne early thesis was that the Democrats needed their own version of the wildly successful podcasts from comedians such as Joe Rogan and Theo Von, ostensibly non-political shows, that nonetheless command a large following among young male conservatives. Both shows featured interviews with Trump during the 2024 election. \n\nOthers have pointed to the activism style of the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was known for touring the country, holding rollicking rallies with pyrotechnics, and conducting freewheeling debates with large crowds at universities.\n\nFollowing Kirk’s shooting death last month, President Trump praised the Turning Point USA founder as someone who understood the “heart of the youth” and helped recruit a new generation of students and young people more broadly into the conservative movement. \n\nThe Democrats have had an influencer program since last year, but it seems an already-elected official has so far been the most prominent example of adopting new school political outreach tactics: California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe liberal stalwart has taken to aping Trump’s meme-heavy, often inflammatory style on social media, while hosting a podcast where he interviewed and debated conservative figures, including former Trump advisor Steve Bannon and Kirk himself. \n\nThe Democratic search for the young male vote comes amid a larger feeling of disaffection from young people in general.\n\nA 2024 analysis from the firm PRRI found that more young men and women considered themselves independent or “other” than a member of either establishment party. \n\nA spring 2025 youth poll from Harvard found that more than four in 10 Americans under 30 say they are “barely getting by” financially. A mere 15 percent believe the country is heading in the right direction, and fewer than one-third told the poll they approve of President Trump or either party in Congress.\n\nAnother key source of tension within the Democratic Party has been the ideological gap between its leadership and the left-leaning contingent of its youth grassroots.\n\nYoung people have been far more critical of the Israel-Hamas war, and the U.S. support for it, than leadership in either party, leading to flare-ups including a high-profile public spat between the 2024 Kamala Harris campaign and uncommitted delegates protesting the Democratic stance on the conflict. \n\nTop Democratic leaders have also been somewhat wary to throw their support behind one of their newest national stars. New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist who earned a surprise win in the Democratic primary thanks to widespread youth support and calls for left-leaning policies such as rent freezes, free buses, and city-run grocery stores.\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown has provided Democrats a key test of their pitch to voters, and Democrats have made a point of focusing on the quality of life issue of healthcare, accusing Republicans of raising prices by allowing Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire.\n\nSo far, the pitch seems to be working, at least among the general voter base.\n\nA Washington Post poll from the first day of the shutdown found 47 percent of adults in the U.S. blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, compared to 30 percent who blamed the Democrats.","summary":"The Democratic Party’s soul-searching on how to reach young men comes after Republicans made gains during 2024 election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-strategy-young-men-influencers-b2840576.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/30/17/Congress_Shutdown_05319.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vZ8kMZ41-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-07 00:19:58","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.093},{"id":367114404,"title":"Timeline: Trump's efforts to overturn Georgia election results","text":"Donald Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty in August 2023 to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia.\n\nThe charges, which were brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis following then-President Trump's Jan. 2, 2021, phone call in which he asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" the votes needed to win the state, allege that the defendants solicited state leaders throughout the country, harassed and misled a Georgia election worker, and pushed phony claims that the election was stolen, all in an effort for Trump to remain in power despite his election loss.\n\nFour of Trump's co-defendants subsequently took plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify against other defendants.\n\nHere's a look at how the case has unfolded.\n\nNov. 3, 2020\n\nVoters head to the polls in the 2020 general election.\n\nNov. 7, 2020\n\nMultiple media organizations, including ABC News, call the election for Joe Biden based on the projected electoral vote count, as several states, including Georgia, have yet to be projected.\n\nNov. 10, 2020\n\nThe Trump campaign requests a hand recount in Georgia, where Biden leads by about 14,000 votes out of nearly 5 million cast in the presidential race.\n\nNov. 11, 2020\n\nRaffensperger, a Republican, announces that due to how slim the vote margin is between Biden and Trump, the state's planned audit will trigger a \"full by-hand recount in each county\" of the presidential race.\n\nNov. 19, 2020\n\nThe results of Georgia's statewide audit, which entailed that counties recount by hand every vote cast in the presidential race, reaffirm Biden as the winner -- by a margin of 12,284 votes. It's the first time since 1992 that a Democrat will win the state.\n\nNov. 20, 2020\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger certify the results of the general election, making it official that Biden won the state's 16 electoral votes.\n\nNov. 24, 2020\n\nGeorgia's 159 counties start counting the votes cast in the presidential race for a third time, after the Trump campaign requests a machine recount.\n\nDec. 6, 2020\n\nRaffensperger defends the integrity of the general election, telling ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos during an interview on \"This Week\" that his office has yet to find evidence supporting \"systemic fraud\" that would change the outcome.\n\nDec. 7, 2020\n\nRaffensperger and Kemp recertify the state's election results after a recount requested by Trump confirms once again that Biden won the state. The audit found that Biden won by a margin of 11,779 votes.\n\nDec. 22, 2020\n\nMark Meadows, the White House chief of staff at the time, visits Georgia's Cobb County to observe a signature match audit.\n\nDec. 23, 2020\n\nAmid the signature match audit in Cobb County, Trump phones a chief investigator in Raffensperger's office to discuss the audit, telling the investigator they would be praised for finding errors in the vote count, according to an individual familiar with the call.\n\nJan. 2, 2021\n\nIn an hourlong phone call obtained by ABC News, Trump calls Raffensperger and falsely claims that it was \"not possible\" for him to have lost and asks the secretary to \"find 11,780 votes\" -- the exact number Trump needed to win Georgia.\n\n\"The people of Georgia are angry. The people of the country are angry, and there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated,\" Trump says on the call. \"All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. ... Fellas, I need 11,000 votes, give me a break.\"\n\nMeadows was also heard speaking on the call.\n\nRaffensperger challenged the president's allegations, saying the data Trump is citing about tens of thousands of illegal votes \"is wrong.\"\n\nFeb. 10, 2021\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis notifies Kemp that her office has launched an investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.\n\nThe letter asked state officials to preserve any documents potentially related to the 2020 general election, \"with particular care given to set aside and preserve those that may be evidence of attempts to influence the actions of persons who were administering\" it, which would include Trump's phone call with Raffensperger.\n\nJan. 20, 2022\n\nWillis requests to seat a special grand jury in her probe, according to a letter obtained by ABC News. In the letter to Fulton County Chief Judge Christopher Brasher, Willis wrote that the move is needed because \"a significant number of witnesses and prospective witnesses have refused to cooperate with the investigation absent a subpoena requiring their testimony.\"\n\nMay 2, 2022\n\nTwenty-six jurors are selected for a special grand jury in Willis' investigation.\n\nThe special grand jury does not have the ability to return an indictment and can only make recommendations concerning criminal prosecution. Should charges be recommended, it would then be up to Willis to determine whether or not to pursue them.\n\nJuly 19, 2022\n\nNew court documents reveal that 16 people identified as \"fake electors\" have been notified that they are targets of the Fulton County district attorney's criminal investigation, new court documents reveal.\n\nAug. 15, 2022\n\nTrump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is informed he is considered a \"target\" of the Fulton County district attorney's probe, according to sources familiar with the matter. Among his efforts to overturn the state's election results, Giuliani appeared during a December 2020 hearing before state lawmakers at which he presented since-debunked allegations that poll workers had suitcases containing illegitimate ballots.\n\nNov. 1, 2022\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court rejects Sen. Lindsey Graham bid to block a subpoena for testimony before the special grand jury. Graham, in the aftermath of the 2020 election, called Georgia election officials to discuss the election.\n\nNov. 8, 2022\n\nVoters head to the polls in Georgia for a primary election where Raffensperger is up for reelection for his secretary of state seat. Trump supports Rep. Jody Hice in the primary.\n\nNov. 18, 2022\n\nA hand count of random batches of votes confirms Raffensperger has won reelection, state election officials announce.\n\nJan. 9, 2023\n\nA new filing indicates that the special grand jury has finished its work and submitted its final report following months of closed-door testimony.\n\nThe jurors heard testimony from some of Trump's closest allies and supporters, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and Sen. Graham.\n\nJan. 24, 2023\n\nWillis says during a hearing that charging decisions in the case are \"imminent.\"\n\nFeb. 13, 2023\n\nFulton County Judge Robert McBurney rules that portions of the special grand jury's report can be released in the coming days, though the majority of the report will remain sealed. Willis had argued for the report to remain sealed, saying that it was important to \"be mindful of protecting future defendants' rights.\"\n\nFeb. 16, 2023\n\nExcerpts from the special grand jury's report are released, revealing that the jury has recommended to prosecutors that they seek indictments against witnesses who they believe may have lied during their testimony.\n\n\"A majority of the grand jury believes that perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it,\" the grand jury wrote in the report. \"The Grand Jury recommends that the District Attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling.\"\n\nThe excerpts from the report do not list any names of those who grand jury members believe may have committed perjury nor offer any rationale for its allegations of perjury.\n\nThere are also no details revealed regarding whether or not the grand jury recommended charges for anyone related to efforts to overturn the election. The excerpts do not identify any of the 75 witnesses interviewed and do not mention Trump by name.\n\nFollowing their release, a spokesperson for Trump said the excerpts \"have nothing to do with the President because President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"The President participated in two perfect phone calls regarding election integrity in Georgia, which he is entitled to do -- in fact, as President, it was President Trump's Constitutional duty to ensure election safety, security, and integrity,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nFeb. 21, 2023\n\nIn a series of print and television interviews, Emily Kohrs, the foreperson of the special grand jury, reveals that jurors recommended charges for several individuals, without naming any of them -- and intimated that the former president is among them.\n\n\"You're not going to be shocked,\" Kohrs told The New York Times about whether her panel recommended charges against Trump. \"It's not rocket science.\"\n\nMarch 20, 2023\n\nTrump's attorneys file motions in Fulton County Superior Court and with the Georgia Supreme Court seeking to throw out the special grand jury report and remove the district attorney's office leading the investigation.\n\nApril 24, 2023\n\nWillis indicates her office will announce any charging decisions sometime between July 11 and Sept. 1, 2023, in a letter to law enforcement.\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\nEight of the \"fake electors\" accept immunity in the Fulton County district attorney's probe into the matter, according to their lawyer.\n\nJuly 11, 2023\n\nWillis empanels a new grand jury that could ultimately decide whether to approve charges against Trump.\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court denies the request by Trump to quash the findings of the special grand jury and remove Willis from the probe.\n\nJuly 29, 2023\n\nSenior Superior Court Judge Stephen Schuster, responding to a third motion filed by Trump seeking to disqualify Willis from the election probe, schedules a hearing for Aug. 10. The motion had been filed on July 20, after the Georgia Supreme Court denied a similar request.\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nJudge McBurney denies the motion filed with Fulton County Superior Court by Trump's legal team seeking to disqualify Willis and quash the findings of a special grand jury convened to review evidence in the matter.\n\nWillis, meanwhile, signals that an indictment of the former president could be imminent, telling a local news outlet, \"We've been working for two and a half years -- we're ready to go.\"\n\nAug. 4, 2023\n\nTrump's attorneys file a notice of appeal, signaling their intent to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court Judge McBurney's ruling denying Trump's motion to remove Willis from the probe and quash the special grand jury's report.\n\nThe filing comes a day after Trump drops his other remaining motion seeking to have Willis removed from the case.\n\nAug. 8, 2023\n\nSources tell ABC News that Willis is likely to go before the grand jury the following week to present her case so the panel can weigh potential charges.\n\nIn the meantime, following a day of dueling motions from the special counsel's office and Trump's legal team regarding a proposed protective order in the case, Judge Chutkan schedules a hearing on the matter for Friday, Aug. 11.\n\nAug. 9, 2023\n\nABC News reports that a newly revealed memo from Dec. 6, 2020, details a plan by Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro to pursue slates of supposedly \"alternate\" electors in order to prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes.\n\nProsecutors say Chesebro was working with the Trump legal team to find ways to challenge the outcome of the election in order to keep Trump in office.\n\nAug. 10, 2023\n\nWillis, responding to a recent attack ad from Trump, issues an internal memo to her staff urging them not to respond and telling them that \"This is business, it will never be personal,\" according to a copy of the memo obtained by ABC News.\n\n\"We have no personal feelings against those we investigate or prosecute and we should not express any,\" Willis writes.\n\nAug. 12, 2023\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and journalist George Chidi, who were previously subpoenaed in the probe, are called to appear early the following week before the grand jury in the case, as Willis is expected to being presenting the case to the panel so they can weigh potential charges.\n\nDuncan, a Republican, has been a vocal critic of Trump and efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. Democratic Georgia state Sen. Jen Jordan is also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury, her spokesperson tells ABC News.\n\nAug. 14, 2023\n\nTrump and 18 others are charged by Willis in a sweeping racketeering indictment over their efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. The indictment alleges they solicited state leaders throughout the country, harassed and misled a Georgia election worker, and pushed phony claims that the election was stolen, all in an effort for Trump to remain in power despite his election loss.\n\nAmong those indicted in the alleged scheme are some of Trump's closet advisers from his time as president, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and his one-time personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nTrump's campaign calls the indictment \"un-American and wrong.\" The former president says that his actions were not illegal and that the investigation is politically motivated.\n\nAug. 22, 2023\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, as part of the bond arrangements for the 19 defendants in the Georgia case, sets Trump's bail at $200,000.\n\nPer Georgia law, the bond can be paid through cash, a commercial surety, or a court program that requires a payment of 10% of the bond amount.\n\nAug. 24, 2023\n\nTrump and the 18 other defendants in the DA's case surrender to authorities at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta. Trump and 17 other defendants are processed and released on bail, with one defendant being held without bond.\n\nAfter Trump is released on a $200,000 bond, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office releases his mug shot -- the first one ever taken of a former U.S. president. Although Trump has been indicted in three other criminal cases, it is the first time a jurisdiction has required a mug shot be taken of the former president.\n\nFour defendants -- former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, former Georgia GOP chair David Shafer and recently elected Georgia state Sen. Shawn Still -- file motions seeking to have their cases moved from Georgia state court into federal court.\n\nAttorney Kenneth Chesebro files a motion for a speedy trial, prompting DA Willis to request a trial start date of Oct. 23, 2023, for all 19 defendants -- leading Judge McAfee to schedule an Oct. 23 trial date for Chesebro only.\n\nAug. 28, 2023\n\nMark Meadows, seeking to have his case moved from Georgia state court into federal court, testifies about his election-related actions in a hearing before U.S. District Judge Steve Jones. Meadows' attorneys argue that his case should be tried in federal court because Meadows' actions were all performed \"under color\" of his role as chief of staff, while prosecutors contend that his actions were political in nature and not part of his official duties.\n\nJudge McAfee, meanwhile, sets the date of Sept. 6 for Trump and his 18 co-defendants to be arraigned on charges.\n\nAug. 29, 2023\n\nWillis, in a filing, asks Judge McAfee for clarification on whether the Oct. 23 trial date he set for Cheseboro means that he is severing Chesebro's case from the other 18 defendants -- reiterating to the judge that her preference is to try all 19 defendants together.\n\nThe filing comes as defendants Ray Smith III, Sidney Powell and Trevian Kutti waive their formal arraignment and enter a plea of not guilty to all charges, in order to be excused from appearing at their scheduled arraignments on Sept. 6.\n\nIn a separate filing, Kenneth Chesebro asks Judge McAfee to unseal many of the underlying records in the case, including the special grand jury report that recommended charges, the transcripts of testimony heard by the panel, and any recordings of the proceedings.\n\nAug. 30, 2023\n\nTrump's attorneys, citing the right to a fair trial and due process, file a motion opposing Willis' request that all 19 defendants be tried together.\n\nThe filing comes as Harrison Floyd -- the only one of the 19 defendants to be held overnight after surrendering to authorities the previous week -- is released from the Fulton County Jail, according to the inmate database.\n\nAug. 31, 2023\n\nTrump enters a plea of not guilty so he does not have to appear at his scheduled arraignment on Sept. 6, then files a motion to sever his case from other defendants who have requested a speedy trial.\n\nSept. 6, 2023\n\nJudge McAfee sets an Oct. 23 trial date for defendants Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, but holds off on determining what will be done with the other 17 defendants, including Trump. McAfee says he's \"very skeptical\" of Willis' plan to try all 19 co-defendants together, but tells prosecutors, \"I'm willing to hear what you have to say on it.\"\n\nBy the end of the day, all 19 defendants in the case have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.\n\nSept. 7, 2023\n\nAttorneys for Trump notify a Georgia state court in Fulton County that they may seek to remove his election interference case to federal court.\n\nSept. 8, 2023\n\nThe public release of the full report issued in February by the special purpose grand jury that aided in the DA's initial election investigation reveals that Sen. Lindsey Graham and two other senators were among those that the panel recommended for charges -- though none of the three were ultimately charged in the case. In total, the special purpose grand jury recommended charges against 39 individuals, 19 of whom ended up being charged by the DA.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Georgia denies Meadows' bid to remove his case from Georgia state court into federal court.\n\nSept. 11, 2023\n\nMeadows files an emergency motion asking the judge to stay his order rejecting Meadows' request to move his case, pending the appeals process.\n\nRudy Giuliani, meanwhile, files a motion seeking to sever his case, making him the latest defendant seeking to separate himself from defendants Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, who are set to stand trial on Oct. 23.\n\nSept. 12, 2023\n\nLawyers for Chesebro file a motion to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that his actions were \"justified\" because he was acting \"within his capacity as a lawyer\" for the Trump campaign.\n\nSept. 13, 2023\n\nAn appeals court schedules oral arguments for later in the week on an emergency motion filed by Meadows, which seeks to pause a lower court's ruling that denied his effort to move his case to federal court, pending appeal. The court also grants Meadows' separate request for an expedited appeal, and sets an initial briefing schedule on the matter.\n\nSept. 14, 2023\n\nIn a blow to prosecutors, Judge McAfee severs the case, ordering that 17 defendants -- including Trump -- will not be tried alongside speedy trial defendants Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell on Oct. 23.\n\nProsecutors, in the meantime, agree to disclose to the defense the identities of the 30 unindicted co-conspirators referenced in their indictment, as requested by Chesebro.\n\nSept. 18, 2023\n\nAn attorney for former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark argues that his case should be removed to federal court because Clark's drafting a letter to send to Georgia officials claiming there was evidence of voter fraud would have been \"impossible\" if he wasn't acting under the color of his federal office. Prosecutors rebuff that argument, saying Clark's office only had limited authority over election fraud matters.\n\nSept. 20, 2023\n\nJudge Steve Jones hears arguments from so-called \"alternate electors\" David Shafer, Shawn Still and Cathy Latham as to why their cases should be removed to federal court.\n\nLater in the day, the DA reveals in a court filing that pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood will be among the prosecution witnesses in the case.\n\nSept. 21, 2023\n\nSeveral high-level Trump allies -- including Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn -- could potentially be called as witnesses in the first Georgia election interference trial, according to a court filing in the case.\n\nSept. 28, 2023\n\nAttorneys for Trump notify a Fulton County court that he will not seek to have his Georgia election interference case removed to federal court. A month prior, Trump had notified the court that he may file to remove, which the new filing says was done \"in an abundance of caution.\"\n\nSept. 29, 2023\n\nScott Hall, a Georgia bail bondsman charged in relation to the alleged breach of voting machine equipment in Coffee County, takes a plea deal in which he will agree to testify against others in the case. The arrangement marks the first plea deal in the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Judge Steve Jones rejects the efforts of all the remaining defendants who had sought removal of their cases to federal court. The judge rules that former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark and so-called \"alternate electors\" David Shafer, Cathy Latham and Shawn Still have not met the requirements to have their cases moved from Georgia state court into federal court.\n\nOct. 3, 2023\n\nSources tell ABC News that a number of defendants in the case have received plea deal offers or have been approached about potentially making a deal by the district attorney's office.\n\nOct. 4, 2023\n\nKenneth Chesebro files a motion to dismiss his case, alleging that Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who was brought in by the district attorney to help with the election interference investigation, didn't file the oath of office required to join the DA's team.\n\nOct. 5, 2023\n\nJudge McAfee denies the request from former Trump campaign attorney Sidney Powell to have the case against her dismissed over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nOct. 6, 2023\n\nJudge McAfee denies Kenneth Chesebro's motion seeking to dismiss his case over an alleged paperwork error by one of the prosecutors, saying that filing of the oath of office is not required by those working only on one specific case.\n\nOct. 10, 2023\n\nFulton County prosecutors files requests seeking the testimony of Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel and InfoWars host Alex Jones in the Oct. 23 trial of Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro.\n\nOct. 16, 2023\n\nFormer Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is granted a hearing by the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals over his continued effort to move his Fulton County case into federal court. The appeals court sets oral arguments for Dec. 15.\n\nOct. 18, 2023\n\nABC News reports that Kenneth Chesebro, in late September, rejected a plea offer from prosecutors, according to sources. The deal would have allowed Chesebro to avoid prison time by pleading guilty to one felony count of racketeering and agreeing to testify against his co-defendants in the case, according to the sources.\n\nOct. 19, 2023\n\nOne day before jury selection is set to get underway in her trial, former Trump campaign attorney Sidney Powell takes a plea deal in which she receives probation in exchange for agreeing to testify in the case.\n\nPowell, who prosecutors accused of helping tamper with voting machines in Coffee County, becomes the second of the case's 19 defendants in the case to strike a plea agreement.\n\nOct. 20, 2023\n\nKenneth Chesebro, a key co-defendant in the case, takes a last-minute plea deal just as jury selection for his trial is getting underway.\n\nThe attorney, who prosecutors say drafted a strategy to use so-called \"alternate electors\" to prevent Joe Biden from receiving 270 electoral votes in the 2020 election, pleads guilty to a single felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing of false documents, and will receive five years' probation and a $5,000 fine in exchange for agreeing to testify and provide documents and evidence.\n\nOct. 24, 2023\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jenna Ellis becomes the fourth defendant to take a plea deal, tearfully admitting in court that she made up details about election fraud and saying that she regretted representing the former president.\n\nShe pleads guilty to one count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings, and will receive probation in exchange for her testimony in the case.\n\nNov. 13, 2023\n\nABC News obtains video excerpts of proffer interviews Georgia prosecutors held with attorneys Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell as part of the plea deals they struck in the case.\n\nAmong other revelations, Ellis tells prosecutors in the video that senior Trump White House official Dan Scavino, referring to Trump, told her at a White House Christmas party weeks after the 2020 election that \"the boss is not going to leave under any circumstances\" despite losing the election.\n\nNov. 16, 2023\n\nJudge McAfee issues a protective order in the case following a request from Willis' office in light of the publication of proffer interview videos by ABC News and other media outlets. The order requires the state to designate which discovery materials they believe are sensitive -- and are thus protected from being made public -- and gives the defendants an opportunity to challenge that.\n\nNov. 17, 2023\n\nFulton County prosecutors, in a court filing, request a start date of Aug. 5, 2024, for the trial of Trump and his co-defendants.\n\nThe filing, which asks that all the defendants be tried together, says the August date \"balances potential delays from Defendant Trump's other criminal trials,\" as well as the other defendants' constitutional speedy-trial rights.\n\nNov. 21, 2023\n\nJudge McAfee rejects a request from prosecutors to revoke the bond of co-defendant Harrison Floyd, after the DA says he engaged in witness intimidation by posting multiple tweets tagging witnesses in the case.\n\nDec. 1, 2023\n\nTrump's attorneys tell a Fulton County court that the indictment against Trump \"needs to be dismissed\" on the grounds that it prosecutes conduct protected by the First Amendment, during a pair of hearings in which lawyers for the former president and several of his co-defendants seek the dismissal of the case or a delay in the case's upcoming deadlines.\n\nDec. 15, 2023\n\nThree judges on 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals pepper attorneys for former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and the Fulton County district attorney's office with questions during a hearing on Meadows' ongoing effort to move the charges against him into federal court.\n\nDec. 18, 2023\n\nA federal appeals court in Georgia rejects a bid by former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to move his case into federal court, affirming a lower court's decision that left it in Georgia state court.\n\nThe ruling comes on the same day that Trump, in a court filing, urges the judge in the case to dismiss all charges against him on First Amendment grounds, arguing that the DA's indictment seeks to criminalize \"core political speech.\"\n\nJan. 8, 2024\n\nA defendant in the election interference case, former Trump campaign staffer Michael Roman, files a motion seeking to dismiss the charges against him and disqualify DA Fani Willis, alleging that Willis \"engaged in a personal, romantic relationship\" with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors she brought in to work on the case, which allegedly resulted in financial gain for both of them.\n\nSeparately, Trump's legal team files several new motions seeking to dismiss the case against him on grounds that include presidential immunity, which they say \"shields him from criminal prosecution.\"\n\nJan. 12, 2024\n\nDuring a hearing to hear motions from several defendants in the case, Judge McAfee tells attorneys there will likely be a hearing in early February, at the earliest, to address allegations filed against Willis that she had an inappropriate relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nJan. 14, 2024\n\nWillis, speaking during a Sunday church service celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day, appears to acknowledge the improper relationship allegations leveled against her, while also defending the special prosecutor she brought in for the election interference case.\n\nJan. 18, 2024\n\nJudge McAfee sets a hearing date of Feb. 15 to hear evidence over allegations that Willis and prosecutor Nathan Wade were having an improper relationship.\n\nJan. 19, 2024\n\nThe credit card statements of Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade appear to show he paid for multiple trips for him and Willis, according to copies of the statements included in a filing submitted by Wade's wife as part their divorce proceedings.\n\nJan. 22, 2024\n\nThe Georgia judge overseeing Nathan Wade's divorce case issues a stay of Fani Willis' deposition in the case, saying that he will wait until after Wade is deposed in the proceedings the following week to determine whether Willis should be deposed.\n\nJan. 25, 2024\n\nAttorneys representing Trump move to join the motion filed by co-defendant Mike Roman that seeks to disqualify Willis and dismiss the criminal charges against him based on allegations of an improper relationship.\n\nJan. 30, 2024\n\nOn the eve of a hearing in the divorce proceedings of prosecutor Nathan Wade and his wife, the two come to a \"temporary agreement\" that cancels the hearing, preventing what could have been sworn testimony from Wade and the possible release of any records pertaining to the allegations involving Wade and Willis that could have arisen at the hearing.\n\nJan. 31, 2024\n\nABC News reports that DA Fani Willis and prosecutor Nathan Wade have been subpoenaed to testify at the Feb. 15 hearing set by Judge McAfee, according to a new lawsuit from election case co-defendant Michael Roman's attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, that accuses Willis' office office of \"stonewalling\" Merchant's efforts to obtain records from the office through public information requests.\n\nFeb 2, 2024\n\nA court filing from Fulton County DA Fani Willis admits to a \"personal relationship\" with prosecutor Nathan Wade, but argues that there is \"no financial conflict of interest that constitutes a legal bases for disqualification\" from the election interference case. The filing requests that the Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing scheduled to examine the allegations against Willis and Wade be canceled, claiming that \"no further factual development is necessary.\"\n\nFeb 7, 2024\n\nTrump, in a court filing, renews his request to have Willis disqualified and his election charges dismissed, arguing that comments Willis made during her church speech in early January violated her office's ethics requirements.\n\nFeb 9, 2024\n\nTrump co-defendant Michael Roman files a motion accusing Willis of including falsehoods in her filing that admitted to a \"personal relationship\" with prosecutor Nathan Wade, saying he has a witness who will refute Willis' claim that her and Wade's relationship started after Wade was hired for the election case.\n\nFeb 12, 2024\n\nSaying that it's \"possible\" misconduct allegations leveled against DA Fani Willis \"could result in disqualification\" if evidence shows she financially benefited from the case, Judge McAfee confirms that the Feb. 15 hearing on the matter will proceed as scheduled.\n\nFeb 15, 2024\n\nOn the first day of the evidentiary hearing into misconduct allegations against prosecutor Nathan Wade and DA Fani Willis, Wade testifies under oath that his romantic relationship with Willis began after she hired him in November 2021, and that when the two of them traveled together Willis often paid him back in cash so that expenses roughly \"balanced out.\" Wade also testifies that he visited Willis' condo less than 10 times prior to his being hired.\n\nWillis, on the stand, blasts the allegations against her and testified that her and Wade's romantic relationship didn't start until after Wade's hiring, saying, \"I didn't consider my relationship with him to be romantic before that.\"\n\nFeb 16, 2024\n\nOn Day 2 of the hearing, Terrence Bradley, Wade's former law partner and divorce attorney, largely declines to answer questions, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, whom the defense has claimed has evidence that Wade and Willis' relationship began before Wade was hired, testifies that he had \"no personal knowledge\" of when the relationship started, but acknowledges that Wade had told him about \"socializing\" with Willis prior to November 2021.\n\nJudge Scott McAfee says he was \"left wondering\" about whether Bradley had \"been properly interpreting privilege,\" and says he will need to examine Bradley in private to make that determination.\n\nFeb 23, 2024\n\nAttorneys for Trump submit a request to enter new evidence based on Wade's cellphone records, which they claims show that Wade visited the area of Willis' condo approximately 35 times in 2021, prior to her hiring him. The DA's office urges the judge not to admit the records into evidence, saying they \"do nothing more\" than show that Wade's phone \"was located somewhere within a densely populated multiple-mile radius.\"\n\nFeb 26, 2024\n\nJudge McAfee rules that Wade's former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley, must retake the stand to testify on topics not covered by attorney-client privilege.\n\nFeb 27, 2024\n\nA two-hour hearing concludes without providing any revelatory information about the timeline of Willis and Wade's romantic relationship, which the defense contends started before Wade was hired, in contrast to what they both testified.\n\nWade's former law partner and divorce lawyer, Terrence Bradley, who the defense argued would testify that the relationship started prior to Wade's hiring, testifies that any past statements he made to that effect were \"speculation on my part.\"\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nJudge McAfee hears final arguments on motions to disqualify DA Fani Willis, with the defense arguing that Willis and Nathan Wade conspired to bring the election case to enrich themselves with public money, and attorneys for the DA's office arguing that defendants have failed to meet the \"high standard of proof\" for disqualification.\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nDA Fani Willis' office urges Judge McAfee to reject the disqualification effort against her, arguing in a court filing that Trump and his co-defendants failed to meet the \"high\" standard required by law to disqualify an elected district attorney. In response, the defense says in a filing that that Willis committed \"appalling and unforgivable\" forms of forensic misconduct.\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\nAshleigh Merchant, the lead attorney pushing for the disqualification of DA Fani Willis, provides new testimony to a Georgia Senate panel about how she says she uncovered the romantic relationship between Willis and prosecutor Nathan Wade that sits at the heart of the misconduct allegations.\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nJudge McAfee quashes multiple counts contained in the election interference indictment against Trump and several of his co-defendants, dismissing six counts related to the charge of Solicitation of Violation of Oath by a Public Officer.

The judge writes that while \"dismissal of the indictment is not the appropriate remedy,\" his conclusion is that \"the established record now highlights a significant appearance of impropriety that infects the current structure of the prosecution team.\"\n\nHours later, Wade resigns as special prosecutor, ensuring that Willis will stay on.\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nTrump and several of his co-defendants file a motion asking Judge McAfee to grant a certificate of immediate review in order to appeal the judge's ruling that ultimately kept Fulton County DA Fani Willis on the election case.\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nJudge McAfee grants the request from Trump and several co-defendants to obtain a certificate of immediate review, clearing the way for Trump to appeal the judge's ruling that ultimately kept Willis on the case.\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\nJudge McAfee, vowing to keep the election case moving forward during any potential appeal, schedules a March 28 hearing to hear oral arguments on a number of motions from Trump and his co-defendant David Shafer.\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nDA Fani Willis, in a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, says that her office has fully complied with a congressional subpoena related to a federal funding probe, and vows that \"nothing that you do will derail the efforts of my staff and I to bring the election interference prosecution to trial.\"\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nAttorneys for Trump, seeking to have the election case dismissed, argue in a hearing that Trump's comments \"calling into question\" the election of 2020 were \"political speech advocacy that lie at the heart of the First Amendment\" -- but prosecutors fire back, telling Judge McAfee that Trump's speech was part of a conspiracy to commit crimes. The judge ends the hearing without making any rulings on the motions.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nTrump and several of his co-defendants file an appeal of the disqualification ruling that allowed Fulton County DA Fani Willis to remain on the case. The motion argues that Judge McAfee \"erred as a matter of law by not requiring dismissal and DA Willis' disqualification.\"\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nJudge McAfee denies a motion from Trump and several of co-defendants seeking to have the case thrown out on the grounds that the indictment violated their First Amendment right to political speech. \"Even core political speech addressing matters of public

against Trump on the grounds that a sitting president is immune from federal or state criminal prosecution.\n\nDec. 12, 2024\n\nFulton County DA Fani Willis rebuffs the latest request from House

prosecution of Trump may be able to continue despite his impending inauguration.\n\nDec. 19, 2024\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals disqualifies Fulton County DA Fani Willis from her prosecution of Trump and his co-defendants, ruling that Judge McAfee \"erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office\" following accusations of impropriety regarding her relationship with fellow prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nThe ruling, following Trump's appeal of McAfee's decision, allows the election interference indictment to stand and leaves the question of who takes over the case -- and whether it

she failed to demand he drop out, because Spanberger “is afraid of her far left flank.” \n\n“This is the dilemma that may well destroy the Democratic Party in the end.”\n\nLiberal: The Left Needs ‘Pragmatic’ Populists\n\n“Amid a dispiriting shutdown fight after a summer of drift,” snarks Justin Vassallo at the Liberal Patriot, Democrats must “do a bit of praying.” \n\nMost important: “rebuilding the fabled Blue Wall remains the first order of business if the party is to have any hope in 2028.” \n\nTo that end, there is “a cohort of independent-leaning,” pragmatic Democrats who could have “an outsize impact — not just on the party’s morale” but on its long-term “trajectory.” \n\nTheir “pragmatic populism” means they’re sensitive to “the concerns of working-class Trump voters,” are “critical of tariffs” and “know firsthand the costs of offshoring and corporate mergers.” \n\nPerhaps they can “reset the narrative in America’s rural and industrial heartlands.”\n\nLegal take: Trump Could Face Global Lawfare\n\nHaving failed to destroy President Trump in local, state and federal courts, the “global deep state” is looking to prosecute him in the International Criminal Court, warns law prof Eugene Kontorovich at The Wall Street Journal.\n\n“International lawyers are already developing multiple lines of attack against the administration and its officials,” with possible cases against Trump for killing Venezuelan drug traffickers or even for “immigration policy,” which has been called “a crime against humanity.”\n\nA future US president could follow the example of the Philippines, where former leader Rodrigo Duterte’s “successor conspired with The Hague” to destroy him, since he was a political enemy. \n\nTrump was taken by “surprise” by the “lawfare campaign” against him; he’d be wise to take proactive steps to “pre-emptively” head off similar efforts down the road.\n\nFrom the left: Progs Are Sure They Know Best\n\n“Progressive donor network Way to Win” recently held a “confab called Persuasion 2025” to “reassert the left’s strategy” to achieve “a national governing majority,” notes The Atlantic’s Jonathan Chait. \n\nBut “the progressive movement’s hold on the party is no longer certain.” \n\nThe DEI-inspired rise of Kamala Harris in the Democratic Party structure “was already an awkward fit,” and “her defeat” demonstrated how “progressive activists” had “driven the entire field leftward” and latched her to a “toxic” social agenda that revolted voters. \n\nProgressives have doubled-down, “irrationally” declaring, “No compromise with the electorate.” \n\nThe party’s progressives “seem determined to reeducate the public rather than compromise for their votes.” \n\nThis is a great strategy “if the goal is ideological purity” — but it won’t help win elections.\n\nLibertarian: DC Permanent ‘Temporary’ Programs\n\n“Milton Friedman liked to quip that there’s nothing more permanent than a temporary government program,” recalls Reason’s Christian Britschi. \n\n“We’re seeing more evidence for this” as the government shuts down after Democrats insist on “an extension of ‘temporary’ Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, subsidies passed during the pandemic.” \n\nThe enhanced subsidies — scrapping “income-eligibility caps” and boosting benefits — are set to expire this year. \n\nYet the fact that their expiration creates a “crisis” is “a feature, not a bug,” laments the Cato Institute’s Michael Cannon. It’s “how spending grows”: The 2021 expansion “attempts to mask the cost of rising premiums by shifting more of the expense onto taxpayers.” \n\nIt’s all a “fiscal illusion.

Historically, the party in the White House loses seats in the midterms, and President Donald Trump’s approval rating remains low. But several states like Texas and Missouri have engaged in mid-decade redistricting to eliminate several Democratic-leaning quadrants in an attempt to thwart losses.\n\nUtah is one state where Democrats could gain seats in redistricting, as a court previously struck down its current map, viewed as a partisan gerrymander. Although former Vice President Kamala Harris received 38 percent of the vote in the state, none of its four congressional districts are Democratic-leaning or even competitive. The new map advanced on Monday would change that.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nBoth the Utah House of Representatives and Senate voted to advance a new map to comply with court orders Monday afternoon, bringing it one step closer to becoming law ahead of the midterms. The map did not receive support from Democratic legislators but passed with Republican support.\n\nRepublicans would have an advantage in each of the four districts, but two would be viewed as more competitive than on the current map.\n\nUnder the new map, Trump would have received just under 50 percent of the vote in UT-03, defeating Harris by about 2 percentage points. This district would contain all of Salt Lake City, a Democratic stronghold split up in the current map, other parts of Salt Lake County and more rural, conservative areas.\n\nA polling center in Provo, Utah, is pictured on November 6, 2018.\n\nIn UT-02, he would have beaten Harris by about 7 points. This map contains the rest of Salt Lake County and rural areas to the west.\n\nAn analysis conducted by The Salt Lake Tribune that accounted for other races found the districts to be slightly more conservative—UT-02 at R+10.7 and UT-03 at R+6.\n\nThe map only splits Salt Lake County into two districts. Under the current map, it is split between each of the four districts—which critics said diluted the power of Democratic voters. Although all districts backed Trump, the two single-digit districts would likely be contested by Democrats, particularly if 2026 shapes up to be a blue wave.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nBetter Boundaries, an anti-gerrymandering group, wrote in a statement: “When politicians control redistricting, there is always an incentive to protect power. That is why Utah voters passed Proposition 4 to create fair standards and measures that could evolve as data and technology changed. Map C demonstrates how the core principles of Proposition 4 are being sidestepped. Proposition 4 called for fairness measured by the best available tools and data, transparency in how maps are drawn, and accountability to voters rather than political interests.”\n\nGOP State Senator Scott Sandall said in a statement reported by KSL-TV: “Despite a condensed timeline, our committee remained committed to transparency and public engagement. The approved map adheres to Proposition 4 requirements and reflects the diversity of Utah by ensuring every district includes both rural and urban communities. Redistricting is the Legislature’s constitutional responsibility, and we continue to prioritize fair maps that give every Utahn a strong, equal voice in Congress.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe map will be submitted to the court later Monday, KSL reported.\n\nOther states are also considering redistricting. Most notably, California voters will head to the polls next month to decide on a ballot measure that would temporarily replace its commission-drawn map with one more favorable to Democrats. The ballot measure was introduced in response to efforts in Texas. Polls suggest a majority of voters support the California move.","summary":"Thenewly passed map would establish two potentially competitive districts around Salt Lake City.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/utah-advances-new-congressional-map-heres-what-it-means-for-midterms-10837081","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2449440-utah-voting.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-06 22:47:11","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":366822704,"title":"Former Auburn Coach Bruce Pearl Responds To ESPN's Mike Wilbon Calling Him 'Divisive'","text":"Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl suddenly retired last month and handed the reins over to his son, Steve. For many, it was a sad moment that a great coach was leaving the game, especially coming off a Final Four appearance. ESPN's Mike Wilbon was not one of those people. During the final moments of Pardon the Interruption on Sept. 22, Wilbon said he was glad Pearl was gone because he had become \"divisive\" and even hoped that Pearl had been forced out of his job. PTI co-host Tony Kornheiser balked at Wilbon's comments, saying that he liked Pearl and that he and Wilbon were \"on the other side\" regarding their opinions on Pearl. Pearl joined Will Cain on Fox News on Monday and responded to Wilbon's comments. \"A dear friend of Mike's reached out to me and said, 'Look, this is not antisemitic. It's probably political,'\" Pearl said. Pearl has been outspoken in his defense of Israel during the ongoing conflict between the nation and the terrorist group Hamas. However, Pearl has also vocally supported President Donald Trump, not just on Israel, but on other political platforms. He has also criticized Barack Obama for increasing racial tensions in the United States. In Wilbon's world – not just Wilbon, but all the left-wingers in the media – supporting Donald Trump makes someone divisive. And criticizing Obama? Forget it. In their world, Obama is completely above reproach. Of course, endorsing Kamala Harris or another Democrat politician is not divisive, at least to them. That's the double-standard that exists, sadly. \"If there's anything I'm not, that is divisive. I've tried to bring people together my entire life,\" Pearl continued. \"Maybe it's an example of why we can't agree to disagree about things politically.\" Pearl is spot-on, unfortunately. Instead of Wilbon simply saying he disagreed with some of Pearl's political opinions, he chose to celebrate his leaving college basketball and even hoped that he was forced to do it. Pearl rejected that notion, though. \"I was not forced out; I love Auburn and I love the opportunity now to be able to do some things for faith and family in our country, to be an advocate for Israel, to be an advocate for education, and [I'm] looking forward to [doing] those things while my son is winning basketball games,\" Pearl said. Good for Pearl for taking the high road, as Will Cain correctly pointed out Wilbon's hypocrisy. \"I would love to ask Mike, ‘Did you ever call Steve Kerr or Gregg Popovich divisive?’\" Cain asked, rhetorically. Fortunately, I can answer that question for Cain, at least on Popovich. The answer is no. In fact, when Popovich became the NBA all-time wins leader among coaches, Wilbon starred in a glowing tribute praising the former Spurs coach's career.

It was her Kamala Harris moment (and of course she supports biological males having unfettered access to girls’ and womens’ private spaces, she’s just too much of a coward to say it.)\n\nNext, we had her urging her supporters to “Let your rage fuel you!” when dealing with political opponents. Utterly dangerous and irresponsible words, especially in light of the fact that someone on her ticket has been outed as having assassination fantasies about a Republican colleague. Again, something Spanberger was slow to condemn; the fact that she hasn’t called for Jay Jones to exit the race proves how much she embraces and welcomes the rage.\n\nNot to mention her Deep State past. Abigail Spanberger is a veritable smorgasbord of radical policies, violent rhetoric, and far-left priorities.\n\nNow, we’re finding out that, soon after 9/11, she spent a year teaching at a Northern Virginia school called the Islamic Saudi Academy (now called King Abdullah Academy).\n\nThe Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Virginia worked for a Saudi government-controlled school just after 9/11, at a time when the Islamic academy was already controversial for being controlled by the Saudi royal family and for its extremist textbooks which taught hatred of non-Muslims.\n\nNEW: Abigail Spanberger worked at the Saudi government-run Islamic Saudi Academy just over a year post-9/11. When she began teaching there, the school was already well-known for its radical & hateful textbooks, links to Hamas, pro-jihad graduates, & more…https://t.co/SfjvuGfBfo\n— Jerry Dunleavy IV 🇺🇸 (@JerryDunleavy) October 6, 2025\n\nA few things to know about the Islamic Saudi Academy (ISA):\n\nThe school was controlled and funded by the Saudi government;\n\nNumerous local citizens in northern Virginia were opposed to the relocation and expansion of the ISA due to concerns about the school’s teachings, about its control by and funding from the Saudi government, and about the Saudi government’s human rights record;\n\nA top leader of Hamas had sent his children to the school;\n\nThe school’s comptroller had been linked to Hamas;\n\nThen-recent graduates of the school had come under suspicion by federal authorities of potentially seeking to carry out a suicide attack in Israel;\n\nThe school’s textbooks contained hateful language, including animosity toward non-Muslims and Jews in particular;\n\nThe ISA had withdrawn from membership in a major accreditation organization; and\n\nThe ISA’s own website stated that it was controlled by the Saudi government and was guided by the Saudi Ministry of Education.\n\nJust a few short years after her time on the Saudi payroll, Spanberger made the leap to becoming an operative for the CIA, something she loves to tout on the campaign trail. She’s got all the bona fides you’d want in a Deep State shill seeking to acquire power.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Spanberger’s tenure teaching future jihadists, there a great write up over on X (see tweet below). Here’s a sampling:\n\nBefore she donned the CIA badge, before she spun herself into a “national security expert” and paraded as the beltway’s moderate darling, Abigail Spanberger spent time at a school so notorious, it earned the nickname “Terror High.” The Islamic Saudi Academy (ISA), funded directly by the Saudi government, has long been under fire for promoting extremist ideology, glorifying jihad, and radicalizing its students. And from 2002–2003, guess who was on staff? Deep-State-Abbie herself—teaching English literature while surrounded by a cesspool of Wahhabi indoctrination.\n\nhttps://t.co/itNgwRceQl\n— A Guy on X. (@VaChangeAgent) July 23, 2025\n\nAbigail Spanberger would like voters to believe she’s a moderate, but when you scratch the surface even a little bit, you find that she’s a dangerous blend of Deep State operative, far-left ideologue, and lover of incendiary political rhetoric.\n\nEditor’s Note: The Schumer Shutdown is here.

So far, neither Democrats nor Republicans look any closer to a deal. \n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries threw down a gauntlet and challenged House Speaker Mike Johnson to a televised floor debate, which Johnson rebuffed. \n\nA maxim of Washington is that typically, nobody wins a government shutdown. This is why each side seeks to blame the other, with Republicans blaming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and calling it a “Schumer Shutdown,” while Democrats accuse Republicans of shutting down the government over not protecting tax credits for the Affordable Care Act’s health care marketplace. \n\nBut determining who “wins” a shutdown is a fool’s errand. \n\nWhile a poll from The Washington Post showed that a plurality of Republicans blame President Donald Trump and the GOP for the shutdown, it’s a difficult barometer to measure. Typically, the person who blinks in a shutdown loses. \n\nThat makes New Jersey and Virginia’s gubernatorial elections next month the perfect barometers. New Jersey and Virginia’s elections are unique products: the states hold their elections in odd years and therefore, they serve as a barometer for the national mood and typically serve as a tea leaf for next year’s midterm. \n\nHistorically, the party out of power wins these races. In 2009, New Jersey elected Chris Christie, elevating him to national status for winning in a blue state. And in 2021, Glenn Youngkin seemed to offer a path forward for Republicans in Virginia despite its increasingly Democratic tilt.\n\nRepublicans faced mixed opportunities in New Jersey and Virginia this time around, despite the fact they did better in both states last year than expected.\n\nGiven its critical mass of federal workers, Virginia has served as ground zero for cuts put in place by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Plenty of them have already lost their jobs.\n\nVirginia law prohibits governors from running for consecutive terms, so Youngkin’s lieutenant governor Winsome Earle-Sears is running for his old seat. Spanberger has sought to tie Earle-Sears to DOGE and the government shutdown. Curiously, Earle-Sears has not received an endorsement of Trump, which complicates her effort.\n\nMeanwhile, Earle-Sears has sought to tie Spanberger to Democrats in Washington who want to hold out for an extension of the subsidies. Virginia’s economy is usually hit by government shutdowns. In fact, the one time the president’s party won Virginia’s governorship came in 2013, when Republicans led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) shut down the government to defund the Affordable Care Act, which led to Terry McAuliffe winning. \n\nEarle-Sears has sought to repeat the anti-transgender attacks that Trump made against Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, even running an ad saying Spanberger “Abigail Spanberger is for They/Them — NOT Us.”\n\nBut Sears has consistently polled in double digits behind the Democratic nominee, former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger. The most generous poll shows Sears down by 10 points. \n\nThat means that Republicans have largely resorted to investing in the New Jersey governor’s race. Rep. Mike Sherrill, who flipped a red seat in 2018, is running on the Democratic side. Like Spanberger, Sherrill is a decidedly moderate Democrat, she has touted her record as a Naval helicopter pilot. \n\nBy contrast, Republican Jack Ciattarelli is running again in New Jersey. Republicans feel they have a legitimate shot after Trump got within six points of Kamala Harris last year thanks to shifts with Asian-Americans and Hispanic voters. \n\nBut so far, only one poll from Emerson College shows the race being competitive. Others, including from Fox News, show Sherrill has as much as an eight-point lead. \n\nIn addition, Ciattarelli received an unwelcome surprise when Russell Vought, Trump’s director of Office of Management and Budget, announced he would cancel the Gateway Tunnel as part of his retaliation against Democratic states because of “unconstitutional DEI principles.” \n\nAnd unsurprisingly, both states’ races have been rocked by scandals to varying degrees. In Virginia, Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones has come under fire for saying that his rival should be shot. \n\nIn New Jersey, the inspector general for the the National Archives and Records Administration launched an investigation into how Ciattarelli’s campaign obtained military records of Sherrill’s, which included private information. \n\nAs of right now, it seems like Democrats have a better shot at flipping Virginia than they do holding New Jersey, where term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy is not as popular. \n\nBut if the shutdown is continuing into next month, which is a distinct possibility, and Democrats win decisively in both states, Republicans might have to change course.","summary":"Sorting out who wins when workers are being furloughed and services to Americans frozen is a fool’s errand, writes Eric Garcia, but two races ahead of the 2026 midterms will serve as bellwethers.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/government-shutdown-virginia-new-jersey-b2840437.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/01/17/50/Jack-Ciattarelli-Mikie-Sherril.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-06 22:12:36","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":366818440,"title":"'The Five': Kamala Harris challenged by the facts during book tour","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Five October 06, 2025 04:30 \n\n 'The Five': Kamala Harris challenged by the facts during book tour \n 'The Five' co-hosts discuss former Vice President Kamala Harris' continued insistence that the 2024 election was the closest in the 21st century.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE FIVEV-VIDEOKAMALA HARRISDONALD TRUMPJOE BIDENPRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONPOLITICS","summary":"&apos;The Five&apos; co-hosts discuss former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; continued insistence that the 2024 election was the closest in the 21st century.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6382132895112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/5e4f67ab-b5f9-4f09-be63-1abcb8365870/a9fb17b4-3efc-42f6-9499-02fc5e9be9be/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-06 22:05:59","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.418},{"id":366802008,"title":"Free Press co-founder Bari Weiss named editor-in-chief of CBS News","text":"Paramount has acquired The Free Press, a four-year old digital news platform, and will make its co-founder Bari Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News, the company announced Monday.\n\nThe official announcement came after months of speculation on the deal and Weiss' high profile role within the news division. Weiss, 41, will report to Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, who personally courted the former New York Times journalist.\n\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Bari and The Free Press to Paramount and CBS News. Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"This move is part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects — directly and passionately — to audiences around the world.\"\n\nParamount is paying around $150 million in cash and stock for The Free Press, a feisty, upstart operation that generated attention through opinion pieces and podcasts with a strong point of view. Its favorite targets are the excesses of progressive left and purveyors of so-called \"woke\" policies.\n\nCBS News is a traditional mass appeal network TV operation with a proud legacy of journalistic excellence and the home of popular franchises \"60 Minutes\" and \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" But the division has struggled to deal with the shifts in audience habits brought about by streaming video and social media.\n\nWeiss is a provocateur who famously resigned from her high-profile role in the opinion section of the New York Times in 2020, citing bullying by her colleagues and a hostile work environment as the reasons. She has no experience in television or running an editorial operation on the scale of CBS News, which has more than 1,000 employees.\n\nWeiss also ascends at a time when the Trump has threatened news operations with lawsuits and regulatory action, such as pulling station TV licenses over what he believes is unfair criticism of him and his administration. Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a Trump lawsuit making the dubious claim that a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris was deceptively edited to aid her 2024 presidential election campaign against him.\n\nCBS News has never had an executive with the title editor in chief before naming Weiss to the role. It still has a president — Tom Cibrowski — a former ABC News executive hired earlier this year who will remain in his role and continue to report to Paramount TV Media President George Cheeks.","summary":"Paramount has acquired The Free Press, a four-year old digital news platform, and will make its co-founder Bari Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News, the company announced Monday.
