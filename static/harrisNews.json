It was a fitting introduction, given how it mirrored the speech that followed: misleading, superficial and positioning Trump’s efforts as a positive rather than a negative.\nTrump never had an actual job at McDonald’s, of course. People born to millionaires usually don’t. He’s referring to a brief campaign trail stop he made in 2024, serving up fries to prescreened customers at a closed restaurant. The stunt was intended in part to goad his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, whose experience as an actual McDonald’s employee Trump had dismissed as an invention. But he was also there in hopes that the chain’s blue-collar, working-class bona fides might rub off on him.\n\nDonald Trump works behind the counter during a campaign event at a McDonald’s restaurant in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 20, 2024.\n\nThat was a theme of his speech before the chain’s executives this week. We are experiencing “the golden age of America,” he said, “because we are doing better than we’ve ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff.” As evidence of this latter point, he cited Walmart’s assertion that the price of a Thanksgiving meal was down relative to last year — a decline that is dependent on the “meal,” including fewer items and cheaper brands.\n\nAs is the case with a lot of sectors of the economy, the price of a fast-food meal has increased modestly in part because restaurants are absorbing some of the cost. \n\nThe president said that his claims that prices had fallen were validated by a senior McDonald’s official who told him (only in private, of course) that prices “were up 40% because of Biden and inflation and they’re coming down and they’re coming down rapidly.” Trump claimed that these purported price reductions were a function of his administration’s policies, including tariffs. Had he not won, he said, “you probably would have had a bankrupt country.”\n“You are so damn lucky that I won that election, I’m telling you,” he told those in attendance.\nIf Americans — and McDonald’s franchisees in particular — are lucky, it’s probably that things haven’t been worse.\nFirst of all, his claim that prices are coming down is not true of fast food. The Washington Post, using data from the firm Numerator, reports that the price of a fast-food meal is up relative to when Trump took office, driven mostly by increases in the price of soft drinks.\nThanks to a recent drop, the most recent data suggests that an average fast-food meal has cost an average of $14.11 over the past four weeks. Had nothing at all changed after January, the trend over the course of 2024 would have led to the average fast-food meal at this point costing … $14.12.\n\nData from Numerator via The Washington Post.\n\nAs is the case with a lot of sectors of the economy, the price of a fast-food meal has increased modestly in part because restaurants are absorbing some of the cost. The price of a fast-food entree has remained relatively flat over the course of the year, for example, despite a big jump in the price of ground beef — a pound of which is up more than 14% since January. That’s a bigger increase than the one seen in the first nine months of Joe Biden’s presidency.\n\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe administration and its defenders will often cherry-pick specific grocery items that have declined in price, such as eggs, ignoring that prices generally have continued to rise (and that egg prices were unusually high when Trump took office due to the spread of bird flu). It is fair to assume that McDonald’s executives and franchisees know that the trend in food prices has been up, not down.\nIts executives clearly do. The customer base for McDonald’s does include many lower-income Americans, meaning any economic headwinds that affect those consumers quickly affect McDonald’s, too. Over the summer, the chain publicly identified some economic warning signs affecting those customers. Sales of breakfasts — what one executive described as the “most economically sensitive” meal — had dropped as people opted to skip breakfast or eat at home.\nThis month, despite new pricing deals introduced earlier this year, McDonald’s announced that lower-income customers were still making fewer visits and spending less money. The slowing economy was keeping people from visiting the restaurants, as were price increases due in part to surging beef prices, as the Los Angeles Times reported.\nWhy are beef prices higher? In part because of tariffs on foreign imports. \nThose tariffs are also a central reason for the slowdown in the economy. Consumer confidence has plunged during Trump’s second term in office, a reflection of fears about prices and, more recently, the government shutdown.\n\nData from the University of Michigan.\n\nThe president and his administration are generally unwilling to concede that his policies have negative effects on the economy, preferring to blame Biden for what’s happening 10 months into Trump’s second term. But the White House is also starting to roll back existing tariffs — including on beef — in an effort to reduce prices and potentially reverse the slowing economy.\nA year ago, Trump closed down a McDonald’s so that he could pretend to work there, presenting himself as a champion of the working class and a warrior against high prices. Over the past 10 months, prices have continued to go up — including surges driven by the tariffs he’s advocated. The economy has weakened thanks to his policies, hurting McDonald’s and other businesses that rely on more economically sensitive consumers. \nIt seems safe to assume that many of the chain’s franchise owners don’t feel particularly lucky at all.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mcdonalds-summit-speech-prices-economy-tariffs-rcna244674","image":"https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251118-donald-trump-mcdonalds-es-363779.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 22:55:21","author":"Philip Bump","authors":["Philip Bump"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":380309210,"title":"The next election that will provide midterm clues: From the Politics Desk","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner The next election that will provide midterm clues Analysis by Steve Kornacki A solidly Republican congressional district in Middle Tennessee will provide some fresh midterm clues in a special election set for two weeks from today. In theory, the race should be a layup for the GOP and its nominee, Matt Van Epps. Tennessee’s 7th District, which takes in parts of Nashville and its suburbs and stretches through rural counties to the south and west, voted for President Donald Trump by 22 points last year. No Democrat in the country currently represents a district that’s nearly as pro-Trump. The closest would be Maine’s 2nd District, which Trump carried by nine points and is now represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Golden. But there are extenuating factors that make this race at least a little volatile. For one, the broader political atmosphere — at least for the moment — has turned on the GOP. Trump’s approval rating has dropped this fall to the lowest level of his second term. That decline may have been spurred by October’s government shutdown, which the public blamed more on Trump and his party than on Democrats. And the two states with governor’s races this month, New Jersey and Virginia, each produced Democratic landslides that caught both parties by surprise. Then consider that the Tennessee race is a special election, where turnout will be lower than normal and an extra-motivated party base can make a real difference. The evidence is clear that Democrats have the more energized base right now. The four previous House special elections this year all saw Democratic candidates perform between 16 and 24 net points better than Kamala Harris did in last year’s presidential election. As you can see, a similar Democratic overperformance in the Tennessee race would make it potentially competitive. And the primary results already suggested a motivation imbalance. Despite the district’s overall GOP bent, turnout for the Democratic primary was just over 31,000, not that far off the 36,854 who participated on the GOP side. A strong showing on Dec. 2 would bolster Democratic optimism heading into 2026, just as it would amplify concern among Republicans. Midterm elections are not really waged on a level playing field to begin with; in all but three cases over the last century, the opposition party has gained seats — often in large numbers. And Republicans face an additional hurdle. Trump was powered back to the White House in part by “infrequent” voters who were drawn to him but who have shown little interest in backing other Republican candidates in low-profile elections like this one. There’s one other extenuating factor at work in the Tennessee race. In Aftyn Behn, Democrats have chosen to nominate a candidate who was dubbed “the AOC of Tennessee” by members of her own party. A state legislator who’s previously been backed by the Democratic Socialists of America, Behn is particularly vulnerable to attacks in a district that has little taste for left-wing politics. Republicans have made no secret of their plans to tie Democratic candidates across the country in 2026 to far-left party leaders like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. If they end up holding this Tennessee seat decisively — and if Behn fails to make the kinds of gains Democrats have made in previous special elections — it may suggest they’re on to something. Related: A Trump-aligned super PAC is starting to air TV ads in the race to boost Van Epps, per Owen Auston-Babcock. And The New York Times reports that former Vice President Kamala Harris hit the trail today for Behn. Trump offers Saudi crown prince a warm welcome By Babak Dehghanpisheh, Katherine Doyle and Monica Alba In his first visit to the White House since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed bin Salman received a warm welcome from President Donald Trump, who contradicted U.S. intelligence and said the Saudi crown prince “knew nothing” about the killing. “You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,” Trump said in response to questions from a journalist about Khashoggi. “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen, but [bin Salman] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.” Trump began his remarks by saying that he was proud of the crown prince in “terms of human rights and everything else.” Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government. At the time, Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing. The crown prince said in 2019 that he took “full responsibility” for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch, but denied ordering it. Today, he defended the kingdom’s probe into Khashoggi’s murder, which he said included internal reforms. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in the killing. “It’s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,” the crown price said, promising that “we are doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.” Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, the late journalist’s widow, responded to Trump on X: “There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.” Crown Prince Mohammed’s visit will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold. “He’s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven’t gone away. But he’s a changed figure; it’s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,” said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts. He added: “He’s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.” Read more → That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner.

Warner Bros Discovery previously rejected a bid from the Ellison family, which holds all board voting power at Paramount Skydance.\n\nNeither Paramount nor Warner Bros Discovery responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed structure, the wealth funds would take small minority stakes and each would receive “an IP, a movie premiere, a movie shoot”, the report said.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery – home to the DC film universe and television studios, HBO, CNN, TNT and Warner Bros Games – is on the verge of breaking up, crippled by declines in its television business.\n\nThe company said in October that it has been considering a range of options, including a planned separation, a deal for the entire company or separate transactions for its Warner Bros or Discovery Global businesses.\n\nNonbinding, first-round bids are due on Thursday.\n\nParamount is the only company currently considering a full buyout according to the US news website Axios. Warner Bros Discovery also wants to have a deal by the end of the year, according to Axios’s reporting.\n\nPolitical pressures\n\nThe looming deal is shaped in part by how the Trump administration views coverage by the news outlets owned by Warner Bros Discovery.\n\nNetflix and Comcast are also reportedly exploring bids, but any Comcast-led effort would need regulatory approval.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly attacked Comcast over its TV news coverage, saying the company “should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they’ve done to our country”.\n\nComcast owns NBC News and its subsidiary Versant Media, the parent company of MS-Now – formerly MSNBC – and CNBC.\n\nCBS, owned by Paramount Skydance, has taken a more conciliatory posture towards the administration, including hiring a Trump nominee as an ombudsman to investigate bias allegations after settling a Trump lawsuit claiming its flagship programme 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump.\n\nParamount Skydance also recently tapped Bari Weiss, a right-leaning opinion journalist with no television background, to lead the CBS broadcast news division.\n\nAny of the deals that are being discussed raise antitrust concerns. But if Paramount Skydance, which already owns CBS, now purchases CNN as part of Warner Bros Discovery, “that would create an added civic risk”, Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture and communication at New York University, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Such a deal would put two leading news outlets under the roof of the same large, multi-industry conglomerate with avowed close relations to the party in power – and that could lead to more conflicts of interest, less independent watchdog reporting and a narrowing of diverse voices and viewpoints in the public sphere,” Benson said.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery remains the parent company of CNN.\n\nOn Wall Street, Paramount Skydance shares were up 1.7 percent in midday trading. Warner Bros Discovery was also up 2.8 percent from the market open. Comcast gained 0.5 percent, and Netflix climbed 3.5 percent.","summary":"Warner Bros Discovery is on the verge of breaking up, crippled by declines in its television business.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/18/paramount-skydance-prepares-71bn-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-report?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-10-28T000502Z_1680353623_RC2WWU9NV46K_RTRMADP_3_WARNER-BROS-DIS-SALE-PARAMOUNT-SKYDAN-1763494596.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 22:14:19","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":380317556,"title":"Michelle Obama Says She Won't Run Because America \"Ain't Ready\" For A Woman","text":"Authored by Luis Cornelio via Headline USA,\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama bluntly rejected calls that she run for office because America “ain’t ready” for a woman president. \n\nObama made the remarks Friday in a YouTube interview with actress Tracee Ellis Ross while promoting her new book, The Look.\n\nThe interview touched on the first lady’s role as an archetype of “wifedom and femininity,” before Obama veered into a tangent on broader cultural issues and the 2024 election. \n\n“Do you think that impacts the room that we’ve made for a woman to be president?” Ross asked.\n\nObama then replied, “As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” before addressing individuals trying to recruit her for a run. \n\n“That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running because you all are lying,” she added.\n\nObama then turned to Ross and sarcastically asked, “What was the question?” prompting laughter from the audience.\n\nNEW: Michelle Obama says she isn't going to run for president because she doesn't want to waste her time because America \"ain't ready.\"\nTracee Ellis Ross: How do you feel about the fact that the First Lady is an archetype for wifedom and femininity?\nObama: I don't agree with… pic.twitter.com/e03xKMIOvE\n— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) November 15, 2025\n\nObama has long been viewed as a potential presidential candidate since leaving the White House in 2017. \n\nHer remarks also come as the Democratic Party has lost two of the last three presidential elections after nominating flawed women candidates. \n\nHillary Clinton ran in 2015 amid sinking popularity and mounting criminal scandals.

Partners that shows Rep. Elise Stefanik trailing Gov. Kathy Hochul by just three points, with Hochul at 46% and Stefanik at 43%. The margin falls within the poll's 4.4% margin of error, making this a statistical dead heat. It’s worth noting here that J.L. Partners correctly projected Trump's popular vote and Electoral College victory over Kamala Harris in 2024, making them one of the most accurate pollsters of that election.\n\nOf course, despite J.L. Parters’ history of accuracy, many on the left will dismiss those results. But the fact is, they aren’t the only ones showing trouble for Hochul.\n\nA new survey from the Manhattan Institute gives Stefanik a 1-point edge over Hochul. Another Siena poll in May showed the race in a virtual tie, with Hochul clinging to a 1-point lead.\n\nA newer Siena poll shows Rep. Elise Stefanik has significantly narrowed Governor Kathy Hochul's lead among independent voters in the New York gubernatorial race. Hochul now leads Stefanik by just 40-36% among independents, down from an 18-point advantage of 43-25% in September. Siena pollster Steven Greenberg reported that Hochul continues to run very strongly with Democrats, holding a 78-9% lead among party members. Stefanik has widened her lead among Republicans to 79-11%, up from 68-15% in September. It’s worth noting that despite the good numbers with independents, the poll shows Hochul with an overall 52-32% lead over Stefanik in a general election matchup… which doesn’t seem likely, considering multiple independent polls show a much closer race, and the fact that nearly half of New Yorks, 48% indicated they prefer to have \"someone else\" be governor instead of Hochul, while only 42% of New Yorkers want Hochul to be reelected.\n\nRelated: Democrats Are Totally Worried About New York\n\nThe Stefanik campaign told The Post Millennial that “weighted party registration in the poll is about 49% Democrat, 22% Republican, and 28% independent or other. In the 2022 Governor's race, turnout by party registration was about 48% Democrat, 29% Republican, and 23% unaffiliated. That means Republicans are under-represented and independents are over-represented.\"\n\nThe campaign added that “According to the release, the weighted party registration in the poll is about 49% Democrat, 22% Republican, and 28% independent or other. In the 2022 Governor's race, turnout by party registration was about 48% Democrat, 29% Republican, and 23% unaffiliated. That means Republicans are under-represented, and independents are over-represented compared with a real midterm electorate.”\n\nBack in 2022, polls pointed in every direction. Some predicted a blowout while others showed a neck-and-neck fight, and the race ended up razor close. I stay grounded about polling this far out, but the numbers give me room for optimism. Stefanik has a real shot at finally sending Hochul packing, and the momentum building around her campaign suggests this year could be the one New York voters decide they’ve had enough.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/11/18/is-there-hope-for-new-york-n4946154","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/179/d7d2db76-0689-471c-8577-74b92ea4f8d6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 21:49:28","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":380313476,"title":"Police walked right past DNC pipe bomb to first look under a bush where bomber sat 17 hours earlier","text":"An eight-inch-long steel pipe with end caps, a kitchen timer, nine-volt battery, and various wires — planted in plain sight under a bench at the Democratic National Committee building — somehow escaped the notice of two U.S. Capitol Police officers who walked right past it 15 minutes after a dispatcher warned of a pipe bomb at the nearby Republican National Committee building.\n\nThe plainclothes counter-surveillance officers instead proceeded straight to the Congressional Black Caucus Institute building, a few hundred feet east of the DNC.\n\n‘Was it placed and picked back up and then put back out again?’\n\nOne of them stopped at a large bush along the alley that led up to New Jersey Avenue. At 1:03 p.m., the officer backed up, ducked, and peered under the shrub. After a brief pause, he stood back up and continued on the return trek to the DNC. That’s where he discovered the second pipe bomb just two minutes later.\n\nThese two bushes are the only ones the officers are seen looking under in the 11 minutes and 14 seconds they’re captured on available surveillance footage. What was significant enough about the bush next to the CBCI building to warrant specific attention? And why has the FBI never disclosed this detail?\n\nA new review of video footage shows that police officers stopped at the exact bush at which, 17 hours earlier, previously released footage shows the hoodie-wearing pipe bomber sitting.\n\nAt 7:48 p.m. on Jan. 5, the suspect spent one minute 17 seconds near the bush — first bent over, then sitting down in front of the shrub — Capitol Police security video shows. The suspect rummaged through a backpack while sitting cross-legged, then leaned into the bush and appeared to place or attempt to place something underneath.\n\nThe suspect stood up after 77 seconds and walked to the DNC building. There, the suspect sat on a park bench and, at 7:54 p.m., placed a pipe bomb under an adjacent bush, video released by the FBI showed.\n\n A January 2025 U.S. House investigative report said three teams were sent out to look for explosives after a pipe bomb was found behind the Capitol Hill Club at 12:43 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021.Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight\n\nIn a matter of seven minutes early in the afternoon on Jan. 6, the USCP counter-surveillance team visited the same two venues as the pipe bomber did the night before. While their assigned task was to search for explosives at potential targets around Capitol Hill, the only locations they can be seen on camera searching are the CBCI bush and the bush by the DNC bench, where they found and reported the second pipe bomb.\n\nThe significance of the CBCI bush could not have been known to police at midday on Jan. 6.\n\n U.S. Capitol Police counter-surveillance officers walk past the DNC building seven minutes before returning and discovering the pipe bomb. Once the bomb was discovered, the Secret Service acted as if it was not a threat. U.S. Capitol Police CCTV \n\nThe bomber’s visit to the first bush and possible attempt to plant a bomb there are one of many details the FBI has never divulged — or even acknowledged.\n\nThe discovery was made by an independent video investigator known only as Armitas, who spent more than a year examining details of the Jan. 6 pipe-bomb case. Blaze News has agreed not to print his legal name for security reasons. Armitas has assisted Blaze News in its ongoing Jan. 6 investigations. He has also spoken with congressional and FBI investigators concerning his findings.\n\nNew case wrinkles\n\nArmitas alleges that the Biden FBI digitally manipulated the video of the alleged bomber released to the public. The bureau also left out major details in its public disclosures, such as the CBCI bush and the alleged bomber’s visit to the front garden of a congressional rooming house on C Street, near the Capitol Hill Club.\n\nThe new wrinkles in the case only add intrigue to the long-unsolved Jan. 6 mystery.\n\nHow could officers dispatched specifically to look for explosives around Capitol Hill miss the pipe bomb as they walked past the DNC building at 12:58 pm?\n\n’It was almost like a Keystone Kop comedy show.’\n\nAfter discovery of the first pipe bomb came across Capitol Police dispatch at 12:43 p.m., their unmarked vehicle sped from 3rd Street Southwest at E Street to the Capitol South Metro lot in under five minutes — with emergency lights on part of the way.\n\nOnce parked in the Metro lot, the men spent about three minutes putting on jackets and backpacks and grabbing gear from the hatchback. They set off on foot down First Street to D Street, past New Jersey to South Capitol Street Southeast, then south to the DNC building. They walked seven-tenths of a mile — all the way from the Capitol South Metro Station near the Republican National Committee building.\n\n A two-man Capitol Police counter-surveillance team traveled by unmarked police vehicle and on foot to reach an undisclosed bush where the pipe bomber sat 17 hours earlier.Maps by Armitas/Graphic by Blaze News\n\nIt does not appear that the men conducted searches along the way. They stopped briefly near a dark SUV and other vehicles parked on the south side of D Street, directly across a patch of grass from the CBCI bush. Other than that, security video showed, the only locations they stopped to examine closely while on camera were the CBCI bush near the walking path and the DNC park bench.\n\nSome Capitol Police surveillance cameras that normally cover the back of the DNC building were turned away by a command from the control room during this time frame. Because of this, the two plainclothes officers were off camera for three minutes and 54 seconds while they walked from the DNC to the CBCI.\n\nWhen one of the counter-surveillance officers approached the DNC park bench after visiting the bush at the CBCI, this time he spotted something suspicious. He first reappeared on security video after his walk over from the CBCI at 1:05 p.m., walking to a Secret Service SUV and a Metropolitan Police Department vehicle assigned to the security detail of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n\nAt 1:07 p.m., another Capitol Police officer on scene radioed Capitol Police dispatch:\n\n987Adam: “I’m going to declare a 10-100 [explosive] at the DNC as well, similar device as was found at the RNC as well. Advising the units on scene what’s going on.”\n\nDispatch: “All right, where do you have your device?”\n\n987Adam: At the DNC.\n\nDispatch: I copy. … Where at in the DNC, sir?\n\n987Adam: Right on the corner of Canal Street … and Washington Avenue.”\n\nUnknown Officer: “Sir, I need you to repeat. Do we have the same device at the DNC?”\n\nDispatch: “A-firm sir. … The corner of Canal Street and Washington Avenue in the bushes. 987-A Adam has seen it.”\n\nAttempts by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) to conduct transcribed interviews of the two officers who discovered the DNC bomb have been blocked by the Capitol Police, Blaze News has learned.\n\nAccording to the FBI, the DNC bomb sat at the foot of the park bench for 17 hours, escaping the notice of U.S. Secret Service K-9 teams that swept the grounds hours earlier in anticipation of an 11:30 a.m. visit by Harris. Video shows at least two K-9 sweeps of the area after 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 6.\n\n“Why would the dog not hit on a pipe bomb that video shows was placed the night before?” Rep. Loudermilk, chairman of the House Select Subcommittee to Investigate the Remaining Questions Surrounding Jan. 6, asked on Lindell TV. “To me, the only answer to that is the pipe bomb was not there when the dog came by.\n\n“Either it was inert, which, according to the FBI, it wasn't — it had explosives in it — or it wasn’t there,” Loudermilk said. “But we have video of it being placed. So now we need to know: Was it placed and picked back up and then put back out again? If so, why? Why did they go to that extent?”\n\n‘They were literally letting citizens walk within feet of the supposed pipe bomb.’\n\nArmitas said he believes the DNC bomb placed just before 8 p.m. Jan. 5 was retrieved overnight and replaced shortly before it was found on Jan. 6. The Biden FBI told a congressional investigator the footage on the DNC camera that would have shown any activity throughout the night after the initial bomb placement was overwritten.\n\nOn Jan. 5, the suspect appeared to place the pipe bomb with the short end — where a 60-minute kitchen timer was attached — sticking out toward the sidewalk, Armitas said. When the pipe bomb was discovered on Jan. 6, the long end was sticking out, with the kitchen timer pointed into the bushes. Both observations would indicate that the device was removed and later replaced, he said. The camera that would have captured this activity was turned away from the bomb scene.\n\nSecret Service agents drove Harris within feet of the bomb location as her motorcade entered the DNC garage at 11:25 a.m. Why was placement of the DNC device not viewed as an assassination attempt? Harris has never spoken of it. The Secret Service took nearly 10 minutes to evacuate Harris after the bomb was discovered. Why the slow response?\n\nAfter being told there was a likely bomb just feet away, Secret Service agents sat in their vehicles for more than two minutes, finishing lunch, video shows.\n\nEven when they emerged, their nonchalant behavior was striking. Pedestrians continued to walk on the sidewalk just feet from the bomb. Commuter trains continued to run across the nearby train trestle for 15 minutes. Vehicles drove past unmolested.\n\nExperts have said police should have quickly established a blast perimeter, shut down vehicle and train traffic, and immediately evacuated the DNC building. Loudermilk compared the bomb response to the work of the Keystone Kops, the fictional, bumbling police officers of America’s silent-film era.\n\n“Once the pipe bombs were found, it was almost like a Keystone Kop comedy show,” Loudermilk told Lindell TV. “The police failed to put a perimeter around. They were literally letting citizens walk within feet of the supposed pipe bomb. There was no control. It didn’t seem anyone was in charge. It was really an embarrassment.”\n\n The Secret Service motorcade of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris pulls out of the Democratic National Committee garage at 1:14 p.m. Jan. 6, right past a pipe bomb sitting feet away.U.S. Capitol Police/Graphic by Blaze News\n\nSecret Service agents should never have stood at a doorway just feet from a weapon of mass destruction. One police officer tiptoed up to the park bench to snap a photo of the bomb. A sudden explosion could have killed them all.\n\nThe mystery of when the pipe bomb was actually planted at the DNC building could be solved with video from the same DNC security camera that captured the alleged bomber’s movements the night before, except that the FBI didn’t seize it from the DNC when agents obtained Jan. 5 surveillance videos during the early hours of the investigation.\n\n“They encountered a couple of other detectives who had started investigating and said, ‘We have identified the person is this person in the hoodie,’” Loudermilk said in the Lindell TV interview. “‘You need to just look at the January 5 video. So no one obtained any of the video from the 6th. Then apparently all the videos have been overwritten.”\n\nThe disappearance of the security video that would solve the case is another suspicious circumstance in a case loaded with them.\n\nCapitol Police security cameras with near-perfect views to the west side of the DNC building were turned by a command from the control room and so did not capture the scene at crucial times on Jan. 5 and also didn’t capture video of the bomb discovery. The FBI has never acknowledged nor commented publicly on the diverted cameras.\n\n Capitol Police security cameras were turned away from the Democratic National Committee building at key times on Jan. 6, preventing documentation of the possible re-planting of the bomb.U.S. Capitol Police/Graphic by Blaze News\n\nThe FBI has described the Jan. 6 pipe bombs as “viable,” though even that has since been called into question.\n\nThe FBI Laboratory report on the devices said the pipe found at the Capitol Hill Club contained “low explosive black powder.” The DNC device “contained the chemical oxidizer and fuels that, when mixed in the proper proportions, can form the low explosive black powder.”\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive defines black powder as “a low explosive material comprised of potassium nitrate (saltpeter), sulfur and charcoal. While used as a propellant in fireworks and pyrotechnics, it is also used in some ammunition and muzzleloaders.”\n\nInspector General report\n\nWhile the Secret Service had bomb-sniffing dogs at the DNC in advance of Harris’ arrival, the K-9s were never taken into the direct vicinity of the park bench, according to a Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report released to the public on Aug. 2, 2024.\n\n“The officer responsible for sweeping exterior areas said that the exterior sweep included the garage entrance ramp and some other areas near the garage entrance, including a storm drain, but did not include the bushes where the pipe bomb was located,” the report said.\n\n‘Apparently all the videos have been overwritten.’\n\nThe Secret Service deleted thousands of its agents’ cellphone text messages from Jan. 5 and 6, despite being warned by congressional committees to preserve all Jan. 6-related records.\n\nThe Secret Service denied any malicious intent and claimed the purge of text messages was “part of a pre-planned, three-month system migration.” However, the phone wipe began 11 days after the first records-preservation warning letter from Congress, the OIG report said.\n\nThe highly critical OIG Jan. 6 report was delayed by Secret Service attempts to stifle its public release, Loudermilk said in August 2024.\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle “considered asking Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas to invoke his statutory authority to block the review in its entirety,” Loudermilk said.\n\nLike Blaze News?

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives today passed a measure to force the release of Justice Department files on Epstein. Trump had opposed the move for months while one of his closest supporters in Congress, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, turned into a harsh critic over his resistance. Trump reversed his position on Sunday as lawmakers prepared to move forward without him.\n\nThe survey showed Trump’s overall approval has fallen two percentage points since a Reuters/Ipsos poll in early November.

The nine-point decline since January leaves his overall popularity near the lows seen during his first term in office, and close to the weakest ratings for his Democratic predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden. Biden’s approval rating sank as low as 35% while Trump’s first-term popularity fell as low as 33%.\n\nTrump has weathered a host of crises during his political career, including multiple prosecutions after he left office that were related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Through it all, he has kept a strong level of support among Republican voters. The new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed his approval rating among Republicans at 82%, down from 87% earlier in the month.\n\nThis year, the president has been particularly dogged by perceptions he isn’t doing enough to help households with everyday expenses, an issue that also hit Biden’s administration hard and contributed to Trump’s victory over Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, in last year’s presidential election. “It’s all about prices,” said Doug Heye, a Republican political strategist. “People are furious when they go out and spend money at the grocery store, and they can’t believe what they are spending.”\n\nJust 26% of Americans say Trump is doing a good job at managing the cost of living, down from 29% earlier this month.

Trump made the comment after a reporter for ABC News asked Trump about the Jeffrey Epstein political scandal during an Oval Office event with the Saudi crown prince.\n\n“I think the license should be taken away from ABC, because your news is so fake and it’s so wrong,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s comments were his latest effort to pressure regulators to target a media outlet that has drawn his ire, but to date, he has had little success. Trump praised Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whom he had tapped to lead the agency in January. “He should look at that,” Trump said of removing the licenses.\n\nCarr visited with Trump in Florida this weekend, according to a social media post from Carr.\n\nIt was the second time in recent months that ABC has been in Trump’s cross-hairs.\n\nTrump in September praised Republican Carr after he pressured broadcasters to take ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel off air after Kimmel made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Trump also suggested that broadcasters’ licenses should be taken away.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called on the FCC to revoke the station licenses of ABC and Comcast-owned NBC and charge them for using the public airwaves.\n\nThe FCC, an independent federal agency, issues eight-year licenses to individual broadcast stations, not networks. The FCC can revoke a license under a rarely used public interest standard but it has not done so for more than four decades.\n\nDemocratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez rejected Trump’s threats. “The FCC doesn’t get to decide whether the news coverage of those in power is acceptable,” Gomez said. “It has neither the legal authority nor the constitutional right to pursue broadcasters for their journalism. These threats sound ominous, but they’re empty.”\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called on NBC to fire late-night talk show host Seth Meyers and criticized the host’s satirical monologue. In July, the FCC approved the $8.4 billion merger between CBS parent Paramount Global and Skydance Media, after Skydance agreed to ensure CBS news and entertainment programming is free of bias, and to hire an ombudsman for at least two years to review complaints and end diversity programs.\n\nThe approval came shortly after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit against CBS over its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic presidential opponent Kamala Harris.

Smith is pushing back on former first lady Michelle Obama’s suggestion that Americans are “not ready” to elect a woman to the White House. \n\nOn Monday’s episode of “Straight Shooter,” host Smith pointed to newly elected Democratic governor-elects Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia as proof Americans are willing to vote for female leaders, noting that Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., won her election and that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. \n\n“Didn’t we just see an election take place last month where a woman won the gubernatorial seat in New Jersey — Mikie Sherrill? Didn’t we just see Abigail Spanberger win in Virginia — the gubernatorial seat? Isn’t Kathy Hochul the governor of New York? Am I missing something?” Smith asked. “Maybe I need to go back to the 2016 election with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Didn’t she win the popular vote in the United States?”\n\nPointing to Clinton’s 2.9 million-vote margin over President Donald Trump in 2016, Smith asked, “What do you mean we weren’t ready?”\n\n“Weren’t there White women who voted for Donald Trump? Not just White men. Didn’t the Blacks show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton? Didn’t Hispanics show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton? Wasn’t it Hillary Rodham Clinton who spent the last few days neglecting to campaign in places like Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania or places like that while [Trump] was everywhere?” he continued. “Y’all remember that?”\n\nMoving on to a more recent example, Smith noted that while former Vice President Kamala Harris did not win her bid for the White House in 2024, her loss was more likely due to Democrats running former President Joe Biden until the very last moment, not Americans being unwilling to vote for a female candidate.\n\n“How about 2024 when Kamala Harris was running as the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States of America? Yes, she did only have 107 days to do it. But whose fault was that? The Republicans, Black people, Hispanics, women, whomever. Nobody told y’all to hold on to Joe Biden for dear life until July of that summer, when there was evidence that showed months earlier that he wasn’t ready anymore,” he asserted.\n\nThe “Straight Shooter” host said Harris had received more votes than any other Democratic candidate in history and argued that the former vice president’s hesitation to sit for interviews and separate herself from some of the Biden administration’s decisions contributed to her losing the election. Despite Smith’s statement that Harris had received more votes than any other Democrat in history, the former vice president is second in that category, just behind Biden, who garnered over 81 million votes in 2020. \n\n“But 74 million plus people still came out and voted for you. Myself included,” he added.\n\nSmith also referenced his earlier remarks about Michelle Obama, praising the former first lady and saying that if she had run against Trump in 2024, she would have won — a belief he said he still holds.\n\nOn Friday, Michelle Obama said Americans are “not ready” to elect a woman to the White House, citing Harris’ 2024 presidential election loss to Trump. Obama made the comments to a crowd of women at the Brooklyn Academy of Music while promoting her new book, “The Look.”\n\n“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” she said.\n\n“That’s why I’m like, ‘Don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.'”\n\nThe former first lady went on to say that she does not believe men in America are comfortable with a woman leading them.\n\n“You know, we’ve got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,” Obama said.\n\nFox News’ Landon Mion contributed to this report.","summary":"Stephen A.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, joined nearly all voting Republicans in denouncing García for “undermining the process of a free and fair election” with the timing of his retirement announcement. House Democratic leadership failed to prevent a mass exodus of Democrats from supporting the symbolic resolution calling out anti-democratic behavior in their caucus. (RELATED: Democrats Gang Up On Colleague For Having Nerve To Call Out Fellow Dem For ‘Election Subversion’)\n\n“Congressman Chuy García has been a progressive champion and voice for the voiceless in his community for decades,” House Democratic leadership said in a joint statement Tuesday in an attempt to head off defections from their own caucus. “We unequivocally oppose this misguided resolution.”\n\nHowever, a majority of lawmakers appeared to have been persuaded by Gluesenkamp Perez’s argument that García’s retirement gambit constituted “election subversion.”\n\nGarcía, 69, announced his decision to not seek reelection after the filing deadline to run for his seat had passed, leaving his chief of staff, who entered the race hours before the cutoff date, the Democratic Party’s automatic nominee.\n\nGarcí1 has denied effectively hand-picking his successor, but he told the Chicago Sun Times that he helped his chief of staff collect the requisite signatures necessary to qualify for the primary ballot. García did not announce his retirement until several days after the filing deadline.\n\n“You don’t get your cake and eat it too,” Gluesenkamp Perez said on the House floor Monday. “If you’re not going to run, you don’t get to choose your successor no matter how noble the work you have done beforehand.”\n\nA group of progressive House Democrats railed against Gluesenkamp Perez on the House floor Monday night for advancing her resolution over House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ explicit objection.\n\n“Chuy Garcia has stood his ground in moments when others have not, including the sponsor of this resolution of disapproval who has opened the doors to authoritarianism by the way she votes,” Democratic Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez said while taking aim at Glusenkamp Perez’s moderate voting record.\n\nDemocratic Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of the congressional progressive caucus, also criticized the resolution in a brief interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n“I think that it’s a very unusual and unique situation, and I think that there should be laws in every state that ensure that somebody can’t drop out at the last minute without fairness,” Jayapal said. “But I don’t understand why somebody from my home state of Washington would be opining a resolution of disapproval. Like, why not work to change the law in Illinois?”\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a top GOP super PAC involved in House races, criticized Gluesenkamp Perez for failing to have the same energy for condemning the party’s apparent coronation of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats, however, were eligible to challenge Harris for the presidential nomination unlike García’s eleventh-hour retirement move.\n\n“Marie Gluesenkamp Perez was complicit in the anointing of Kamala Harris and disenfranchisement of millions of Washington State voters,” CLF spokeswoman Lydia Hall said in a statement. “Why does she suddenly care that Illinois voters are being disenfranchised but didn’t care when it was happening in her home state and the entire country?”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Expressing frustration over the public perception of his handling of the economy, Trump last week dialed back import taxes on coffee, beef, bananas and other staples.\n\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS AHEAD\n\nHis sagging popularity could make Republicans more vulnerable in next year's congressional elections, though the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed voters continue to see Trump's Republican Party as having a better approach to economic policy.\n\n\"What we're seeing is probably the biggest test of his presidency in terms of his grip on the Republican Party,\" said Mike Ongstad, an independent strategist and former Republican who has not supported Trump's presidential campaigns.\n\nOnly 20% of Americans - including just 44% of Republicans - approve of how Trump has handled the Epstein case, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. Some 70% of poll respondents - including 87% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans - said they believe the government is hiding information about Epstein's clients.\n\nReporting by Jason Lange and Tim Reid; Editing by Scott Malone, Deepa Babington and Edmund Klamann\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nZoom in on the key points of this story with Reuters AI\n\nJason LangeThomson ReutersJason Lange is a Washington correspondent focused on political data.

Having been a right-hand man to multiple Republican presidents before running with George W. Bush in 2000, he knew his worth. When a former veep, Dan Quayle, warned him the job mostly involved attending openings and funerals, Cheney replied, “I have a different understanding with the president.” A proponent of a strong executive branch, he rejected the idea that protecting civil liberties outweighed the imperative to prevent another 9/11. Instead, he became the architect of the War on Terror, crafting and promoting the administration’s rationale for invading Iraq in 2003. That conflict, in which nearly 5,000 U.S. service members and some 200,000 Iraqi civilians were killed, grew increasingly unpopular once it became clear that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. Cheney, though, professed no regrets—and didn’t even object to being portrayed as a behind-the-scenes Machiavelli. “Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole?” he mused in 2004. “It’s a nice way to operate, actually.”\n\nRichard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., and spent his adolescence in Casper, Wyo. His parents, both Democrats, “boasted that their son had been born on Franklin Roosevelt’s birthday,” said USA Today. In high school, Dick was captain of the football team—his future wife, Lynne Ann Vincent, was homecoming queen—and won a scholarship to Yale University. But he dropped out and “floundered for a time,” racking up two drunk-driving arrests before starting political science classes at the University of Wyoming in the mid-1960s. By the end of the decade, he was working for “an up-and-coming staffer in the Nixon White House named Donald Rumsfeld,” who would become his mentor. In the Ford administration, 34-year-old Cheney was named the youngest chief of staff in history when Rumsfeld left the post. He had his first heart attack (he’d have five) at 37 while running for the U.S. House, where he spent 10 years. When President George H.W. Bush nominated him for secretary of defense, he was unanimously confirmed despite questions over his multiple draft deferrals. “I had other priorities in the ’60s than military service,” he said.\n\nCheney “won plaudits for low-key but firm leadership,” said The Wall Street Journal, a style that helped him form an international coalition to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait in the first Gulf War. When the next President Bush wanted a seasoned Washington insider on his ticket, he asked Cheney to compile a list of VP candidates; Cheney did, but then selected himself. Cheney’s “defining moment” arrived on Sept. 11, 2001, said The New York Times. The planes hit when Bush was away in Florida. Cheney quickly ordered that any other hijacked plane be shot down—which proved unnecessary—and persuaded Bush to authorize “enhanced interrogation,” or torture, of terrorist suspects, including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and rectal force-feeding. A “powerful advocate” for the invasions of Afghanistan in October 2001 and Iraq in March 2003, he insisted there was “no doubt” Saddam was stockpiling WMDs and that U.S. troops would be “greeted as liberators.”\n\n“Events would prove Cheney wrong,” said The Washington Post. The Iraq conflict birthed insurgencies and extremism, and photographs of detainees tortured at Abu Ghraib prison drew global condemnation. By Bush’s second term, Cheney found himself increasingly sidelined. His nadir came in 2006, when he accidentally blasted a hunting buddy in the face with birdshot. Yet though the U.S. “was poorer, weaker, more divided, and less globally popular” when he left office in 2009, said Foreign Policy, “it also had not suffered another 9/11-like attack.”\n\nOut of office, Cheney was “one of the most strident GOP critics of President Barack Obama,” whom he saw as weak, said CNN.com. Though Cheney endorsed Donald Trump as GOP presidential nominee in 2016, he broke with Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. After his daughter, then–Rep. Liz Cheney, helped investigate Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, Trump pushed supporters to oust her and fantasized about her facing a firing squad. Cheney stood with his daughter and “in an ironic coda” voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024. “There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” he said. “He can never be trusted with power again.”","summary":"Cheney died this month at the age of 84","url":"https://theweek.com/politics/dick-cheney-obituary","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z4RGAxva77z8ow7dhodJCK-2000-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 19:31:25","author":"The Week US","authors":["The Week US"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.26},{"id":380289642,"title":"Did Trump work at McDonald's?

He hung out at a McDonald's drive-through window during the 2024 campaign. Footage shows Saudi Arabia rolled out a McDonald's trailer during Trump's trip to the Middle East earlier this year.\n\nHe also spoke at the McDonald's Impact Summit in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 17, where the McDonald's company’s leadership, franchise owners and other stakeholders discussed its corporate strategy.\n\n“I'm honored to stand before you as the very first former McDonald's fry cook ever to become president of the United States,” Trump said.\n\nBut did he work at McDonald's? Here is what we know:\n\nMore: Are Walmart's Thanksgiving dinner prices really lower? Behind Trump's affordability post\n\nDid Donald Trump work at McDonald's?\n\nHe made a campaign stop at a McDonald's ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAs Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris headed into the homestretch of their campaigns, Trump went to McDonald's in Pennsylvania and raised his unfounded claim that Harris never worked at the restaurant, though she says she did back in the 1980s to help pay for her college tuition.\n\n\"I'm looking for a job, and I always wanted to work at McDonald's. I never did,\" Trump said in an Oct. 20, 2024, video posted on X. \"I'm running against somebody that said she did but it turned out to be a totally phony story.\"\n\nWith an apron over his usual dress shirt and red tie, he worked the fry station and the drive-through window.\n\nThe footage went viral, and the campaign promptly turned it into a merchandise opportunity by selling \"MAGADonald's T-shirts.”\n\nTrump speaks on prices and affordability at McDonald's\n\nAt the summit, Trump sought to highlight his own attempts at reining in inflation and his love for McDonald's, a working-class staple.\n\n“While other politicians fly around on campaign planes stocked with expensive catering, on Trump Force One (his private plane) prior to ascending to Air Force One, which is quite a nice plane also, we served only McDonald's almost every time,” he said.\n\nTrump also went on to highlight his efforts to eliminate various taxes, loosen regulations and increase investments to bolster the economy.\n\n“No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security for our great seniors,” he said, enumerating the tax cuts in his signature tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July.\n\nAs he did in a Truth Social post on Nov. 5, Trump once again claimed that the cost of a Walmart’s 2025 Thanksgiving meal was 25% less than in 2024.\n\nHowever, Walmart’s 2025 Thanksgiving bundle of pre-selected products includes fewer grocery items and different food brands than in 2024. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that “there’s still a drop in price when comparing the same basket of items as the 2024 meal, but it’s a smaller decrease — 6.5% by our calculations.”\n\nAverage U.S. grocery prices in September were 2.7% higher than they were in September 2024 under former President Joe Biden, according to Consumer Price Index figures. But inflation also reached a high of 9.1% under Biden in June 2022, the highest it had been in four decades.\n\nIn 2025, overall food prices are anticipated to rise faster than the historical average rate of growth. In 2025, prices for all food are predicted to increase 3%, according to USDA’s Economic Research Service’s September forecast.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Nov. 14 eliminating tariffs on products including beef, coffee, tomatoes and oranges to address concerns around affordability.\n\nHe also praised McDonald’s for “recommitting to affordable options.”\n\n“I want to give a very special thanks to McDonald’s for slashing prices for your most popular items, bringing back Extra Value Meals,” he said.\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Smith challenges Michelle Obama's suggestion that America isn't ready for a female president","text":"Stephen A. Smith is pushing back on former first lady Michelle Obama's suggestion that Americans are \"not ready\" to elect a woman to the White House. On Monday's episode of \"Straight Shooter,\" host Smith pointed to the newly elected governor-elects Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., and Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., as proof that Americans are willing to vote for female leaders, as well as noting that Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., won her election and that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. \"Didn't we just see an election take place last month where a woman won the gubernatorial seat in New Jersey — Mikie Sherrill? Didn't we just see Abigail Spanberger win in Virginia — the gubernatorial seat? Isn't Kathy Hochul the governor of New York? Am I missing something?\" Smith asked. \"Maybe I need to go back to the 2016 election with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Didn't she win the popular vote in the United States?\" 'THE VIEW' HOST REJECTS MICHELLE OBAMA'S CLAIM THAT COUNTRY NOT READY FOR FEMALE PRESIDENT Pointing to Clinton's 2.9 million-vote margin over President Donald Trump in 2016, Smith asked, \"What do you mean we weren't ready?\" \"Weren't there White women who voted for Donald Trump? Not just White men. Didn't the Blacks show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton? Didn't Hispanics show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton? Wasn't it Hillary Rodham Clinton who spent the last few days neglecting to campaign in places like Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania or places like that while [Trump] was everywhere?\" he continued. \"Y'all remember that?\" Moving on to a more recent example, Smith noted that while former Vice President Kamala Harris did not win her bid for the White House in 2024, her loss was more likely due to Democrats running former President Joe Biden until the very last moment — not Americans being unwilling to vote for a female candidate. \"How about 2024 when Kamala Harris was running as the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States of America? Yes, she did only have 107 days to do it. But whose fault was that? The Republicans, Black people, Hispanics, women, whomever. Nobody told y'all to hold on to Joe Biden for dear life until July of that summer, when there was evidence that showed months earlier that he wasn't ready anymore,\" he asserted. OBAMA INSISTED BLACK MEN VOTE FOR HARRIS BUT NOW STUMPS AGAINST VIRGINIA'S BLACK LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The \"Straight Shooter\" host said that Harris had received more votes than any other Democratic candidate in history, and argued that the former vice president's hesitation to sit for interviews and separate herself from some of the Biden administration's decisions contributed to her losing the election. Despite Smith's statement that Harris had received more votes than any other Democrat in history, the former vice president is second in that category, just behind Biden, who garnered over 81 million votes in 2020. \"But 74 million plus people still came out and voted for you. Myself included,\" he added. Smith also referenced his earlier remarks about Michelle Obama, praising the former first lady and saying that if she had run against Trump in 2024, she would have won — a belief he said he still holds. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE On Friday, Michelle Obama said Americans are \"not ready\" to elect a woman to the White House, citing Harris' 2024 presidential election loss to Trump. Obama made the comments to a crowd of women at the Brooklyn Academy of Music while promoting her new book, \"The Look.\" \"As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,\" she said. \"That’s why I’m like, ‘Don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying.

Biden's reckless spending and anti-business policies had unleashed devastating inflation that crushed families and small businesses alike. But Trump didn't make excuses; he got to work, and the results speak for themselves.\n\n“There’s still a lot of work to do — and we’re making tremendous progress. 1.9 million more American-born workers are employed today than when I took office,” he said. “Wages for hourly workers are rising at the fastest pace in 60 years.”\n\nTrump made it clear that he is an ally of small businesses, and when he says it, you know he means it.\n\n“I’m fighting every day to support small businesses like yours and the citizens that we all serve — and together, we’re fighting for an economy where everyone can win, from the cashier starting her first job, to the franchisee opening his first location, to the young family in a drive-thru line,” he said.\n\nRecommended: The Epstein Emails Just Took Down a Top Democrat. Who’s Next?\n\nAnd he made sure they knew who started the mess he’s cleaning up.\n\n\"The Biden administration started the affordability crisis — and my administration is ending it,\" Trump declared. And the numbers don't lie: breakfast item prices have fallen 14%, bread and dairy prices are down, and — get this — egg prices have plummeted a staggering 86% since March. \n\nTrump also reminded the franchisees and small business owners in attendance that while Democrats were plotting \"the largest tax hike in history,\" he delivered the most significant tax cuts in American history with the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\". That includes No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No Tax on Social Security for our seniors—policies that will put real money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans.\n\nBut Trump didn't stop there. His administration has slashed more than $1 trillion in regulations, reducing the effective burden on franchisees by more than 37%. And by terminating Obama's infamous \"joint employer rule\" during his first term, Trump protected the franchise business model from a regulatory assault that would have destroyed countless small businesses.\n\nPerhaps most telling was Trump's commitment to everyday Americans: \"My pledge to every family and every small business is that I will not rest until you are richer, stronger, more successful, happier, until you've gotten a piece of the American Dream.”\n\nThe Biden years pushed families to the breaking point. Trump is bringing the country back toward real prosperity with the same straightforward grit he showed behind that fryer and drive-thru window during the campaign. He’s making the American Dream attainable again, and he’s ready to serve it hot to every family waiting for relief.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

But they seem to agree on whom they will face.\nSeveral Democratic hopefuls are focusing their attacks on Vice President JD Vance, shifting their attention toward President Donald Trump’s heir apparent.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on social media last week posted a screenshot of a New York Times headline referring to allegations of Trump’s ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in newly released emails. The headline didn’t mention the vice president, but Newsom wrote on X, “Color me shocked. Any comment, @JDVance?”\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro issued a lengthy rebuke of Vance over the lapse in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP) benefits during the government shutdown, invoking the vice president’s memoir detailing his Ohio upbringing near Appalachia, an impoverished region. \n“America deserves better than JD Vance,” Shapiro proclaimed, blaming “Vance’s bulls––– politics” for the predicament.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, meanwhile, used a time-worn tactic for running against a vice president, referring to the “Trump-Vance administration” in an interview with The Grio, also about SNAP. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the attacks on Vance “pathetic,” blaming Democrats for jeopardizing the program.\n\nThe rhetoric underscores how the growing Democratic field is preparing for a matchup with Vance.\n\nThe rhetoric underscores how the growing Democratic field is preparing for a matchup with Vance, who is widely viewed as the most likely heir to Trump’s political movement. But their focus this early on Vance may also be a sign that Trump’s influence is waning.\nErick Erickson, a conservative radio host who, like Vance, was previously a “never Trumper” before supporting the president, warned that Trump’s “lame duck status” would “come even faster” after Democrats won elections in New York, Virginia and New Jersey this month.\nAlex Pfeiffer, a former White House deputy communications director, said Democrats such as Newsom are “desperate for national attention” and attacking Vance “to stir up headlines.”\nVance, meanwhile, hasn’t shied away from the fight. The vice president has consistently been one of the administration’s fiercest defenders, remaining a top messenger during the government shutdown earlier this month. He also embarked on a tour in competitive House districts to promote Republicans’ megabill, which includes tax cuts for most Americans.\n\nThe focus on Vance could mark a major shift for Democrats who have been running against Trump for most of the past decade. \n\nTo be sure, former Vice President Kamala Harris took her share of jabs from Republicans during her tenure. But the focus on Vance could mark a major shift for Democrats who have been running against Trump for most of the past decade. \nThe Democratic National Committee’s rapid response director, Kendall Witmer, said that Democrats plan to focus on economic issues going forward — a top priority for Americans in recent polls — by placing blame on “Trump and his would-be heirs, including JD Vance,” for enduring concerns about the cost of living. \nDespite Trump’s fading star, he remains a top commodity in Republican circles, and his support is considered critical, if not essential, to win the still-unformed Republican primary. Early polling shows Vance is a top contender, and Trump has hyped him as such.\nBut if Vance chooses to run, he will face the difficult balancing act of distancing himself from “the baggage” of the current administration while still serving in it, according to Joel Goldstein, a scholar of the vice presidency.“For Vance, that will be particularly challenging, because Trump doesn’t allow much space for people to separate themselves from him,” Goldstein said. “The president wants loyalty.”\nThis is a preview of MS NOW’s Project 47 Newsletter.

However, his conduct is susceptible to multiple subjective interpretations, including CNN’s,” the judges wrote. \n\n“We have held that, by using ‘Big Lie’ to describe Trump, CNN was not publishing a false statement of fact. Therefore, whether CNN used ‘Big Lie’ one time or many is irrelevant to the question of falsity,” they added. \n\nThis is the latest of Trump’s failed lawsuits against a media company reporting on his lies. In September, a federal judge dismissed the president’s $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, stating it was chock full of “tedious and burdensome” language that had nothing to do with the case itself. \n\nIn July, Trump sued The Wall Street Journal over a report linking Trump to alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. That lawsuit came shortly after the Trump administration won a $16 million settlement from Paramount for a supposedly “deceptively” edited 60 Minutes interview of failed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. \n\nEarlier this month, CBS seemed to have no problem cutting Trump’s tirades out of his interview. \n\nThis story has been updated.","summary":"A federal judge has thrown out Texas’s gerrymandered congressional maps.Judge Jeffrey V. Brown ruled Tuesday that the Lone Star State must return to its 2021 maps for the 2026 election, writing that “substantial evidence” proved Texas had “racially gerrymandered” its latest districts.Congressional maps are typically redrawn every 10 years, after new census data is released. But Texas’s decision to do so in the middle of the decade—at Donald Trump’s direction—raised alarm. Trump had suggested that Texas could give Republicans five more House seats by flipping a handful of blue districts in the Lone Star State next year via “a very simple redrawing.”“Lawmakers reportedly met that request to redistrict on purely partisan grounds with apprehension. When the Governor announced his intent to call a special legislative session, he didn’t even place redistricting on the legislative agenda,” Brown wrote in his ruling. “But when the Trump Administration reframed its request as a demand to redistrict congressional seats","url":"https://newrepublic.com/post/203359/donald-trump-judge-loss-texas-gerrymandering","image":"https://images.newrepublic.com/bec1b156837d75a618320bf46a75328545159af2.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 18:20:07","author":"Ellie Quinlan Houghtaling","authors":["Ellie Quinlan Houghtaling"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":380275952,"title":"Michael Douglas celebrates milestone anniversary with Catherine Zeta-Jones with head-turning throwback photo","text":"It is an extra special, celebratory day for Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 18, the couple rang in their milestone 25th wedding anniversary, for which the Fatal Attraction actor shared a sweet throwback photo.\n\nThe pair first met at the 1996 Deauville Film Festival in France, and together share son Dylan, 25, and daughter Carys, 22, plus he is also a dad to son Cameron, 46, who he shares with his ex-wife Diandra Luker.\n\nIn honor of his and Catherine's special day, Michael took to Instagram and shared a throwback photo of the two from a year before their wedding, attending the Los Angeles premiere for The Muse, which starred Albert Brooks, Jeff Bridges, and Michael's Basic Instinct co-star Sharon Stone.\n\nCatherine, 56, appears in a form-fitting yellow dress with a tank top style neckline, while Michael, 81, wore a floral, button-down shirt layered under a breezy blue blazer paired with matching trousers. \n\n\"Happy 25th anniversary, my darling Catherine. Who knew? All my love, Michael,\" Michael wrote in his caption, and fans were quick to take to the comments section under the post and gush over it.\n\n\"Happy anniversary to you guys!!! Such a cute couple!!!\" one wrote, as others followed suit with: \"Aw! Happy anniversary to you both. 25 years! Good for you!!\" and: \"Happy anniversary, 25 years is a long time, congratulations,\" plus another fan quipped: \"We all knew!\"\n\nCatherine and Michael's family life\n\nCatherine and Michael's daughter Carys recently graduated from Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, following in the footsteps of her brother, who majored in political science. In addition to her college studies and dabbling in singing, Carys is a budding actress, having appeared in a short film titled F*ck That Guy featuring You star Victoria Pedretti. \n\nMeanwhile, her older brother, who has also dabbled in acting, launched a limited podcast with SiriusXM last year, Young American, through which he intended to both inform and motivate his generation when it comes to the political issues impacting their future. The show launched in September for a limited run, in time for the election between former Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram post at the time announcing the new venture, Dylan wrote: \"It's been a wild ride the last couple of years. From the start of forever wars, the first Black president, culture wars, and now a second chance at a first female president, my generation has lived through some of the most transformative and tumultuous times in our history; and it's only gonna get crazier. I wanna take you through it. On my show, I won't just talk you through the news of the day but underscore the larger issues spinning our country out of control.\"\n\nThe Douglas-Jones siblings spent their first years of childhood growing up in their parents' compound in Bermuda, where Michael's family has deep, long ties to. His mother Diana was part of one of the oldest and most respected families in the Caribbean island, and his ancestors' roots there have been traced back to the 1600s. The compound is located in the island's Warwick Parish, though the family listed it for sale for $10.6 million in 2019.\n\nAside from Bermuda, Dylan and Carys were largely raised in upstate New York; the family, who have also owned a home in Mallorca, Spain for over two decades, last year put on the market their 22-bedroom, Georgian-style estate in Irvington.","summary":"Michael Douglas shared a throwback photo with Catherine Zeta-Jones from before their wedding to celebrate their 25th anniversary","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/us/868232/michael-douglas-celebrates-milestone-anniversary-catherine-zeta-jones-throwback/","image":"https://58v76y8z87lo.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e1c66fc454ed-gettyimages-1466832536.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 17:57:38","author":"Beatriz Colon","authors":["Beatriz Colon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.712},{"id":380269110,"title":"Poll: Majority of Democrats Have Favorable View of Socialism","text":"A majority of Democrats have a favorable view of socialism, a weekly survey from the Economist/YouGov revealed.\n\nThe survey, taken after New York City’s election of socialist Muslim mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, asked respondents across the country, “Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of socialism?”\n\nAcross the board, a plurality, 44 percent, said they had an unfavorable view, compared to 33 percent who said they have a favorable view. Another 23 percent said they are not sure.\n\nOpinions varied sharply along party lines. Seven in ten Republicans, for instance, have an unfavorable view of socialism, compared to just 13 percent who have a favorable view. A plurality of independents, 44 percent, also have an unfavorable view of socialism, compared to 27 percent who have a favorable view.\n\nBut among Democrats, a solid majority of 62 percent said they have a favorable view of socialism. Of those, 16 percent said they have a “very” favorable view, and 47 percent have a “somewhat” favorable view. Only 16 percent of Democrats said they have an unfavorable view of socialism, and 22 percent remain unsure.\n\nNotably, 61 percent of voters who backed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 20204 presidential election also favor socialism. Only 13 percent who supported President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election said they view socialism favorably, and 75 percent said they do not.\n\nThe survey was taken November 7-10, 2025, among 1,663 respondents. It has a +/- 3.5 percent margin of error and follows Democrats bending to the radical left contingent of their party, as was seen in their actions triggering the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\n“We say all the time, this is not your father’s party.

We have a choice between communism and common sense.”\n\n“And you know, you take a look, look back 1000 years, [communism] hasn’t worked,” Trump continued. “If it worked, we’d be using it, I guess.

In her story, she calls Musk a 'F*cking Pathetic P*ssy B*tch'. She suggested he could end world hunger, rebuild Gaza, and protect endangered species.Now, the richest man in the world is not cowering from the Birds of the Feather singer with a blunt response on X.Billie Eilish Drags Elon Musk For Hoarding Trillions of WealthEilish has been an outspoken critic of billionaires, advocating for them to donate a greater portion of their personal wealth to charitable causes.During her appearance at the WSJ Magazine Innovator Awards last month, she urged the ultra-rich to donate, asking 'If you are a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but, yeah. Give your money away, shorties. Love you guys. Thank you so much'.https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1833728804579111268?lang=enPutting her own money into where her words are, Eilish also announced in the same event that she would donate $11.5 million (£9.6 million) from her 'Hit Me Hard and Soft' tour. This would support an organisation combating climate change, promoting climate justice, improving food equity, and reducing carbon footprints.The Instagram carousel she recently shared was created by the advocacy organisation MyVoiceMyChoice. It called on Musk to use his wealth to address pressing global issues, including hunger and environmental conservation.She ended the posts with a frustration at billionaires who she feels hoard resources instead of addressing crises.Elon Musk Shares Thoughts on Billie Eilish's CommentsIt was not long before Musk found Eilish's Instagram story on his X platform. His response did not address his controversial trillionaire status, but instead, carried on his original smug 'rebuttals'.In a post showing Eilish's stories, Musk replied 'She's not the sharpest tool in the shed'.This reply is consistent with his tendency to use social media for quick firebacks, similar to how he threatened to 'impregnate' Taylor Swift for backing Kamala Harris in the 2024 US Presidential Election.Musk's Trillion Dollar Package: The Greed They Talk About in the BibleRecently, Musk has received approval from a majority of Tesla shareholders for his unprecedented £761.8 billion ($1 trillion) pay package, despite opposition from advisory firms such as Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services.The approval came during Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas, and is designed to incentivise Musk to meet aggressive growth and operational milestones over the next decade.The package is structured into 12 tranches of share grants, which Musk will only receive as Tesla achieves specific targets. These include hitting market capitalisation benchmarks and operational goals that could increase his ownership from roughly 13% to 25%, adding over 423 million shares to his holdings.With this approval, Musk could become the world's first trillionaire if targets are met. The shareholder approval also means they are confident in Musk's vision to turn Tesla into a $2 trillion (£1.5 trillion) brand, despite debates over the fairness of the package.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/shes-not-sharpest-tool-elon-musk-fires-back-after-billie-eilish-cusses-him-out-his-1756102","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1769373/elon-musk.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4ed7fd8a399aec6c7c28a352e9932d08","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 17:34:41","author":"Thea Felicity","authors":["Thea Felicity"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.108},{"id":380323202,"title":"Sherrill will resign House seat on Thursday","text":"Democratic Rep.

She won’t take office until Jan. 20, but resigning her House seat earlier will speed up the process of setting up the special election for the 11th District in North Jersey.\n\nUnder state law, the primary would take place within 70 to 76 days of Murphy ordering a special election, with a general election to follow 64 to 70 days after that. \n\nSherrill’s letter was not unexpected as she’d already disclosed her plan to resign this week in a Nov. 12 floor speech. She stepped down from the House Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party last week. \n\nA former Navy helicopter pilot, Sherrill flipped her 11th District seat in 2018 during the so-called blue wave, and it was made more favorable to Democrats in redistricting after the 2020 census. \n\nSeveral candidates have already announced bids to succeed Sherrill, who won a fourth term last year by 15 points. Democrats will be favored to hold the suburban 11th District, which backed Kamala Harris by 9 points last year. \n\nDemocrats running in the upcoming special election include former Rep. Tom Malinowski, who represented the neighboring 7th District for two terms; Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill; former White House aide Cammie Croft; Morris Township Deputy Mayor Jeff Grayzel; former Capitol Hill aide Marc Chaaban; Maplewood Township Committee Person Dean Dafis; and Chatham Borough Council Member Justin Strickland. \n\nThe primary could grow further crowded with the New Jersey Globe reporting that Murphy’s lieutenant governor, Tahesha Way, is also expected to enter the race. Murphy, though, endorsed Gill, his onetime campaign manager, on Monday.\n\nAlso on Monday, New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, endorsed Malinowski in the 11th District primary.

I Am Not Stupid”: Epstein Survivors Call Out Trump","text":"A federal appeals court panel affirmed the dismissal Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s $475 million defamation lawsuit against CNN for using the term “the Big Lie,” calling the president’s claims “unpersuasive” and “meritless.” \n\n“Trump has not adequately alleged the falsity of CNN’s statements. Therefore, he has failed to state a defamation claim,” wrote 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judges Adalberto Jordan, Kevin Newsom, and Elizabeth L. Branch in an eight-page filing. “Trump’s other arguments are likewise meritless.”\n\nTrump had nominated both Newsom and Branch, as well as District Judge Raag Singhal, who first dismissed the case in July.\n\nThe term “the Big Lie” refers to Trump’s debunked claims of sweeping election fraud that supposedly robbed him of a second term in the White House in 2020. Trump alleged when he sued the network in 2022 that CNN’s use of the term was part of a “campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander.”\n\nHe also accused CNN of using “the Big Lie” to create a “false and incendiary association” between him and Adolf Hitler, who originally coined the term in Mein Kampf. But the lower court ruled that “bad rhetoric is not defamation when it does not include false statements of fact.”\n\nThe panel of appeals court judges ruled that Trump’s argument was “unpersuasive,” because the term “Big Lie” did not constitute a statement of fact. “This assumption is untenable,” the judges wrote. \n\n“Trump’s argument hinges on the fact that his own interpretation of his conduct—i.e., that he was exercising a constitutional right to identify his concerns with the integrity of elections—is true and that CNN’s interpretation—i.e., that Trump was peddling his ‘Big Lie’—is false. However, his conduct is susceptible to multiple subjective interpretations, including CNN’s,” the judges wrote. \n\n“We have held that, by using ‘Big Lie’ to describe Trump, CNN was not publishing afalse statement of fact. Therefore, whether CNN used ‘Big Lie’ one time or many is irrelevant to the question of falsity,” they added. \n\nThis is the latest of Trump’s failed lawsuits against a media company reporting on his lies. In September, a federal judge dismissed the president’s $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, stating it was chock full of “tedious and burdensome” language that had nothing to do with the case itself. \n\nIn July, Trump sued The Wall Street Journal over a report linking Trump to alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. That lawsuit came shortly after the Trump administration won a $16 million settlement from Paramount for a supposedly “deceptively” edited 60 Minutes interview of failed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. \n\nEarlier this month, CBS seemed to have no problem cutting Trump’s tirades out of his interview. \n\nThis story has been updated.","summary":"The survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking empire are begging Donald Trump to stop turning their suffering into a political issue.\n\nSpeaking during a press conference outside of the U.S. Capitol Tuesday, a group of the financier’s victims excoriated Trump’s dogged efforts to minimize interest in the case as a “national embarrassment.”\n\nJena-Lisa Jones, who publicly accused Epstein in 2019 of abusing her in his home years earlier, described the process to obtain transparency into the government’s investigation as “distressing.”\n\n“First, the administration said it would release everything, and applauded President Trump for that,” Jones said. “Then it fought to release nothing.”\n\n“Now that the checks and balances of our democracy have worked, and the bill is getting passed to release the files, we are hearing the administration say they intend to investigate various Democrats who were friends with Epstein.” \n\n“I beg you President Trump—please stop making this political.

However, one part of the ceremony which prompted many questions across the various platforms revolved around his son Barron Trump — and an exchange he had with outgoing president Joe Biden. (Picture: Saul Loeb – Pool/Getty Images)\n\n The 19-year-old, 6 foot 9 student was seen approaching Biden and the outgoing vice-president Kamala Harris during the ceremony, shaking hands with them inside the Capital Rotunda before speaking in Biden’s ear. The moment saw Biden’s expression change from upbeat to solemn within seconds – causing social media to light up with speculation as to what was said.\n\n ‘You forgot to pardon yourself,’ one person joked at the time. Another added: ‘Not sure what he said but wiped the smirk right off his face.’ However, nearly a year later, the mystery may have been solved — courtesy of Barron’s older brother Eric. (Picture: TikTok/trumpwon829)\n\n Speaking to Megyn Kelly during a live take of her show in Miami last week, Eric Trump told her that he had asked Barron exactly what went on between him and former President Biden at the inauguration and, despite all the conspiracy theories doing the rounds, it wasn’t nearly as exciting as some might have suggested. (Picture: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n Eric said: ‘One night I call Barron and I go “Buddy, what did you actually say?” And it was something so polite I almost wouldn’t even get it right. But like, “Congratulations, and best of luck to you”, or something like that. Something very respectable.’ (Picture: Sirius XM)\n\n He also denied that his sibling might have said something more controversial, adding: ‘Patrick Bet David, I was on his show and he goes “Did Barron really tell Biden to go f*** himself?” He just doesn’t have that in him. He’s probably thinking it, he definitely has it up here, but like he’s too courteous to actually go out there and say it.’ (Picture: SiriusXM)\n\n Barron, 19, also won praise at the time for shaking hands with the outgoing president. ‘I was very impressed by that gesture and from someone so young. To go across the aisle and shake their hands was a very classy and mature thing to do. Good for Barron,’ one person said. Another added: ‘That gesture just tells you everything.’ (Picture: Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)\n\n More recently, it’s been rumoured that Barron, who is in his second year at NYU, has been struggling with university life since his dad began his second term as president, with the Daily Mail reporting that he has been subject to nicknames from his peers. ‘He’s sort of like an oddity on campus,’ said Kaya Walker, the former president of NYU College Republicans, via Vanity Fair. ‘He goes to class, he goes home.’ Other reports recently suggested that he shut down an entire floor of Trump Tower for a romantic date – for security reasons. (Picture: Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)\n\n Trump, however, has refuted such speculation. Speaking in a YouTube video his granddaughter Kai posted to her channel – in which the pair play golf together – he said of Barron: ”He’s doing good. He’s a good boy.’ (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n Barron, who is a student at NYU School of business, is reported to be taking classes at the university’s Washington DC campus and living in the White House, after spending his first year on campus in New York. He is due to graduate in 2028.

Bush from 2001 to 2009, played a key role in shaping U.S. national and international policy, most notably the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He died on November 3 at the age of 84 “due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease,” according to a statement from his family.\n\nWhen Is Dick Cheney’s Funeral?\n\nThe funeral service for Cheney is scheduled for Thursday, November 20, at 11 a.m. ET at Washington National Cathedral in the nation’s capital.\n\n“Vice President Cheney devoted decades of his life to public service at the highest levels of government,” the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, Dean of Washington National Cathedral, said in a statement. “His life was marked by deep dedication to his family and to the country he served. We pray for his family and all who loved him.”\n\nThe cathedral’s announcement states the service is invite-only, with heightened security protocols in place.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney in St. Michaels, Maryland, on March 17, 2012. \n\nWill President Donald Trump Attend the Funeral?\n\nNewsweek emailed the White House to confirm whether the president, the first lady, or any Trump administration official would attend the funeral.\n\nTrump has remained conspicuously silent on Cheney’s passing, offering no public tribute or statement on social media or through official channels. The White House acknowledged Cheney’s passing only briefly, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt noting that the president was “aware” and that flags had been lowered to half-staff “in accordance with statutory law”—a gesture widely seen as perfunctory rather than heartfelt. \n\nAnalysts suggest the muted response reflects Trump’s long-standing animosity toward Cheney, who had branded Trump the greatest “threat to our republic” and endorsed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nWhich Former Presidents and Politicians Are Attending the Funeral?\n\nFormer President George W. Bush will deliver a tribute at the funeral, according to a statement from the cathedral.\n\nIt is not uncommon for high-profile political figures from both parties to attend presidential funerals. At former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral in January—the last major funeral service held at Washington National Cathedral—Cheney was the only living former vice president not in attendance. Then-President Joe Biden was there, along with the other four living former presidents: Trump, Bush, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\n\nNewsweek asked a cathedral spokesperson if other former presidents and vice presidents will be present.\n\nIt is likely, though not confirmed, that other figures from the Bush administration will attend, including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Former Secretary of State James Baker and former Attorney General Bill Barr, who both served in the cabinet of former President George H.W. Bush alongside Cheney when he was secretary of defense, might also attend.\n\nWho Is Speaking at the Service?\n\nIn addition to Bush, tributes will also be heard from Pete Williams, who worked for Cheney in his congressional office and at the Defense Department as a spokesperson, and Cheney’s cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner; the former vice president had a long history of heart problems, culminating in a transplant in 2012.\n\nCheney’s grandchildren and his eldest daughter, Liz Cheney, the Republican former Wyoming representative who lost reelection in 2022 after speaking out against Trump, are also due to speak.\n\nThe cathedral also listed the following clergy as taking part in the funeral:\n\nThe Most Reverend Sean Rowe, Presiding Bishop and Primate, The Episcopal Church\n\nThe Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, Dean, Washington National Cathedral (will offer the homily)\n\nThe Reverend Canon Jan Naylor Cope, Provost, Washington National Cathedral\n\nThe Reverend Canon Rosemarie Logan Duncan, Canon Precentor, Washington National Cathedral\n\nThe Reverend Joshua D. Armstrong-Walters, Rector, St. John’s Episcopal Church\n\nHow to Watch Dick Cheney’s Funeral\n\nThe service will be livestreamed via the Cathedral’s website and its YouTube channel. Additionally, news networks will provide broadcast coverage.\n\nWhy Are Flags at Half-Staff Today?\n\nFlags across the U.S. are flying at half-staff to honor Cheney. Under federal law, the president directs flags to be lowered as a mark of respect following the death of a current or former vice president.

But the second report, which confirms Carlson’s investigation, comes from the New York Post.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Butler assassination attempt, top FBI officials, including former Director Christopher Wray, testified before Congress that Crooks had no significant social media presence that could help explain his motivation for trying to kill Donald Trump.\n\nThe head of the FBI’s Pittsburgh office told reporters, “We see no definitive ideology associated with our subject, either left-leaning or right-leaning.” Either they weren’t trying very hard, or they lied.\n\nBoth Carlson and the New York Post discovered an extensive social media history connected to Thomas Crooks. They found more than a dozen social media accounts that detailed Crooks’s transition from a strong Trump supporter to a rabid Trump-hater.\n\nAn investigative source for the New York Post said:\n\n“The danger Crooks posed was visible for years in public online spaces. His radicalization, violent rhetoric, and obsession with political violence were all documented under his real name. The threat wasn’t hidden… \n\n\"He left a digital trail of violent threats, extremist ideology, and admiration for mass violence. He spoke openly of political assassination posted under his real name…”\n\nIn one post, Crooks wrote, “The only way to fight the government is with terrorism-style attacks, sneak a bomb into an essential building and set it off before anyone sees you, track down any important people/politicians/military leaders, etc., and try to assassinate them.”\n\nBoth Carlson and the Post discovered that, just like Charlie Kirk’s assassin, Crooks was also obsessed with “furries.” One of Crooks’s accounts was devoted to “scantily clad cartoon [animals] sporting muscle-bound male bodies and female heads.” He also used “they/them” transgender pronouns, repeatedly attacked Donald Trump, and mocked MAGA supporters.\n\nAll of that seems to point to motive. The question that must be answered is: Why didn’t the FBI find this information, or why did it try to cover it up? There is no good explanation.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel is defending his agency, asserting that “Over 480 FBI employees were involved in the Thomas Crooks investigation.” It’s hard to believe that over 480 FBI agents missed all this information. And given everything we have learned about the Deep State over the past 10 years, it’s hard to trust anything the Comey/Wray FBI did, especially when it comes to Donald Trump.\n\nTrump: Release The Epstein Files\n\nSunday night, President Trump made it clear where he stands on the continuing controversy over the so-called “Epstein Files.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote:\n\n“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics… \n\n\"The Department of Justice has already turned over tens of thousands of pages to the Public on ‘Epstein,’ [is] looking at various Democrat operatives (Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, Larry Summers, etc.) and their relationship to Epstein, and the House Oversight Committee can have whatever they are legally entitled to. I DON’T CARE!”\n\nThe president’s reluctance to release the files before now has many explanations. One of which is that there will be people named in these files who didn’t do anything wrong.\n\nFor many years, Jeffrey Epstein was a fixture of the New York financial establishment. Many people dealt with him regularly. But we know the media will take the name of any conservative or someone associated with Donald Trump and imply they were regular visitors to his sex trafficking island.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has announced that a vote to release the Epstein files will be held today. There could have been a vote last week, but Democrats blocked it for political purposes.\n\nJust a reminder, Donald Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, and he said this in 2015, “That island was an absolute cesspool, there’s no question about it. Just ask Prince Andrew. He’ll tell you about it. The island was an absolute cesspool.” Why would Trump say that and invite additional media attention if he had something to hide?\n\nIn addition, the Biden administration and its Deep State allies had control of Epstein’s files for four years. If there was ANYTHING that implicated Donald Trump, it would have been released.\n\nProtecting Our Tax Dollars\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced that food stamp benefits will not be automatically renewed. All food stamp recipients will have to reapply for their benefits. The screams from Democrats and their fake news media allies will start anytime now about how women and children are suffering.\n\nBut here’s why the administration is taking this responsible step. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins asked the states to provide information about who is getting food stamps so the Trump administration could audit the program. Only 29 states, mostly “Red” states, complied with her request.\n\nWhat she found was shocking: More than 180,000 dead people are getting food stamps, and 500,000 people are getting paid twice.\n\nRollins added, “But here’s the really stunning thing: This is just data from those 29 mostly red states. Can you imagine when we get our hands on the blue state data what we’re going to find?”\n\nThis is exactly what needs to be done when the government is handing out free benefits. It is exactly what you would expect any conservative administration to do.\n\nThis is not a minor issue. The food stamp program is rife with fraud. Some people either sell their food stamps for cash or exchange them for drugs.\n\nWe owe it to productive, hard-working Americans to ensure that the taxes being deducted from their paychecks are being used wisely and not encouraging more poverty and dependence.\n\nShe Said What?\n\nMany historians believe the evidence is strong that Edith Wilson, wife of President Woodrow Wilson, held bigoted and racist views. For example, her husband resegregated the federal government, undoing decades of progress made after the Civil War.\n\nBut I think a strong case can be made that we had a racist first lady from 2009 to 2017. Her name is Michelle Obama.\n\nDuring an interview to promote her new book, Obama complained about the intense pressure she felt in the White House to comply with “white beauty standards.” She said:\n\n“Let me explain something to White people! Our hair comes out of our head naturally in a curly pattern, so when we’re straightening it to follow your beauty standards, we are trapped by the straightness!” \n\nThis is not the first time Mrs. Obama has spoken in a derisive, hostile way about White Americans. Can you imagine Melania Trump or Laura Bush saying, “Let me explain something to Black people!” That’s a sentence that would result in a political firestorm.\n\nMrs. Obama even lashed out at her fellow Democrats. She told her audience, “I didn’t even feel I had the support of the [Obama] campaign.” Why not? “They were white folks, too,” she said. The former first lady judges everybody by the color of their skin. She totally rejects the goal of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nShe went on to say she has no interest in running for the White House because America is just too “sexist.” Referring to Kamala Harris’s loss, Obama claimed:\n\n“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready. That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not. You know, we’ve got a lot of growing up to do.”\n\nWrong, Michelle. It has nothing to do with gender. There are female Republican governors, senators, and representatives. It has everything to do with the extreme policies Harris promoted, including open borders, abortion on demand, and transgender surgeries for prison inmates. Even with those radical positions, Harris received 48% of the vote.\n\nPack Your Bags, Ladies\n\nGallup just released an odd poll. It found that 20% of Americans want to leave the country permanently. That is startling enough. But among women ages 15 to 44, that figure is 40%. Fox News host Laura Ingraham had a great response to this poll, “Then leave.” I couldn’t agree more.\n\nPolling shows there is growing support for political violence among the Left. I bet a poll of the 40% of women who want to leave the country would find that 80% of them support political violence.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/122817-the-crooks-cover-up-2025-11-18","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 15:18:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":380209778,"title":"'The View' host rejects Michelle Obama's claim that country not ready for female president","text":"\"The View\" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin rejected former First Lady Michelle Obama's claim that America was not ready for a female president on Monday, calling the two recent female candidates, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, \"flawed.\" \"I respectfully disagree with the first lady,\" Griffin said. \"I don't think that we're not ready.

But while he may have a regular guy’s taste in fast food, he’s looking oblivious to the wrenching price pressure haunting millions of Americans.\n\n“There’s never been a time like this,” he declared Monday at a summit of McDonald’s franchise owners in Washington. The president waxed lyrical about his favorite Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and fondly recalled his turn working the fry station at one of the fast-food giant’s Pennsylvania restaurants last year.\n\nBut Trump’s overall message was jarring, as he argued the economy was super-sized even while millions struggle to afford the cost of living. “You know, I just might add, this is also the golden age of America, because we are doing better than we’ve ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,” Trump said.\n\nHe went on, “We are looking at affordability — we are going to bring it down for everybody because not everybody understands the fact that a great stock market is great for everybody,” including 401Ks.\n\nCitizens lucky enough to have pension funds linked to record stock markets have done well recently. But they’ve also been punished by daily costs and the money in their paychecks not going as far. And that leaves the common touch Trump effectively highlighted as a candidate now in question. Political peril lurks for him in the gap between a complex reality and his happy talk about the economy — punctuated in his speech Monday by digressions over his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and his obsession with slow-running taps.\n\nTrump came over all poetic about the unique place of McDonald’s in American communities. “Before the sun rises, you’re up serving hot coffee to construction workers, nurses and police officers on the way to the job,” he said. “In the evening, you stand ready with the fast dinner and the smile for busy moms and their children. There’s a race from school to soccer practice, really, it’s Americana.”\n\nThis was high praise coming from a master of branding. But as he often does, Trump explained his political rationale out loud. If he couldn’t truthfully claim to have delivered lower prices, he can try to steal his opponents’ branding on the issue.\n\n“The word is affordable,” Trump said. “And affordable should be our word, not theirs, because the Democrats got up and said ‘affordability, affordability’ and they don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history, everything was the worst. What they are great at is lying.”\n\nTrump’s speech came across as an attempt to show understanding about daily costs and to repair Republican vulnerabilities exposed by a big night for Democrats in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey this month. But it would be hard to conclude his rambling cheerleading fulfilled either goal.\n\nFirst, and most dauntingly, for Trump, the high prices for most food, housing and health care that are antagonizing Americans and souring their confidence in his leadership are almost certainly not coming down.\n\nWhile inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, is at 3.0% — far lower than the 9.1% peak during the Biden Administration — costs are still going up. No economist wants to see prices go down in a cycle of deflation — that would be a harbinger of a big recession with massive job losses. But at the same time, and after decades of low inflation, voters have yet to adjust to the post-pandemic price shock.\n\nMaybe voters were insulated from economic pressures for decades and have unrealistic expectations. But that doesn’t make it feel any easier.\n\nAnd after driving Democrats out of the White House partly over their poor record on inflation and affordability — and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’s lack of answers on those issues — Trump is now suffering the incumbent’s curse. He’s been office for nearly 10 months and voters aren’t feeling better, so he’s getting the blame. Affordability can get a politician elected. But it then becomes their problem.\n\nThe statute of limitations for blaming the Biden administration is running out. “(Democrats) are saying that the runaway spending that we gave you guys, that created runaway inflation, is 100% your fault,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said on CNBC Monday. But those are the breaks, even for a president who’d prefer the buck didn’t stop with him.\n\nHow Trump is trying to ease costs\n\nTrump has made significant policy steps to try to alleviate the burden on working Americans. He’s trying to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. He temporarily eliminated tax on most tips in his big domestic policy legislation. In his speech to McDonald’s franchise owners, he argued that his slashing of regulations that constrain small business growth would end up helping everyone.\n\nBut insecurity felt by many Americans who are one layoff away from losing health insurance is structural and long-term; it can’t be fixed with a few quick policy initiatives.\n\nIt’s going to need more than Trump’s first big political point in his Monday speech: “You are so damn lucky that I won that election.”\n\nThere’s growing evidence his policies may be making things worse. Global trade wars and high tariffs are contributing to rising costs, according to multiple independent analyses. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for instance, reported that the tariffs amounted to an effective tax hike on the average American household of $1,200, a figure set to rise to $1,600 next year. A CNN poll this month found 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” And everyone who does their own shopping feels the pain every time they go to the grocery store.\n\nAlleviating the situation will be tricky. Trump’s newest proposals look buzzy and may help at the margins. A potential plan to send out $2000 tariff revenue payments is one idea — though such a rush of cash into the economy could spike inflation. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted Monday that such checks wouldn’t fix the damage and added “who knows if they’ll ever come.”\n\nOfficials are thinking aloud about 50-year mortgages. This might get people into homes — if there’s sufficient supply. But they may never be able to pay them off.\n\nTariffs may be the problem\n\nMore fundamentally, the White House seems to be implicitly admitting that the tariffs are partly to blame, while insisting publicly that they are not. Trump issued an executive order on Friday cutting duties on beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas. “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,” Hassett said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday, said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday. But he added, “The prices will go down,” arguing that this was not due to removing tariffs but rather an increased supply of goods.\n\nBut Trump isn’t slashing tariffs across the board. To do so would repudiate the central principle of his entire economic policy — which is designed to trigger a revival of American manufacturing. The downside of this strategy was always that if even if it works, it will take years to fully play out, after a period of economic adjustment and pain in the meantime. That’s time Trump doesn’t have, with midterm elections less than a year away.\n\nAnd the president has left himself politically exposed after attempting such a risky strategy to remake the global trading system that almost every economist predicted would raise prices. It was probably just a coincidence, but he blamed his raspy voice Monday on having to shout at somebody over trade policy with an unidentified country. “I blew my stack at these people,” he told a reporter.\n\nAnother complication for Trump is that his impressive power at defining the political narrative may be starting to fail him. He was just forced into a complete reversal by calling on the House of Representatives to vote to compel his own Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files to avoid an embarrassing political defeat.\n\nEven one of his top supporters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, is rebuking him for losing sight of the concerns of the MAGA base, including on costs. Convincing millions of voters that an election was stolen is one thing. Telling them the economy is in a “golden age” when they know well that it is not won’t work. Trump seems to be coming dangerously close to the inflation denial of the Biden administration, which helped cost Democrats the 2024 election.\n\nTrump has hardly been helping himself. Obsessing over personal legacy projects like the new White House ballroom, dining with corporate CEOs and flying around the world in search of a Nobel Peace Prize isn’t exactly the look of a president laser-focused on the uncertainty facing millions of Americans.\n\nAnd his speech at the McDonald’s event did not offer any real sense of empathy for people who were hurting. He threw in the new Washington buzzword “affordability” a few times. He offered a litany of statistics that were often misleading about prices coming down. Such claims are often incomplete or untrue, as CNN’s Daniel Dale has documented.\n\nBut Trump did show flashes of what makes him a compelling political personality. He quipped that some people might not want to hand down wealth to children they didn’t like. If only that were a concern for most Americans. And he revealed striking new operational details about the daring US stealth bomber raid that targeted Iran’s nuclear sites earlier this year.\n\nBut his levity felt off-key given the subject, and politically unwise amid claims he’s out of touch. Trump aides are thinking about sending him around the country to give a series of economic speeches. But the president himself identified a potential flaw with that strategy, celebrating his refusal to stick to a script during his appearance on Monday.\n\nTrump said he’d given a McDonald’s executive a signed page of his printed speech offstage. “‘I said, do you want to keep this? You can either hang it, you can give it to somebody, you can throw it away. I don’t care.’ But I don’t stay on the speech too long anyway, you know, so usually those speeches aren’t too accurate.”\n\nAnd one more thing. The next time the Beast presidential limo shows up at a drive-thru, the commander-in-chief has a special request. “I like the fish. I like it,” Trump said. “You could do a little bit more tartar sauce someplace, seriously.”","summary":"President Donald Trump proclaimed an economic golden age under the Golden Arches.

I Went to See Why Its Dream Is Coming Apart.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAt a bar downstairs at the Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, I recently found myself next to a 67-year-old man who had come to town to get a tattoo on his shoulder. The tattoo in question was of Yosemite Falls, in California. As best I could understand it, he was getting branded with the landmark because he was enmeshed in a situationship that wasn’t working out. He and this woman had apparently taken a memorable trip to Yosemite earlier this year, and he hoped that—after he showed her the tattoo—a tarnished spark would be rekindled. I wished him all the luck in the world as he took his leave of me, and for a few minutes, I was alone among the chirping slot machines, nursing a gin and soda and pondering how no place on Earth can make you believe the impossible quite like Las Vegas.\n\nI know more people who hate Vegas than love it, and I’ve never been able to construct a convincing argument for why they’re wrong. We are granted only so many vacations in this life, and it might seem ill-considered to spend one of them watching the Blue Man Group in an Egyptian-themed hotel in the Nevadan desert. But here I was, at the Luxor, on a quest to renew my love affair with this city.\n\nThe hotel, located at the tip of the Las Vegas Strip, remains a crown jewel of the city’s famed themed-resort district. The building is a matte-black pyramid, fitted with 4,407 rooms and 65,000 square feet of gaming space, all flourished with pop-Egyptian pastiche. Incoherent hieroglyphs plate the walls, plastic pharaohs stand guard in the check-in lane, and taxis idle under the haunches of a gargantuan Sphinx. I had arrived at the hotel on a balmy afternoon in early autumn and took the elevator to a third-floor suite on the southern face of the pyramid, desert sun pouring through the slanted floor-to-ceiling windows. The resort has long been known as one of the more budget-friendly options in Las Vegas, but it has never been cheaper than it is today. That’s because the Luxor, like so many other hotels in the city, is currently half off.\n\nIn September, the Luxor participated in the “Fabulous Five-Day Sale,” a massive weeklong initiative launched by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, offering cut-rate deals on restaurants, resorts, and shows across the city. The goal was to coax lapsed vacationers back to America’s sanctum of indulgence, greasing the wheels of a hospitality sector that’s struggled all year long. More to the point, it was a tacit admission that something in Las Vegas had gone awry. Significantly fewer visitors have come to the city in 2025 than they did in 2024, when Vegas hosted more than 41 million travelers, and it’s now facing the worst dip in traffic since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAgitators in the city have attempted to document the deterioration by posting ominous images of barren casinos, conjuring the perception of a place hollowed out by economic armageddon. The reality is more nuanced, but it is true that practically every conceivable indicator tracking tourism to Las Vegas is flashing warning signs. Hotel occupancy has cratered. Rooms were only 66.7 percent full in July, down by 16.8 percent from the previous year. The number of travelers passing through Harry Reid International Airport also declined by 4.5 percent in 2025 during an ongoing ebb of foreign tourists, for familiar reasons. Canadians, historically one of the city’s most reliable sources of degenerates, have effectively vanished. Ticket sales for Air Canada jets flying to Las Vegas have slipped by 33 percent, while the Edmonton-based low-cost carrier Flair has reported a 62 percent drop-off. Those last data points have provoked the city’s mayor, Shelley Berkley, to engage in some emergency diplomacy. In September, she implored our neighbors from the north to make their prodigal return to the Strip.\n\n“I’m telling everyone in Canada, please come,” she said. “We love you, we miss you, we need you.”\n\nWhere did everyone go? Nobody seems to know for sure. It’s clear that the city is in the midst of a rough season. What is more vexing is diagnosing what the issue actually is. Are there some obvious, observable problems to explain the swoon? To a certain extent, yes. Vegas has grown more expensive in recent years—hotels and restaurants have gotten pricier, gambling more extractive. But complaints about the cost of leisure have also hampered every other city in America. Tourism is down nationwide, even if destinations like New York City and Los Angeles haven’t suffered as much as Vegas. The terminal plunge of Canadian visitation, meanwhile, is almost certainly related to Donald Trump’s goading the nation at every opportunity. This trend is set to continue into 2026, with experts forecasting as much as a 6 percent drop in foreign visitation to the United States, curtailing tourism sectors all across the country.\n\nBut what’s ailing Vegas might be harder to quantify than any material factor—closer to spiritual rot than pure economic tumult. Multiple generations of Americans have been socialized to believe that a mecca of cheap, dirty pleasures awaits in the wastelands of southern Nevada. And for a long time, that was basically true. The mythology of Las Vegas is all-day buffet counters as big as football fields, of David Copperfield tickets that cost the same as a cup of coffee, of indoor cigarettes and comped drinks and the irresponsible ideas those forces can summon in tandem. Las Vegas took your money with gracious respect for your degeneracy, gouging you sweetly and slowly. The magnitude of excess saturated time itself. Somehow, no matter how much you lost at the casino—and you will lose at the casino—it always felt as if you got your money’s worth.\n\nThese days, though, that dream is in tatters. Millions of people seem to have determined that Las Vegas has become corroded—its joys less accessible, its humiliations too dire. And that is precisely why I, a longtime devotee of the city, found myself at the Luxor for a three-day stint in October. If Las Vegas was truly in decline, I wanted to see for myself what had gone so wrong. And boy did I.\n\nJohn and Kristina Mehaffey, the husband-and-wife duo who run the gambling news website Vegas Advantage, asked to meet me at Harrah’s, one of the chintzier casinos on the Strip, located just up the road from Madame Tussauds. Vegas Advantage is famous for its obsessively updated database, which tracks the city’s gambling landscape. If a game room has just installed a fresh band of blackjack felt, the Mehaffeys are the first to know. I reached out to them because I wanted a tour of the infamous triple-zero roulette wheels, which have become a symbol for latter-day Las Vegas hubris. These tables were unheard of in the city until 2016, when two of them made landfall in the bowels of the luxe Venetian. The game has since proliferated across the Strip, for one reason: Every time a player sits down for a few spins of triple zero, they’re getting ripped off.\n\nThe Mehaffeys escorted me past the blinking slot machines and into the pit, where we sidled up alongside a gaggle of players peering over the wheel—watching the silver ball zip along the rim. John explained the math: A standard roulette table has 36 numbers—half red, half black. Hit your number, and you’re paid 35 to 1; bet on a color, and you double your money. Quantitatively speaking, a roulette wheel fashioned this way would be totally fair. “Theoretically, over a million spins, you’d get 100 percent of your money back,” said John.\n\nWhere the house maintains its edge is in the two additional numbers foisted upon the roulette wheel, a single zero and a double zero, both painted green. With those digits in place, betting on red or black is no longer a 50/50 proposition, and if a player is lucky enough to score a win on a 7, or a 12, or a 28, they’re still making what they bet back by a multiplication of just 35—despite the fact that those green spaces allow for 38 potential outcomes. All this is to say that each zero added to a roulette table increases the revenue it scrapes from players by 2.7 percentage points. So, in a moment of incredible audacity, the power brokers of Las Vegas decided to sharpen their advantage, festooning a gauche and unsightly triple zero to their wheels, plundering our wallets more efficiently than ever before.\n\nWhy would anyone put up with those bad odds? That’s not quite the right question to ask. Later on in the day, I watched a bachelor party descend upon a triple-zero wheel, despite that, right next to them, bathed in fluorescent light, a double-zero table—encircled by empty seats—waited for customers. The serene, vodka-buzzed tourists either didn’t know or didn’t care that they were inches away from a much better deal. Vegas happily feasted upon that ambivalence all night long.\n\nVegas seems to have exported its triple-zero philosophy across the Strip. Another casualty is blackjack, which remains the most popular casino attraction in the city. Historically, the game has followed a golden rule. If you are dealt 21—an ace and a 10—you’ve hit blackjack, and your wager is paid out on a 3-to-2 ratio. (A $100 bet nets $150, and so on.) But Vegas has since altered the rules. Now, on most tables, blackjack is rewarded with a 6-to-5 equation; that same $100 kicks back only $120, significantly curtailing just how lucky someone is allowed to get. Again, it’s not hard to see why Vegas casinos made the change. “They’re tripling the house edge,” John told me. “It went up from about 0.66 percent to 2 percent.”\n\nEven if a gambler is willing to tolerate these perversions of tradition, the price of admission in Vegas has skyrocketed. According to John’s research, in 2020, 38 casinos in the greater Las Vegas gambling market featured tables dealing 3-to-2 blackjack capped at a $5 minimum bet. (As in, to play, you need to risk at least $5 per hand.) These days, that group has dropped to six casinos. Prowl through the Strip after dark, sift through the pits, and you’ll feel the difference. Most table games in 2025 force patrons to sacrifice painful amounts of cash to its maw—$25 minimums are basically standard. Fifty-dollar minimums aren’t uncommon either. Even more deviously, some Vegas properties force customers to pay a premium to access friendlier rules. I came across exactly one ultra-rare single-zero roulette wheel on the Strip, which felt a little bit like uncovering the hutch of the last surviving dodo. Naturally, it was stowed away in a high-limit room.\n\nJohn told me that Vegas initially ratcheted up its minimums during the pandemic in reaction to the crunch of COVID-era gambling. Social-distancing mandates limited the number of players that could gather at casino tables, so operators made up the difference in scale—squeezing more money out of the few gamblers risking infection to play. It is less clear why those juiced wagers stuck around once the coronavirus receded, outside of the obvious: Gamblers are willing to pay them.\n\nOliver Lovat, a real-estate consultant at the Denstone Group who serves as an adviser to several Vegas casino properties, said I needed to understand that cheaper games are no longer economically prudent in the city. Between inflation, upkeep, and labor costs—including a Nevada minimum wage that jumped to $12 last year—Lovat argued, the salad days of low-minimum blackjack have been legislated out of the fray. After all, it is telling that no matter how much Vegas tourism declines, the city’s gambling revenue continues to tick upward. In August, gaming revenue on the Strip increased by 5.5 percent. Downtown, it was by over 8 percent, and the Boulder Strip was up almost 10.\n\n“It’s not viable to run a $5 blackjack table anymore. You will lose money running $5 blackjack,” Lovat said. “Now, some places still have it. But they’re running it at a loss.”\n\nIt might seem wise to make room for smaller bankrolls in the city—the soul of Las Vegas is contingent on budget travelers—but those appeals are invariably ignored. Like so many other pleasures of modern life, Las Vegas is increasingly becoming a city financed by private equity. Harrah’s Entertainment, the gambling company that owned the casino where I met the Mehaffeys, was sold to a pair of equity sponsors in 2008 for $27.8 billion. One of those firms was Apollo Global Management, a New York–based real-estate holdings group that in 2022 made a play for the iconic Venetian hotel. That pattern has continued across the Strip. Blackstone, the commercial real-estate giant, entered sale-leaseback agreements for the Bellagio in 2019 and picked up the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay in the years afterward. Blackstone would later sell some of those investments to Vici Properties, a real-estate investment fund founded in 2017, which owns a total of 54 casinos. The mom-and-pops have been bought off, the copper wiring is stripped, and as so often is the case with Wall Street, that tends to be the plan all along.\n\n“The casinos on the Strip are no longer being driven by personalities at leadership. They’re being driven by corporate politics. So they have a different attitude about how you treat your consumers,” said Andrew Woods, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Why wouldn’t the resort industry find a way to maximize shareholder value by nickel-and-diming their consumers? Especially when, until very recently, those consumers haven’t pushed back.”\n\nHis point recalled a conversation I had with Jacob Orth, better known by his online moniker JacobslifeinVegas, who has been publishing YouTube videos about Las Vegas for the past 11 years. In earlier eras of his channel, Orth’s videos had a frothy self-help flair; he doled out advice on how to best enjoy some of the more revelrous temptations the city has to offer. (His best-performing upload is titled “5 Ways Las Vegas Prostitutes Scam You.”) Lately, though, Orth’s repertoire has grown increasingly despondent as he chronicles the sense of precipitous decline pervading the Strip. His second-most-popular video was published three months ago. The title: “Why Nobody Wants to Visit Las Vegas Right Now.”\n\nOrth told me a story that he thinks illustrates what has changed. Two years ago, he dumped a couple thousand dollars into a slot machine with the intention of losing his way into a free room. This is a classic Vegas ritual; there is a long history of casino managers giving away free meals, drinks, and lodging to whales willing to risk a tremendous amount of money on their property. The plan worked, and a few weeks later, Orth received a letter in the mail inviting him back to the casino with a complimentary suite. However, rather than the red-carpet treatment he expected—the licentious glamour of earlier epochs in the desert—Orth found the whole process oddly onerous. He ate a conspicuous “resort fee” on his room to the tune of $90. He was told if he made the booking over the phone, he would be charged $15 more. Early check-in, meanwhile, would cost another $60. When Orth finally got into the suite, he found the bathroom covered with questionable splotches. When he asked the front desk for a different room, the attendant inquired about his membership tier.\n\nAll told, the experience left Orth with a feeling shared by a lot of people who’ve traveled to Vegas lately. “Can I just get a clean room without having another fee thrown at me?” he said. “It’s like, ‘Do you guys even want me here?’ ”\n\nContrary to popular belief, the drop in tourism hasn’t rendered Las Vegas a ghost town. The internet billows with sobering images of derelict casinos and abandoned food halls, often emblazoned with apocalyptic all-caps exhortations of doom: “5 Reasons Why Las Vegas is DYING!” And, sure, if you squint, maybe the foot traffic at the Luxor looks a little soft on a Wednesday. But walking down the Strip, there’s no doubt that the social architecture of the city remains sturdy enough.\n\nOne morning, I passed into the gaudy marble corridors of Caesar’s Palace and mixed it up with some degenerate boomers, all ashing cigarettes, sipping martinis, and dumping payloads of cash into an array of slot machines before the clock even struck noon. I asked one woman, a Midwesterner with a clipped accent, if she had heard anything about a Vegas slump. “That’s the rumor,” she replied sarcastically, moments after the icons on her screen cascaded in glorious alignment, amounting to a sizable jackpot. If the city is in the midst of a protracted downfall, she’s yet to see it herself.\n\nIndeed, despite the troubling tourism metrics, Las Vegas is undeniably in a moment of big-ticket expansion. The city has added NFL and NHL teams over the past few years, and a baseball team is scheduled to move to town in 2028. The Sphere is a legitimate phenomenon, looming over the skyline with alien grandeur, hosting everyone from the Backstreet Boys to the Kamala Harris campaign. And later this month, the third annual Las Vegas Grand Prix will rumble down the Strip, further solidifying the city’s partnership with Formula One, an arrangement that was just renewed until 2027. All of these endeavors ought to provide fresh blood for the hospitality sector.\n\nSo who, exactly, is feeling the crunch? I get my answer when I bumped into Sarah, a 56-year-old selling timeshares and day-trips outside a CVS. She has been working this hustle for nearly three decades. This year has been her worst yet.\n\n“It used to be packed no matter what time it was,” she told me, gesturing to the concrete thoroughfares of the Strip’s southern reaches, which were thin with pedestrians. “Now you see these empty sidewalks.” Sarah makes the bulk of her money on commission, which has been difficult in the uncertainty gripping Las Vegas. (Over the summer, one of her most profitable shifts, a Friday afternoon, was contracted out of existence.) When I asked why Sarah thinks she’s reaching fewer customers, she actually pointed her finger toward the marquee additions to the Vegas cityscape. “They say the F1 race brings a lot of money here, but we don’t see it,” she said. “The people coming aren’t spending money in the hotels. They’re not walking the streets.”\n\nYou may find it difficult to summon a ton of empathy for timeshare hawkers, but traipsing through the malaise of modern Vegas, it’s clear that just about everyone in Sarah’s position is struggling. The basic theory goes something like this: With the city angling toward a more affluent market, the marginal titillations of Las Vegas are getting skipped over. At least, that’s the take of a listless showgirl, whose wreath of red peacock feathers exploded out of her leotard as we spoke. “Everyone is spending their money on other stuff,” she said. She typically charges customers $60 for a photo, and even with the Strip steadily growing more expensive—when a snapshot with a busker costs roughly the same as a burger and beer—her financial model has broken.\n\n“In six years of showgirling, this has been my worst summer,” said a different young woman, this one dressed in a purple leotard. “It feels like business is down 80 percent.”\n\nFarther down the Strip, I chatted with a convincing Captain America, whose chiseled jawline and sandy blond hair were betrayed only by his height, about 5-foot-10. He gave me the exact same complaints as the showgirls. “This is more of a job now than it used to be. When I wake up to go to work, it feels more like a grind,” said Cap, who was flanked by miscellaneous other cosplayers—a Transformer, a Stitch—all loitering by a carousel. They were here to feed off Venmo accounts belonging to the parents of enthralled children, and none of them seemed to be around at the moment.\n\n“It seems like international travelers are down. These hotels are charging $200 per night,” he added. “Tourists are just fed up.”\n\nIt went on like this. Those who subsist on the fringes of the Vegas tourism orbit are aware that they are in a funk but are nonetheless powerless to fix it. A silent Pennywise—holding a red balloon—wiggled one claw left to right, in a “so-so” motion, when I asked how business had been lately. A male model, shirtless, clenching his biceps in the Excalibur Hotel, had noticed a decrease in traffic to his show, Thunder Down Under, essentially an Australia-centric take on Chippendales. (He’d like to start booking more gigs out of state during the downturn.) I rode the escalator up to an anonymous resort restaurant, and the bartender assured me that while his job is safe, some of the more recent hires at the casino he works in have watched their shifts dwindle into nothing. “You used to be able to come to Las Vegas and spend 6 bucks on a steak this thick,” he said, pinching his fingers 3 inches wide. “That doesn’t happen anymore.” In a related matter, the mediocre fajitas I ordered cost $40.\n\nLater that day, I met a man named Mike, who has scratched out a living selling Cirque du Soleil tickets from a modest wooden stall underneath the colossal shadow of the Strip casinos. He estimated that his business dropped 50 percent this summer, and he had all the usual suspicions as to why. “I was just talking to some Texans—they told me they go to Oklahoma to gamble now,” Mike said. “There’s no resort fees. You can get a beer there for a couple bucks.”\n\nWith Las Vegas shedding its reputation for cheap thrills, I wonder what will become of him and all the others who, in previous incarnations of this city, existed in symbiosis with other budget travelers—the aunts and uncles, the grandmas and grandpas—who only ever wanted to spin the penny slots and pose with the girls.\n\nAt the midpoint of my most recent time in Vegas, I resolved to witness the foreclosure of the Las Vegas dream for myself. I ventured across the Strip from the Luxor to the MGM Grand, a casino streaked with dollar-bill-green neon in the vacant desert night. My goal was to retake the exact same steps that began my love affair with Las Vegas. It started a decade ago, when a long-defunct media company flew me into the valley to cover a computer game tournament. I checked into my room at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino—a resort famous for exhibiting a Union Jack minidress that had once belonged to Ginger Spice—and quickly realized that, outside of a couple of perfunctory interviews with catatonic teens, I didn’t have much to do with myself. Most gambling habits are incubated through a combination of aimless curiosity and dangerous opportunity, and this was no different. I took out $200 from the ATM, a not-insignificant amount of money for me at the time, and bellied up to the blackjack table.\n\nWhat followed would permanently alter my brain chemistry. These were the days of $5 minimums, which meant that my stack of chips would be bled away gracefully, deep into the chthonic night. Inconsequential wins and losses spread out for hours on end, my money gently oscillating with the tide. Cocktail waitresses bearing trayfuls of whiskey sodas materialized out of thin air, lubricating the vibes. The veterans coached me on the rudiments of the game; I learned how to split aces, I learned to never double down on 12. At one point, after hitting two blackjacks in a row, I savored the sublime act of playing with house money. The drinks kept coming, phone numbers were exchanged, inside jokes gained inebriated salience. There was talk of hailing a taxi to a strip club, or hitting the craps table, or buying a couple packs of Marlboro Reds, until finally, at around 3 a.m., I rode the elevator back up to my floor, 100 bucks richer. I don’t think I ever saw the light of day.\n\nIt should not surprise you that I eventually lost all that money. The following morning, I returned to the pits of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and reignited the ritual, without the same luck. I had scaled the mountaintop of profitability, but, like every other gambler I have ever known, I found that the desire to prolong the euphoria of the weekend had sealed my fate. After my final wager went bust, I pivoted to the bar—where, unfortunately, the drinks were no longer on the house. When I think back on those indelible first days in Vegas, it was not the thrill of victory that seduced me. What surprised me was how much I enjoyed giving in to my worst instincts. Those $200 in chips made the questions of financial responsibility that loomed over me in every other avenue of my life gloriously incorporeal. I was there for as long as the ride was going to take me.\n\nAnd so, upon entering the wide-open foyer of the MGM Grand, I once again retrieved $200 from the ATM, eating an $11 convenience fee in the process. I plopped down at a blackjack table brimming with other wayward souls and settled in for what I hoped would be a long night.\n\nThere was just one problem. This table, like every other I saw at the casino, required—you guessed it—a $25 minimum bet. Back in 2015, a $200 bankroll could be neatly divided into 40 different wagers. Now I was looking down at eight. Half an hour later, I held on 19, and the dealer turned over a 20. She swiped away my last chip from the felt. I hadn’t even had time to order a drink.\n\nAll at once, my fond memories of Las Vegas were permanently condemned to the past. It seemed like a betrayal to me, but funnily enough, none of the other tourists I spoke to around town appeared to feel the same way. Over and over again, I heard the exact same refrain from the visitors ambling around the Strip. To them, Vegas was the same city it’s always been, mostly because they had no reason to think otherwise.\n\nI can’t really blame them. The scam gains velocity—the numbers keep going up—but only the dedicated hustlers are capable of identifying the crime. Most people coming to the Strip aren’t going to be counting the number of zeros on a roulette wheel, and even if they did, it wouldn’t prevent them from sitting down for a few spins. That makes those objecting to the changing face of the city a dying breed. You need to be a true degenerate for Las Vegas to break your heart.\n\nThe following morning, on my last day in the city, I made a trip into the belly of the beast. Every October, the weeklong Global Gaming Expo takes up residence in the Venetian convention hall. It is, essentially, a showcase of the casino industry’s incredible scope and unlimited capital. Booths stretched out forever, all flush with the many component parts that add up to a successful gaming operation. One vendor touted a display of cushioned leather chairs manicured to fit the precise dimensions of a blackjack table; another presided over chunky green motherboards optimized to swindle cash more efficiently than previous generations of tech.\n\nThe glitziest exhibits belonged to the slot-machine manufacturers. They were the ones with the open bars, the gabbing salespeople, and the display of blinking cabinets set to free-play mode. Patrons pressed the buttons again and again, accumulating a pile of cash locked deep within the hardware. The player-friendly artifice that defines so much of Las Vegas was absent here. The business of gambling has only ever been about driving unfathomable capital. It was almost refreshing to be in a place where nobody was afraid to admit it.\n\nI wondered if the vendors had concerns about the Vegas tourism swoon. And, sure, some of them were ringing alarm bells. John Smallwood, the president of Travel Outlook—a company that fields customer phone calls to 300 hotels and casinos—told me that he has seen a startling 25 percent drop in call volume nationwide, a trend he lays at the feet of the president. “This administration has an arrogance about it,” Smallwood said. “And that offends people that aren’t from here.” Other businesspeople floated more-outlandish theories. Jon Friedberg, CEO of the tech company PokerAtlas, correlated the chilly tourism in the city with the rash of air-travel incidents that had colored the news at the beginning of 2025. But the most memorable conversation I had was with a man who works for a gambling company that told me that he was hard at work on software that would remove the last vestiges of friction stopping someone from dumping their hard-earned wages into his casinos. In the future, he says, you’ll be able to tap your phone on a slot machine to load it up with cash, in the same way you might buy a latte, eschewing the need for an ATM and keeping butts in seats for longer than ever before. “They see that slot machine, and they enter a hypnotic state,” he said of his target customer. “They’re willing to lose the $100 because it’s entertainment.”\n\nNaturally, the executive didn’t seem especially worried about the Strip’s visitation numbers. And, frankly, he probably shouldn’t be. Las Vegas, no matter what happens to it, will continue to make a lot of money. The city might be dying, but it will never be dead.\n\nI took the long walk back to the Luxor, prepared to make the most of the few hours I had afforded myself off the clock. There remains, even in this diminished state, a magic to Las Vegas, and I tried to attend to it the best way I could. In practice, that meant that I wove between the casinos—all with their doors swung wide open, prepared, on principle, to welcome absolutely anyone—taking sly little sips from a miniature bottle of Jack Daniel’s stuffed in my back pocket. Two hundred more dollars, this time retrieved from my own checking account rather than the travel budget, burned in my wallet. I hemmed and hawed all afternoon about my willingness to eat shit again, but when I arrived at the hotel, a sense of inevitability had settled in about how the night would unfold. I took my seat at the edge of a blackjack table—paying, you guessed it, 6-to-5—eager to see what kind of mess I would make.\n\nAfter a couple of lucky breaks, I found myself with a small profit. And even more surprisingly, I had the discipline to venture toward the payout window. The cashier counted out $160, enough to effectively erase the beating I had taken at the MGM Grand. But the spirit of degeneracy had firmly gripped me. The elevator back to my room might as well have been in the next state, and it felt great. So I chose a slot machine at random and fed it those crisp $20 bills. It had some sort of Arabian Nights theme—a magic lamp trembled with anticipation, a sultry genie, midriff exposed, danced across the screen. After I tapped the spin button on the console, the whole machine seemed to erupt. Incomprehensible icons locked into the columns, all bearing numbers that read unbelievably, impossibly high. When the dust settled, I had somehow scored $900. It was, by far, the best night I’ve ever had at a casino.\n\nI wish I could tell you I respected the improbability of the windfall by immediately retreating to my suite. But no, I churned through 100 more bucks—back at the blackjack table—before finally listening to my better angels. Back in my room, I lay in bed and splayed out the cash in my hand, sending a photo of the bounty to my wife, who was surely fast asleep. The horrible truth, for all of us gamblers, is that a delirious trip to Las Vegas is still possible. All of the disappointments dissipate with one lucky spin. I guess they’ve got me for life.","summary":"It defines the American experience like no other.
