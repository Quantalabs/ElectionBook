Good riddance!”\n\nO’Donnell also said that she wrote an apology to Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin for the interaction with Trump at the White House earlier this month when a reporter asked him about her move to his country: “Why in the world would you let Rosie O’Donnell move to Ireland? I think she is going to lower your happiness.”\n\nBefore Martin could reply, Trump said, “That’s true. I like that question. Do you know you have Rosie O’Donnell? Do you know who she is? You’re better off not knowing.”\n\nThe former co-host of “The View” also knocked Trump signing an executive order Thursday to shut down the Department of Education.\n\n“He disbanded the Department of Education, and I have a child who has autism and that child will be denied services and many, many autistic children because the funding for these programs for special needs children comes from the federal government as well as the states,” O’Donnell said. \n\nShe added that the closing of the department would “be disastrous for children on the spectrum,” calling it “terrifying.”\n\nIn response to a comment request from Fox News Digital about O’Donnell’s concerns, the White House highlighted a Friday post from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKennedy said his department “is fully prepared to take on the responsibility of supporting individuals with special needs and overseeing nutrition programs that were run by @usedgov. We are committed to ensuring every American has access to the resources they need to thrive. We will make the care of our most vulnerable citizens our highest national priority. Together, we will Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital in a statement, “President Trump is doing everything within his executive authority to dismantle the Department of Education and return education back to the states while safeguarding critical functions for students and families such as student loans, special needs programs, and nutrition programs. The President has always said Congress has a role to play in this effort, and we expect them to help the President deliver.” \n\nFox News Digital reached out to O’Donnell, but she declined further comment.","summary":"O'Donnell also knocked Trump signing an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/media/rosie-odonnell-questions-validity-of-trumps-2024-win-wants-elon-musk-investigated/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2019-file-photo-shows-rosie-101101930.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rSD5YWr3-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:59:11","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":304137442,"title":"Democratic U.S. senate hopeful says her party nixing Rogan interview is why people are ‘turning against’ it","text":"One of the Democratic Party’s up-and-comers is telling her colleagues what they can do to stem their bleeding support. Democratic Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow told Politico in a new interview this week that the party needs to occupy prominent cultural spaces like Joe Rogan’s podcast to reach voters. She noted that snubbing these opportunities because of political differences contributes to the impression that the party is \"elitist.\" \"Instead of snubbing your nose at those people, which is the perception that a lot of people have of Democrats, is that we’re elitist and we’re academic, and we look down on people who don’t watch traditional Hollywood movies or engage in mainstream media — that’s the perception, and that’s why people are turning against Democrats,\" McMorrow said. NEWSOM, PRITZER, BUTTIGIEG, AMONG THE DEMOCRATS MAKING EARLY 2028 MOVES Politico portrayed the \"Rising Democratic Star\" – who is reportedly prepping a run for U.S. Senate in Michigan in 2026 – as someone who can bring a fresh perspective to a Democratic Party that is struggling following its electoral defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump. The Democratic Party is currently suffering some of its worst polling in decades. According to national polls from CNN and NBC News published earlier this month, just 29% and 27% of respondents, respectively, say they view the party favorably. These represent the lowest approval numbers for the party surveyed by those outlets since the early '90s. McMorrow first gained notoriety in 2022 after a clip went viral of her impassioned rebuttal to a Republican colleague went viral on the floor of the Michigan State Senate after that colleague accused her of \"grooming and sexualizing children\" because of her opposition to a parental rights bill. One of the suggestions McMorrow gave was that the party needs to convey \"authenticity\" and do that by meeting people \"everywhere.\" MEDIA, DEMS CELEBRATE TESLA WOES AS ANGER OVER ELON MUSK'S ROLE IN TRUMP ADMIN CONTINUES \"Democrats have to start being unafraid to go everywhere and meeting people where they are,\" she said while mentioning \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" Former Vice President Kamala Harris famously missed an opportunity to go on Rogan’s show just before the election. The Harris team reportedly maintained that bad timing during the height of her campaign season sunk the interview, while Rogan has insisted he gave Harris ample opportunity to fit in a sit-down. Either way, McMorrow said not going on programs like Rogan contributes to the impression that the Democratic Party is above ordinary people who watch the popular podcast. \"You have to be willing to go into spaces that may feel a little bit uncomfortable, and be willing to have maybe three-hour long podcast conversations, or go into a dive bar or go into a bowling alley,\" she said. \"People have really good bull---- detectors. They can tell when you’re giving talking points and you’re trying to be buttoned up,\" she said. \"And this is a moment where I think people want to vote for people that they like and people that they trust, and they’re not going to like you or trust you if they don’t feel like they know who you are, and that’s much bigger than just your job or your title.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Democratic Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow said in a new interview that her party needs to occupy more popular cultural spaces so it doesn&apos;t come off as &quot;elitist.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-u-s-senate-hopeful-party-nixing-rogan-interview-people-turning-against","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/GettyImages-2166798144.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:00:53","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":304129078,"title":"President Trump makes surprising announcement regarding Travis Kelce and Kansas City Chiefs","text":"Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs did not win the 2025 Super Bowl but it appears they will still make an appearance at the White House after the President alleged he had invited the team.\n\nThe winner of the Super Bowl always receives an invite to the White House for the ceremonial event, although the Chiefs were not able to make it in 2020 due the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThey attended in 2023 and 2024 when President Joe Biden was in office. \n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl in February 2025, beating the Chiefs with a resounding 40-22 victory.\n\n\"I look forward to having the Eagles,” he told founder of the sports website Outkick, Clay Travis, adding: \"And one other thing, we’re going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that, because they missed their turn because of COVID.\"\n\nHe did not say what date the team had been invited to attend, and the Chiefs have not yet commented.\n\nDespite rumors that the Eagles had turned down an invite from the President, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed their upcoming visit earlier in March.\n\n\"April 28, I can confirm that the Philadelphia Eagles will be here at the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory,\" she told press.\n\n\"I know there was a lot of fake news about an invitation that wasn’t sent or was sent.

The poll surveyed 2,640 respondents, with Democrats Kamala Harris and Katie Porter securing 20% and 25%, respectively.

The actor, who lost his home in the 2022 Palisades Fire, highlighted California’s high taxes and lack of accountability. He accused leaders of negligence, citing insufficient wildfire preparedness and insurance companies dropping coverage for residents. Gibson also lamented the decline of Hollywood’s film industry, once a cornerstone of the state’s economy, now diminished by outsourcing and regulatory challenges.

Nor is it to maintain that such ideologies cannot generate authoritarian counter-ideologies that can become influential and dominant.\n\nEven in the 1930s, fascism remained a subterranean political movement in those Western countries (America, Britain, and France) in which liberal democracy had become the prevailing political ideology in the 19th century and after World War I.\n\nGermany and Italy were exceptions – nation states that were formed in authoritarian fashion in the latter half of the 19th century – in which liberal democracy had failed to prevail as it had elsewhere in the West.\n\nTrump is not a fascist because, unlike fascism, ‘Trumpism’ does not constitute a coherent ideology. In fact, there is a sense in which Trump is not really an ideological politician at all.\n\nThe contrast with fascism is stark.\n\nNational Socialism was a political movement that was based upon a coherent ideology – an amalgam of Volkish racial anti-Semitism and the 19th century liberal ideology of eugenics. Hitler sought to bring about revolutionary social and political change in Europe – and beyond – by biological means and military aggression.\n\nTrump is quite incapable of formulating such a program – and, even if he did, it would hold little appeal for the American electorate. Nor is Trumpism an aggressive expansionist ideology in terms of foreign policy, let alone a genuinely revolutionary one.\n\nIt is, therefore, patently absurd for liberal democratic politicians and their sycophantic allies in the Western media to continue to brand Trump as a fascist.\n\nSuch a false categorization of Trump reveals the fundamentally ahistorical mentality of Trump’s critics, and – more importantly – their intrinsic inability to engage in any kind of meaningful critique of the expansion of American global hegemony since 1945 and its corrupting consequences internally in America.\n\nIn this regard, Trump’s critics lack the integrity and insight of principled 1960s American critics of the expanding American Empire – such as Barrington Moore Jr, William Appleman Williams, and Gore Vidal – as well as like-minded contemporary American critics like John Mearsheimer and Jeffrey Sachs.\n\nThis brings us back to Trump and his foreign policy.\n\nUnlike his neocon predecessors (both Democrat and Republican alike, and it should not be forgotten that the neocon movement started within Jimmy Carter’s Democratic Party, not with George W. Bush) Trump is an isolationist – isolationism being an extremely strong trend in American politics for over 250 years.\n\nThe American founding fathers wisely warned against America becoming involved in “foreign entanglements” – because they had firsthand experience of how the British Empire had oppressed its colonial subjects.\n\nThey also understood how empire had corrupted and debauched internal British politics. Washington, Adams, and Jefferson all feared the consequences for the new American republic if, mutatis mutandis – in Edmund Burke’s telling phrase – “the breakers of the law in India became the makers of the law in England.”\n\nWoodrow Wilson won a presidential election in 1916 as the politician “who had kept America out of the war.” He entered the war only after the German submarine campaign continued to sink American ships, and in order to save the West from the spectre of communism after the Russian Revolution in 1917.\n\nThe isolationist American Senate, however, subsequently refused to endorse Wilson’s internationalism, and vetoed America joining the League of Nations.\n\nLikewise, Franklin D. Roosevelt only entered World War II after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 – more than two years after the war had commenced.\n\nUnfortunately, all post-war American presidents – until Trump – cast aside isolationism and firmly committed America to the global expansion of its empire. And, from the Carter regime onward, neocons have framed America’s expansionist and aggressive foreign policy.\n\nThus the Cold War, misguided wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and the America-driven and disastrously provocative expansion of NATO over the past 30 years.\n\nTrump’s foreign policy stance constitutes a decisive break with the past.\n\nTrump’s isolationism is evident in his firm determination to end the Ukraine conflict. He has also taken initial steps to end the reactionary Netanyahu regime’s brutal colonial oppression of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Whether this will succeed is, however, not yet clear.\n\nAnd whether Trump’s isolationism extends to cutting deals with Iran and China is, at this stage, very much an open question.\n\nWhat then of Trump’s domestic policies? Here Trump’s authoritarian and anti-liberal democratic tendencies are already apparent.\n\nTrump is determined to reshape the Judiciary, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and any other domestic institution that does not cravenly support his domestic agenda. This should come as no surprise – Trump has always been openly contemptuous of liberal democracy, the Constitution, and the rule of law.\n\nTrump has also moved very swiftly to dismantle authoritarian woke ideologies and their insidious consequences. He has also taken steps to put an end to the disastrous open borders immigration policy promoted and facilitated by Obama and Biden.\n\nWhether Trump will succeed in successfully implementing his domestic agenda is not yet clear. Constitutional challenges to some of his executive orders are already before the courts, and more can be expected.\n\nThis week Trump called for the impeachment of those “crooked judges” who have ruled against some of his executive orders – provoking an unprecedented public rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIt is thus already clear that Trump’s attempts to disregard the Constitution will lead to a serious constitutional crisis and an accompanying intensification of political conflict over the next four years.\n\nHow resilient liberal democratic institutions will prove to be under the Trump onslaught is difficult to predict – bearing in mind that many of these bodies have become weakened and corrupted under previous Democratic administrations.\n\nOne thing is clear however – the shattered Democrats are at present unable to mount any effective political resistance to Trump’s domestic or foreign policy programs. Not for nothing did Trump contemptuously taunt ‘Pocahontas’ Elizabeth Warren during his recent speech to Congress.\n\nKamala Harris has disappeared from sight, and the ultra woke Gavin Newsom recently recanted on his previous championing of transgender athletes in women’s sport. This, however, hardly constitutes a viable alternative political program to Trumpism.\n\nThe Democrats’ dilemma was highlighted recently when they criticized Trump for diminishing free speech in America by shutting down America’s propaganda agency, USAGM. These, however, are the same Democrats that have for decades championed an authoritarian ‘cancel culture’ that has diminished free speech and destroyed the careers of anyone courageous enough to oppose the Democrats’ woke ideologies.\n\nEven more troubling for the Democrats is the fact that the American elites that once supported them are now changing political tack, and falling in behind the Trump regime – just as the liberal 19th century French elites made their peace with Louis Napoleon’s authoritarian regime. It should not be forgotten that Elon Musk and Robert Kennedy Jr. were once fervent Democrats who denounced Trump as a fascist.\n\nHow then are we to properly categorize Trump as a politician?\n\nHe is, of course, sui generis. Trump is first of all a modern celebrity politician – among whose ranks the inept Vladimir Zelensky must also be numbered. He is also a populist who captured the Republican Party after realizing (as previous third-party candidates had not) that capturing a major party was the only way that a third-party politician could ever become president.\n\nTrump is thus a new kind of politician – a modern celebrity populist.\n\nHis predecessors include William Jennings Bryan and George Wallace, and he shares with them their ‘common man’ rhetoric, anti-intellectualism, contempt for liberal democracy and traditional conservatism, as well as their program of demonizing the East Coast and Washington elites. And, like his populist predecessors, Trump promises to miraculously revive a weakened and corrupt America.\n\nTrump also has a great deal in common with Louis Napoleon. Elected president of the new French Republic in 1848, Louis Napoleon – being constitutionally barred from a second term as president – mounted a coup in 1851, dismissed parliament, and declared himself emperor. He ruled France in authoritarian and repressive fashion for the next 20 years – until military defeat in the Franco Prussian War led to the collapse of his regime.\n\nTrump is also constitutionally barred from running for the presidency in 2028, and he may well attempt to overturn this legal impediment to a third term. In February 2025, he posted an image of himself wearing a crown with the caption “Long Live the King.”\n\nBut Trump’s modernity and the fundamentally changed nature of politics in America over recent decades render such historical comparisons otiose and misleading.\n\nTrump became president in a decadent American society dominated by a mindless celebrity culture – in which there was no longer an educated elite or an educated public; in which liberal values and basic notions of decency had collapsed completely; and in which politics had descended into complete irrationality and become an unedifying and brutal spectacle akin to a celebrity-based television show.\n\nThese fundamental changes long predated Trump’s entry into politics, and without them he could not possibly have become president. Only in an America that had degenerated to this extent could populism in its new Trumpian form become a dominant political force.\n\nLukacs in the work cited above predicted that the expansion of the American Empire would result in internal cultural decadence and the corruption of American politics.\n\nLukacs highlighted various aspects of this, including a rise in juvenile delinquency – not for a moment imaging the school shootings that are now a regular occurrence in America. Nor could he possibly have imagined the degenerate nature of a popular culture that feted a ‘celebrity’ like Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and continues to exploit his celebrity status as it belatedly seeks to destroy him.\n\nDonald Trump is not a fascist.\n\nHe is a modern celebrity populist whose election as president is a symptom of the irreversible decadence and decline of contemporary American politics and American society more generally.\n\nSocial democratic critics of Trump, however, cannot accept this categorization of Trump because it entails admitting that American society has degenerated culturally and politically in recent decades – a state of affairs for which they themselves are primarily responsible.\n\nFar easier to simply brand Trump a fascist, and ignore America’s ongoing decadence and decline.","summary":"It’s much easier to invoke inept comparisons than to analyze and combat the systemic decadence and decline of America \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/614751-donald-trump-not-fascist/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67e2cbca85f5404f553e0f35.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 21:11:40","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.044},{"id":304114754,"title":"Did Jeff Bezos criticize Washington Post’s employees?

Jasmine Crockett?","text":"Being a Black woman in politics comes with a unique set of challenges. There’s the burden of being the “first” in any role and the heightened scrutiny that often comes with it. The treatment of Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas serves as a prime example of this.\n\nShe made headlines in May 2024 when she prompted backlash from the right after calling GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia “bleach blonde, bad built, butch body” in response to Greene’s own comments about Crockett’s appearance. \n\nNow, Crockett has seemingly offended the right by allegedly harming Tesla’s reputation by engaging with a group of protesters planning a peaceful picket outside several dealerships nationwide. Crockett, who did not organize nor attend the protest, merely interacted with the protesters, making her a prime target for right-wing outrage.\n\nInitial opposition came from Greene—still seemingly nursing a grudge over Crockett’s previous insult—and far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who is never one to miss a chance to tout her racist bonafides. \n\nIn a barrage of social media posts, the two women falsely accused Crockett of enabling “terrorism.” Greene even went as far as calling for the FBI to investigate Crockett, despite there being no evidence of any wrongdoing on her part.\n\nThen, Attorney General Pam Bondi quickly escalated the situation, warning Crockett to “tread very carefully” and demanding that she apologize to Tesla shareholders. Bondi even echoed Greene’s calls for Crockett to be censured.\n\n“She needs to unequivocally denounce the violence,” Bondi said on Fox News on Monday. “[Crockett] must apologize immediately, not only to all Texans but to our country, to the American shareholders of Tesla, because she is promoting violence.”\n\nSadly, Crockett isn’t the first Black woman to face this kind of vitriol from the right. \n\nJust look at former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was viciously attacked after former President Joe Biden announced that he ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris to take his place. In not-so-subtle digs, Republicans like President Donald Trump, accused Harris of being a “DEI” hire and tried to tie her rise to the top of the ticket to former President Barack Obama. \n\nAs absurd as these arguments might sound, they resonate among the right because they aim to diminish the accomplishments of Black people—especially Black women—who many Republicans don’t want in politics.\n\nAnd under Trump, who has a well-documented history of racism, it’s hardly surprising that the White House wouldn’t defend Crockett but double down, continuing to attack her for something she never even did. \n\nWhat’s more, the Trump administration also promoted clips unrelated to the Tesla protests, accusing her of inciting violence in a transparent attempt to paint her as uncontrollable and radical. \n\n“Here’s another unhinged Democrat inciting violence. Crockett says you should ‘punch’ your opponents,” Trump’s rapid response team posted on X on Monday. \n\nThese comments were, of course, taken out of context. During the interview, Crockett was asked how Democrats can win more races, and she responded by saying that they need to be more aggressive rather than submitting to Republicans and Trump.\n\nAfter Crockett’s comments, a Fox News article labeled her as “far-left” and included a slew of statements from conservatives attacking her.\n\nAll of this is just a brouhaha aimed at punishing Crockett for something she didn’t do—namely, the violence against Tesla, for which Republicans have somehow decided she’s responsible.\n\nWhat all of these attacks against Crockett neglect to mention, of course, is the role that Tesla CEO Elon Musk plays in dragging down his own company.\n\nInstead of holding Musk—whose own reckless actions and leadership have already harmed Tesla—accountable, the right has decided that Crockett, a Black woman, is the easier target. \n\nLet’s be clear: Any outrage directed at Tesla is a direct result of frustration with Musk, who, in his new role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has launched a relentless attack on federal agencies that millions of people depend on, all under the guise of “efficiency.” \n\nBefore Crockett even spoke out, Tesla’s stock was falling, and its European sales were plummeting. The company’s real issue is Musk himself, but it’s more convenient for Republicans to scapegoat Crockett.\n\nShould the vandalism of Tesla vehicles continue, Republicans are likely to take the opportunity to censure Crockett, just as they did with fellow Texas Democrat, Rep. Al Green. \n\nDespite widespread dissatisfaction with Musk, the right continues to avoid holding him accountable. Instead, the default reaction is to blame a Black woman—because that’s an easier story to sell.","summary":"Being a Black woman in politics comes with a unique set of challenges.

Though the agency is prohibited from censorship or infringing the First Amendment rights of media, broadcasters cannot intentionally distort the news.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said separately there was no basis to investigate, Reuters reported. “To conduct an investigation into news distortion without a shred of evidence appears intended to harass CBS and chill those putting forth disfavored viewpoints,” the group said.\n\nUnder Carr, the FCC reinstated complaints about the “60 Minutes” interview with Harris, as well as complaints about how Disney’s ABC News moderated the pre-election TV debate between then-President Joe Biden and Trump. It also reinstated complaints against Comcast’s NBC for allowing Harris to appear on “Saturday Night Live” just ahead of the election. \n\nCarr’s predecessor, Jessica Rosenworcel, had initially rejected those complaints in January.","summary":"\"We're not close in my view to the position of dismissing that complaint at this point,\" FCC chair Brendan Carr said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/media/fcc-rejects-cbs-bid-to-dismiss-complaint-over-60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/vice-president-kamala-harris-says-101093447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 19:30:31","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":304091678,"title":"Nevada Investigates Hundreds of Potential ‘Double Vote’ Cases in 2024 Election","text":"State elections officials received at least 303 complaints about individuals trying to vote twice in the November election, the report found. Each individual who allegedly attempted to vote twice in the election was caught before they cast their second vote.\n\nFive of the cases have been closed, including one that was referred to an unspecified “outside agency,” and the four remaining cases were marked as “civil notice/no violation,” the office said in the March 21 report. The remaining possible cases, 298, are still marked as “open” in the report.\n\nThe 303 potential cases represent about 0.02 percent of the ballots cast in the Silver State during last year’s General Election, the office said.\n\n“The Secretary of State’s Office takes every allegation of election integrity violations very seriously and investigates them to the full extent of the law,” the report said.\n\nThe office is now working “very closely with the Attorney General’s Office through the investigative process,” the report added. “Once a determination is made regarding the validity of any allegations, a report is prepared and cases are referred to outside investigatory agencies, including the Attorney General’s Office and county District Attorney offices.”\n\nIn the report, officials provided examples of double-vote complaints and investigations.\n\n“A father and son with the same name who live in the same household both receive a ballot. The son votes in-person. The father mistakenly ﬁlls out his son’s ballot and mails it to his County Clerk or Registrar’s Office,” it said, adding that the registrar or clerk may detect a double vote for the son but doesn’t count the second ballot that was cast.\n\nAn investigation is then launched, and the secretary’s office sends a Civil Letter Notice to the father.\n\n“The letter details the situation and outcome of the investigation, with a warning that attempting to vote twice is illegal, however, no intent was found and no further action will be taken unless more information is revealed. All civil notices are tracked by our office to monitor potential future irregularities,” the report said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the example is based on a real-world incident or was one of the cases that were investigated during the 2024 election.\n\nThen-presidential candidate Donald Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in Nevada by about 46,000 votes, enough to secure the state and its six electoral votes. Trump also won every other speculated battleground state during that contest.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have said they want to bolster election security, including voter ID laws; ensure more secure vote-by-mail procedures, including using paper ballots; and maintain more accurate voter rolls. Since 2020’s contest against Democrat Joe Biden, Trump has said he believes that the election was fraught with fraud that ultimately caused the election to be called in favor of his opponent.","summary":"The secretary of state's office recently released a report confirming the investigations.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nevada-investigates-hundreds-of-potential-double-vote-cases-in-2024-election-5831100","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/06/id5755205-36482-LasVegas-Nevada-Jacob-Kepler-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 19:29:09","author":"Jack Phillips","authors":["Jack Phillips"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":304079094,"title":"Podcasting was once a rebel medium for diverse voices. Now it’s slowly being consumed by big media","text":"Podcasting was once the underdog of the media world: a platform where anyone with a microphone and an idea could share their voice. \n\nWith low barriers to entry and freedom from institutional gatekeeping, it promised to amplify marginalised voices and allow underrepresented groups to tell their own stories, on their own terms.\n\nToday, however, this promise seems increasingly strained as corporate interests tighten their grip on the industry. As money flows in, the podcasting space is beginning to resemble the rest of the digital media world – driven by advertising revenues and political polarisation. \n\nThe promise of podcasting\n\nSix years ago, audio scholars Martin Spinelli and Lance Dann described podcasting as a “revolutionary” medium for its ability to inspire empathy through innovative forms of audio.\n\nPodcasting was heralded as a format that broke through the barriers of traditional media by offering new ways to engage with underrepresented voices and ideas. Media and cultural studies pointed to the direct-to-ear delivery – free from the biases of visual culture – as a uniquely intimate way to consume content.\n\nGlobally, the industry boomed as a result of pandemic lockdowns, with the number of podcasts on Spotify skyrocketing from 450,000 in 2019, to 1.5 million in 2020.\n\nListenership has also surged in Australia. According to a 2024 report by Edison Research, we’ve seen a 20% increase in listenership from 2022 to 2024 – with 48% of the those aged 12 and above having listened to a podcast within the past month.\n\nFrom open space to rat race\n\nIn his 2024 book Podcasting in a Platform Age, podcast researcher John Sullivan warns the podcasting space is being increasingly dominated by a handful of powerful media companies that dictate what and who gets visibility. \n\nLarger podcasts with higher production budgets, celebrity hosts and backing from major networks are attracting larger audiences, with independent creators struggling to get a foot in the door. \n\nAt the time of writing, of the top 50 most popular podcasts in Australia, more than half (52%) come from overseas, and primarily the United States.\n\nOf the 24 Australian-made podcasts on the list, 80% are backed by a media organisation, with most (64%) connected to major networks such as LiSTNR, which is owned by Southern Cross Austereo. Only 12% of the Australian podcasts on the list come from truly independent creators without any corporate funding or major production support.\n\nWhy does it matter that large-network ownership is on the rise? To understand this, it helps to first understand how ads keep podcast networks in business – and how this can impact content decisions. \n\nDeepening ideological divides\n\nAdvertisers follow the crowds. In a podcasting context, this means they’re more likely to funnel their dollars into large networks, further bolstering their resources.\n\nAt the same time, networks want to drive as many ears to their ad sponsors as possible. To do this, they focus on producing content they know will get the most engagement. \n\nThe result is a vicious cycle in which attention and advertising power feed each other, making it even harder for independent voices to break through. Over time, this feedback loop can lead to less content diversity and more polarisation. \n\nIt’s here that we’re seeing an increase of politicians using podcasts to push their views and cultivate ideological loyalty. \n\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 US election, Kamala Harris appeared on Call Her Daddy (the second most popular Spotify podcast in 2024), while Donald Trump was on The Joe Rogan Experience (the most popular). Both interviews were later fact-checked and found to contain false or misleading claims. \n\nTrump’s interview in particular was flagged by CNN for having 32 false claims. Nonetheless, analysts and researchers pointed to it as a driver behind his success with young male voters.\n\nThe political podcasting trend is also playing out in Australia ahead of the next federal election.\n\nLate last year, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton appeared on the podcast Diving Deep With Sam Fricker. This was followed by an appearance on Straight Talk, hosted by businessman Mark Bouris, in January.\n\nMore recently, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Greens leader Adam Bandt separately appeared on It’s A Lot with Abbie Chatfield.\n\n Read more:\n Misinformation is rife and causing deeper polarisation – here's how social media users can help curb it\n\nDiversity in the podcasting space\n\nAccording to 2022 Pew Research Centre data, 55% of Americans said their major reason for listening to podcasts was “to learn”, while 29% said they wanted to stay up-to-date with current affairs. But information-hungry listeners may be getting shortchanged, as podcasts are less likely to be fact-checked against the same editorial standards that govern traditional media. \n\nAs platform researcher Michael Bossetta notes, although large platforms such as Spotify have the potential to create a more informed world, they\nare more likely to push content that keeps users hooked (that is, content they already enjoy and/or agree with). \n\nRecommender algorithms also have a role to play. One 2020 study found that while Spotify’s personalised suggestions increased user engagement by 28.90%, they also reduced the individual-level diversity of podcast streams by 11.51%.\n\nBut platforms do have the power to do better. They could, for instance, use their algorithms to prioritise content diversity. This would help ease the “engagement-diversity trade-off”, in which personalisation increases engagement, but limits the diversity of content consumed by an individual. \n\nThat said, it’s unlikely platforms will voluntarily change the way they operate. If meaningful reforms are to happen, they will more likely have to come from government regulations or through independent governing bodies. \n\nIn the meantime, listeners aren’t powerless. While we can’t stop algorithms from pushing certain content to the top of our feeds, we can disrupt them by actively seeking out independent voices and diverse stories.","summary":"Of the top 50 most popular Spotify podcasts in Australia today, more than half come from overseas – and primarily the United States.","url":"https://theconversation.com/podcasting-was-once-a-rebel-medium-for-diverse-voices-now-its-slowly-being-consumed-by-big-media-252169","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/657364/original/file-20250324-56-u58207.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=57%2C494%2C6354%2C3177&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 19:14:23","author":"Corey Martin,Lecturer/Podcast Producer,Swinburne University of Technology","authors":["Corey Martin","Lecturer/Podcast Producer","Swinburne University of Technology"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":304072834,"title":"Here’s How the First Measles Case Got to D.C.","text":"George Clooney has said on screen romance is dead for him because, at 63, he can’t compete with younger leading men.

The real shocker? It wasn’t President Donald J. Trump, notorious “Insulter-in-Chief.” \n\nIn fact, Trump was off spending his day hosting a bunch of cute school kids, relishing again in his newfound role as “grandfather-in-chief.”\n\nNo, the mic-dropping, jaw-dropping smackdown of the former vice president came from current Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nVance was speaking Thursday morning on “Vince,” the new Rumble podcast hosted by Vince Coglianese that replaced Dan Bongino’s show starting Monday.\n\nCoglianese asked Vance “How are you doing the job differently than Harris did it?”\n\n“Well,” replied Vance, “I don’t have four shots of Vodka before every meeting.”\n\nC’mon, he didn’t really say that, did he? Yup. Listen for yourself:\n\nHysterically funny? Wildly inappropriate? A clever way for the likely 2028 GOP candidate to keep the highest polling Democrat for 2028 pinned to the mat? That’s for another time.\n\nWhat’s interesting is the juxtaposition between Vance’s TKO of Harris and Trump’s XOXOs with school children when signing the executive order dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nWhat an adorable scene: The very large president squeezed behind a small desk, signing the EO, surrounded by kids in school desks signing their own versions of the order.\n\nThis came just days after the adorable scene of Elon Musk’s son Lil X trotting with Trump to Marine One.\n\nIt happens a couple of weeks after the cute … if less-than-sanitary … appearance of Lil X in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd it also happened less than a month after the powerful scene of Trump signing the executive order keeping males out of women’s sports, surrounded by young girls and young women. The president looks to be protecting the girls who could be his granddaughters.\n\nNot incidentally, this is just weeks after the vice president forcefully interjected himself into the White House meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, smacking the Ukrainian in front of the entire world for being disrespectful to the President.\n\nAm I suggesting the White House is creating a good cop, bad cop strategy with Trump and Vance? No, of course not. You could no more remove from Trump the “mouthy construction guy from Queens” than you could remove the hair gel from Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn fact, here’s a quick look at Trump’s Truth Social account from Friday.\n\nHe went off on the “sick terrorist thugs” attacking Tesla, suggesting they could serve their 20-year prison sentences “in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!”\n\nHe called veteran New York Times columnist Maggie Haberman “Maggot Hagerman, the really dumb ‘scammer’ who constantly writes about me for the Times, using anonymous, made up (nonexistent!) sources, and who … is a big part of the Scam.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg? He’s “a local, unknown Judge, a Grandstander, looking for publicity, and it cannot be for any other reason, because his ‘Rulings’ are so ridiculous, and inept.”\n\nYes, the Orange Man of the “Mean Tweets” is still around. More subtle, but still around.\n\nHowever, two things are clear.\n\nFirst, the White House this time around is working hard to show off the warm, funny, gracious grandfatherly side to Trump that those who meet and know him have long insisted was there. They are demonstrating the real person that both the legacy media and social media refused to show in his first term. And now that what was formerly Twitter has been liberated by Lil’ X’s daddy, those special, personal, humanizing Trump moments are being seen and spread, or in the case of the photo of Trump and Lil’ X at Marine One, cooed over.\n\nSecond, Trump 47 has a wingman in Vance ready at a moment’s notice to jump into the dogfight with guns a’blazing. He now has someone willing to draw heat away from the president, to attack his foes, to help remove the pressure on Trump to smack back at every slight, to give the chief executive more breathing room to do the actual job he’s been elected to do.\n\nAnd as Vance showed Tuesday, he can share the burden of being the Chief Smart-Aleck.\n\nThis one-two punch serves several purposes: First, it neutralizes the Saul Alinsky “Rules for Radicals” strategy of isolating and demonizing an enemy that was used so effectively by the Left in Trump’s first term. (A strategy, not incidentally, now being used against Elon Musk.)Second, it creates a far less toxic atmosphere around the White House than in Trump’s first term. It’s harder to throw obnoxious questions at the president—and for Trump to respond with serious bite—when there’s a little tot tugging his sleeve or school kids at his side. It’s also a lot riskier in other settings—whether you are a snotty reporter or petulant foreign leader—when you know J.D. Vance is ready, willing and definitely able to jump in and double-team you.\n\nA more genial Trump and more civil Oval Office is better for everyone.","summary":"Somebody in the White House leveled Kamala Harris Thursday with a line that would have made Don Rickles blush.

People Are Finally Listening.","text":"As he waited in the shadow of a parking garage in Tempe, Arizona, to hear Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speak last Thursday evening, John Ward, a longtime Democrat from the deep-red retirement community of Sun City West, told me he “probably” hadn’t voted for the Independent Vermont senator in the past, but it felt like Sanders had become a party leader by default. \n\n“I mean, Kamala [Harris’] not talking, Barack [Obama]’s not talking, [Joe] Biden’s not talking,” he said. “Right now, he’s the only one talking, and he’s the only one making sense.”\n\nWard arrived hours early to catch Sanders at the latest stop on his Fighting Oligarchy tour, but already, the line snaked around the block to get into the hockey arena on the campus of Arizona State University. The rallies, which Sanders began organizing in February to apply pressure to Republican lawmakers in their home districts, have been growing and growing. According to organizers, nearly 87,000 people attended five events last week—a stunning showing 20 months away from the midterm elections. Before an event at a high school football stadium in Tucson on Saturday—where people started arriving at 6 a.m. for an 11:30 start—I met a high school student who had persuaded her grandmother to come with her all the way from Redlands, California. It had taken them half a day, stopping every three hours to recharge their car. (No, they clarified, it was not that kind of electric car.) \n\nThe Fighting Oligarchy tour is drawing larger crowds than the Sanders presidential campaign ever did, but it’s also drawing a different sort of crowd. Although there were still more “Feel the Bern” T-shirts than you could count, at two stops in Arizona last week, most of the people I talked to were, like Ward, not longtime supporters. A significant number had not attended a political event or a protest before. Many of these voters found Sanders’ long-running message of a growing oligarchy newly resonant at a time when the richest man in the world has been given carte blanche to dismantle public institutions. Above all, they showed up because they wanted to hear elected officials express the sort of frustration and rage Democratic voters have been feeling for months. They wanted to be where the fight was. Sanders’ rallies offer both a lifeline and a warning to a party that hasn’t yet found its footing: Start going after President Donald Trump—or voters might start going after you, too.\n\nYou couldn’t go far at these rallies without running into someone who was dealing firsthand with the fallout from Trump and Elon Musk’s attack on the federal bureaucracy. The first person I talked to before Thursday’s rally in Tempe told me that he was moving back to Puerto Rico after being fired from the IRS. In Tucson on Saturday, I met an educator from a border community whose special education programming was getting wiped out due to cuts at the Department of Education. Sitting in the top row of bleachers at the event, a woman from Nogales whose company buys produce from Mexico spent five minutes patiently explaining the process of importing fruit and how the impending tariffs will force distributors to shut down.\n\nFor seniors, Social Security was top of mind. When I talked to Lisa Melton outside the arena in Tempe, she said she was now planning to tap into the program a year early and taking an annual $2,000 hit because she didn’t trust what the Trump administration was going to do to it. I don’t know if that’s a sound strategy; I do know that she was terrified.\n\n“I tried to sign up for Social Security about a month ago,” said Therese Wagner, a bit further up the line. “I got in and then got error messages and I thought, Elon Musk is fucking with our Social Security already.”\n\nWagner eventually managed to apply, but rallygoers feared that things were only going to get worse. A retired bus driver named Kevin James volunteered that he’d recently gotten so upset after trying to talk to a human at the Social Security Administration that he called the White House right after.\n\n“I politely said, ‘I would like to express concern and displeasure,’” he said. “Click.”\n\nThese people are as furious at Republicans right now, as you might expect. Musk would probably find a warmer reception on Mars. But what separates the energy of the Sanders-led Fighting Oligarchy tour from the 2017-era Resistance is that a lot of the anger is trained at their own party. Democratic voters’ approval of congressional Democrats has fallen 35 points since last year, according to a recent survey, and rallygoers at the two Arizona stops took aim at what they perceived as a toothless approach to the new administration.\n\nAs she waited in the stands in Tucson on Saturday morning, Samantha Schrieber offered a characteristic response when I asked about what Democratic leaders have been doing.\n\n“They’ve been doing something? What have they been doing?” she said. Then she laughed. “They haven’t been doing shit.”\n\nAttendees at the Arizona rallies were the focus group of Sen. Chuck Schumer’s nightmares. They talked about “backbone” about as often as they talked about “fascism.” The strategy seemed to be to “play dead and just wait for everyone to vote for them,” one young voter complained. The Senate minority leader was “bringing a pillow to a gunfight,” said a cannabis worker. Watching the party fold over the federal budget was “incapacitating,” said a disabled veteran, who said he was thinking of running for office now himself. A woman who had just protested outside her Republican congressman’s office told me simply: “We have to take matters into our own hands, because the people who should be fighting for us aren’t.”\n\nTo a lot of the people I spoke with, too many Democrats were still searching for comity in a political climate that had moved beyond it.\n\n“Democrats kind of lean on, like, a ‘they’re not all bad, we can all get along’ kind of thing,” said Adonis Gonzalez, who was selling “Deport Elon” and “Smash the Oligarchy” buttons outside the hockey arena. “I feel like right now, we don’t necessarily need that message. I think we need a message of, ‘Hey, there are bad people trying to do bad things and we should as good people come together and stop them.’”\n\nThe speakers on stage during the tour sought to channel this frustration into immediate action and longer-term transformation. Sanders, who has said he went on tour only after seeing the tepid response to Trump from the Democratic Party, chose his rally locations strategically. They are all either in competitive but Republican-held House districts or close to them. In Michigan earlier this month, he targeted second-term Rep. John James. In Colorado on Friday, it was first-term Rep. Gabe Evans. In Arizona, Ocasio-Cortez promised that Democrats would unseat veteran Republican Rep. David Schweikert, who held on to his suburban Phoenix seat in November in one of the country’s closest races. The hope is that with sustained public pressure on vulnerable Republicans, Democrats can convince enough of them to block Trump’s objectives in a narrowly divided chamber.\n\nSanders is, in large part, still giving the speech about oligarchy that he’s been giving for the last decade. But the 83-year-old was a bit more soulful as he spoke with urgency about threats that are now not just theoretical, but existential. There were nods to both the nation’s founders and its second founding at the end of the Civil War—at various stops on the tour, he and the crowd have recited a portion of the Gettysburg Address together. It’s like a Tea Party rally for people who believe the 14th Amendment is real.\n\n“From the bottom of my heart, I am still convinced that they can be defeated,” Sanders said on stage in Tempe.\n\nPart of the reason for that optimism was the presence of a handful of considerably younger allies joining him on tour, including Texas Rep. Greg Casar and Ocasio-Cortez, who told the crowd in Tempe, “We’re gonna throw these bums out and fight for the nation we deserve,” before she even introduced herself.\n\nAnd “these bums” might not all be Republicans. The Bronx Democrat, who as Sanders noted won her seat after beating a member of the Democratic leadership in a primary, drew huge applause when she told the crowd, “You all have shown that if a US senator isn’t fighting hard enough for you, you’re not afraid to replace her with one who will”—a reference to both Arizona Republican Martha McSally and the Democrat-turned-Independent Kyrsten Sinema, who declined to run for reelection in the face of plummeting Democratic support. \n\nMusk and Trump—Vice President JD Vance was never mentioned—are trying “steal our health care, Social Security, and veterans benefits in order to pay for their tax cuts,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Pugilism was the name of the game. “We’re gonna fight, fight, fight,” she said. Attendees deserved people “with the courage to brawl for the working class.” In Tempe, she used the word “fight” 13 times.\n\n“My queen!” someone at Arizona State shouted.\n\nOcasio-Cortez laughed. “Your representative,” she said.\n\nTechnically, the congresswoman from the Bronx isn’t that, either. (In fact, she was full of praise for the four Democrats currently representing Arizona in Washington.) But on stage, Ocasio-Cortez and her allies were holding themselves up as, in effect, the true opposition—an alternative power center that will stand up for working people when the people who promised to do so fade away. \n\nSam Van Pykeren/Mother Jones\n\nAfter their speeches in Tucson had wrapped up Saturday and the announced crowd of 20,000 had begun to trickle out, Sanders and Casar chatted with reporters for a few minutes in the high school gym where the rally was originally slated to be held—before the surge in interest pushed it outdoors. It had been a hectic three-state tour, and Sanders had spoken for half an hour under a scorching high-desert sun. As he dropped into a folding chair, the senator looked spent. But he let out a loud laugh when I asked if it felt like people were more attuned to his message about oligarchy now, in Trump’s second term.\n\n“Trump helped me immensely in educating the American people to what oligarchy is,” he said.\n\nThe inauguration crystallized things, he said. The three richest men in the world, sitting alongside the richest Cabinet in history, made for a powerful symbol. “It doesn’t take Bernie Sanders to point out that you now have a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires—I think that’s clear and apparent to everyone.”\n\nNow that people have come around to Sanders’ diagnosis of the problem, he hopes they will accept the prescriptions he and his allies are offering. Anyone who has been listening to him for a while will recognize the applause lines—free health care, free college, new organizing protections for unions. He’s recently started using Musk’s obsession with artificial intelligence and automation at the Department of Government Efficiency to argue in his speeches that what’s happening to federal workers now will come for your industry, too—if it hasn’t already. But a major part of his pitch is the need to overhaul the Democratic Party. I asked Sanders what he thought about the rumblings about a liberal Tea Party.\n\nWhile he commended the party’s accomplishments on social issues and civil rights, he reiterated a point he’s made in the past. “I think very few people who understand politics can deny that, by and large, for the last 30, 40 years, the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class of this country, and that is the working class out there,” Sanders said, referring to the crowd outside. “They want leadership like Greg and Alexandria to stand up, and they want more people. They’re tired of Democratic hacks. They’re tired of Republicans.”\n\n“I mean, we are taking on everybody,” he continued. “Taking on the oligarchy, taking on the Republican Party, taking on the Democratic leadership, taking on the corporate media, taking on Wall Street. It ain’t easy, and this change is not gonna happen overnight.”\n\nCasar, chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, put the point a bit more sharply, when I asked why it seemed like his colleagues had been caught flat-footed.\n\n“The biggest divide right now within the Democratic Party [is] between fighters and folders—it’s not just between the sort of the typical left/right constellation that you usually talk about in political media.”\n\nDemocrats who rolled over in this moment were “playing some sort of political game,” he said, but “most people don’t think of their lives as a political game. They think of their lives as their only life on earth, and they want somebody to say, ‘We’re going to do everything we can to protect our democracy and keep your life from getting worse.’” \n\n“We either have to listen to our voters, channel that energy, and turn this into an organizing moment,” he said, “or, you know, face the consequences from our voters.”\n\nSanders and his younger colleagues are hoping to channel this dissatisfaction into a movement that can remake the Democratic Party and wrest power back from the billionaire class. But a public uprising powered to such a large extent by the anger and anxieties of mainstream Democrats could still end up in a much different direction. \n\nBy the time we wrapped up in the gym in Tucson, the crowd had emptied out, and only a few stragglers remained. Lois Bursuk, a school psychologist, and Linda Laraia, a retired VA nurse, were cooling off under a tree by the main entrance. They said they were fed up with what they were seeing in Washington and had each taken their own steps to resist Trump. Bursuk recently had joined hundreds of protesters outside the nearby office of Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani.\n\n“They just inspire me to keep going, because they’ve been on this platform now for a decade, and I’m grateful that they’re there,” she said of Sanders and his colleagues.\n\nBut Laraia, when asked, offered a far different choice for a Democratic champion going forward.\n\n“Okay, I’m gonna put in a plug for somebody I want to run for president,” she said. “Mark Cuban.” \n\nAdditional reporting by Nadia Hamdan and Sam Van Pykeren.","summary":"As he waited in the shadow of a parking garage in Tempe, Arizona, to hear Sen.

Schakowsky, 80, has been serving in Congress since 1999, the year that Abughazaleh was born.\nAbughazaleh, who moved to Illinois with her partner about a year ago, is kicking off a congressional campaign amid growing grassroots frustration with party leaders over their failure to aggressively combat Donald Trump’s agenda. She argues that any capitulation to Trump won’t result in “an easier sentence or less aggression by the Trump administration,” adding, “That’s not how these people work.”\n“The right-wing media ecosystem is what moved Republicans. I’ve said this before, but Roger Ailes created Fox to prop up the GOP,” Abughazaleh tells me. “But over the years, it’s made it so the GOP exists to prop up Fox.”\nShe is well acquainted with the MAGA-media machine through her past work at Media Matters for America, where she produced videos aimed at debunking narratives presented by Fox News and former anchor Tucker Carlson, and her more recent work on TikTok, where, as of this writing, she’s amassed more than 225,000 followers. She’s currently got another 210,000 on X, where she posted a video of herself Monday, urging Democrats “to drop the excuses and grow a fucking spine.”\nWhen asked about Abughazaleh’s run for Schakowsky’s seat, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said he was not familiar with it. However, he described the incumbent lawmaker as a “long-standing, stalwart progressive member,” while also acknowledging that “there’s a lot of angst, a lot of anxiety…across the country.” Abughazaleh, whose campaign manager posted Monday that the new candidate was already nearing $200,000 in donations, also shot back at Jeffries: “Nice to meet you, Hakeem! It’s time to get familiar.”\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nVanity Fair: For those who maybe aren’t familiar with your previous media work, can you explain what you tackled for Media Matters, Mother Jones, etc.?\nKat Abughazaleh: For Media Matters, I watched Fox News’ prime-time lineup. I was on their night shift team and my specialty was Tucker Carlson specifically. I was monitoring his show every night, analyzing narratives, what was happening, and then explaining it as well, in personal videos on my TikTok during the week. I used to do Fox recaps every week. When I got laid off because of Elon Musk’s lawsuit, I started working with Zeteo News and Mother Jones. [Musk’s company X sued Media Matters in November 2023, claiming the advocacy group’s work had misrepresented the site’s user experience, leading advertisers to leave the social media platform; Media Matters then laid off more than a dozen staffers last year, including Abughazaleh, with president Angelo Carusone citing “a legal assault on multiple fronts” as the reason for the cutbacks.]\nSince you have such a specific understanding of the right-wing media ecosystem, do you see that as an advantage in launching a political campaign?\nThe right-wing media ecosystem is what moved Republicans. I’ve said this before, but Roger Ailes created Fox to prop up the GOP. But over the years, it’s made it so the GOP exists to prop up Fox. If you want to know what Republicans are going to be talking about on the House floor a week in advance, just watch what’s happening at Fox’s 8 p.m. hour. Also, understanding what their lies are and what the aims are, I think, is really important. There are a lot of institutions, including Democrats, that are capitulating because they think that it will result in an easier sentence or less aggression by the Trump administration. That’s not how these people work. We can’t fall for this stuff, and I think having a genuine understanding of that helps.\nCan you explain the decision to challenge a long-serving Democrat? I noticed your website notes that you were born the year following Rep. Jan Schakowsky’s first win in the district. Why do you see this as a problem?\nShe hasn’t actually announced. I’m the only candidate in this race right now. I’m not sure if she will announce; she has filed. But my thought in this district is that people deserve more choice. I think that’s a really big issue in the Democratic Party, this belief that we shouldn’t ever challenge things or try something new until the right moment, and the right moment never comes. If Kamala Harris focused on being a change candidate, rather than presenting [Joe] Biden’s legacy, I think we might be in a different position here today. As far as Jan Schakowsky, she’s one of the most progressive members of Congress. She’s been good. I’ll be better. It’s time.\nCan you speak to the issues that you plan to tackle on the campaign trail? Are there any ideological differences there?\nI think the biggest difference would be in our lived experiences. There’s just some things you can’t understand unless you’re living through them right now. I mean, my parents, for instance, never had to go through school shooter drills. My parents had health insurance. It’s hard to understand what a lot of constituents, especially millennials and Gen Z people, are facing unless you are actively facing it yourself.\nIn your announcement video, you call for a “makeover” of the Democratic Party. Can you expand on that? What needs to change from the status quo to either combat Trump or engage young voters?\nThe biggest thing is not only being flexible, but also being strong. You have to do both. You can’t keep telling your constituents they’re the ones in the wrong. These consultants who haven’t won a presidential election since Barack Obama, or before, are the ones that are right. You can’t at the same time be saying that Donald Trump is the next coming of fascism but then also vote for his budget that gives him and Elon Musk unprecedented powers.\nAs a member of Gen Z, it feels like there’s growing representation of younger politicians. Can you expand on why that’s important right now?\nThese generations are just being left out in the cold after being told by these institutions that are run by people that are much older, that they’re delusional, or that things have always been this way. And they haven’t. The things that are happening right now are not normal. It’s not normal to not be able to afford health care anywhere else in the world. It’s not normal to deport people without due process. These aren’t normal things. Rather than just either ignoring it or pretending that you understand, or offering solutions that don’t actually help, having proper representation leads to a better future. It’s that simple. We know what we need, and we need to be in power, or have representation in power, so that way it can be delivered.\nWhat are your plans for the campaign trail? Can you speak to how you intend to engage with voters and connect with them in a way that might be unorthodox?\nWe’re focusing a lot on the ground, community-type stuff. So for example, in our first launch event, we are trying to uplift the Chicago Period Collective. Instead of needing a donation to get in, you just bring a box of tampons or pads, and those are all going to be donated to this organization that provides period products to shelters and schools and other organizations all over the city. Campaigns use so much money. We would much rather spend that on places where it actually matters, and talking to real people, than on 100k for the Hyatt ballroom for a fancy fundraiser. It’s kind of shocking that that’s not just the norm in how we campaign in this country.\nAs far as talking with constituents, I can’t wait to talk to people in person at these types of events. But also, people are free to DM me, come on stream. I want to meet people where they are. That doesn’t need to be limited in one way and doesn’t need to be limited to the length of a handshake.","summary":"Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old progressive TikTok star, talks to VF about vying for an 80-year-old Democratic congresswoman’s seat, her experience debunking right-wing narratives, and why capitulating to Donald Trump won’t work.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/maga-media-antagonist-running-for-congress","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67e1ce198867ec6f783c356b/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf325-Abughazaleh.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 16:49:01","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":304106334,"title":"Walmart heiress worth $17.8 billion quietly enters political discourse with New York Times ad declaring ‘the dignity of our country is not for sale’","text":"Christy Walton, an heir to the Walmart fortune, placed a nonpartisan ad in the New York Times urging Americans to uphold national dignity, respect allies, and engage in civic discourse. Many saw this as a response to Trump’s foreign policies.\n\nWhile the tech titans of the U.S. were quick to declare their banners for the Trump administration, billionaires in the wider political spectrum have been somewhat more cautious.\n\nYet it seems that one of the heirs to the Walmart fortune has quietly entered the political discourse, with a reminder that the dignity of the American nation is not up for sale.\n\nChristy Walton, 76, is worth an estimated $17.8 billion, having married into the Walmart dynasty. Her husband was John Walton, son of the grocery giant's founder Sam. He died in a plane crash in 2005 with his widow inheriting a portion of his shares.\n\nThis weekend, the billionaire placed an ad in the New York Times, making it clear that the \"views represented here are solely those of Christy Walton.\"\n\nThe ad, first reported by Bloomberg and depicting an image of the Statue of Liberty, is a paid political advertisement headed \"USA, USA, USA.\"\n\nPhotographs of the ad were shared on social media. Among the calls to action are: \"We honor our commitments and stand by our allies,\" \"We defend against aggression and dictators,\" and \"We respect our neighbors and trading partners.\"\n\nA person familiar with Walton's motive told Bloomberg that the message is intended to be nonpartisan and encourage people to express their opinions.\n\nThe piece ends: \"Show up, attend your town halls, be civil.\"\n\nGiven Walton's call for respect for America's trading partners, many are connecting the dots between the missive and recent actions from the White House.\n\nSince President Trump took office, foreign policy between America and its key trading partners has shifted: Tariffs have been imposed on China as well as Canada and Mexico, sparking retaliation from Uncle Sam's neighboring countries.\n\nPresident Trump and his administration have also repeatedly jibed that Canada will become its \"51st state,\" as well as questioning the sovereignty of Greenland. Trump has claimed that he will acquire the nation \"one way or the other\" for the U.S., which has outraged politicians in Denmark, as Greenland is part of the nation's kingdom.\n\nPresident Trump has also ruffled feathers overseas following a public spat with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nFortune did not receive a response from the contact details provided on Christy Walton's advertisement.\n\nWalton's philanthropic work\n\nBoth Christy and her son Lukas Walton have turned their attention to philanthropic work focused on sustainability and the environment.\n\nChristy founded iAlumbra (InnovacionesAlumbra), which focuses on bringing together commercial and charitable entities to strengthen community engagement, economies, and land and ocean environments.\n\nThis includes work such as improving ocean vitality, cultivating land and water resources to keep up with population change, and building community well-being.\n\nChristy also reportedly cohosted a fundraiser in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for former Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential campaign run. Per Bloomberg, tickets for the event ranged from $1,250 to $100,000.\n\nHer son, Lukas, founded Builders Vision in 2014, which invests in and advocates for businesses solving sustainability challenges across oceans, food and agriculture, and energy sectors.\n\nLukas, who also inherited a significant stake of Walmart in his father's will, is worth an estimated $36 billion.\n\nCurrently only two members of the Walton family, Steuart Walton and Gregory Penner, serve on Walmart's board.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/walmart-heiress-worth-17-8-164305461.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uXA_3PWbU1ZonpF5fh8d4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/c59a8e1ad0b72c91f57959cee90acbcd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 16:43:05","author":"Eleanor Pringle","authors":["Eleanor Pringle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":304050514,"title":"Snowmobiling Teen Dies After Triggering Alaskan Avalanche","text":"George Clooney has said on screen romance is dead for him because, at 63, he can’t compete with younger leading men.

I’m not trying to compete with 25-year-old leading men. That’s not my job.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, didn’t like Clooney’s appearance on 60 Minutes, but not because he won’t take loved-up roles anymore. On Truth Social, he criticized the actor for his political views. “Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece’ on George Clooney, a second rate movie ‘star,’ and failed political pundit,” Trump wrote.

Well...homie just confirmed exactly why we were all terrified by making one of the biggest public blunders we’ve seen in national security.\n\nOn March 15, the United States planned to bomb the Houthis in Yemen. This was a covert operation, meaning that the people planning this attacked wanted to surprise their targets. Well, they surprised the Houthis, but they embarrassed America along the way: A group chat about the attack was created for American senior security officials on Signal, a decentralized, encrypted messaging app. Somehow Mike Waltz, the National Security Advisor of the United States, invited Jeffery Goldberg, an editor at the Atlantic, to join in a discussion that included Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n Normally these kinds of communications are taken seriously and not haphazardly done on an app frequented by journalists and sex workers. That they used Signal to execute their plans appears obvious that they didn’t want anyone else within the government knowing what they did, and it makes one wonder what else they have going on on the app. But that’s a conversation for another column. \n\nThis would be funny if it wasn’t so sad. You may not remember, but Republicans suggested that Obama purposefully leaked classified information in 2012. They were outraged over the possible security breach. Then, when Hillary Clinton was running for President in 2016, there was all this uproar with Republicans about how she used a private server for her emails. The issue was concern over national security. Then there were concerns over how Kamala Harris would pose a security risk if she was elected president.\n\nSo, to recap: There was outrage about a possible security breach during Obama’s administration, uproar about Hillary’s use of a private server for her emails, citing security concerns and worry concerning Harris’ national security bona fides. \n\nBut here we have a legitimate, actual, real deal security breach from Trump’s second administration, and what do we hear? Crickets.\n\nLet’s call it like we see it: Republicans are hypocrites. Full stop.\n\nSure, there is a bit of hypocrisy in every corner of the American political system, but what we are seeing from the GOP is over the top. For years they have claimed to care deeply about American democracy (that was the whole issue with Trump saying he won in 2020), but then they do an about face on the topic when it suits them. \n\nThen they claim to care about the economy (that was why he won this time) and then have nothing to say when Trump fires thousands of Americans and starts a trade war that will, unquestionably, lead to higher prices. And now the party that claims to care the most about national security has nothing to say about an administration that has put our national security at risk.\n\nAnd why do they do this? Why are they silent when they would be crying wolf if a Democrat was in the White House? Because the guy they voted for sits behind the Resolute Desk.\n\nI’m not wasting any more ink on this. The Republicans are a joke. I bet they put sugar in their grits.","summary":"Everyone was worried about Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News contributor with a well documented love for the sauce, heading up the Department of Defense.

Prepare to talk about the why and how of Trump 2.0","text":"The urgent care doctor cocked an eyebrow at Mari Santos and her American accent.\n\nIt was four days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, and Santos was a student with a stomach bug in the first weeks of an overseas semester in Glasgow, Scotland. A doctor arrived to see her after a six-hour wait. But before asking what ailed her, he said this: “Interesting time to be an American, I suppose.\"\n\nUntil then, Santos, 20, had not been thinking about Trump — just her 104-degree fever and concern about being sick while abroad. But the president and his triumphant return to the White House, she says, were on her physician's mind, giving the American University student an instant education in geopolitics. The lesson, as she sees it: “There's a kind of chilling in the air.”\n\n“I knew that maybe that Europe is not in general big fan of American politics,” Santos said, “but I didn't expect it to be such like a personal thing.”\n\nThe United States and its center of gravity occupy a unique space in the international conversation. People the world over talk about America — its policies, its proclivities, its place in the world. They have for generations. They did it during the Iraq War. They did it during the first Trump administration.\n\nAnd two months into Trump 2.0, at least in many European and English-speaking countries, it's happening again — sometimes even more intensely.\n\nPeople from other countries have questions about Trump — and trust\n\nAnswering for America under the new Trump administration is becoming a delicate experience for some of the estimated 5 million U.S. citizens living in other countries.\n\nFrom Santos in Scotland to others in New Zealand, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, Republican and Democratic expats alike told The Associated Press in recent weeks that the moment they are revealed to be American changes virtually every conversation to, in essence, “What about Trump?”\n\nAt its root, this change is about whom to trust among those thought until now to be allies, in world politics and in life. Trump, known for insisting the truth is what he says it is, is now the voice of America — not VOA, the independent news service that told the nation's story for eight decades until he silenced it March 16. The president himself has set an example in which trust is almost beside the point.\n\n“Who do I trust? I mean, who do you trust?

A doctor arrived to see her after a six-hour wait. But before asking what ailed her, he said this: “Interesting time to be an American, I suppose.”\n\nUntil then, Santos, 20, had not been thinking about Trump — just her 104-degree fever and concern about being sick while abroad.

The lesson, as she sees it: “There’s a kind of chilling in the air.”\n\n“I knew that maybe that Europe is not in general big fan of American politics,” Santos said, “but I didn’t expect it to be such like a personal thing.”\n\nThe United States and its center of gravity occupy a unique space in the international conversation.

Trump, known for insisting the truth is what he says it is, is now the voice of America — not VOA, the independent news service that told the nation’s story for eight decades until he silenced it March 16.

The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic.”\n\nTrump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, 2 1/2 hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach.\n\nThe material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security. The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.\n\nJust two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the U.S. began launching a series of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nNational Security Council looking into matter\n\nThe National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist’s number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat. In addition to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, it included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of national intelligence.\n\nGoldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.\n\nHegseth in his first comments on the matter attacked Goldberg as “deceitful” and a “discredited so-called journalist” while alluding to previous critical reporting of Trump from the publication. He did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Goldberg ended up on the message chain.\n\n“Nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he began his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defense secretary.\n\nTrump on Tuesday in a brief interview with NBC News’ Garrett Haake downplayed the incident as “the only glitch in two months” of his administration “and it turned out not to be a serious one.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday said in post on X that no war plans were discussed and that “No classified material was sent to the thread.”\n\nLeavitt said on Monday the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Waltz and the national security team. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man.”\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump told reporters: “I don’t know anything about it. You’re telling me about it for the first time.” He added that The Atlantic was “not much of a magazine.”\n\nBy early evening, the president jokingly brushed it aside. He amplified a social media posting from Elon Musk spotlighting a conservative satirical news site article with the cutting headline: “4D Chess: Genius Trump Leaks War Plans to ‘The Atlantic’ Where No One Will Ever See Them.”\n\nGovernment officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, but it is not classified and can be hacked. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice call app is more secure than conventional texting.\n\nLeavitt said the White House counsel’s office has provided guidance to Trump’s top officials on a number platforms to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\n\nReaction poured in quickly\n\nThe sharing of sensitive information comes as Hegseth’s office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defense personnel to determine how reporters have received information.\n\nSean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defense secretary posted war operational plans on an unclassified app.\n\nThe administration’s handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic lawmakers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.\n\n“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a floor speech Monday afternoon.\n\n“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.\n\nHe said American lives are “on the line. The carelessness shown by Trump’s Cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.”\n\nRep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was “horrified” by the reports.\n\nHimes said if a lower-ranking official “did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation. The American people deserve answers,” which he said he planned to get at Wednesday’s previously scheduled committee hearing.\n\nSome Republicans also expressed concerns.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday, “We’re very concerned about it and we’ll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”\n\nReed said he would be speaking with Wicker about what the committee will do to “follow up” on the Signal leak.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants to learn more about what happened.\n\n“Obviously, we got to to run it to the ground, figure out what went on there,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson offered a notably forgiving posture.\n\n“I think it would be a terrible mistake for there to be adverse consequences on any of the people that were involved in that call,” Johnson said. “They were trying to do a good job, the mission was accomplished with precision.”\n\nStrict laws around handling defense information\n\nThe handling of national defense information is strictly governed by law under the century-old Espionage Act, including provisions that make it a crime to remove such information from its “proper place of custody” even through an act of gross negligence.\n\nThe Justice Department in 2015 and 2016 investigated whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law by communicating about classified information with her aides on a private email server she set up, though the FBI ultimately recommended against charges and none were brought.\n\nIn the Biden administration, some officials were given permission to download Signal on their White House-issued phones, but were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the Democratic administration.\n\nThe official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to communicate what they internally referred to as “tippers” to notify someone when they were away from the office or traveling overseas that they should check their “high side” inbox for a classified message.\n\nThe app was sometimes also used by officials during the Biden administration to communicate about scheduling of sensitive meetings or classified phone calls when they were outside the office, the official said.\n\nThe use of Signal became more prevalent during the last year of the Biden administration after federal law enforcement officials warned that China and Iran were hacking the White House as well as officials in the first Trump administration, according to the official.\n\nThe official was unaware of top Biden administration officials — such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan — using Signal to discuss sensitive plans as the Trump administration officials did.\n\nSome of the toughest criticism targeted Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel weekend host. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, said on social media that Hegseth, “the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in history, is demonstrating his incompetence by literally leaking classified war plans in the group chat.”\n\nLeak reveals internal debate on Houthi operation\n\nVance in the chain of the messages questioned whether Americans would understand the importance of strikes that came with the risk of “a moderate to severe spike in oil prices” and if the timing of the operation might be a “mistake.”\n\n“I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,” Vance argued. “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nVance also made the case that Europe would benefit much more than the U.S. by the action aimed at decimating the Houthis and securing Red Sea shipping lanes.\n\n“If you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said in a back-and-forth with Hegseth.\n\n“I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC,” Hegseth replied. He added, “I think we should go.”\n\nThe vice president’s communications director, William Martin, released a statement downplaying the debate.

A week later, the Biden-era Department of Justice sued a provider of such software, called RealPage.\n\nNow the Bay Area is leaning into this blame-game. The Berkeley City Council last week voted to adopt an ordinance to “prohibit the sale or use of algorithmic devices to set rents or manage occupancy levels for residential dwelling units.” A final vote will come today.\n\nThe consequences would be long-lasting. These “algorithmic devices” — a complex term for software — offer property managers, big and small, a suggested value for their rental units based upon current market conditions. Users can advertise their rentals for more or less.\n\nAllowing landlords to use the software brings inventory to market more quickly, because it eliminates the time-intensive process of researching the going rates of units in similar locations with comparable amenities. Developers will also be more willing to build in the East Bay and throughout California if they can utilize modern tools to make property management easier.\n\n“It amounts to illegal price-fixing,” claimed Debbie Potter, former chair of Berkeley’s Housing Advisory Commission, who proposed the ordinance.\n\nBut estimating the value of rentals based on comparables is not the same as controlling the value of rentals, when there is no requirement to accept the software’s recommendations. Without any agreement between property managers to go by the software’s suggestions, they are free to compete against one another by pricing their units below market value. Ultimately, prices are set by humans who reach an agreement on what they are willing to take and pay for rent.\n\nIn opposition to the ordinance, Berkeley City Councilmember Mark Humbert suggested the ban would require a police state to determine who is using advanced math and a computer to calculate market value. His solution to the high price of housing makes sense: If Berkeley wants to bring down prices, it should just build more housing, he said.\n\nIt works. In Austin, Texas, an area that rivals Northern California for national prestige in tech leadership, average rental prices have declined for 19 consecutive months following a recent boom in apartment development. Likewise, when Miami housing prices skyrocketed in the early 2000s — because of a population boom generated by retiring Northeasterners and Latin American expats — builders responded with a massive building campaign. Because government supported their work, housing prices fell dramatically.\n\nIn short, to make housing more affordable, our local leaders should reduce the disincentives to new single and multifamily construction through reform of the city’s rent control, its overly restrictive tenant-rights policies, and its glacial permitting process.\n\nThe real reason for high rents was explained in Econ 101: In the East Bay, housing supply has yet to catch up with housing demand.\n\nBerkeley City Council’s attempt to shut down algorithmic price recommendations is remindful of the ugly king who thought he became handsome because he banned mirrors. Housing won’t become affordable by banning algorithmic math either. \n\nWill Swaim is president of the California Policy Center.","summary":"Comparative algorithms help landlords bring rentals to market more quickly and encourage more housing development.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/25/opinion-banning-algorithmic-math-wont-make-east-bay-housing-affordable/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/VOJ-Z-HISTORY-COL-0412-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 12:10:13","author":"Will Swaim","authors":["Will Swaim"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":303933758,"title":"Fetterman calls out 'absolutely absurd' pandering to far-left Democrats","text":"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., called out in a new interview what he believes to be \"absolutely absurd\" pandering to extreme Democrats over issues like the war in Israel or shutting down the government. Fetterman spoke to Jewish Insider on Monday about his ongoing conflict with some members of his party, particularly over his support for Israel. However, his latest issue with the more \"extreme\" members of his party came from their demand that Democrats refuse to support a GOP bill to fund the government earlier this month. Fetterman was one of ten Democrats who broke ranks to vote for the bill and called out attempts to \"pander\" to calls for the government to shut down. FETTERMAN URGES DEMOCRATS TO TALK LIKE 'REGULAR' PEOPLE INSTEAD OF RANTING ABOUT ‘OLIGARCHS’ \"I was really the first Democrat to refuse to shut our government down, and my party was so desperate to pander to shut the government down,\" Fetterman said. \"Absurd, absolutely absurd. Six months ago, we were lecturing the Republicans, ‘You can’t shut the government down.’ Now it’s, ‘Well, yeah, let’s do these things.’\" He added, \"It’s like that’s part of the problem, to pander, and they want to pander to the extreme parts of our party, to shut the government down. I said I will never burn the village down and claim that I’m saving it.\" Fetterman also pointed to Michigan as an example of political \"pandering\" that failed, claiming the Democratic Party tried to appeal to the left-wing Arab-American population only to lose the state to President Donald Trump anyway. He specifically called out Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for refusing to support President Joe Biden and later Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election because of their support for Israel. Fetterman claimed that she and other far-left Democrats ultimately helped to elect Trump.

Fox News Digital reached out to Fetterman and Tlaib’s offices for a comment. Fetterman called out another far-left Democratic representative on Friday when he fired back at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., over her suggestion that Democrats \"fight harder\" after she urged her party to vote against the spending measure in the Senate. \"Fight ‘harder’—a stunt that would have harmed millions and plunged us into chaos,\" Fetterman wrote when sharing a screenshot featuring a quotation of Ocasio-Cortez's comment. \"We kept our government open.

I even had long chats with Hindu youth in a few cities. My stay everywhere was with my friends from India, i.e. local Hindu families.\nI could not help, but reflect on my earlier interactions with email groups during the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton elections, and personal conversations with many Indian Americans, including Muslims, during my earlier trip in December 2019. I experienced a huge upheaval in Hindu society about how they look at American politics as US citizens.\nDuring the Clinton-Trump battle, I saw a big divide between the traditional Democrat supporters among the Hindu community and the new-age Republicans. Democrats, being the vocal majority at that time, were more aggressive. The Democratic Party was the party for all immigrants by default, and Indians were no different. However, the younger citizens and the American-born citizens were no more bound by the reflexive sympathy for Democrats. The political divide was so bitter that once I commented on a group, why were they fighting with each other? Why could they not come up with a Hindu agenda and talk to their respective candidates that this is our agenda, whichever candidate wins.\nHindus do not seek any favour because they have risen with hard work without seeking any favours. The only thing that worries and irritates Hindus is the way their religion is presented in education and the way they are misrepresented in public discourse. I was surprised at that time to hear from some senior Hindus that “we do not have that kind of lobbying power”. However, since I did not have any stakes in American politics, I just let it pass. I had also told my hardcore Democrat friends that unless Clinton came up with a clear stand on Islamic terrorism and radicalism, she would lose. And she lost.\nIn the next election, we had the spectacle of Hindus falling for Kamala Harris, as one of their own, despite her never accepting this ownership, except for a few public shows of Indianness. It was the time when some politicians with Indian ancestry used to show themselves as American Christians, converted for the sake of being successful in politics. People like Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley tried to shy away from their ex-Hindu and Indian identity, while we Indians insisted that they had strong Indian roots. The socio-political changes in the Indian community slowly saw the fake, make-believe politicians losing steam because they tried to be what they were not.\nI could sense the changing mood of Hindu American citizens — the growing confidence in their American identity, while being open about their affection for their land of origin. They had begun taking an interest in American politics more actively. One saw more Indians in local politics, if not national politics. Some senators and Congressmen/women did come up. But they were either highly anti-Hindu or took one stance in public and another in private. So, there was an element of tentative uncertainty about them and their beliefs.\nIn this election, we saw Hindu politicians comfortable in their skin. No more apologetic, nor did they need to Americanise with a name change, no more need to show themselves to be more American Christian than they were. Their two generations of success based on sheer hard work backed by strong family values in that land have made them more confident and bolder. They profess a strong belief in America without giving up on their identity. Similarly, I also found Hindu youth and younger-generation Indians pitching their political and social views very confidently.\nIn one of the meetings, I met two young Hindu Americans making a strong pitch for the Democratic Party, believing that the youth were being misled by the Republican Party, which can never be theirs. There were also strong Trump supporters there. But, like true Hindus, they did not have any confrontation. I felt very happy to see this transformation of the political landscape within the Hindu community. No more bitter fights within the community, but healthy competition.\nAnother interesting thing I noted was that the Indians in the USA with H1B visas seem to be much less worried about their visa renewal than the Indians in India. They are confident of their skills and knowledge. The pro-Trump Indians and even Democrat Indians feel that what Trump is doing is necessary for the USA to break free of the shackles put in by the extreme Left. A senior Hindu Democrat leader said they were saved from doing this clean-up as Trump is doing it, and they will also reap the benefit from this spring cleaning. There is nothing one can do about hardcore Democrat supporters who were swearing at Trump. But there were objective critics who feared that the aggressive stance of tariffs could hurt the USA badly, as inputs will become costly. In a way, there is a big churn. And like other Americans, Hindu Americans are also equally invested in it.\nAn Atlanta senator, who was incidentally Black, asked me about Modi ji’s economic policies, which he thought were Leftist, although he was being called a right-wing politician. I responded by telling him how India does not fit into the western binary of Left and Right. And how, economically, Modi ji and Hindu economic philosophy was more ‘left of centre’. I also explained the philosophy of Integral Humanism that Modi ji imbibed. It was refreshing to see rising American interest in India without any traditional baggage, with a fresh look.\nA group of students at Harvard requested me to give a talk about my book ‘Conflict Resolution – The RSS Way’. Although they got some hate mail from the usual suspects, they stuck to their guns. I am told it was the first talk ever in the Kennedy Centre at Harvard with a subject directly about the RSS. Surprisingly, it was attended by students from five countries from the African continent and Eastern Europe, apart from the Indian students.\nI met an eminent professor who specialises in democratic institutions. He shared a chapter about the success of India and Indonesia in democracy. When I told him that Indian democratic polity does not flow from the western model and just our Constitution, but from our long tradition of institutions like Panchayat, to my surprise, he had no clue. He was honestly eager to know more. However, his ignorance showed me how the academics references in the west is dominated totally by Left, secular intellectuals. So much so that he could not find any book about these traditions. Though I did send him a list of a few books, I hope the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tries to bridge this gap of lack of books in western institutions.\nDuring my earlier visits and even the current one, when Hindu Americans would ask me about problems in Bharat, I used to teasingly tell them, “Let us worry about Bharat and Modi. You should just enjoy the spectacle of rising Bharat; but worry about how Hindus are portrayed in your own country.”\nOne of the elder Americans was unhappy at this suggestion. He poured forth his love for his country of origin and how he carried his Hindu identity back from his village in Bharat to America, where he had come due to some circumstances, but always thought of Bharat. In the same meeting, when I asked a young, American-born Hindu girl about her views, she went beyond what I had imagined. She said, “I am not worried about political developments in Bharat. I think we should focus on where Hindus will be 100 years from now in America, where the community would be in American society.”\nWhen I look back at the last 10-12 years of Indian and American politics and the evolving thought process of Hindu Americans, especially the new generation, I like the feel of the rising expectations and changing perceptions of Hindus and local Americans about Bharat and their own country, that is, the USA.\nIndians are slowly and surely becoming international citizens.\nThe writer is a well-known author and political commentator.

The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic.”\n\nTrump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, 2 1/2 hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach.\n\nThe material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security. The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.\n\nJust two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the U.S. began launching a series of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nThe National Security Council is looking into the matter\n\nThe National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist’s number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat. In addition to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, it included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of national intelligence.\n\nGoldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.\n\nHegseth in his first comments on the matter attacked Goldberg as “deceitful” and a “discredited so-called journalist” while alluding to previous critical reporting of Trump from the publication. He did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Goldberg ended up on the message chain.\n\n“Nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he began his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defense secretary.\n\nIn a statement late Monday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Waltz and the national security team.\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump told reporters: “I don’t know anything about it. You’re telling me about it for the first time.” He added that The Atlantic was “not much of a magazine.”\n\nBy early evening, the president jokingly brushed it aside. He amplified a social media posting from Elon Musk spotlighting a conservative satirical news site article with the cutting headline: “4D Chess: Genius Trump Leaks War Plans to ‘The Atlantic’ Where No One Will Ever See Them.”\n\nGovernment officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, but it is not classified and can be hacked. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice call app is more secure than conventional texting.\n\nReaction poured in quickly\n\nThe sharing of sensitive information comes as Hegseth’s office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defense personnel to determine how reporters have received information.\n\nSean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defense secretary posted war operational plans on an unclassified app.\n\nThe administration’s handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic lawmakers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.\n\n“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a floor speech Monday afternoon.\n\n“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.\n\nHe said American lives are “on the line. The carelessness shown by Trump’s Cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.”\n\nRep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was “horrified” by the reports.\n\nHimes said if a lower-ranking official “did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation. The American people deserve answers,” which he said he planned to get at Wednesday’s previously scheduled committee hearing.\n\nSome Republicans also expressed concerns.\n\nSen.

The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic.”\n\nTrump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, 2 1/2 hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach.\n\nThe material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security. The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.\n\nJust two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the U.S. began launching a series of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nThe National Security Council is looking into the matter\n\nThe National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist’s number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat. In addition to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, it included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of national intelligence.\n\nGoldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.\n\nHegseth in his first comments on the matter attacked Goldberg as “deceitful” and a “discredited so-called journalist” while alluding to previous critical reporting of Trump from the publication. He did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Goldberg ended up on the message chain.\n\n“Nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he began his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defense secretary.\n\nIn a statement late Monday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Waltz and the national security team.\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump told reporters: “I don’t know anything about it. You’re telling me about it for the first time.” He added that The Atlantic was “not much of a magazine.”\n\nBy early evening, the president jokingly brushed it aside. He amplified a social media posting from Elon Musk spotlighting a conservative satirical news site article with the cutting headline: “4D Chess: Genius Trump Leaks War Plans to ‘The Atlantic’ Where No One Will Ever See Them.”\n\nGovernment officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, but it is not classified and can be hacked. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice call app is more secure than conventional texting.\n\nReaction poured in quickly\n\nThe sharing of sensitive information comes as Hegseth’s office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defense personnel to determine how reporters have received information.\n\nSean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defense secretary posted war operational plans on an unclassified app.\n\nThe administration’s handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic lawmakers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.\n\n“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a floor speech Monday afternoon.\n\n“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.\n\nHe said American lives are “on the line. The carelessness shown by Trump’s Cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.”\n\nRep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was “horrified” by the reports.\n\nHimes said if a lower-ranking official “did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation. The American people deserve answers,” which he said he planned to get at Wednesday’s previously scheduled committee hearing.\n\nSome Republicans also expressed concerns.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday, “We’re very concerned about it and we’ll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”\n\nReed said he would be speaking with Wicker about what the committee will do to “follow up” on the Signal leak.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants to learn more about what happened.\n\n“Obviously, we got to to run it to the ground, figure out what went on there,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson offered a notably forgiving posture.\n\n“I think it would be a terrible mistake for there to be adverse consequences on any of the people that were involved in that call,” Johnson said. “They were trying to do a good job, the mission was accomplished with precision.”\n\nThere are strict laws around handling defense information\n\nThe handling of national defense information is strictly governed by law under the century-old Espionage Act, including provisions that make it a crime to remove such information from its “proper place of custody” even through an act of gross negligence.\n\nThe Justice Department in 2015 and 2016 investigated whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law by communicating about classified information with her aides on a private email server she set up, though the FBI ultimately recommended against charges and none were brought.\n\nIn the Biden administration, some officials were given permission to download Signal on their White House-issued phones, but were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the Democratic administration.\n\nThe official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to communicate what they internally referred to as “tippers” to notify someone when they were away from the office or traveling overseas that they should check their “high side” inbox for a classified message.\n\nThe app was sometimes also used by officials during the Biden administration to communicate about scheduling of sensitive meetings or classified phone calls when they were outside the office, the official said.\n\nThe use of Signal became more prevalent during the last year of the Biden administration after federal law enforcement officials warned that China and Iran were hacking the White House as well as officials in the first Trump administration, according to the official.\n\nThe official was unaware of top Biden administration officials — such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan — using Signal to discuss sensitive plans as the Trump administration officials did.\n\nSome of the toughest criticism targeted Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel weekend host.

Jamie Raskin, who received among the loudest applause of any of the panelists, took a starker tone: \"Don't let anybody tell you that we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Raskin said.\n\n\"Because that is too passive-sounding. That's too ambiguous. This is an attack on the Constitution of the United States, and we're going to defend the Constitution of the United States!\"\n\nRepublicans face fierce pushback at in-person events\n\nThe Democratic Party claims that it's holding these town halls as a way to hear directly from voters.\n\n\"The purpose of these town halls is not for us to spread our message, but us to hear from people throughout this country right now who are facing deep and serious impacts to their own lives, to their neighborhoods and communities, because of what this administration is doing,\" Martin told ABC News on Thursday after the town hall.\n\nBut Martin and others, explicitly, are also emphasizing the idea that Democrats are showing up and hosting these events while Republicans are pulling back from hosting in-person events or facing fierce pushback from constituents when they do. Some of the loudest applause in the church on Thursday came when speakers criticized the district's representative, Ryan Mackenzie -- who in 2024 narrowly flipped the seat held by Democrat Susan Wild.\n\nArnaud Armstrong, a spokesman for Mackenzie, told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday that Mackenzie has answered questions at in-person events and would run a telephone town hall on Thursday night to allow for more people to speak with the congressman, including people with disabilities or seniors who might struggle to make it to an in-person event.\n\nDuring that telephone town hall, Mackenzie said, \"This is the best way that I have found to reach literally thousands of people at once and be able to have this kind of conversation.\"\n\nDisillusioned Democrats\n\nThe town halls come as Democratic voters show disillusion with their party.\n\nA recent CNN/SSRS poll taken in early March found that 52% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents felt that the leadership of the Democrats is taking the party in the wrong direction, and that 57% felt that the party should mainly work to \"stop the Republican agenda.\"\n\nWhile waiting in line outside to enter the town hall, some residents of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley region told ABC News that President Donald Trump's actions struck close to home or worried them -- but that they felt disillusioned with the broader Democratic response so far.\n\n'Very mixed feelings' on Democrats' response to Trump\n\nCarole Ostfeld, a retired teacher from Allentown, Pennsylvania, came bearing a sign that said \"Hands off Medicaid.\" She and her husband David told ABC News that they came out to the town hall in order to protest Trump and Musk, including because of Trump's actions with the Department of Education.\n\nBut asked how they feel about the Democratic response to the Trump administration, Carole Ostfeld said, \"I've got very mixed feelings --\"\n\nHer husband added, \"It needs to be more.\"\n\nAsked if Democrats' messaging is resonating with them, Carole Ostfeld said it is -- but, \"as they say, you can't fight city hall,\" as Republicans are in power.\n\nAnother attendee, Ann Frechette of Easton, Pennsylvania, said the news about Trump signing an order to dismantle the Department of Education, which came that day, struck close to home. \"I have a son in college who benefits from a Pell Grant,\" she told ABC News. \"And I'm afraid that that Pell Grant will disappear, that monies like that will disappear. He's on Medicaid, I think he may lose his health insurance. There's so many things.\"\n\nBut the broader Democratic response was disillusioning her as well. While she praised some individual lawmakers, including Raskin, she added, \"I think the Democrats in general, they don't -- I'm a Democrat, but my party doesn't seem to get the message that was delivered last November. I would like people to stand up to what is being done.\"\n\nFiring up supporters\n\nThat said, the town hall itself was by many measures a success -- or at least, the Democratic speakers were able to fire up their supporters.\n\nAll of the pews were filled, with some attendees standing on the back or the sides of the sanctuary; and the crowd gave thunderous standing ovations to the speakers multiple times – particularly when, for instance, Raskin spoke about taking on Trump or former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild criticized the incumbent representative.\n\nPeople paid attention as audience members shared their own stories and questions, and then applauded them warmly, cheering on their peers in a clear show of support.\n\nDuring a question and answer portion of the town hall, attendees raised concerns about the future of Medicaid, educational programs, and other issues.\n\nAnother attendee, Terri Neifert, told the crowd that she has lived in Bethlehem almost her entire life and became disabled after a fall at a grocery store, which changed the trajectory of her life. She said she managed to get her degree and to support her family through Medicare, food banks, and Social Security disability.\n\n\"If they cut Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps… I would lose everything,\" Neifert told the crowd.\n\nNeifert received a round of applause from the audience, and other attendees went up to her after the event wrapped to thank her for sharing her story.\n\nAsked by ABC News after the town hall how she was feeling by then about the Democrats' response to the Trump administration, Neifert -- similar to other attendees -- focused on the road ahead.\n\n\"It looks like it's gonna be a fight, and an uphill battle... more public outcry, more marches, and Congress needs to pull up their big boy pants and start doing their job,\" Neifert said.\n\nGoing on the road\n\nSome Democrats or Democratic-aligned allies are taking a different tack than the town halls -- and going on the road.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been on the road for weeks with what he calls the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, making stops for rallies in both right- and left-leaning districts. The Democratic Party has shown support for his efforts, reposting social media posts from Sanders about the tour.\n\nOut there on Sanders' tour, some attendees said they're disillusioned with the party's response to Trump.\n\n\"They gotta be a little tougher,\" one rally attendee told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl at the Denver event. Another was blunter: \"Quit being a bunch of doormats.\"\n\nBut -- in a sign that the rallies may be a successful tactic for Democrats to reach their base -- they're attracting thousands of people. Sander's Denver appearance, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., brought in more than 30,000 attendees.\n\nSanders said it was the largest rally he's ever hosted -- bigger than the rallies on his two presidential runs.\n\nSanders himself has his own criticism for the Democratic Party, telling Karl in an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" that the Democrats should have done more for working people when they had control of the Senate.\n\n\"And since then, do I think the Democrats have been effective in rallying the American people, in stopping Trump's movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism? No, I don't,\" Sanders told Karl.\n\nDonna Brazile, a former DNC chair and an ABC News contributor, said on \"This Week\" after Sanders' interview, said, \"Bernie Sanders is filling a void, a major void left after, of course, the defeat of Kamala Harris last year by Donald Trump. This void has to be filled because there's so much anger, anger not just in red districts, but also in blue districts.\"\n\nThat void is one that Democrats hope to fill with these events.\n\nMartin, asked by ABC News after the Bethlehem town hall if he thought the messages of the Democrats is going to resonate in Republican districts or with Democrats themselves, said that wasn't really the point.\n\n\"It's really not about the message resonating,\" Martin said. \"What this is about is listening to people. Hearing the concerns of Americans right now throughout this country, who deserve to be heard, right?\"\n\nMartin added later: \"We're going to fill a void for them, and we're going to talk to more people throughout this country.\"\n\nABC News' Hannah Demissie, Isabella Murray, Jonathan Karl, Meghan Mistry and Quinn Scanlan contributed to this report.","summary":"Town halls are among the strategies that Democrats are using to try to get their base fired up against the Trump White House.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-host-town-halls-hear-voters-fire-supporters/story?id=119991887","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/af8a3ff4-6c6a-4a0c-98f6-71c5ea395be0/Carole-Ostfeld-abc-gmh-250324_1742826703467_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 10:10:32","author":"Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":303913664,"title":"Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Fight the Oligarchy","text":"“They’re not stepping up,” a retired nurse named Mark Creal said. “No spine, no backbone,” he added. “They’re not doing their jobs.” He wore a button that said “Proud Democrat.”\nIt was shortly before noon, and thousands of people were in the process of filing through a security checkpoint onto the field at Catalina High School. They were there for the latest stop of the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, a series of rallies organized by Senator Bernie Sanders which have, in recent weeks, garnered attention for attracting significant crowds: at a rally in Denver the day before, Sanders and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had reportedly drawn thirty-four thousand people. (By way of comparison, Vice-President Kamala Harris’s appearance in Houston, with Beyoncé, late in her campaign, had drawn some thirty thousand people; President Trump’s preëlection extravaganza at Madison Square Garden had had an audience of nearly twenty thousand.) But the 2024 election proved that in-person displays of enthusiasm are not an adequate measure of political strength—the collective political imagination is increasingly defined by social media. Still, in Tucson, it seemed striking that thousands of people (the organizers reported a crowd of twenty thousand) had turned out on a Saturday to see three out-of-state politicians—Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Greg Casar, a young congressman from Austin—none of whom is actively campaigning for national office. As an attendee named Cindy Brooks told me, “I’ve never really heard Bernie speak from end to end, and that’s why I’m here, because I want to hear everything that he has to say.”\nSanders had begun the tour in late February, starting with stops in Midwestern congressional districts where Republicans had eked out narrow majorities. It’s not the first time the senator has held rallies in the off-season—in 2017, during Trump’s first six months in office, Sanders held more than a dozen events promoting progressive issues. In the speeches on this tour, his policy proposals hadn’t changed much: Medicare for All, free tuition for college and trade schools, building more affordable housing, taxing the rich. Now, however, the mood was different. As Trump, in collaboration with Elon Musk, has embarked on efforts to decimate the federal government, public political gatherings—in particular, appearances by Republicans in their home districts—have become flash points for an angry citizenry. In March, House Speaker Mike Johnson encouraged Republican lawmakers to skip town halls to avoid confrontations with what he claimed were paid protesters, and during last week’s congressional recess many Republican lawmakers avoided open forums.\nOn March 14th, following Sanders’s lead and perhaps attempting to fill the vacuum left by Republicans, the Democratic Party announced that it would be holding its own series of “People’s Town Halls” in congressional districts won by Republicans they consider to be vulnerable. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and losing 2024 Vice-Presidential candidate, hit the road, paying visits to G.O.P. districts in Wisconsin and Iowa, and Ro Khanna, the California congressman whose district includes parts of the Bay Area, toured three of his state’s red districts. But, at a time when the Democratic Party’s approval rating is at a historic low, constituents are venting their exasperation with their party as well. After Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer supported a Republican spending bill to prevent a government shutdown, public outcry against him was pronounced enough that he postponed a planned book tour. And rock-bottom favorability ratings aren’t the Party’s only problem: it’s also facing a grim map for Senate races in 2026; a demographic crisis, as the populations of its strongholds shrink; and legislative incapacitation because of conservative majorities in both houses of Congress and the Supreme Court.\nBut none of these gatherings had attracted the same attention, or the same crowds, as Sanders and his special guest, Ocasio-Cortez. The people I spoke to had shown up in part because Sanders is an Independent. “I don’t know if I’m part of the Party anymore—they’ve really failed us in a lot of ways,” a twenty-eight-year-old named Brendan Crowley said to me, of the Democrats. “﻿They need to work on messaging, they need to work on getting the Old Guard out of office and actually letting the progressive wing of the Party that represents the people through.” Out in the crowd, a medic was called to attend to someone who’d fainted in the heat—the first of several such incidents. Crowley, who had dressed practically for the weather in a sun hoodie and a wide-brimmed hat, works as an H.V.A.C. technician—“a tradesman,” he said. He scanned the crowd. “There aren’t a lot of us here.” I asked about those of his co-workers who support Trump. “They have grievances against the economic state of America. They feel left behind, they feel that their voices aren’t heard,” he said. “The grandstanding of the Democratic Party has totally looked down on them.”\n“Nothing’s happening that’s supposed to be happening,” a forty-year-old named Nikki Montaño Brown told me. She was at the rally with her adult daughter. Brown lives in Tucson, where she has worked as a cashier at the grocery chain Albertsons for twenty-five years. “It’s always been a fight, but this is the biggest fight we’ve had right now in my whole life,” she said. “That’s it, no one’s helping us at all.”\nThe crowd’s attire was a retrospective of Democratic memes dating back to at least 2016: I saw a coconut; I saw merchandise from Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 Presidential campaigns, and Moms Demand Action T-shirts. Had it not been for the weather, there probably would have been a pussy hat. I asked an attendee, Tracy Wood, whether she thought rallies really accomplished anything. “They’re important emotionally,” she said. “It lifts you up to know that this many people actually care.”\n“I wanted to hear the positive message after all the negative that’s been going on,” another attendee, Matilda Martinez, told me. She is of the Navajo clan Naakai Dine’é and had travelled to the rally from her home on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. She expressed her disappointment in Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the House Minority Leader. “They are not fighting for us,” she said. “The only ones that I see speaking out are Jasmine Crockett”—a congresswoman from Texas—“A.O.C., and Bernie Sanders.”\nShannon Hardnock wore a beige visor and a shirt that said “MORONS ARE GOVERNING AMERICA.” “We’re really being taken over by a dictatorship, and it’s a really scary time,” she said. She expressed worry about the cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs—her husband is a veteran who had a traumatic brain injury during a training exercise before a planned deployment to Afghanistan in 2001. She was not angry at the Democrats, though—“I feel like their hands are tied,” she said.\nOcasio-Cortez followed this speech with more. “Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s disdain for the working class doesn’t just come from not being raised right,” she said. “It’s a shorthand for the right wing’s entire political agenda and a certain ugly kind of politics that at its core is about lying to and screwing over working- and middle-class Americans.” She continued, “But there’s a word for this kind of thing, Tucson. You know it: ‘corruption.’ ”\nWhen Sanders took to the stage, he stood between his young protégés, putting his arms around their shoulders like a proud uncle. He spoke of the “other Alexandrias and Alexanders” out there in America, waiting to run for office. Sanders has been warning about the growing threat of an oligarchy for years. Now, he implied in his speech, he no longer needed to explain what it meant to the American people. In January, he said, he’d had a front-row seat to an Inauguration at which the President took the oath of office flanked by Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk—the three richest men in America—with at least a dozen other billionaires arrayed behind them.\n“The truth is that right now in America, the people on top have never, ever in the history of our country, had it so good,” Sanders said. “These guys literally don’t know what to do with their money. They buy one mansion, two mansions, not enough. They’ve got five mansions. They want to get around? They own their own jet planes; they own their own helicopters. Send their kids to the best private schools, the best colleges. Go on vacation, they don’t go to Motel 6. They own their own islands, and just for kicks, the very rich decide to take a trip to outer space.”\nHis audience erupted into loud boos. But both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez seemed to acknowledge that many Americans prefer to ally themselves with the richest person rather than the poorest, or have lost faith entirely in the idea of a functioning government. “What Republicans do is that they try to make working people like you and me feel like we’re just one step outside of that club, that if we just work a little bit harder, maybe we’ll be a billionaire too,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Except those kinds of spoils aren’t earned, Tucson. They’re stolen.”\nWhere does that leave demoralized progressives? After the rally, Sanders spoke with reporters in the high-school gym. He seemed tired but not defeated. For the most recent events, he said, a majority of the people who R.S.V.P.ed weren’t already in his campaign’s database. He brushed away concerns that young adults voted more conservatively in the most recent election than they had before, and he came back to people’s views of the Democrats. “They’re seeing their position on supporting Netanyahu,” he said. “These young people can’t pay rent. They’re earning horrific wages. The standard of living is going to be lower than their parents’. They say, ‘Where are the Democrats?’ ” After Sanders departed, Casar stayed on. He acknowledged that whatever might pass as mass resistance to the policies of Trump’s second term had been slower to materialize than resistance to the President’s policies the first time around. But he suggested that the divide within the Democratic Party was less between right and left than between what he called “fighters and folders,” the latter being “people who say, ‘Well, the Democratic Party should just not do much, they should just fold and let the Republicans look bad.’ But that is playing some sort of political game,” he continued, “where most people don’t think of their lives as a political game. They think of their lives as their only life on earth.” ♦","summary":"In Arizona, a crowd of thousands suggested that the left still has a pulse.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/bernie-sanders-and-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-fight-the-oligarchy","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/67e1ae59049bc18e12668ab5/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Witt-Bernie-AOC.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 10:00:00","author":"Emily Witt","authors":["Emily Witt"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":303934098,"title":"Exclusive: Inside the Kamala Harris Campaign’s First Week—and Final Hours","text":"In his new book, Uncharted, VF contributor Chris Whipple dissects the 2024 presidential race. Here, he offers fresh reporting on the genesis of Harris’s campaign—and its sorrowful conclusion.\nStill, taking Biden’s place on the ticket was a lot more complicated and fraught than being the acting president for a day. To prepare, Harris’s team launched a stealth operation; they recruited people with no direct connection to the VP. On Thursday, July 18, three days before Biden made his decision to step aside, a veteran Democratic operative heard from Stephanie Schriock, the former head of Emily’s List. “I got a call to help the Harris campaign come up with an ‘if he drops out plan,’ ” this operative told me. “ ‘Can you take a look at all the rules? What we would actually need to do in terms of signatures?’ They 100 percent did not know at that point. They were like, ‘We just feel like we should put a plan in place. Maybe something happens.’ We were all very careful that this was not Kamala. This was, ‘If someone [Biden] wants to drop out, we desperately want a woman president, and us women have to be there.’ That was the framing.”\nOther Harris allies were also wrangling prominent Democratic senators to make a promise: If Biden didn’t retreat by Monday, July 22, they would call on him publicly to do so. Even at this late date, Nancy Pelosi, who’d been putting her own pressure on Biden, was thought to oppose a coronation of Harris; she wanted a primary. Barack Obama reportedly wanted one too. And he was said to favor a governor, not Harris, as the nominee. But as Biden weighed his options at his Rehoboth beach house that fateful weekend of July 20–21, he was practically alone. The only counsel he was taking was from close aides Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon.\nOn Sunday, just a little after noon, Biden called Harris. The vice president, wearing sweatpants and a Howard University hoodie, was in the kitchen of the VP mansion at the US Naval Observatory. The second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, was in California. Harris’s niece Meena was visiting and her two daughters, Harris’s grandnieces, were sitting down to do a jigsaw puzzle. Her cell phone buzzed. “Hello, Mr. President,” she said.\n“Listen,” said Biden. “I’ve decided I’m not going to run.” Harris sounded dumbfounded. She replied, “Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do that?” The president was sure. Biden hung up, but he called back to say the White House would announce his decision soon—and he would follow up with a tweet endorsing her. At 1:46 p.m. the White House released Biden’s statement; at 2:13 p.m. he sent out the tweet.\nNow that Biden had actually ended his campaign, Harris would have to seize the nomination. She’d struggled with staff turnover during her first two years in office, but by 2024 she’d assembled a strong team, led by Voles; Sheila Nix, a senior adviser; Kirsten Allen, her comms director; and Brian Fallon, her senior comms adviser. They swiftly activated a formidable political machine. “There was a political operation in place that was minding her p’s and q’s well ahead of the ticket switch,” said an adviser. “We just were able to immediately utilize it for the sake of a whipping operation to secure the nomination.”\nBy that point a dozen Harris advisers had joined the vice president around her dining room table. Laptops open, cell phones buzzing, they were wrangling support from around the country. Suddenly, Harris shouted: “Could someone please get hold of my husband?” She’d called the second gentleman three times and got his voicemail—he was on a stationary bike at SoulCycle in San Francisco. Next, Harris stepped into the turret of the castle-like residence so she could speak without being overheard.\nFirst, she called Bill and Hillary Clinton. They offered their support and an immediate endorsement. She then called the Obamas. The 44th president was supportive but said he wanted to wait a few days before endorsing her to avoid the appearance of a coronation. (By now, Obama evidently preferred the appearance of a process to an actual open primary.) Michelle was not only all in, she also offered to campaign with Harris, something she hadn’t done for Biden.\nHarris’s next calls were to potential rivals for the nomination: governors Roy Cooper, Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, JB Pritzker, and Gavin Newsom. Some asked Harris what the “process” would be. She replied crisply that it should be settled in the normal way: Whoever earned a majority of the pledged delegates would win the nomination. Period. Cooper, Whitmer, Shapiro, and Newsom offered Harris their support that same day; Arizona senator Mark Kelly followed suit. (Outreach to potential running mates—she eventually chose Minnesota governor Tim Walz—wouldn’t begin for another week.)\nEarly in the afternoon the enormity of what was happening struck Harris. It was a moment none of her advisers and friends would forget. The vice president called her pastor and put him on speakerphone. Reverend Amos C. Brown, 83, led Harris, Voles, Nix, and Allen in prayer, asking God for guidance and wisdom for the good of the country. “What does the Lord require of you but to do justice,” he said, reciting from Micah 6:8, “and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” The vice president was verklempt, in tears. “She welled up, for sure,” said an adviser. “We all did.”\nBy 10 p.m. at the Naval Observatory, jigsaw pieces were still strewn across the kitchen table. But the puzzle of Harris’s nomination had been solved. She’d called more than 100 people. Not a single potential rival had challenged her. By Monday, Harris had the backing of a majority of Democrats in Congress. Within 48 hours she had the support of most delegates who would be at the convention. A senior adviser summed up Harris’s two-day marathon as a political tour de force: “A lot of people were like, ‘We need a process.’ Well, there is a process: getting the delegates to commit. We just needed to do it and we did it.”\nA campaign has a gravitational pull, and chief of staff Voles was feeling it. “You get sucked into the momentum,” she said. “Like you believe it. I’ve been on winning ones and losing ones, and this felt more like [Bill] Clinton’s [in 1992] than [Michael] Dukakis’s [in 1988].” Voles wasn’t talking poll numbers or analytics, but intangibles. “The rallies were so big and so enthusiastic. People were lining the streets.” But Harris’s pollsters didn’t share the kumbaya cohesion. One ex-Biden campaign official couldn’t understand all the heady talk. “They still had consistent polling results that showed her down by two in every state,” she said, “and Trump always overperforms. How the hell were they going to make that up?”\nOn election morning Harris gathered with her family in the front part of the house while, in the back, Nix, campaign chief of staff Voles, and others monitored returns. O’Malley Dillon and company were running the campaign nerve center at the Marriott Marquis hotel near Howard University with an army of data crunchers, keeping Harris and her inner circle informed as returns came in.\nThe vice president was hunkered down with her family. “We saw her maybe one time that whole night,” said one of her close insiders, when the VP “came back” to their section of the house. As the evening wore on, “it was just like, ‘What’s going on?’ The SG [second gentleman] would come in. Doug would say, ‘What’s happening?’ ” The realization grew that it was going to be a difficult night. One key indicator: Voles had summoned a photographer and a videographer. They were supposed to head to the Howard University campus with Harris for her victory speech. Instead, they cooled their heels.\nThe moment of truth came just after midnight. O’Malley Dillon huddled with her two best analytics experts. They were her barometer, her North Star, and when they told her they did not see a path, O’Malley Dillon knew there wasn’t one. She called the vice president. “We’re down in the blue wall states, and we’re not going to be able to make it up,” she said. “Oh, my God,” said Harris. “What is going to happen to this country?”\nSuddenly, the race was over, as though someone had thrown a switch. “We sent people home,” said a Harris aide. “And then, ‘Find Cedric.’ ” Cedric Richmond, a Harris confidant, was tapped to deliver the bad news to the faithful at Howard University. He took the stage at 12:45 a.m. There would be no declaration of victory that night. There would be no Harris presidency.\nJust after 1 a.m., O’Malley Dillon faced one of her most daunting tasks. She had to call her 12-year-old twin daughters. They’d gone knocking on doors for Harris in Arizona that weekend and were totally invested in the campaign. They’d sent their mother a note saying they had to go to bed, but that they knew the numbers were going to turn for Harris. O’Malley Dillon called them on FaceTime to give them the news. And that was the moment when the steely, take-​no-prisoners campaign chair broke down.\nAs Harris’s devastated followers departed the campus courtyard, the ground was littered with discarded American flags and Harris-Walz posters. The inspiring lightning-speed campaign had imploded. So too, in ways too numerous to count, had its defiant theme, “We Are Not Going Back.”\n\nFrom the forthcoming book Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History by Chris Whipple.

He is campaigning against Mark Carney, an international banker and Goldman Sachs executive who replaced the disgraced Justin Trudeau as head of Canada’s Liberal Party.\n\nThe two parties are close in the polls as Poilievre slams Carney for supporting Trudeau’s very unpopular immigration policy.\n\nIn 2015, the investor-led Century Initiative persuaded Trudeau to grow the economy by inflating the nation’s population from 36 million to 100 million by 2100. Since then, Trudeau has imported four million migrants — or 10 percent of the nation’s population, which is the equivalent of 33 million migrants in the United States.\n\nThat huge population of legal migrants — which includes many Indians and migrants who are too old to work — inflicted an economic shock and massive economic damage to 30 million ordinary Canadians.\n\nIt cut wages, exacerbated healthcare shortages, and spiked housing costs. It dropped workplace productivity and reduced corporate research. It also imported criminals, unexpected sanitary habits, unfamiliar foreign conflicts, and strange ethnic resentments.\n\nBut the pocketbook and civic damage also wrecked Trudeau’s political career. So the party replaced Trudeau with Carney the international banker, who is now promising to continue the nation-wrecking immigration policy.\n\nHowever, Canada’s major investors and older citizens gained enormously. Trudeau’s mass migration inflated the stock market by 40 percent with a flood of consumers, renters, and low-wage workers.\n\nIn the run-up to the April 28 national election, Poilievre is wrapping the Century Initiative around Carney’s political neck. On Monday, he told a student journalist:\n\nI will stop the insanity. I’m against of the Century Initiative. I voted against the Century Initiative in the House of Commons when it came up. It’s a radical, crazy idea meant for multinational corporate elites to bring in people from poor countries in large numbers, to take away Canadian jobs, drive wages down and profits up.\n\nPoilievre also promised lower migration:\n\nI want people to come here to numbers that can actually be housed, employed, and cared for — like we used to have. We used to have a great system. You know, people from around the world came here with nothing but a dream and a suitcase, and it worked. But in the last 10 years of the liberals, it’s got totally out of control. They’re growing the population by 1.2 million people a year and we’re only building 200,000 homes [a year], so our population is growing three times faster than our housing stock … I’m going to slow immigration down, and I have a very simple mathematical formula.\nThe numbers we will let in this year will have to be lower than the number of homes we built in the previous year. So we’re always going to be adding homes faster than we add people.\n\nThat focus on migration’s economic damage is more aggressive than Trump’s 2024 focus on migrant crime.\n\nPoilievre is also spotlighting Carney’s pro-migration advisor, Mark Wiseman who founded the Century Initiative. “By bringing on Mr. Wiseman, it shows that Mark Carney supports the liberal Century Initiative to nearly triple our population to 100 million,” Poilievre said on March 21.\n\nWiseman is a former investor for the Canadian government, then a top banker at BlackRock until he was forced out, and is now a top advisor to Carney. In 2020, Wiseman touted mass migration as a way to offset government deficits, preserve government welfare spending, and expand business:\n\n“We have to invest in this country [via mass migration] … In fact, I believe that the vast majority of growth that we’ve had in Canada since the Second World War has come from the fact that we have brought new Canadians into our economy … Those Canadians pay taxes, those Canadians start businesses, those Canadians are entrepreneurial, and those Canadians are consumers, the new Canadians … I would personally advocate increasing our current immigration levels to somewhere closer to 500,000 [a year] … Keep in mind, these are consumers, these are taxpayers. These are people who are going to help us grow.\n\nIn May 2023, Wiseman retweeted an op-ed that urged more migration, saying “100 million Canadians by 2100 may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.” The article justified mass migration by saying:\n\nLarger populations mean lower fixed costs, per capita, and other economies of scale. At higher population density, transportation costs are lower. Larger economies typically generate more companies, meaning more competition for consumers. More startups and more innovators mean more chances of coming up with a “unicorn” product that conquers export markets. And so on.\n\nWiseman’s policies were repeatedly praised by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration border czar, Alejandro Mayorkas. In September, the Cuban-border Mayorkas said:\n\nWe look to the north, with Canada. Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive.\nWe [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it.\n\nMayrokas and his pro-migration business allies imported at least 12 million legal, semi-legal, and illegal migrants, so helping cause the political defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrats’ myriad interest groups.\n\nSince November, President Donald Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance, has repeatedly spotlighted the economic damage caused by mass migration.\n\nMore Canadians are recognizing the damage. “Per capita output in 2022 was roughly the same as in 2017,” The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on March 23. “Benjamin Reitzes, a macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, recently noted that the average annual growth in real GDP over the past 10 years was 1.8 per cent, but only 0.6 per cent after adjustments were made for population gains.”\n\nCarney, however, is trying to dodge the damage caused by mass migration by touting support from movie actor Mike Myers, spotlighting President Trump’s tariff plans, offering a complex economic plan and a rival tax cut, and promising to deregulate the economy and help Canadians:\n\nBut he is being forced to talk about immigration.\n\nOn March 23, for example, he promised to raise immigration and lamented the pocketbook damage to migrants — not Canadians — when he was asked if he would lower or raise migration inflows. Carney answered:\n\n Yeah, this is an important question. So the way I would characterize the situation is that post-Covid, there was a surge in immigration, both in temporary foreign workers and in foreign students, as well as permanent immigration.\n[But] we have not lived up to the bargain with those [immigrant] people. There’s not adequate housing [for immigrants], not everyone who came here for an education could get an education they would expect. And a consequence of that and many other aspects, but a [political] consequence of that is new caps that have been put in place on much lower levels of immigration, including temporary foreign workers, including foreign students. Those caps, or something similar to those levels, in my judgment, need to remain in place until we’ve expanded housing, [until] we’ve reabsorbed the levels of immigration that have happened in our country.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadians continue to suffer from mass migration. This month, a Canadian woman bitterly complained that she has to wait 13 months to get an MRI for a suspected brain tumor:\n\nI need an MRI to see if I have a fucking brain tumor. And go ahead, cuess what [date] it is? Go ahead. Guess! It is in 2026. 2026! … Cool. Canada, where healthcare is free, but only If you can afford to wait.","summary":"Canada's conservative leader wants to win the nation's April 28 national elections and is hammering Justin Trudeau's replacement for supporting the massive legal immigration that has caused massive pocketbook damage to ordinary Canadians.\n\n\nThe post Canada&#8217;s Conservative Party Promises to Cut Mass Economic Migration appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/25/canadas-conservative-party-promises-to-cut-mass-economic-migration/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/03/Pierre-Poilievre-1-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 09:12:16","author":"Neil Munro,President Joe Biden","authors":["Neil Munro","President Joe Biden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":303889594,"title":"The Existential Threat of Ultra-Billionaires","text":"Elon Musk has long boasted that he is a climate hero. By selling electric vehicles, he claimed to inaugurate a future of zero-carbon transportation. “The fundamental intention of Tesla, at least my motivation, was to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy,” he once said.\n\nThe climate benefits of EVs can be overstated. They are certainly better for the climate than gas-powered cars, but they require a lot of emissions to produce, and there are still secondary emissions from the electricity needed to charge them, depending on where you live.\n\nBut whatever climate bona fides Musk had previously established are now going directly out the window. Musk, as shadow president in the Trump administration, is overseeing the utter devastation of Joe Biden’s ambitious climate program. As Heatmap News has covered in detail, solar and especially wind are slumping as Trump threatens to slash federal subsidies. Republicans are likely to gut at least some of the Inflation Reduction Act (Biden’s marquee climate law) to make budget headroom for tax cuts for the rich. Federal funding for EV chargers has been slashed, and even existing chargers are being torn out at federal buildings.\n\nWhy? Certainly some of it comes down to Musk melting his brain into a fine slurry interacting with his neo-Nazi pals on Twitter/X. And there’s a ruthless economic calculus here: Because Tesla is far ahead of its counterparts on electric vehicles (or at least was), it can give up subsidies, which will have the effect of crippling its competition.\n\nBut there is also a concrete reason: Kamala Harris’s proposed tax on billionaires.\n\nPolitical scientist Adam Bonica provides a convincing argument along these lines. Musk’s behavior is even more curious when you take into account how much better Democratic administrations are for billionaires than Republican ones over the last 40 years. The reason is Democrats have presided over growing economies, which boost the stock market, while Republican ones—because they always, always screw everything up—typically lead to recessions if not financial crises.\n\nBut Harris, for the first time in decades in a presidential campaign, proposed doing something about soaring wealth inequality: a 25 percent tax on “unrealized gains” over $100 million. This is a reference to how billionaires have rigged the system to pay almost nothing in taxes. They take nominal salaries, or none at all, and instead receive their compensation as packages of stock and options. So long as you don’t actually sell these assets, you never have to pay the capital gains tax.\n\n“They borrow against their assets, deduct the interest payments, and live lavishly without ever realizing taxable income,” Bonica writes. And when they die, they avoid the estate tax through the “stepped-up basis” loophole, which allows their heirs to start the capital gains tax counter from zero, starting the whole process over again. Presto: a self-perpetuating oligarchy.\n\nFacing a threat to their wealth, billionaires mobilized to an unprecedented degree. As Bonica outlines, back in 2008, donations over $10 million made up just 4 percent of contributions for Republican campaigns. But in 2024, they made up fully 56 percent—and of a much larger pie. Those mega-donors paid just $58 million in 2008, but last year they paid $2.472 billion, almost two and a half times what they spent in 2020. Elon Musk by himself accounted for more than a tenth of that money, and much more than that if you include his purchase of Twitter as a political act. Without this money, Trump likely would not have won.\n\nThe hysteria of this reaction should be emphasized. Had she won, Harris’s billionaire tax plan almost certainly would not have become law. The more easily bribed fraction of her own party’s caucus, amounting to maybe a quarter of representatives and senators, would be dead set against it. (Witness the appalling spectacle of Senate Democrats shilling for the crime-ridden crypto industry.) If that somehow failed, the reactionary Supreme Court majority, in between ultra-luxurious vacations funded by their billionaire pals, could be expected to declare it unconstitutional.\n\nA savvy billionaire, in other words, would have dismissed Harris’s plan as unrealistic, and supported her against her criminal madman opponent. A few like Mark Cuban did so (though he also threatened to turn against Harris should her idea become law). Even Harris herself went quiet on the whole plan in the homestretch of the campaign. But the mere suggestion of a tax on their hoards of wealth drove many more of them into a frenzy.\n\nThe outrageous unfairness of all this is practically beyond description. A just tax is imposed according to one’s ability to pay, so the rich pay more. For ordinary income, that is indeed the case. But the people with the greatest possible ability to pay—people with resources exceeding entire countries—react with snarling outrage at the prospect of paying anything at all.\n\nProPublica illustrated the billionaire tax-avoidance machine with the leaked tax returns of several top billionaires some years ago. Counting wealth increases as income, Musk paid the most at 3.27 percent between 2014 and 2018, while Warren Buffett paid the least at just 0.1 percent. In one year, Jeff Bezos made so little traditional income that he claimed and received the Child Tax Credit, which at the time phased out at a household income over $150,000. So much for means-testing!\n\nOne couldn’t ask for greater proof of the extreme danger of hyperconcentrated wealth. When the Citizens United decision, which scrapped most controls on political spending, came down in 2010, many worried it would lead to greater influence of money in politics. But the idea that within 15 years a handful of ultra-rich people would buy an election outright, and the richest one of all would seize direct personal control of the entire federal bureaucracy, would have seemed like ridiculous hyperbole to all but a few.\n\nYet that is exactly what happened. One megalomaniac billionaire is leveraging his extreme wealth to tear the American system of government to shreds. Every American is under dire threat—to our freedom, our health care, our economic security, our basic way of life. That includes no small risk to billionaires themselves. American capitalism depends utterly on the foundation of federal laws and regulations—there is no such thing as “ownership” without the rule of law, as some Russian oligarchs have learned at the cost of their fortunes or their lives.\n\nAnd there is no greater threat to America over the long term than climate change. Under Biden, America was for the first time doing its part to combat the threat posed by warming temperatures, which can be seen in a weekly catalog of devastating weather disasters around the country. Now one billionaire, who previously posed as a great climate hero, is doing all in his considerable power to increase emissions and strangle the development of renewable energy.\n\nThat in turn underscores the need for confiscatory taxation of extreme wealth. Allowing anyone to possess that much money is an existential danger to American democracy and society. It simultaneously drives them mad with power and gives them the resources to destroy us all, including themselves.","summary":"A handful of rich guys will burn human society to the ground rather than pay a dime in tax.","url":"https://prospect.org/power/2025-03-25-existential-threat-ultra-billionaires-elon-musk/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22655/download/Cooper-Ultra-billionaires%20032525.jpg?cb=eefc595458d53d39607b045d556a1aea&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 09:00:00","author":"Ryan Cooper","authors":["Ryan Cooper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":303862846,"title":"US Trade Representative Brendan Lynch To Visit India From Today | Trump Tariff Deadline | News18","text":"Donald Trump Officials Accidentally Texted A Journalist Top-Secret War Plans | Trump News | N18G\n\nDonald Trump's F-47 vs China's J-36: Who Is Ahead In The Sixth-Generation Fighter Jet Race?\n\nWill Kamala Harris Run For California Governor?

But the cost of living made it impossible for me to give my children the life they deserve.”\n\nShe said she lived in a “progressive” city in a southern state classed as “deeply red” for its backing of Donald Trump and the Republican Party.\n\n“I cannot vote, but that has never stopped me from being politically active,” she said.\n\nThe woman added that her advocacy began in Bermuda, where she was “vocal about racial justice and marriage equality issues — and it has continued in the US because I refuse to be silent in the face of injustice”.\n\nShe said she had attended local protests in support of Palestinians, LGBTQ+ rights and women’s reproductive rights while “remaining cautious of large-scale demonstrations due to the real risk of my green card being revoked”.\n\nHer actions have included donations to “organisations that bail out protesters and those fighting for gun reform”.\n\nShe said she had called attention to Trump’s remarks at a pre-election rally last October on the death of Amber Thurman, whose passing in 2024 was linked to the state of Georgia’s abortion ban.\n\nShe also spoke out against Trump’s disparaging claims regarding Haitian immigrants.\n\nConsidering herself a political liberal, she said she had aligned with the Democratic party during the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris last year, including knocking on doors, handing out pamphlets, making phone calls, sharing information online and donating to the Harris campaign.\n\n“I believed in democracy, in the right to speak freely, and in the idea that participation mattered — even if I couldn’t cast a ballot myself,” she said.\n\n“But now, under the Trump-Vance-Musk administration, I am terrified.\n\n“The recent disappearance of a green card holder, a legal immigrant, because he organised a protest for Palestine is proof that even permanent residency offers no protection.”\n\nMr Khalil, an Algerian citizen and green card holder, was arrested and held on March 8 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.\n\nAlthough charged with no crime, he was detained under provisions of the US Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 pertaining to persons attracting “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”.\n\nMr Trump’s second presidential campaign came with a vow to cancel the visas of international students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, and he followed through on it this January, as President, with an executive order.\n\nOther high-profile examples of the changing political climate in the US included a French scientist’s denial of entry to the country this month after immigration officials unearthed criticism of the Trump Administration on his phone.\n\nLast Thursday, members of a British punk rock band, UK Subs, were barred entry. Their best guess was that the refusal was a result of their outspoken criticism of the President during concerts.\n\nThe Bermudian woman who spoke with the Gazette said she considered activism a matter of “making this country a better, safer place for my children”.\n\n“As Black, LGBTQ+ young women, they face multiple layers of discrimination — and I want to ensure that the country they see as their home is a place where they can thrive,” she said.\n\n“Freedom of speech should apply to all of us, yet Trump has openly called people like me ‘the enemy within’ and has even floated the idea of deporting US citizens.\n\n“If they can come for citizens, what chance do green card holders have?\n\n“I have built a life here over the past decade. I own a home. I work hard. My children depend on me. But what happens if Ice comes for me in the middle of the night? Who will know what to do?\n\n“My family is in Bermuda. My children could be left confused and alone, unsure of where I am or how to help me. That thought is terrifying. If I were to leave the US, I would want to do it on my own terms, not be forcibly removed from the life I built. But the fear is real because it is happening to others, right now.”\n\nShe said she had emigrated to the US as “the next best option, a place where I could build stability, own a home, and create a future for my family”.\n\n“And now, after nearly ten years of hard work and sacrifice, I have to live with the fear that it could all be taken from me.\n\n“I never seriously considered US citizenship before. I love being Bermudian. I never saw myself as needing an American passport to feel secure. But now, it feels like the only way to protect my future here.\n\n“And yet, applying feels like a risk in itself. What if, during the process, they see my political activism and decide to deny my application? What if they revoke my green card instead? What if Ice shows up at my door because I dared to oppose Trump?”\n\nShe added: “This is not paranoia. Green card holders, people who have committed no crimes, are being detained at airports, sent to Ice detention centres and treated as if they have no rights.\n\n“Their only offence is being from a country Trump disapproves of, speaking out against him, or simply being an immigrant of colour. And many Americans, particularly White Americans, are comfortable with this, as long as it’s happening to people they already see as outsiders.”\n\nShe said she had begun to censor herself online for fear that “my words could be used against me”.\n\nShe called the atmosphere “suffocating”.\n\n“Worse, my fear isn’t just for myself, it’s for my children,” she said.\n\n“One is a US citizen, but the other is not. Could she be targeted because of her association with me? Could she face consequences simply for canvassing with me in support of Kamala?\n\n“We never think that exercising our political rights will make us a target, until it does.”\n\nShe said she counted herself lucky to come from a politically stable country, in the event she should be sent home.\n\n“Bermuda is not at war, overrun by gangs, or ravaged by sickness or political unrest,” she said.\n\n“My loving family is there, waiting with open arms. That in itself is a privilege, and I don’t take it for granted. But that privilege doesn’t erase the fear of having the life I built ripped away from me.\n\n“It doesn’t lessen the devastation of losing my home, my career and the security I worked so hard to create for my children. And it certainly doesn’t make it any easier to think about how much worse it must feel for other immigrants of colour who don’t have that safety net.”\n\nShe added: “This is the reality of being an immigrant, a Black immigrant, in America today.\n\n“You live in constant fear. Fear of what you say, who you support, where you go, and whether the life you built will be ripped away from you in an instant. And that fear? It’s paralysing.”","summary":"A Bermudian permanent resident of the United States has described a climate of anxiety for green card holders over reprisals by the country’s new administration against people from overseas airing lef...","url":"https://www.royalgazette.com/politics/news/article/20250325/living-in-fear-bermudian-in-us-on-immigration-crackdown/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.rgb.navigacloud.com/?uuid=cf219567-ee25-5282-aab1-5acfea309274&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 08:15:00","author":"Ted Shaffrey","authors":["Ted Shaffrey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bm","sentiment":-0.11}]}
