He began his speech with, “As I was saying,” and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began.\n\nThe Trump campaign worked to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with “God Bless the USA,” frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally.\n\n“We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,” Trump said. “And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We’ve bled.”\n\nTrump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states.\n\nAt the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang “Ave Maria” after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13.\n\nStanding behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin “a vicious monster” and said he did not succeed “by the hand of providence and the grace of God.” There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.\n\nOne of the most anticipated guests of the evening was Musk, who climbed onto the stage on Saturday jumping and pumping his fists in the air after Trump introduced him as a “great gentleman” and said he “saved free speech.”\n\n“President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,” said Musk, who endorsed Trump after the assassination attempt. “This is a must-win situation.”\n\nMusk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has embraced conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a black “Make America Great Again” hat. A billboard on the way into the rally said, “IN MUSK WE TRUST,” and showed his photo.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, got on stage and reflected on the events that day while severely criticizing Democrats for calling Trump “a threat to democracy,” saying that kind of language is “inflammatory.”\n\n“You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, ‘Fight, fight!’” said Vance, who was chosen as his vice presidential nominee less than two days later. “Now I believe it as sure as I’m standing here today that what happened was a true miracle.”\n\nCrowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. A massive crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the expansive field stretching to the venue’s edges. Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers arrived Friday.\n\nMuch of the crowd waited several hours for Trump. About half an hour into his speech, Trump paused his speech for more than five minutes after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic.\n\nTrump used the event to remember Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters.\n\nThe building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence. Most bleachers were now at the sides, rather than behind Trump.\n\nHow Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among many questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive.\n\nButler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week that “everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is done safely and correctly.”\n\nMike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the Secret Service, was deploying ”quadruple the assets” it did in July. The agency has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two attempts on Trump’s life.\n\nButler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of the county’s 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% something else.\n\nChris Harpster, 30, of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, was accompanied by his girlfriend on Saturday as he returned to the scene. Of July 13, he said, “I was afraid” — as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him immediately after the shots rang out.\n\nHeightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican nominee’s stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of concern over gas and oil industry jobs.\n\nOther townspeople were divided over the value of Trump’s return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump’s last visit fanned political tensions in the city.\n\n“Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don’t want to see him reelected,” she said.\n\nTerri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her 18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her. “I just figure we need to not let fear control us. That’s what the other side wants is fear. If fear controls us, we lose,” she said.\n\nShe said she was not worried about her own safety.\n\n“Honesty, I believe God’s got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we’re rooting for him.”\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Trump campaign wanted to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing potential with just&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump goes back to the location in Pennsylvania where an assassination attempt took place to hold a significant rally in a crucial swing state. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-goes-back-to-the-location-in-pennsylvania-where-an-assassination-attempt-took-place-to-hold-a-significant-rally-in-a-crucial-swing-state/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1728173603_rewrite-this-title-Trump-returns-to-site-of-Pennsylvania-assassination.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 00:14:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":258616760,"title":"After the deluge, the lies: Misinformation and hoaxes about Helene cloud the recovery","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The facts emerging from Hurricane Helene’s destruction are heartrending: Businesses and homes destroyed, whole communities nearly wiped out, hundreds of lives lost, hundreds of people missing.\n\nYet this devastation and despair is not enough for the extremist groups, disinformation agents, hucksters and politicians who are exploiting the disaster to spread false claims and conspiracy theories about it and the government’s response.\n\nAccording to former President Donald Trump, the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. Far-right extremist groups warn on social media that officials plan to bulldoze affected communities and seize the land from residents. A tale straight from science fiction asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThe claims, according to experts and local officials dealing with disaster response, say less about the reality of the widespread damage from Helene than they do about America’s fractured politics and the fear and distrust shadowing an election year marked by assassination attempts and escalating global tension.\n\nDebunking conspiracy theories takes time away from recovery efforts\n\nAs rescue work continues and authorities try to separate fact from fiction, the conspiracy theories are not helping. Elected leaders from both parties have had to set the record straight and urge people not to give into fear and rumor.\n\n“If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great,” posted Glenn Jacobs, the retired professional wrestler known as Kane, who is now the Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Jacobs’ post was intended to rebut rumors that workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were seizing relief supplies from private citizens.\n\nMany of the conspiracy theories focus on hard-hit North Carolina, a state key to winning the White House. Rumors circulated that FEMA was raiding storm donations and withholding body bags, forcing local hospitals to stack the bodies of victims. One claim suggested federal authorities would condemn the entire town of Chimney Rock and prohibit resettlement in order to commandeer a valuable lithium mine nearby.\n\nFalse claims of blocked relief flights and aid withheld from Republicans\n\nElon Musk, the owner of Tesla, X and SpaceX, posted that private relief flights to North Carolina were being blocked by the Federal Aviation Administration, a claim dismissed as false by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nDespite the tradition of Democrats and Republicans putting aside politics for disaster response, many conspiracy theories suggest Democrats such as President Joe Biden or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are intentionally withholding aid from Republicans. Trump has pushed the claim, as has North Carolina’s lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, the embattled GOP nominee for governor.\n\n“They’re being treated very badly in the Republican areas,” Trump told Fox News, ignoring reports and photo and video evidence of recovery efforts underway throughout the region. “They’re not getting water, they’re not getting anything.”\n\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones endorsed Trump’s fact-free allegation. Jones, the founder of InfoWars, popularized the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children in 2012 was faked. “Exclusive: Victims of Hurricane Helene Confirm The Federal Government is Purposely Blocking Rescuers and Stealing Aid In an Attempt to Keep Deep Red Areas From Voting,” Jones posted Thursday on X.\n\nDisinformation campaigns by China and Russia amplify the misleading claims\n\nState-run media and disinformation campaigns run by China and Russia have amplified false and misleading claims about the response to the storm. Both countries have used social media and state news stories to criticize responses to past U.S. natural disasters, part of a larger effort to stoke division and distrust among Americans.\n\nState and local officials from both parties have condemned the conspiracy theories as rumors, saying the focus should be on recovery, not political division and hearsay. Responding to the hoaxes is taking up time that should go toward assisting victims, said North Carolina state Sen. Kevin Corbin, a Republican who urged his constituents not to give into hoaxes.\n\n“Friends can I ask a small favor?” Corbin posted Thursday on Facebook. “Will you all help STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet… Please don’t let these crazy stories consume you.”\n\nAfter Robinson, the GOP candidate for North Carolina governor, posted that state officials had not prepared for the storm, a spokesman for the governor accused Robinson of mounting “an online disinformation campaign.” North Carolina officials say the response to Helene is the largest in state history, including thousands of members of the National Guard and other recovery workers, millions of meals, dozens of aircraft and more than 1,000 chainsaws.\n\nTrump has tried to tie the hurricane’s aftermath to immigration, a leading issue of his campaign. He falsely claimed that FEMA had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe agency’s funding for disaster aid is stretched, but that is because of the many parts of the country dealing with the effects of hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities. Disaster aid is funded separately from other Department of Homeland Security programs that support immigration-related spending.\n\nFar-out tales of space lasers, fake snow and weather control technology\n\nBizarre stories proposing that the government used weather control technology to aim the hurricane at Republican voters quickly racked up millions of views on X and other platforms.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., endorsed the idea, posting Wednesday on X: “Yes they can control the weather. It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”\n\nFar-out tales of space lasers, fake snow and weather control technology — sometimes tinged with antisemitism — have spread after recent natural disasters, including a snowstorm in Texas and last year’s wildfire in Maui.\n\nExperts who study conspiracy theories say big events like disasters — or the Sept. 11 attacks or the COVID-19 pandemic — create perfect conditions for conspiracy theories to spread because large numbers of anxious people are eager to find explanations for shocking events.\n\nResponding to the volume of false claims about Helene, the Red Cross urged people to consult trustworthy sources of information and to think twice before reposting conspiracy theories.\n\n“Sharing rumors online without first vetting the source and verifying facts ultimately hurts people — people who have just lost their homes, neighborhoods, and, in some cases, loved ones,” the organization wrote in a public plea.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

The former president specifically targeted Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing her of neglecting her duties during the crisis.The death toll from Hurricane Helene has now reached a staggering 227 across six states, according to CNN's tally.The latest figure puts Helene as the second-deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in the past half-century, surpassed only by Hurricane Katrina, which claimed at least 1,833 lives in 2005.The impact of Helene has been particularly severe in North Carolina, where 113 deaths have been reported. South Carolina follows with 48 fatalities, while Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia have also suffered losses. The rising death toll has intensified scrutiny of the federal government's response to the disaster.As Politico reports, the timing and location of Hurricane Helene have thrust it into the spotlight of the upcoming presidential election. The storm's devastating impact on key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina has made it a pivotal issue in the race, with both campaigns acutely aware of the political implications.Trump has been quick to seize the narrative, visiting affected areas before President Biden and Vice President Harris. The former president and the Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp shook hands last Friday during a meeting to discuss further relief efforts in the state.With polls in Georgia showing an extremely tight 2024 race, Trump has since changed his tune on the governor, who he previously called \"disloyal,\" and thanked Kemp for his \"help and support\" in a recent Truth Social post.The Biden administration, meanwhile, has been working to counter claims of negligence following the storms. Vice President Harris visited Augusta, Georgia on Wednesday, October 3, meeting with those distributing aid and cleaning up after the storm.Newsweek contacted Trump and Harris' campaign via email on Saturday for comment.During her speech, Harris outlined the federal government's relief efforts, including immediate cash disbursements and longer-term emergency funding.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been at the forefront of the relief efforts.According to a press release, the organization has already disbursed over $10 million in \"flexible and upfront\" assistance to the affected states. FEMA as shipped over 8.8 million meals, more than 7.4 million liters of water, 150 generators, and more than 225,000 tarps to the storm zone.Despite these efforts, more than 460,000 customers across five states remain without power more than a week after Helene made landfall. South Carolina leads with over 170,000 outages, followed closely by North Carolina with nearly 145,000 customers in the dark.Politico notes that the political impact of Hurricane Helene could be significant. In the 25 North Carolina counties designated for FEMA assistance, nearly one million votes were cast in 2020. In Georgia, close to 650,000 votes were cast in the more than 40 FEMA-designated counties.With both states currently showing Trump leading by only a single percentage point in polling averages, the government's response to Helene could sway the election outcome.","summary":"Trump calls Helene \"the worst Hurricane Response by a president and vice president since Katrina,\" as Harris defends federal aid efforts.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-hurricane-helene-kamala-harris-katrina-1964449","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488428/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 00:11:01","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":258616698,"title":"Musk Launches PAC to Back Candidates Focused on Secure Borders, Free Speech, Sensible Spending","text":"“This is the PAC that I created to support candidates who believe in the core values of America,” Musk wrote in a post on X on Oct. 5.\n\nAmerica PAC’s mission statement, posted on social media, outlines its focus areas: secure borders, safe cities, a fair justice system, self-protection, and free speech.

(AP) — Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris pledged ongoing federal support and praised the “heroes among us” as she visited North Carolina on Saturday in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, her second trip in four days to the disaster zone.\n\nThe vice president was in Charlotte one day after a visit to the state by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster.\n\nHarris opened her visit by attending a briefing with state and local officials, where she thanked “those who are in the room and those who are out there right now working around the clock.”\n\nShe promised federal assistance would continue to flow and added praise for the “strangers who are helping each other out, giving people shelter and food and friendship and fellowship.”\n\nDespite Trump’s claims that the federal response in the state has been “lousy,” Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said the state was “deeply grateful for the federal resources that we have. FEMA has been on the ground with us since the very beginning,” he said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAfter her briefing, Harris helped pack toiletries into aid kits at a distribution center, where she met Angelica Wind from hard-hit Asheville, who was there to volunteer with her daughter and a friend even though Wind said her own family was still without power and people were “just surviving.”\n\n“There’s a lot of resilience,” Wind told Harris, adding that, “We want to make sure people don’t forget about us.”\n\nHarris assured her the federal government was “here for the long haul.”\n\nMelissa Funderbunk told Harris about driving a truck carrying assistance to people in remote Morganton, “where people weren’t coming.”\n\n“You are the heroes among us,” Harris said.\n\nEarlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed.\n\nThe two have been vocal and visible about the government’s willingness to help, and the administration’s efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage.\n\nIn a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund “has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year.” He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program.\n\nMore than 200 people have died. It’s the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change.\n\nBut in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene’s aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it “one of the great scams of all time.”\n\nDuring a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal government “doing a very bad job” in its storm response, with little relief in North Carolina in particular. In fact, Cooper said this week that more than 50,000 people have registered for FEMA assistance and about $6 million has been paid out.\n\nBiden has suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is withholding money for disaster relief needs.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

The contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is super tight, both nationally and in the key states.\n\nSo, how much can we trust the polls?\n\nIt’s a question many are raising after they famously got it so wrong four years ago.\n\nThe American Association for Public Opinion Research called it the biggest polling miss in 40 years, showing Mr Biden’s lead over Mr Trump in the final two weeks of the campaign twice as large as it was when the votes were counted.\n\nIn 2012, pollsters significantly under-estimated Barack Obama’s lead over Mitt Romney. But, while Mr Trump’s 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton shocked many people, the error on the national polls was relatively small by comparison.\n\nOf course, all polls come with uncertainty, some inbuilt error, and they are only a snapshot of the current situation, not a prediction of the outcome on polling day.\n\nCrucially, though, there is evidence they also become a more reliable predictor of the outcome the closer we get to the election. It may seem obvious, but a year out from voting the polls are on average seven points different from the final tally for each candidate. By the last week of the campaign, this falls to less than three points.\n\nEvery day the polls tell us a little bit more about the result.\n\nSo, how should we read them?\n\nOne key thing to remember is the uncertainty around the estimated support for the candidates.\n\nUncertainty: ‘Margin of error’\n\nWhile pollsters publish a percentage figure for each, they also report a ‘margin of error’ to indicate the amount that support might vary.\n\nFor example, if a poll puts Mr Trump on 46% with a three-percentage point margin of error, it means that his support among the voting public should lie between 43% and 49%. If the same poll has Ms Harris on 49%, then her support should lie between 46% and 52%.\n\nAll this tells us is that the contest is close and either candidate could be leading.\n\nSimilar caution is required when looking at trackers using polling averages.\n\nYou might think that averaging the polls would reduce uncertainty, since random errors should cancel out. But some pollsters are consistently more accurate than others, while some may be systematically wrong in one direction. Adding them all together can reinforce those biases.\n\nRead more on the election:What exactly happens on the night of the US election?How does Donald Trump keep his support so strong?\n\nPredicting the turnout: Context matters\n\nWho votes in an election is also critical to the outcome but predicting that is a tough ask for pollsters. Roughly a third of eligible Americans do not cast a ballot in presidential elections, and it isn’t all the same people each time.\n\nContext matters. It can make people more or less likely to vote. For example, potential changes to abortion laws seems to have mobilised many Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nThe policies and performance of a candidate can also change the likelihood of more partisan voters to turnout.\n\nThe Electoral College: Why state contests can be crucial\n\nThe same considerations are needed when looking at state polls and arguably they are more crucial to determining which candidate is most likely to win the election.\n\nThe outcome of a presidential race is decided state by state, by the Electoral College, and the difference between that and the national vote has been growing.\n\nRead more: What is the Electoral College?\n\nIn 2000 and in 2016, the candidate with the most votes nationally lost the election because they didn’t win a combination of states that delivered the highest tally in the Electoral College.\n\nThis is why battleground state polls get so much attention and they are factored into the models of statisticians trying to forecast the outcome.\n\nOf course, they have the same uncertainty and potential flaws as national polls. And the bad news is their recent performance hasn’t been great.\n\nIn 2016 they suggested Ms Clinton would sweep the key states needed for a comfortable win in the Electoral College. In 2020, they fared even worse.\n\nSome states have proven particularly difficult to poll accurately. In 2016 and 2020, the biggest misses were in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThese, especially Pennsylvania, which of the group carries the most Electoral College votes, are all potentially decisive in 2024.\n\nSo, what can the polls tell us?\n\nThe answer is plenty if you are looking for a steer on how people feel about a certain candidate or policy.\n\nBut, if you’re trying to work out who’s ahead in the race to be president, then all you can confidently say is the contest is really close and could come down to a small number of votes in a few states.","summary":"Ask most party strategists, US pollsters or pundits and they&#8217;ll tell you the 2024 presidential election could be the closest in decades, if not a century.

Comperatore’s fire uniform, as it was during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, was prominently displayed for all to see.\n\n“This field is now a monument to the valor of our first responders, to the resilience of our fellow citizens, and to the sacrifice of a loving and devoted father, Corey Comperatore,” Trump said. “Forever after, all who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here and they will know of the character and courage that so many incredible American patriots have showed.”\n\nChants of “Corey, Corey, Corey!” rippled through the crowd before it participated in a moment of silence to Ave Maria for Comperatore and the rallygoers who were injured during Trump’s first assassination attempt.\n\nTrump then returned to his Pennsylvania stump speech, promising, among other things, that his second administration would “frack like we’ve never fracked before.” Energy policy is a wedge issue in the Keystone State.\n\n“I will never bend, I will never break, I will never yield, not even in the face of death,” Trump said. “Who wants open borders? Who wants men playing women’s sports? Who wants sex change operations for illegal aliens?”\n\nTrump did not spare Democrats, alleging they have “slandered” him, “impeached” him, “indicted” him, tried to deny him ballot access, and “maybe even tried to kill [him].”\n\nOf Vice President Kamala Harris, he added, “She ruined San Francisco, she ruined the state of California, and now she wants to ruin the United States of America.”\n\nBillionaire businessman Elon Musk, who has been using his social media platform X to promote Trump and criticize President Joe Biden and now Harris, was in attendance and addressed the crowd, saying he had gone “Dark MAGA,” a reference to his black MAGA hat, and underscoring the importance of voting.\n\n“The true test of one’s character is how they behave under fire,” Musk said. “We had one president who couldn’t climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist-pumping after getting shot.”\n\nTrump was introduced by singer Lee Greenwood, who sang the former president’s walk-up song “God Bless the USA” in person instead of over the sound system. Shortly afterward, one member of the crowd near the press pen needled “the globalist” media, claiming he would “take a bullet” for Trump.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), Trump’s vice presidential nominee, was also part of the program, warmly welcomed to chants of “J.D., J.D., J.D.” Vance, fresh off of his vice presidential debate this week against Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), described Saturday as a “historic day” and one that the crowd would “remember forever.”\n\n“You heard the shots, you saw the blood, we all feared the worst,” Vance said.\n\nVance used the platform to blame Democrats for the raised political temperature, contending at least Trump was the democratically elected Republican presidential nominee as opposed to Harris, despite the vice president repeating that Trump is the “threat to democracy.”\n\n“Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy, what the hell have you done?” Vance asked of Harris. \n\nVance scrutinized Harris for her record of inaction as vice president, citing Hurricane Helene as the most recent instance.\n\nEric Trump, in his remarks, similarly undermined Harris for the Biden administration’s natural disaster response, particularly since battlegrounds North Carolina and Georgia have been devastated by the storm. His father had earlier compared Helene to former President George W. Bush‘s Katrina in 2005. \n\nEric Trump’s wife Lara, who is co-chair of the Republican National Committee, emphasized the importance of election integrity. Campaign staff and grassroots organizers were handing out cards with a voter fraud hotline number on it throughout the day.\n\nCrowds, some wearing their best Trump get-up, started gathering at Butler Family Farms long before the gates opened at 10 a.m., with people bringing picnic rugs and buying snacks at the food trucks parked on the grounds, creating a carnival-like atmosphere, irrespective of the tragedy that had prompted Trump’s return. Campaign staff distributed water, though medical assistance was required multiple times to tend to those who had overheated under the 70-plus Fahrenheit sun.\n\nOne month before the election, Trump and Harris are locked in a tight race for the White House. Although Harris has an edge in national polls, surveys of voters in the seven battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina reveal that the contest is too close to call. In the Keystone State, Trump and Harris are tied, according to RealClearPolitics‘s averages of the pair’s head-to-head polling.\n\nThe election is in a different place from when Trump emerged in the immediate confusion after Crooks fired his weapon with a bloodied face because the shooter had managed to graze the former president’s ear with a bullet. The then-undisputed front-runner had turned his head toward an illegal immigration numbers chart as Crooks pulled his trigger.\n\n“I love that chart,” Trump said on Saturday.\n\nBefore U.S. Secret Service agents surrounded Trump and rushed him from the stage and to safety, the former president instructed them to wait so he could get his shoe and raise his fist and shout, “Fight, fight, fight!” \n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe same chant would echo around the Republican National Convention days later, with convention attendees bandaging their own ears in a demonstration of solidarity with Trump, and in Butler again on Saturday.\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid public pressure over the Butler assassination attempt. Congress passed legislation last week to fund the federal government until Dec. 20, which included $231 million in additional money for the Secret Service, as an independent investigation is ongoing into that incident and a second assassination attempt last month in Florida.","summary":"BUTLER, Pennsylvania — Under a heavy security presence and from behind bullet-proof glass, former President Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, to honor the memory of a rallygoer who was killed three months ago by a bullet that barely missed him, but galvanized his base. &#8220;I return to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3178528/trump-revels-in-return-to-butler-with-musk/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SS-Trump-rally-2.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 00:00:12","author":"Naomi Lim","authors":["Naomi Lim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.31},{"id":258615326,"title":"Elon Musk says Trump ‘must win to preserve democracy’ during ex-prez’s triumphant return to Butler, Pa.","text":"Elon Musk took the stage at former President Donald Trump’s triumphant rally in Butler, Pa., Saturday — three months after the first assassination attempt on his life there — where he offered his full-throated support for the Republican candidate and implored people to register to vote.\n\nMusk, 53, joked he’s “not just MAGA, I’m dark MAGA” as he took the stage to loud cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd dressed in all black — including a custom black MAGA hat.\n\n“President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution.

At Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-related meetings, Yoon says he’ll emphasize that North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace. \n\n“At the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearization of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realizing a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” Yoon said in written responses to questions from the AP.\n\n“This will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea’s reckless actions,” he said.\n\nConcerns about North Korea have grown in recent weeks, with the country unveiling a secretive uranium-enrichment facility, vowing to build more nuclear weapons and continuing its provocative missile tests. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to destroy South Korea with his nuclear weapons, if provoked.\n\nMany foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new U.S. president is elected. They say Kim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, would increase his chances to get what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigns, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won’t “cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.”\n\nThe Sept. 13 disclosure of the nuclear site showed Kim’s defiance of U.S.-led efforts to eliminate his advancing nuclear program. It was North Korea’s first unveiling of a facility to produce weapons-grade uranium since the country showed one at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in 2010.\n\n“North Korea seems to have recently disclosed its nuclear facility in order to draw attention from the United States and the international community in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, and it is likely that North Korea will carry out additional provocations such as nuclear tests and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launches going forward,” Yoon said.\n\nYoon didn’t elaborate whether South Korea has detected any suspicious activities in North Korea that indicate its preparations for nuclear and ICBM tests. He said South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea’s movements through the South Korea-U.S. combined intelligence and surveillance assets.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests since 2006, and numerous ICBM test-launches in recent years. Additional tests are likely meant to further hone its nuclear and missile capabilities. Many observers assess North Korea has yet to possess functioning nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely has ones that can strike all of South Korea and Japan.\n\nSince his inauguration in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has made a stronger military alliance with the United States the center of his foreign policy to cope with North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats. He’s also taken a major step toward moving beyond historical disputes with Japan to beef up a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership. Such moves have enraged North Korea, which has called Yoon “a traitor” and ignored his calls for dialogue. \n\nThere are some potential worries about the South Korea-U.S. alliance if Trump returns to the White House. He had previously asked South Korea to drastically increase its share for the cost of the U.S. military deployment on its soil. Some experts say Trump’s possible push for a new round of negotiation with Kim could complicate Yoon’s approach on North Korea’s nuclear program.\n\nBut Yoon said that he’s confident that the “ironclad” South Korea-U.S. alliance will continue to advance steadily regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election.\n\n“There is a firm bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S. alliance in the United States,” Yoon said. “Numerous leading U.S. Democrats and Republicans have publicly stated their staunch support for the alliance and are continuously visiting Korea for consultations to enhance the bilateral relations.”\n\nThe ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea’s formal name. \n\nYoon also expressed confidence that South Korea and Japan will continue to advance their bilateral ties under Japan’s new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office last week. Yoon’s office said the two countries are discussing arranging a meeting between Yoon and Ishiba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.\n\nYoon said he believes North Korea’s nuclear threats against South Korea are aimed at fomenting internal divisions in South Korea and tightening its domestic control with heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n“The North Korean regime’s past claim that its nuclear development was never intended to target the Republic of Korea, since we are one nation, has been debunked,” Yoon said.\n\nAsked about North Korea’s repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, Yoon said that North Korea “will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand” if the safety of South Korean people is jeopardized. He didn’t elaborate what specific steps his government is considering. \n\nBefore visiting Laos, Yoon is to travel to the Philippines and Singapore. \n\nAt the ASEAN-related summits, Yoon said that a key issue that South Korea plans to raise other than the North Korean nuclear program is the establishment of the ROK-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. He said South Korea will further expand cooperation with ASEAN on a range of areas such as politics, military exchanges, cybersecurity, environments and a safety net against financial crises.","summary":"South Korean leader says North Korea wants US attention by showing off nuclear might  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-north-nuclear-asean-3e6a6839383efed921afc12351e3ba8c","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/b9f2e91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7285x4098+0+381/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc3%2Fc9%2Fd56630013e6e15bc4bc674dd0909%2F16b2edb71318432f824c5932a4133245","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:37:00","author":"Hyung-Jin Kim","authors":["Hyung-Jin Kim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":258615410,"title":"Tim Walz Ventures Into The Lion’s Den With Fox News Interview","text":"Tim Walz will sit down with Fox News anchor Shannon Bream for a Sunday morning interview, the Democratic vice presidential nominee’s first solo on-air conversation since becoming Kamala Harris’ running mate.

(AP) — Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a sprawling rally with a massive crowd of supporters in a critical swing state Trump hopes to return to his column in November’s election.\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left off in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear. He began his speech with, “As I was saying,” and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began.\n\nThe Trump campaign worked to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with “God Bless the USA,” frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally.\n\n“We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,” he said. “And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We’ve bled.”\n\nTrump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states.\n\nAt the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang “Ave Maria” after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13.\n\nStanding behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin “a vicious monster” and said he did not succeed “by the hand of providence and the grace of God.” There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.\n\nOne of the most expected guests of the evening was Musk, who climbed onto the stage on Saturday jumping and pumping his fists in the air after Trump introduced him as a “great gentleman” and said he “saved free speech.”\n\n“President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,” said Musk, who endorsed Trump after the assassination attempt. “This is a must-win situation.”\n\nMusk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has pushed into conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a black “Make America Great Again” hat. A billboard on the way into the rally said, “IN MUSK WE TRUST,” and showed his photo.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, got on stage and reflected on the events that day while severely criticizing Democrats for calling Trump “a threat to democracy,” saying that kind of language is “inflammatory.”\n\n“You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, ‘Fight, fight!’” said Vance, who was chosen as his vice presidential nominee less than two days later. “Now I believe it as sure as I’m standing here today that what happened was a true miracle.”\n\nCrowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. A massive crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the expansive field stretching to the venue’s edges.

As he had suggested he would for weeks beforehand, he began his speech with, “As I was saying,” and gestured toward an immigration chart that he was looking at when the gunfire began.\n\nThe Trump campaign worked to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with “God Bless the USA,” frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk was expected to speak later Saturday.\n\nTrump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states.\n\nEarly in his speech, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang “Ave Maria” after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13.\n\nStanding behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin “a vicious monster” and said he did not succeed “by the hand of providence and the grace of God.”\n\n“We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,\" he said. \"And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We’ve bled.”\n\nBefore Trump's appearance, his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, got on stage at the Butler Farm Show grounds to speak before the former president and reflected on the events that day while severely criticizing Democrats for calling Trump “a threat to democracy,” saying that kind of language is “inflammatory.\"\n\n\"You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, ‘Fight, fight!’\" said Vance, who was chosen as his vice presidential nominee less than two days later. “Now I believe it as sure as I’m standing here today that what happened was a true miracle.”\n\nMusk, who has pushed into conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a black “Make America Great Again” hat. A billboard on the way into the rally said, “IN MUSK WE TRUST,” and showed his photo.\n\nA massive crowd stood shoulder to shoulder from the stage to the press stand several hundred yards away at the event billed as a \"tribute to the American spirit.” Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers arrived Friday.\n\nCrowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.\n\nMuch of the crowd waited several hours for Trump.

We got 32 days until the election,' Harris says.\n\nHowever, she then pauses while casting her eye across the crowd and appears to falter. \n\n'So 32 days, 32 days, Okay,' she continues. 'We got some business to do. We got some business to do. All right. 32 days and we know we will do it,' she adds before pausing as the crowd cheers.\n\n'And, and this is gonna be a very tight race until the very end. This is gonna be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog and we know we have some hard work ahead.' \n\nHer performance was trashed on social media, where viewers branded it 'humiliating'.\n\n'Kamala Harris is the embodiment of the Biden administration's incompetence,' one person said. \n\n'With a teleprompter malfunctioning, all we get is a robotic echo of “32 days.” This isn’t just a gaffe; it’s panic, and a glimpse into the chaotic leadership that will continue to undermine our nation.'\n\n'Look at her face when the teleprompter goes out. Like a deer in the headlights,' another added. \n\nHarris was visiting the union stronghold city in hopes of securing an endorsement from the firefighters' union but suffered another blow.\n\nBut by a slim margin, the International Association of Firefighters declined to back any candidate, a reminder of the Democratic nominee´s struggle to lock down the same support from organized labor that President Joe Biden won four years ago. \n\nThe vice president spoke after basketball legend Magic Johnson, who said 'nobody is going to outwork her,' and UAW President Shawn Fain, who described Trump as 'a scab.'\n\nThe leader of the Michigan firefighters union, Matthew Sahr, still showed up for Harris in Redford Township - although not to bestow the endorsement.\n\n'We could have chosen to stay away. But what kind of message would that send?' Sahr said.\n\n'The vice president is proud to have the support of organized labor, including firefighters across key battlegrounds like those who joined her in Michigan Friday,' said Harris campaign spokesman Brian Fallon.\n\n 'She is the only candidate in this race who always stands with workers and has fought to protect overtime pay, worker pensions, and the right to organize.'\n\n What unfolded nonetheless reflects the shifting loyalties in American politics as Harris vies with Trump for support among working-class voters who for years could be more solidly counted on to support Democrats.\n\nHarris didn't mince words when she spoke at the firehouse, saying Trump 'has been a union-buster his entire career' and would launch a 'full-on attack' against organized labor.\n\nHarris said Trump supports 'right-to-work' laws that often make it more difficult to unionize, and said he had weakened federal employees´ unions. While he was president, Trump used a series of 2018 executive orders designed to reduce those unions´ powers to collectively bargain.\n\nHe has expressed support for right-to-work since his initial run for president in 2016 - while also making comments more generally supportive of labor rights when speaking to union audiences since then.\n\nHarris also accused the former president of 'making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping you will forget how he let you down.'\n\nHer remarks followed U.S. dockworkers suspending their strike in hopes of reaching a new contract, sparing the country a damaging episode of labor unrest that could have rattled the economy.\n\n A tentative agreement that has been hailed by Harris was reached to raise salaries, although other issues still need to be resolved.\n\n She also hit back at Trump's claims she would ban Americans from driving gas cars if elected.\n\n'I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive,' Harris said. 'But here´s what I will do, I will invest in communities like Flint,' she said.\n\nHarris headed to North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene, arriving there one day after a visit by Republican Donald Trump","summary":"The Vice President was addressing crowds in Flint when her teleprompter appeared to malfunction and she was stuck repeating the phrase '32 days'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13928353/kamala-harris-michigan-rally-moment-teleprompter-glitch-flint.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/05/22/90500899-0-image-a-4_1728162429663.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:23:03","author":"Bethan Sexton For,Editor","authors":["Bethan Sexton For","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":258616000,"title":"Gyrations in the education sector (II)","text":"When in February 2023. The then 98 year old Jimmy Carter was admitted into hospice care, many of those who were closest to him were sure that he had only a few days to live. I chose not to wait until he was dead to pay tribute to him and so I celebrated his life in an article. Almost two years on, Jimmy Carter may not be well but he is very much alive. I am writing this on the day of his one hundredth birthday and I am sending him hearty greetings and very best wishes for the rest of his life. Jimmy Carter, like other mortals, has had his fair share of triumphs, failures and even tragedies but through them all, he has remained true to the idles of a genuine human being, a man for all seasons. Since he entered hospice care, he has lost his wife of seventy seven years but he has not allowed this to kill his zest for life. One of his grand sons has been quoted as saying that his grand father is hopeful of living just long enough to cast his vote for his fellow Democrat, Kamala Harris in the up coming presidential elections. Georgia where he has spent his long life is a swing state and his vote may just be important to the outcome of the election. May he live long enough and more to see another Democrat in the White House.\n\nThe First World War battles consumed so many men that conventional wisdom at the end of it was that any ambitious European country needed to have a humungous body of men under arms in order to even think of waging war. After all, the British lost sixty thousand men on the first day of the battle of the Somme and any loss on that scale was not sustainable over a long period. The victorious Allied nations especially France were determined to cripple Germany’s capacity for waging war forever. The ingenuous plan through which they intended to achieve this stern objective was to limit the size of the German army to such a number as to make it nothing more than a ceremonious force. Part of the treaty forced down the constricted throat of the defeated enemy was that her armed forces was to consist of a hundred thousand men only. The German response to this stifling restriction was to build an army in which every member had received advanced officer training of the highest calibre around which a formidable army could be built in a matter of a couple of months. Later on, Germany was able to build up a truly frightening war machine around the spine provided by her highly trained officer corps and had become a serious threat to Europe. This example proves the crucial importance of training to any body of people dedicated to the performance of any task. The purpose of education in any society is to produce that small but critical mass of people to provide leadership to the masses. In Nigeria however, it is apparent that we have dedicated our efforts to train a large body of rabble to provide the leadership needed in a modern, functional society. That choice is making it impossible for the country to build that critical mass needed for the take off which we so badly need to build a coherent society.\n\nRead Also: The Bob that is risky and his entanglements\n\nIn the dim past, at a time when the Nigerian society had a well defined shape, emphasis was placed on giving education to those who have proved their worth, the benefit of outstandingly good education. Even then, the number of people who wanted an education, at least in the southern parts of the country was in considerable excess of available places in the few institutions available. The competition to secure a place in a secondary school for example was a figurative fight to the death as this was recognised as the first crucial step on the ladder to future success. In those days, pupils were attracted to certain primary schools which had acquired a solid reputation for placing their charges in a reputable secondary school. And in any case before the establishment of the Nigerian Colleges in Zaria, Ibadan and Enugu, there were no tertiary institutions in the country. Today, there are probably more institutions rejoicing in the name of university, polytechnic or College of Education than there were primary schools In the period immediately after the Second World War throughout the length and breadth of the country. This begs the question as to the quality of education available in the myriad schools and colleges which are in operation today.\n\nThose of my contemporaries who were in the primary school at the time of Nigerian independence would remember the drill we were put through throughout the period of our stay in the primary school. First, there were those weekly tests, the results of which were carefully written up into our report cards at the end of the week. We delivered up those cards to our parents who went through those reports and were brought up to date with our progress or the lack of it. Then, there were examinations at the end of every term. The end of year examination which arrived with dry harmattan winds were particularly intimidating as they were promotion exams. Those who failed were not promoted to the next class which also meant a miserable Christmas period bereft of any personal celebrations in the midst of general celebrations. The suffering attached to failure was painfully sharp and immediate but more serious on the long term as the avenue to future academic accomplishment was on the verge of terminal blockage. Passing through the primary school was a veritable obstacle course towards the secondary school or, in the Western Region, something called the Modern School.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to a secondary was the entrance examination. In the last year of primary school, ambitious students began to attend lessons in preparation for entrance examinations to various secondary schools. Some teachers were famous for placing a considerable number of their clients into some of the top secondary schools and their afterschool institutions were oversubscribed. I was fortunate in having teacher parents who made sure that my nose was firmly pressed to the grinding stone throughout the period of my preparation for the entrance examination season because merit was the only consideration for success in the secondary school stakes. All my own study was in-house, a situation which I found to be almost intolerably irksome. I was woken up at the crack of dawn and confronted with unappetising exercises at a time when I thought I should still be asleep and when I came home from school, those exercises were waiting to greet me. There was no window of freedom from the grind and when I showed any signs of flagging, my mother reminded me of the dire consequences of failure to spur me on.\n\nI suppose that I now have the privilege of writing this piece because, in the end, I was able to navigate the formidable obstacle course which marked my admission to Igbobi College.\n\nFounded thirty years before I darkened her formidable doors in 1962, the school had acquired an intimidating reputation for elite level education for pupils who had shown that they had the innate ability to cope with the tough demands of the Igbobi College brand. The entrance examination demands were fiendish. The coveted entrance examination form to the school, unlike other schools, was not on open sale but no more than half a dozen forms but frequently fewer were sent to targeted reputable primary schools, to be completed for by the best pupils in the school. To lay hands on the form which qualified one to attend the entrance examination was therefore a little more than a minor triumph. In the language of today, it was a big deal.\n\nAll the boys who turned up at various examination centres on examination day were local champions, those boys whose position in their school examinations were seldom south of third. At that point, they were hoping to score enough points to be invited to participate in the interview process. For most other schools, their interview was over in one day but not Igbobi College. Anxious candidates, about two hundred of them reported at the school on a Friday evening and did not regain their freedom until the following Tuesday morning. During that unforgettable weekend, they were subjected to rigorous tests in English and Arithmetic and a one on one interaction with the principal. High performance in these tests was not enough as the candidates had to show their prowess in athletics and football. Even today, I have not shaken off my belief that my admission to the school owed more to my ability to run very far and my dexterity with a football at my feet than to my rather limited ability to solve arithmetic problems. Whichever way I secured that precious admission, I still regard it as the greatest achievement of my career as it opened the door to a world ruled by merit. It has ingrained in me absolute contempt for mediocrity which is now a byword for the Nigerian education system.\n\nUnfortunately, there was a time when even Igbobi College could not escape being drawn into the maelstrom of the fraudulent Nigerian education system. Igbobi College, by an accident of geography is situated within that axis of Somolu, a suburb of Lagos famous for its slum character disposition and home to an army of small scale printers. There was a time when the Lagos State government decided in its lack of wisdom to dismantle iconic schools like Igbobi College in an attempt to give some form of education to everyone who so much as showed just a flicker of interest in acquiring a modicum of basic learning. That obstacle course which existed to sift the wheat from the chaff in those who chose the school was removed and the old school opened her gates to everyone who cared to enter them forcing the school to put on the mantle of her Somolu environment. This sad fate has been extended to many of those schools which had built up a solid reputation over several decades. The foundation of Igbobi College was however dug so deep that like the famous phoenix she has risen from the flames which had all but consumed her in that dark period of her exile from excellence. I wonder if that miracle could be extended beyond my old school but reality has dampened my expectations in this direction.","summary":"When in February 2023.&#160;&#160; The then 98 year old Jimmy Carter was admitted into hospice care, many of those who were closest to him were sure that he had only\n\n\nThe post Gyrations in the education sector (II) appeared first on The Nation Newspaper.","url":"https://thenationonlineng.net/gyrations-in-the-education-sector-ii/","image":"https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/28013614/Adebayo-Lamikanra.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:14:09","author":"Adebayo Lamikanra,The Nation","authors":["Adebayo Lamikanra","The Nation"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.189},{"id":258616090,"title":"Kamala Harris Visits North Carolina to Check on Hurricane Response","text":"IAB TCF Vendors\n\n6senseIAB TCFOff6sense stores cookies with a maximum duration of about this many days: 730.

A bell then tolled four times, once for each of the four victims, including Trump.\n“He did not stop our movement, he did not break our spirit,” Trump said of the shooter, who was shot and killed by security sharpshooters.\nThe crowd appeared to be in the tens of thousands, many wearing Trump regalia. Some chanted the “fight, fight, fight” slogan Trump used to rally his followers moments after he was shot.\n“We’re here to say, we can’t be intimidated, we can’t be stopped,” Ohio Republican Senator J.D. Vance, Trump’s vice-presidential running mate, told the crowd.\nVance rejected the argument from Vice-President Kamala Harris and other Democrats that Trump represents a threat to democracy.\n“Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy. What the hell have you done?” Vance said.\nTrump ally Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of social media platform X, was expected to appear on stage at the rally, his first time at a Trump campaign event since he endorsed the former president after the July 13 assassination attempt.\nTrump’s defiant and much-hyped return to Butler, Pennsylvania, came exactly one month before the November 5 presidential election, the outcome of which President Joe Biden suggested on Friday might not be peaceful.\n\nSecurity was noticeably tighter than at Trump’s July rally, with sniper squads positioned on several surrounding buildings, and a surveillance drone deployed overhead.\n“There’s a lot going on that’s unnerving,” said Heather Hughes, 43, who had travelled from New Castle in must-win Pennsylvania.\n“Do I think he’s safe? No, I think there’s going to be another attempt. But I think he’s going to make it through.”\nTrump was riding a clear poll lead after crushing Biden in a television debate in late June, and entered the Republican convention in Milwaukee as a political martyr.\nPictures of Trump with a blood-streaked face, pumping his fist and shouting “fight, fight, fight” as he was bundled away by Secret Service agents became defining images of the campaign.\nOn Saturday, many Trump supporters wore shirts emblazoned with assassination iconography, and some sported ear coverings recalling the bandage the former president wore after the shooting.\n\nMuch has changed since Trump’s last visit.\nBarely a week after the failed assassination bid, the presidential race was turned on its head when Biden dropped out and was replaced as the Democratic nominee by Harris.\nThe Harris campaign has clawed back the poll deficit – reversing it in some states – and the seismic events in Butler were largely overtaken.\nTrump’s rally appeared aimed at recovering momentum as a bruising campaign enters its final stretch.\nHarris on Saturday was in North Carolina meeting first responders and people hit by Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 220 as it ripped through the southeast.\nThe emergency response is “an example of the best we can do when we bring resources together at the federal, state and local level and tap into the kind of collegiality that produces results,” she told officials at a briefing.\nTrump has criticised the federal response, alleging without evidence that the Biden-Harris administration wrongly redirected relief funds to migrants.\n\nThe heavy security presence on Saturday highlighted persistent security fears, underscored when another attempt on Trump’s life was foiled last month.\nThe Secret Service has been pilloried for failing to secure the building where the Butler shooter managed to fire eight shots at Trump before being shot dead.\n“He said he’d come back to finish his speech, and to me [that takes] guts,” said Robert Dupain, 53, a local construction worker who was at the July rally.\nTrump and his campaign have turned on their head Democrats’ warnings about the former president representing a threat to democracy.\n“The Republicans aren’t violent … I think they [the Democrats] incite. They keep talking about Hitler and the end of democracy,” said retiree Glen Scheirer, who was with five relatives wearing identical “By the grace of God” T-shirts showing Trump after the shooting.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Butler incident, all sides urged a lowering of the political temperature.\nBut Trump quickly reverted to his signature inflammatory rhetoric and personal attacks, and has refused to commit to accepting the eventual result in November.\nHe has been indicted over the effort to subvert the 2020 election that culminated in his supporters storming the Capitol.\nAsked on Friday about the possibility of further election-related violence, Biden said he did not know if the vote would be peaceful.","summary":"Republican presidential candidate took the stage behind panes of bulletproof glass after an assassin’s bullet narrowly missed him in July.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3281246/trump-returns-site-failed-assassination-pennsylvania-campaign-rally","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/06/5ede14ca-7e69-485b-adce-f85edb59c871_7d3ef3a0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:06:51","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":258615808,"title":"Here's who to thank for the Harris campaign's historic field operation","text":"When then-Sen. Barack Obama kicked off his 2008 presidential campaign with a raucous rally in Springfield, Illinois, eagle-eyed political observers might have noticed a surprising face in the crowd: San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris. \n\nHarris was both an early Obama supporter and a fierce convert to his bold vision for reshaping Democrats’ costly and inefficient state field operations. She hit the doors for Obama in Iowa in 2008 and later went on to manage his California field operations as state campaign co-chair. As Harris rose through the ranks to become vice president, she continued to advocate for Obama’s aggressive style of registering and engaging new voters.\n\nSixteen years later, Harris is now applying lessons learned during the Obama campaign to a political operation that is both larger and more flush with cash than Obama’s ever was. With less than a month until election day, Harris is staking it all on the hope that a better-funded version of Obama’s operation can provide a critical boost in closely contested swing states. If she’s right, Democrats could soon be hailing the “Harris model” of voter activation as the blueprint for 2028 and beyond.\n\nHarris’ recent campaign moves suggest she’s serious about implementing Obama’s strategy of pouring money into state and local grassroots voter outreach. Back in August, Harris was quick to sign Obama campaign veterans David Plouffe, Stephanie Cutter, and Mitch Stewart to senior-level roles within her own campaign. She’s also reshaped her campaign message to not-so-subtly frame her “freedom” message as a natural progression of Obama’s effective “hope” imagery.\n\nThe burst of enthusiasm for Harris’ campaign from Democratic grassroots circles has been tough to miss. Democratic voter enthusiasm is rising at record levels, according to recent data from the conservative Wall Street Journal, and that’s translating into a tidal wave of new voters and first-time donors. In July, Harris’ candidacy helped Vote.org hit a new record for voter registrations, with nearly 40,000 people signing up in just 48 hours. \n\nRegistering new voters is (comparatively) easy. Getting those first-time voters out of their homes to cast a ballot on Election Day is harder. That’s why Obama’s 2008 campaign invested so heavily in efforts to connect first-time voters with early voting resources and offer rides to the polls for voters with mobility challenges. Those kinds of complex offerings require a campaign to build a robust local presence with plenty of staff redundancy. Harris’ campaign is already moving to ensure that won’t be an issue.\n\nLast month, the Harris campaign announced it would open over a dozen new campaign offices in the key swing state of Virginia. The campaign also celebrated opening its 50th field office in Pennsylvania and recently announced six more local field offices in North Carolina to support over 12,000 new volunteers there. Harris is now nearing over 300 field offices and 200,000 volunteers spread across all 50 states. \n\nThat includes Florida, a state once considered unwinnable by Democrats. With about a month until the election, Harris currently trails Trump by a scant 4 percentage points.\n\n“I saw field work pay off as an organizer in Florida in 2008. That’s why I’m not surprised by the surge in field operations I’ve witnessed here over the last couple of months,” said Evergreen Strategies founder Ben Sharpe, who also served as a Florida Democratic Party voter targeting staffer. \n\nSharpe adds, “What stands out is how quickly [Harris] understood what resources she had on the ground. They are letting people take ownership of these programs and letting them fly, which is a fundamental part of organizing a community. People become more invested in their work and outcomes.”\n\nFor once, Democrats actually have the money to build the field organization of their dreams. Harris has raised more money in less time than any presidential candidate in history, and enters the final stretch of the campaign season with a monumental $361 million August fundraising haul. That’s more than enough money to build a field operation more than double the size of Obama’s—and Harris is clearly making the investments necessary to build a formidable voter engagement machine.\n\nThings aren’t looking so good on the Republican side. Last month, the Trump campaign quietly announced it would reduce its field investment in New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Virginia, citing reduced competitiveness. The campaign has also reported spending more than it raised for the second month in a row, according to September fundraising figures. Republican insiders are now raising the alarm about Trump’s lack of a serious ground game in the face of Democrats’ organized effort. Others already fear it’s too late for Trump to recover from his sizable disadvantage.\n\nHarris’ shrewd decision to reactivate many veteran state-level Obama operatives allowed Democrats to quickly scale up a campaign operation that had been sagging under President Joe Biden. By forcing Republicans to spend ever-increasing amounts of their dwindling cash on once-safe states like Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina, Harris has achieved one of the biggest victories in organizing: expanding your electoral map. \n\nHarris’ team now spans outreach efforts to Latinos, women, young people, Black Americans, Native Americans, city dwellers, and those living in rural communities from North Carolina to Nevada and even Alaska. It’s a well-financed, professional operation filled with campaign veterans who have spent nearly two decades turning out hard-to-reach and first-time voters. It’s also the turnout machine that could give Harris her critical margin of victory in razor-edge races like Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nThanks, Obama.","summary":"When then-Sen.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Deirdre Durkan-simonds and Germania Rodriguez For Mailonline \n Published:23:31 BST, 5 October 2024 |Updated:23:59 BST, 5 October 2024 \n\nDolly Parton will donate $1 million towards recovery efforts following Hurricane Helene.\nThe country music legend confirmed during an event in her home state of Tennessee on Friday that the cash would come 'from my own bank account.'\nThe superstar also confirmed that her local commercial ventures, such as the Dollywood amusement park, would be donating the same amount to the Mountain Ways Foundation that is helping victims of flooding in the area.\nMore than 200 people (including 11 in Tennessee) have been killed as a result of Helene after the storm ripped through the south-east of the United States late last month - with the government warning that the clean-up could take years.\nDolly, 78, said: 'This is my home.\n\nDolly Parton will donate $1 million towards recovery efforts following Hurricane Helene; seen in 2014\n'God has been good to me and so has the public, and I feel that if there's anything I can do to give back in any way I can I'm always willing to do that. I want to feel like I'm doing my part,' she said. \nThe 9 to 5 singer continued: 'I was heartbroken like everybody else, and just amazed and devastated by it.\n'All these people feel like my people.'\nLater, Dolly broke into song with the words 'Helene, Helene' to the tune of her famous hit, Jolene, during her remarks as she also issued a message of support to those who have had their lives devastated by the storm.\nShe said: 'I know it's easy for us to say, \"Oh, things are going to get better\" when things are still really bad. All we can say is that we are with you, that we love you, we hope that things get better real soon - and we're going to do our part to try and make that possible.'\nHurricane Helene has left 4.4 million people without power and at least 30 dead across four states as it battered Georgia and moved into the Carolinas early on Friday. \nThe storm has been downgraded to a tropical depression and is located about 125 miles southeast of Louisville, Kentucky, as of Friday afternoon.\nIt was updated to Category 4 earlier in the evening, and hit the Florida's Big Bend region just after 11pm with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph.\n\nThe country music legend confirmed during an event in her home state of Tennessee on Friday that the cash would come 'from my own bank account' (the aftermath of Hurricane Helene on October 2, 2024 in North Carolina)\n\nHurricane Helene has left 4.4 million people without power and at least 30 dead across four states as it battered Georgia and moved into the Carolinas early on Friday\nBut the damage extended hundreds of miles to the north, with flooding as far away as North Carolina, where a lake used in scenes from the movie Dirty Dancing overtopped a dam.\nAt least 15 people have died in Georgia and 17 in South Carolina due to the storm.\nHelene had already spurred warnings and several states of emergencies, not only Florida, but all the way to Georgia and the Carolinas. More than 60million Americans in 12 states are under some form of advisory.\nFloridaTennesseeDolly PartonGeorgia\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDolly Parton makes $1 million donation to Hurricane Helene relief efforts: 'These are my people'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEHas Miranda Hart finally landed a perfect husband at the tender age of 51?

Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith’s twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election.\n\nThe devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.\n\n“As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,” said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.\n\nThe faith’s leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith’s 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.\n\nLatter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House.\n\nSome church members say the former president’s demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concerns about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent’s inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church’s teachings.\n\nTrump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.\n\nHarris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.\n\nOne of Harris’ greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.\n\nIt is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump’s brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump’s support for Israel.\n\n“He’s the lesser of two evils,” said Idos, 70. “The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that’s kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.”\n\nThe religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships.\n\nSammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.\n\n“Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that’s not something I think I can stand by,” he said.\n\nUndecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics.\n\nThe couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn’t really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.\n\n“The important thing about any general conference message is that it’s general and then we’re asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,” Jenna said. “People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives.”","summary":"Dallin H.

Roy Cooper said the state was “deeply grateful for the federal resources that we have. FEMA has been on the ground with us since the very beginning,” he said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAfter her briefing, Harris helped pack toiletries into aid kits at a distribution center, where she met Angelica Wind from hard-hit Asheville, who was there to volunteer with her daughter and a friend even though Wind said her own family was still without power and people were “just surviving.”\n\n“There’s a lot of resilience,” Wind told Harris, adding that, “We want to make sure people don’t forget about us.”\n\nHarris assured her the federal government was “here for the long haul.”\n\nMelissa Funderbunk told Harris about driving a truck carrying assistance to people in remote Morganton, “where people weren’t coming.”\n\n“You are the heroes among us,” Harris said.\n\nEarlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed.\n\nThe two have been vocal and visible about the government’s willingness to help, and the administration’s efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage.\n\nIn a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund “has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year.” He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program.\n\nMore than 200 people have died. It’s the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change.\n\nBut in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene’s aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it “one of the great scams of all time.”\n\nALSO SEE: Donations continue ramping up one week after Helene ravages western NC\n\nDuring a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Thursday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal response and cited “lousy treatment to North Carolina in particular.” In fact, Cooper said this week that more than 50,000 people have registered for FEMA assistance and about $6 million has been paid out.\n\nBiden has suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is withholding money for disaster relief needs.\n\nHarris’ visits present an additional political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She’s trying to step into a role for which Biden is well known – showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy – in the closing stretch of her White House campaign.\n\nUntil this week, she had not visited the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice president. That duty was reserved for Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms, and more.\n\nHarris said this week that she wanted to “personally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary.” She expressed admiration for how “people are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.”\n\nShe said that shows “the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,” an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail.\n\n“We are here for the long haul,” she said.\n\nNorth Carolina is said to be a battleground state that could tip the fate of this year’s election in November.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. &#8212; Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris pledged ongoing federal support&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vice President Kamala Harris to Visit Asheville, North Carolina to Survey Damage from Hurricane Helene first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/vice-president-kamala-harris-to-visit-asheville-north-carolina-to-survey-damage-from-hurricane-helene/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Hurricane-Helene-Vice-President-Kamala-Harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:35:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":258614232,"title":"Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters - The Associated Press","text":"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — As both presidential campaigns have stepped up efforts to win over voters in western swing states who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a top church official urged members on Saturday to “avoid what is harsh and hateful” in the heat of election season.\n\nDallin H.

While Jenna said her religion doesn’t really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.\n\n“The important thing about any general conference message is that it’s general and then we’re asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,” Jenna said. “People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives.”","summary":"Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/mormon-voters-trump-harris-abortion-4b7d1b3fca00d341ba988d3390cfc3d5","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/407d16e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+23/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ff5%2F81%2F32f612193c6b89b6f7736b72541e%2F6a80033473c44a57b8f956089394e290","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:34:00","author":"Hannah Schoenbaum","authors":["Hannah Schoenbaum"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":258615866,"title":"Comedian Janey Godley, 63, shares heartwarming moment she is reunited with her beloved sausage dog Honey as she receives cancer care in hospice","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 6th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk JUMPS on stage to join Trump as he re-enacts ex-president's 'fight, fight, fight' moment in front of 'Super Bowl-sized' crowd\n\nAmanda Abbington reveals she quit Strictly over cancer scare - as she goes to war with Giovanni Pernice AGAIN\n\nRevealed: King Charles eats lunch for the first time - and his meal of choice is a millennial's favourite\n\nI was juggling looking after my child with a busy job and doctors thought I had tonsilitis - then they found cancer\n\nDAN HODGES: The British people are being taken for fools.

See if you bring up a wee cup or something that would be good\".\n'And he loved it and he liked it. So then my pal said to him \"She's started jazz knitting.\" Which is basically knitting without following a pattern.\n'It's horrendous. It is like I vomited up a knickerbocker glory. But I am knitting him this scarf, he will need to get it before I die, that's for sure.'\nThe star joked: 'Because the good news is you see the thing is when I die I don't have to grieve, as I will be dead and he will have a great big scarf around his neck and you will see a picture and think \"That's that creepy scarf she knitted for him\".'\nAnd seven months later the scarf has made its way to Liam who looked overjoyed as he kissed the knitted garment.\nTikTokGlasgowJaney GodleyLiam Neeson\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nComedian Janey Godley, 63, shares heartwarming moment she is reunited with her beloved sausage dog Honey as she receives cancer care in hospice\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEHas Miranda Hart finally landed a perfect husband at the tender age of 51?

The community’s coming together.”\n\nBefore visiting the donation center, Harris greeted National Guard members while at Charlotte Air National Guard Base who were loading military aircrafts with pallets of emergency aid to be flown to communities throughout western North Carolina.\n\nHarris also met with officials on Saturday afternoon where she received updates on recovery efforts for the area and announced that Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, had been added to the federal disaster declaration. Helene, a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall along Florida's Big Bend region on Sept. 26, has killed more than 200 people and left thousands without power or drinkable water.\n\n“For the folks who are local, I also know what this means for each of you as a leader, to be a leader at a time that your own homes, your families, your friends, people you know, your community, has been directly hit,” Harris said during remarks ahead of a briefing at the North Carolina Air National Guard, which is on the grounds of the airport.\n\nHarris' visit comes exactly one month ahead of the 2024 presidential election, in which she is locked in a tight race against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. North Carolina is viewed as a pivotal swing state, and the speed and effectiveness of Biden administration’s response efforts could have ramifications on the race. \n\nTrump has also visited disaster-struck regions in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina over the last few days. \n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's latest updates. \n\nWhere is Tim Walz?\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, headlined a fundraising event on Saturday for the Harris campaign in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nThe governor spent at least an hour at the event, which was being held at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Following his stop in Cincinnati, Walz left for Cleveland where he was set to headline another fundraising event.\n\n– Rebecca Morin and Sharon Coolidge, USA TODAY Network\n\n Another hurricane expected to hit Florida after Helene\n\nAs clean-up from Tropical Storm Helene continues across the Southeast, the National Hurricane Center has issued advisories for at least three storm systems. One of those could make landfall on the West Coast of Florida in the next few days.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Saturday said Tropical Storm Milton is expected to develop into a \"near major hurricane,\" with the risk of life-threatening impacts. The forecast shows the storm approaching the Gulf coast of Florida with winds of 110 mph ahead of a possible mid-week landfall near Tampa.\n\nForecasters are also tracking two other storm systems: Hurricane Kirk, a Category 3 storm over open ocean in the Atlantic and Hurricane Leslie, a Category 1 storm following behind Kirk. Neither were expected to make landfall as of Saturday.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat FEMA support in North Carolina looks like\n\nAs communities across North Carolina continue to recover from Hurricane Helene, FEMA has offered support and staff to the state. Here is a breakdown of what it looks like, according to the White House:\n\n$26 million in housing and other types of assistance to more than 25,000 households in North Carolina.More than 5,400,000 meals and 6,300,000 liters of water shipped to the state.700 FEMA staff members on the ground. More than 1,200 urban search and rescue personnel are in North Carolina and the teams have rescued or supported more than 3,200 survivors as of Saturday.74% of originally reported power outages have been restored.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nNC Gov. Roy Cooper thanks FEMA for Helene recover response\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper thanked FEMA for its “massive unprecedented response” in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\n“FEMA has been on the ground with us from the very beginning of this,” Cooper told reporters on Saturday before his briefing with Harris. \n\nDuring his remarks, Cooper said 68 people died from the storm, which is the official state count. However, local authorities said they believe there are more than 100 who have died from the storm across North Carolina.\n\nAs of Saturday, the USA TODAY Network analysis of Helene deaths increased to 228 across the states impacted by the storm.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nFEMA's response to Hurricane Helene\n\nFEMA has deployed more than 1,500 workers to impacted areas in the southeast, officials said. The agency has shipped more than 11.5 million million meals, more than 12.6 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 400,000 tarps to regions affected by Helene. FEMA has so far approved more than $45 million in up-front emergency aid to victims.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n Biden calls on Congress to pass disaster relief\n\nPresident Joe Biden urged members of Congress to replenish critical disaster relief programs that have run out of money, or that soon could run out.\n\nIn a Friday night letter to congressional leaders, Biden warned that the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program is set to run out of funds in a matter of weeks. He also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief funds could face a shortfall by the end of the year. Biden called on Congress to restore funding and provide FEMA with additional resources.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested Congress can wait until after the election to pass Hurricane relief measures.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n Helene among top deadliest storms in U.S. history\n\nAs search and rescue teams continue to examine stream beds and debris piles across North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, the toll of lives lost in Helene's horrific flooding mounts daily. At least 214 people have died as a result of the storm. Hundreds are still missing and officials expect the number to rise.\n\nBut already Helene is the fourth deadliest landfalling hurricane in the mainland U.S. since 1950. It ranks behind Hurricane's Katrina (2005), Audrey (1957 and Camille (1969).\n\n– Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\n Where is Trump today?\n\nDonald Trump is holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

With just a month to go until the election, Donald Trump has sought to make Biden and Harris' Hurricane Helene a focus of the campaign.\n\n“There’s nobody that’s handled a hurricane or storm worse than what they’re doing right now,” Trump said to supporters Thursday night in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nTrump's indictment has included falsehoods - he claimed that federal disaster money went to migrants and that Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp had trouble reaching Biden, but neither were the case - and the 2024 Republican nominee for the White House has been accused of playing politics with disaster relief during his presidency.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n Harris vows \"long haul\" government relief efforts\n\nKamala Harris pledged \"long lasting\" federal support to get residents and neighborhoods battered by flooding from Helene \"back up and running\" during a visit to Augusta, Georgia earlier this week.\n\n\"We're here for the long haul,\" Harris said.\n\nThe Biden administration has so far approved requests from Georgia, Florida and North Carolina for the federal government to fully cover the state and local costs of debris removal, search and rescue efforts, mass-feeding and other hurricane-related emergency response activities.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n(This story has been updated with a new headline, information and photos.)","summary":"LIVE: Harris visits North Carolina for update on Helene recovery, helps at donation center  USA TODAY","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/05/kamala-harris-north-carolina-hurricane-helene/75531129007/","image":"https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/05/USAT/75535328007-20241005-t-202350-z-802862909-rc-2-keaad-37-o-1-rtrmadp-3-usaelectionharris.JPG?crop=3487,1962,x0,y0&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:29:45","author":"Karissa Waddick,Rebecca Morin","authors":["Karissa Waddick","Rebecca Morin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":258615840,"title":"Forrest TRUMP!

While one in five in the UK said they would vote Trump, which has almost doubled from four years ago when Betfair ran the same survey.\n\nThose aged 18-24 are most likely to back Trump if given a vote, with 32 per cent saying they would vote for him, which has almost tripled since the last election (11 percent).\n\nBetfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said: 'Several US celebs have made a successful transition to politics. Trump himself fronted The Apprentice on TV over there, plus there was Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. So, we thought it would be fun to discover which stars the British people think would do a good job in the White House.\n\n'It's not surprising that a well-loved actor such as Hanks, famed for playing likable but strong characters on screen, tops the poll.\n\n'Other popular figures such as The Rock, and Oprah are also backed to be a good leader of the free world.\n\n'He's already taken over Twitter, could the White House be next? Almost one in five Brits believe Elon Musk would make a good US President.'\n\nThe Betfair poll found that the real Presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris has captured the imagination of the British people, with 60 per cent of all those polled saying they are interested in the battle for the White House.\n\nBetfair Exchange, the world's leading peer-to-peer betting platform, has already seen more than £125m in wagers on the US Election markets with plenty more expected in the next month.\n\nFour years ago, the Betfair Exchange next President market broke all records to become the world's biggest ever betting event, with £1.7bn staked on Trump v Biden.","summary":"Britons would not be blamed to tune out of elections after going to the polls earlier this year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13928195/Brits-pick-Tom-Hanks-President-Rock.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/05/22/90498929-0-image-m-13_1728165399676.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:29:41","author":"Editor,Jose Ramos","authors":["Editor","Jose Ramos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.252},{"id":258614050,"title":"Day in Photos: Butler Rally, Detained Activist, and Human Tower","text":"Support UsSHARELaw enforcement sharpshooters position themselves on a roof prior to a rally by Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, at the Butler Farm Show Inc. in Butler, Pa., on Oct. 05, 2024.

No, I think there’s going to be another attempt. But I think he’s going to make it through.” \n\nTrump was riding a clear poll lead after crushing Biden in a TV debate in late June, and entered the Republican convention in Milwaukee as a political martyr.\n\nPictures of Trump with a blood-streaked face, pumping his fist and shouting “fight, fight, fight” as he was bundled away by Secret Service agents, became defining images of the campaign.\n\nOn Saturday, many Trump supporters wore shirts emblazoned with assassination iconography, with some sporting ear coverings recalling the bandage the former president wore after the shooting.\n\nThe rally appears aimed at recovering that momentum as a bruising campaign enters its final stretch. Trump is bringing along running mate J.D. Vance, and iconoclastic billionaire Elon Musk said on his X platform that he too would be addressing the crowd.\n\nMuch has changed since Trump’s last visit.\n\nBarely a week after the failed assassination bid, the presidential race was turned on its head when Biden dropped out and was replaced as the Democratic nominee by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Harris campaign has clawed back the poll deficit - reversing it in some states - and the seismic events in Butler were largely overtaken.\n\nTrump has sought to revive the incident, billing his return to the place where he “took a bullet for democracy.”\n\nHarris meantime travelled to North Carolina to meet Saturday with first responders and people hit by Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 220 people as it ripped through the southeast.\n\nTrump has criticised the federal response, alleging without evidence that the Biden-Harris administration wrongly redirected relief funds to migrants.\n\nTrump will speak behind protective glass on Saturday - a stark reminder of persistent security fears, underscored when another attempt on Trump’s life was foiled last month.\n\nThe spotlight will be on the Secret Service, pilloried for failing to secure the building a few hundred feet from where the Butler shooter managed to fire eight shots at Trump before being shot dead.\n\nTen days later the director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned. Along with Trump, two supporters were wounded and one - firefighter Corey Comperatore - was killed.\n\n“Fight, fight, fight,” rally-goers chanted Saturday, echoing Trump’s post-shooting call, as they waited for their political idol.\n\n“He said he’d come back to finish his speech, and to me (that takes) guts,” said Robert Dupain, 53, a local construction worker who was at the July rally.\n\nTrump and his campaign have turned on their head the Democrats’ warnings about the former president representing a threat to democracy.\n\n“The Republicans aren’t violent... I think they (the Democrats) incite. They keep talking about Hitler and the end of democracy,” said retiree Glen Scheirer, who was with five relatives wearing identical “By the grace of God” T-shirts showing Trump after the shooting.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Butler incident, all sides urged a lowering of the political temperature.\n\nBut Trump in particular quickly reverted to the inflammatory rhetoric and personal attacks that are his signature, and he has refused to commit to accepting the eventual result in November.\n\nHe has also been indicted over the effort to subvert the 2020 election that culminated in his supporters storming the Capitol.\n\nAsked on Friday about the possibility of further election-related violence, Biden said he did not know if the vote would be peaceful.\n\nRally-goer Heather Hughes said she fears there could be more assassination attempts.\n\n“I think (Trump’s opponents) want rid of him,” she said, “because they know he’s gonna make a better America.”","summary":"The former US president and Republican candidate is about to make a historic move, but some of his supporters are worried.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/trump-to-return-to-site-of-failed-assassination/news-story/3383b6d2c3db94accfa87adb49d5e175?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/e9604f378fd5c97c9389121695b01f91","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:25:44","author":"Copy Link","authors":["Copy Link"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":258614100,"title":"Kamala Harris Offers Aid Pledges on Visit to Storm-Hit North Carolina - Bloomberg","text":"Why did this happen?\n\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not\n blocking them from loading.\n For more information you can review our Terms of\n Service and Cookie Policy.","summary":"Kamala Harris Offers Aid Pledges on Visit to Storm-Hit North Carolina  Bloomberg","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=18555f7b-836e-11ef-86a6-aba441e16e04&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyNC0xMC0wNS9rYW1hbGEtaGFycmlzLW9mZmVycy1haWQtcGxlZGdlcy1vbi12aXNpdC10by1zdG9ybS1oaXQtbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmE=","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:23:18","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":258612010,"title":"What are Trump and Harris’ views on marijuana laws?","text":"(NEXSTAR) — Marijuana legalization has long been a topic of political conversation, especially over the last year as talks about reclassifying it as a less dangerous drug have continued. \n\nWhile the federal process of rescheduling marijuana trudges on, some are looking at the Oval Office — and who will be moving in come January — in anticipation. \n\nSo where do presidential nominees Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump stand on the matter?\n\nHarris on marijuana legalization\n\nHarris recently spoke on the issue for the first time since becoming the Democratic nominee during an extended interview with the sports and culture podcast “All the Smoke.”\n\nIn the interview, released Monday, Harris said she believes “we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior,” The Hill reports.\n\n“I just feel strongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed,” she told hosts Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. “And we know historically what that has meant and who has gone to jail.” \n\nWhile she went further than President Joe Biden by expressing support for full legalization, Harris has been criticized for her stance on marijuana in the past. \n\nAs The Hill reports, Harris aggressively prosecuted marijuana-related crimes while district attorney and attorney general in San Francisco and California, respectively. When she was running for president in 2019, however, she called for nonviolent marijuana-related criminal offenses to be expunged.\n\nShe also spoke out about a failed 2010 ballot measure in the state that would have legalized and regulated marijuana. But once she became a senator, Harris co-sponsored legislation to end the federal prohibition of marijuana.\n\nHarris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently dodged a question on marijuana legalization and expressed support for it being left to individual states. \n\nTrump on marijuana legalization\n\nEarlier this year, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would vote yes on an amendment to legalize marijuana in Florida come Election Day.\n\n“As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,” he wrote. “We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults to safe, tested product.”\n\nHe later added that he would work on marijuana reform if he is elected to a second term, expressing support for rescheduling the drug and working “with Congress to pass common sense laws.”\n\nWhen running for president in 2016, Trump said that marijuana legislation should be left to the states. While Trump was in office, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where the drug is legal.\n\nHis running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), previously voted against the SAFER Banking Act, explaining to a constituent that he feared the bill would “pave the way for more widespread marijuana use and federal legalization.”\n\nWhere Americans stand\n\nAbout 70% of American adults said marijuana should be legal in a Gallup poll taken last year, the highest level recorded by the polling firm since it first asked about marijuana policy in 1969. By contrast, only about one-third of respondents supported marijuana legalization 20 years ago.\n\nLast year’s Gallup poll showed the highest support for marijuana among young voters, a key demographic in seven presidential battleground states.\n\nAn analysis of national survey data published earlier this year found that an estimated 17.7 million people reported using marijuana daily or near-daily in 2022 — up dramatically from less than 1 million people in 1992. Though alcohol is still more widely used, the report marked the first time that the number of Americans who use marijuana just about every day surpassed the number who drink that often.\n\nNearly half the country has already legalized medical cannabis, recreational marijuana, or both as of 2024.\n\nThe Hill’s Nathaniel Weixel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(NEXSTAR) — Marijuana legalization has long been a topic of political conversation,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: What are Trump and Harris&#8217; views on marijuana laws? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/what-are-trump-and-harris-views-on-marijuana-laws/","image":"https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/10/d42fd938352741a58754f8a2c03e454a-e1714501989306.jpg?w=800","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:15:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":258609976,"title":"Holly Willoughby is enjoying a new solo career after leaving This Morning and becoming 'free' from being a double act with Phillip Schofield","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Oct 5th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHas Miranda Hart finally landed a perfect husband at the tender age of 51?

Myself, Josie, Dermot, Alison, Craig and every single person that works on this show will continue to work hard every day.'\nPhillip does not mention his former co-star Holly in his new TV show Cast Away - but does make multiple swipes at his former colleagues.\nDespite mentioning ITV co-stars Ant and Dec as well as Joanna Lumley , 78, Holly isn't mentioned at all throughout the 45-minute episode.\nIn one outburst which will leave viewers wondering whether it is aimed at her, Schofield says: 'When you throw someone under a bus, you've got to have a really bloody good reason to do it.\n'I got into telly because I love the nuts and bolts of telly, I never wanted to be famous. I'm not fussed about that.\n'I miss parts of it. I miss most of it, I'm honest. But there are bits that I really, really, really don't miss.\n'You learn a lot about people. I don't miss that.'\nThe disgraced presenter revealed this week he was taking part in his own survival show just 16 months on from leaving This Morning after admitting to having an 'unwise but not illegal' fling with a junior male colleague.\nHe is said to have turned down a selection of big money TV offers before choosing to sign up for Cast Away - which he believes will allow him to share his story in an 'unedited and honest' way.\nHolly left This Morning in October 23 after presenting the show alongside Phillip for 14 years.\nSources at the time said she quit because the show 'wasn't the same' after her co-host left but was finally 'tipped over the edge' by an alleged 'kidnap and murder plot', insiders have claimed.\n\nAppearing to reference the now-famous speech on Cast Away, Phillip is seen having a BBQ with his family and asking: '...are you ok?'\n\nDespite mentioning ITV co-stars Ant, 48, and Dec, 49, as well as Joanna Lumley, 78, Holly (pictured in 2023) isn't mentioned at all throughout the 45-minute episode\n\nMeanwhile, during the episode Schofield referred to ITV duo Ant and Dec as his 'best mates'.\nIn May it was suggested Declan Donnelly had reportedly been trying to convince the former presenter to make a TV comeback, after the pair had a four-hour dinner together.\nJoanna Lumley also featured, sending him a 'good luck' message.\nMs Lumley, 78, appeared in a similar programme in 1994. 'Listen, Phil these are the tips I've got,' she said.\n'Keep your knives sharp, spend much of the day trying to find wood otherwise you won't be able to eat anything.\n'When I was on the island I made a pair of shoes out of my bra, and I would love to think that you could do something a bit challenging, and bring it back so we could all look at it.\n'I shall be thinking of you all the time Phil, and actually I'm a little bit jealous, lots of love.'\nHolly WilloughbyThis MorningJoanna LumleyITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHolly Willoughby is enjoying a new solo career after leaving This Morning and becoming 'free' from being a double act with Phillip Schofield\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEHas Miranda Hart finally landed a perfect husband at the tender age of 51?

He’s also expected to reveal federal actions as part of his administration’s efforts to replace the nation’s lead pipes within a decade.\n\nThe push — alongside an observation Monday marking last year’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants, followed by a campaign event Tuesday night in Philadelphia — represent an increased public-facing cadence from Biden, who had curtailed his schedule after exiting from the presidential race this summer and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has notably increased his interaction with the White House press corps — including his first-ever appearance in the White House’s briefing room — as the administration seeks to highlight a strong jobs report, the resolution of a port workers’ strike and Hurricane Helene recovery efforts.\n\nRead More: Biden Makes Surprise Appearance, Champions Economy Aiding Harris\n\n“President Biden is seizing every opportunity to act on his agenda so we can keep fueling immediate economic growth and job creation now while also ensuring these historic investments he and Vice President Harris secured keep paying off for decades to come,” Biden communications director Ben LaBolt said in a statement. \n\n“That’s why this week, he’ll achieve more progress eliminating dangerous lead from drinking water — and creating good-paying jobs in the process — and by announcing additional student loan debt relief.”\n\nBiden’s student loan announcement will come just days after a federal judge in Missouri temporarily blocked efforts to finalize a program that would have canceled as much as $20,000 in accrued interest on student loans and forgiven balances for longtime borrowers. \n\nThe White House has been repeatedly stymied by federal courts as it’s sought to eliminate student debt, though the administration has canceled almost $170 billion so far.The lead pipe plan, expected to include both actions and funding, will add to $9 billion already announced by the administration.\n\nIn Germany, Biden is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the leaders of other allies at Ramstein Air Force Base.\n\nZelenskiy said he will present his victory plan at the summit, including “clear, specific steps for a just end to the war” that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, according to a post Saturday to Telegram. Zelenskiy and Biden met late last month to discuss the proposal at the White House.\n\nIn Angola, Biden is scheduled to meet with President João Lourenço to demonstrate the strength of the relationship between their two countries, according to a statement last month from the US Embassy in Luanda.","summary":"Biden is set to announce next week that he’s expanding student debt relief for public workers, according to a senior White House official.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/10/05/student-loan-debt-relief-joe-biden-public-workers-expansion/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2175315529-e1728165898395.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:10:47","author":"Bloomberg,Justin Sink","authors":["Bloomberg","Justin Sink"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.341},{"id":258611668,"title":"Magic Johnson: Black men should vote for Harris because Trump 'did not deliver on' promises to Black community","text":"Kamala Harris rallied in Flint, Michigan, Friday and brought along one of the state's most legendary figures to support her.

We love, Pennsylvania, and as I was saying —,” Trump said to a thunderous applause, while standing in front of bulletproof glass at the exact spot where he was shot nearly three months ago. \n\n“Tonight, I return to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America. \n\n“Our movement to make America great again stands stronger, prouder, more united, more determined and nearer to victory than ever before.”\n\nFlanked by top MAGA stars, Trump hoped to galvanize his supporters in the crucial battleground state and transform the tragic memory of July 13 into a message of resilience, proving that he and his movement are more alive than ever, even as security concerns loom large.\n\nSupporters flocked to the showgrounds hours before Trump’s arrival, and Pennsylvania State Police officials estimated the crowd at 21,000 people.\n\nTrump commenced his speech by rattling off a bevy of thank yous, conveying gratitude to all the first responders for leaping into action when bullets started flying on July 13. Chants of “Corey” broke out from the audience at one point.\n\n“Exactly 12 weeks ago … on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement,” Trump recounted. “For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper’s perch.”\n\n“By the hand of Providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal. Did not come close. He did not stop our movement. He did not break out our spirit.”\n\nAbout 10 minutes into his return speech, Trump paused for a moment of silence to pay tribute to Comperatore. Christopher Macchio then performed “Ave Maria” to cap off the solemn moment.\n\n“To Helen and the entire family. I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief,” Trump said to the widow, Helen Comperatore. “I know he’s looking down on us right now from heaven, smiling at his beloved wife.”\n\nTrump hugged and consoled the Comperatore ahead of his return to Butler.\n\n“We’re going to make a new memory in Butler, Pennsylvania. And this will mark the moment that this election was won for Donald J. Trump. Let’s send him back to the White House,” Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump proclaimed during her remarks before the 45th president took the stage. \n\nLast time, the rally ended in horror. \n\nWith blood dripping down his face, Trump iconically pumped his fist up in defiance and urged his supporters to “fight, fight, fight” as the Secret Service whisked him away.\n\nThe would-be assassin’s bullet clipped his right ear, with Trump saved by a slight turn of his head as he spoke. \n\nTrump provided a heartfelt homage to Corey Comperatore, the retired firefighter in the stands who was struck by the would-be assassin’s errant bullets, along with two others injured in the bloodbath in western Pennsylvania.\n\nComperatore, 50, was attempting to shield his wife and daughters from the gunfire. \n\nHis wife Helen and his daughters Allyson and Kaylee were among his family members set to join the former president as special guests during his return Saturday. \n\nDavid Dutch, 57, one of the two rallygoers injured alongside James Copenhaver, 74, was also a special guest, as were a handful of other July 13 attendees and first responders.\n\nOther key guests included GOP vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, former first son Eric Trump and his wife and Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, and tech mogul Elon Musk.\n\nSecret Service agents spent weeks scrambling to ensure that there wouldn’t be a repeat of the security failures that enabled gunman Matthew Thomas Crooks, 20, to crawl up a nearby roof about 130 yards away from Trump and fire off eight rounds. \n\nAhead of Saturday’s rally, law enforcement was seen combing the roof that Crooks used as his perch and positioning semi-trailers to block the line of sight to the stage. \n\nTrump supporters poured into the fairgrounds hours ahead of time in anticipation of hearing from the former president, especially in light of the July attack.\n\n“It was horrifying,” recalled John Burkert, 46, a behavioral health specialist at Butler Memorial Hospital, where Trump was taken.\n\n“I actually stood up with the shots [fired], not thinking that it’s shots, just to see what is going on. And then I see Trump go down,” he added. “My daughter would not return today because of the trauma.”\n\nThe Pennsylvanian is backing Trump on Nov. 5 because of his concerns about the economy. \n\nFor the most part, there was an aura of excitement palpable on the fairgrounds and attendees tended to downplay any concerns about safety.\n\n“I actually was not even concerned about coming here because I felt this was going to be the safest of them all to go,” Tammy Bodenweber, 54, a bookkeeper from upstate New York who drove seven hours to attend.\n\nShe was particularly excited about the special guests like Vance.\n\nEvangelical Christians who were at the rally, couldn’t help but thank God for Trump’s survival. Dan Beazley, 63, from Northville, Michigan, told The Post “We believe God saved him for a purpose.”\n\nSeveral rallygoers were also spotted trying to raise money to help communities ravaged by Hurricane Helene’s rampage through Florida, Georgia and North Carolina late last month. \n\n“Take a minute to help the people of North Carolina. FEMA’s not helping them, but we can,” Marty Best, 54, from Allegheny Township in Butler County, was heard yelling. “We can fill in the gaps.”\n\nThe July 13 assassination attempt marked the first time a would-be assassin drew blood from a current or former US president since the 1981 attempt by John Hinckley Jr. against President Ronald Reagan. \n\n“I’m not supposed to be here, I’m supposed to be dead,” Trump told The Post the day after his brush with death. \n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned later that month amid a wave of pressure and a major reckoning for the protective agency. \n\nScores of investigations into what went awry are underway, including from congressional committees and government agencies. \n\nThe agency has taken a variety of steps to bolster Trump’s protection, including erecting bulletproof glass around him during outdoor rallies. \n\nCongress has marshaled more funding and resources for the Secret Service. \n\nBut everyone is holding their breath, hoping that nothing goes wrong amid fears of copycats.\n\n“With all the hatred they have spewed and President Trump, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him,” Vance reflected to the packed venue before Trump took to the podium. \n\n“At this exact spot nearly three months ago, we thought, President Trump was going to lose his life. But God still has a plan for him just like he still has a plan for the United States of America,” he later said.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has partly attributed the failures of July 13 to the absence of “clear guidance or direction to our local law enforcement partners” about how to secure the perimeter. \n\nOn Sept. 15, another would-be assassin — Ryan Wesley Routh, 58 — was confronted by the Secret Service at Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, Fla. \n\nLaw enforcement managed to detain him and alleges that while he didn’t manage to get off a shot, he had a clear motivation to kill the GOP nominee.\n\nBeyond those two attempts, prosecutors have claimed in court documents that the government foiled an attempt by the Iranians to kill Trump, who ordered the 2020 strike against late Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen. Qasem Soleimani.\n\nHaving survived two very well-publicized assassination attempts, Trump has acknowledged that he is “always worried” about his personal safety, but he’s been adamant that he won’t cower in fear. \n\n“I don’t think we should be stopped by someone with severe mental problems or whatever his problem was,” Trump told Fox News in July about his intent to go back to Butler. \n\nTrump’s very symbolic and emotional bid to finish “what we were supposed to do” in Butler months later comes amid a dramatically different dynamic in the 2024 contest. \n\nAt the time of the July 13 rally, Trump had been riding high, buoyed by President Biden’s disastrous debate performance just two weeks prior. \n\nA mutiny was underway within the Democratic Party to depose Biden as the nominee, and Trump was dominating polls. \n\nPrivately, his top advisers were feeling very confident about his prospects of victory. \n\nBut eight days after the assassination attempt, Biden, 81, opted to bow out of the race and pass the baton to Vice President Kamala Harris, who rapidly closed the gap with Trump. Now the two are locked in a very tight matchup that many pollsters feel is too close to call. \n\nStill, one thing remains the same — Pennsylvania is the greatest prize of the seven major battleground states, with 19 Electoral College votes. \n\nBoth campaigns are desperate to win the Keystone State. \n\nSaturday’s rally in Butler comes exactly one month before Election Day.","summary":"An undaunted former President Donald Trump is poised to make his dramatic first return to Butler Farm Show grounds, the site where he came within a quarter inch of death, and pay tribute to slain firefighter Corey Comperatore.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/us-news/defiant-donald-trump-makes-bold-return-to-butler-pa-where-he-was-nearly-assassinated/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/trump-comp-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/K9xT1VGh-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:05:30","author":"Carson Swick,Ethan Dodd,Ryan King","authors":["Carson Swick","Ethan Dodd","Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.036},{"id":258611666,"title":"DAVID MARCUS: Trump's defiant supporters flock to Butler rally with renewed confidence","text":"In the couple of weeks after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket, there was a decided doldrum I detected across the country from Trump supporters. But Saturday, as Trump returned to the site of his July 13 near assassination and the tragic murder of Corey Comperatore, a new confidence was clear among his faithful. Rob is a teacher who lives in Pennsylvania and was carrying a clipboard, registering voters who stood in the vast line to get in. \"I coach wrestling,\" Rob told me, \"and when they switched in Harris it was like a wrestler had his opponent pinned, and suddenly they swap in a new, fresh opponent. Even if that new opponent is weak, it's still deflating.\" TRUMP SUPPORTERS WEIGH IN ON SAFETY AT HISTORIC PENNSYLVANIA RALLY But now, Rob, who had registered about a dozen new voters when I spoke to him early in the day, thinks Trump has turned a corner, and is poised to defeat Harris. He wasn’t alone. On a park bench in the shade, I found Karen and George, both in their 60s, along with Johnny and Rocky, in their late 20s or so. The two pairs, all decked out in Trump gear, had only just met. But when I was talking to them, I honestly thought they were family members who had known each other forever. \"It’s like a Grateful Dead vibe,\" Johnny told me, \"it's all about love.\" Karen agreed, at least about the love part, not sure about the Dead, and she is confident that Trump can unite our deeply divided country. \"He’s already showed he can get people what they need. He was in North Carolina right away after the hurricane. Where were Harris and Biden?\" Karen, like many I spoke to, believes that Trump won the 2020 election, and expects similar shenanigans this time around. However, she is confident not just that Trump will win, but that Republican Dave McCormack will beat incumbent Bob Casey Jr., in the Keystone State's critical Senate battle. Rocky agreed, \"Casey is just a career politician,\" he mused. \"One thing I wish Trump would talk more about is term limits, because these are the people destroying the country.\" I’ve been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts. It took an hour to park in a nearby field. My little Mitsubishi Lancer had never driven on grass before, but she did okay, and the atmosphere was incredibly festive notwithstanding the long, long waits. Joe, a retired NYPD officer, had driven six hours from Staten Island with his 18-year-old nephew, Uriel. I’ll note I saw no evidence of anyone being bused in. This crowd was truly as organic as a vegan’s lunch. When I asked Joe how long he had supported Trump, he told me, \"All my life.\" It was his way of saying The Donald was the politician he had been waiting for. I’ve been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts. \"In Staten Island, people are excited about Trump,\" he told me, and his nephew, set to vote for the first time, agreed. I asked Uriel, what would make an 18-year-old vote for Trump? \"He’ll make it a better country,\" he said quietly, in his Yankees t-shirt. \"More opportunity?\" I pressed, \"Yes,\" he replied. It mirrored what young voters have been telling me across the Rust Belt, and beyond. I spoke to several attendees who had been in the same place on that fateful July 13, but the one who stood out was another Joe. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Everybody was so calm and orderly, that's what I remember,\" he said. \"But I felt so bad for the kids, I mean, they were really scared.\" Joe did admit to feeling some emotions coming back to the Butler Farm Show grounds, but he’s a dude and declined to elaborate on them too much. As for the election? Like everyone I spoke to, the confidence is growing. \"Look at this crowd,\" he said,\" how can he lose?\" I’ll admit, it sounded a bit like hubris, especially given the events of the last eight years, but it absolutely reflects the attitude of Trump voters over the past month, who have moved from a sense of nervousness, to increasing belief that this election is now squarely moving in Trump’s direction. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Saturday in Butler, it felt like a reset. After all, the tragic shooting took place just two days before the Republican National Convention. Just a week later, Biden was out, Harris was in, and confusion was everywhere. There is now a month to go until Election Day, and if the sprawling crowd at the second Butler rally is to be believed, Donald Trump, decidedly has his groove back.

Police arrested four other confirmed TdA gang members and 15 suspected members.\n\nFollowing multiple complaints from an apartment complex on the city’s north side, San Antonio police officers, Texas Department of Public Safety Anti-Gang Unit officers, Homeland Security Investigations special agents, the FBI, and U.S. Border Patrol agents raided the apartment complex early on Saturday, MySA.com reported.

Recently, at a campaign event in Michigan, filmmaker Michael Moore warned Harris about a possibly disastrous mistake she might make in the final four to five weeks before Election Day in November. However, Moore has often criticized Donald Trump and he believes that Harris has a good chance to win in the upcoming elections.\n\nMoore said, “If you know to really read the polls, or if you have access to the various private and internal polling being conducted by and shared only amongst the elites, Wall Street, and Members of Congress, then you already know that this election was over weeks ago.” He cautioned that campaigning with Liz Cheney in Wisconsin isn’t helping Harris with progressives and might lower her chances in the election, as reported by HuffPost. “Another mistake that could be made in these final 4-5 weeks is if Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a ‘move to the center,’” he wrote, as reported by The Daily Beast.\n\nHe said it could lower her voter turnout. \"This, too, could reduce or depress the vote for Harris, especially among the base. I know many of you don’t want to hear that, but I’m just trying to warn you that the actions of party hacks and pundits have consequences,” he wrote. Moore further said, “Biden’s continued funding and arming of the Netanyahu regime has already depressed the Michigan vote.\" However, he also said that a new era is starting where being Caucasian is just one option and no longer the dominant one in the world.\n\nHe said that being too confident about a Harris win could also be risky. Moore wrote, “An aggregate of top polls as of today shows that Harris will defeat Trump in the Electoral College count by 270 to 268, but I think we need more. We need to ensure that Trump loses in a landslide.\" The director later explained several ways Harris could win if she can get regular nonvoters to show up at the polls. He wrote, “All we need is just a few thousand of them to show up — just this once — to make a difference: To cut taxes for all working people, to make the rich pay theirs, to keep the government off women’s bodies.\"\n\nHe concluded his post by stating, “If there ever was an election where the totally unexpected and crazy could happen, this is already that election. Assume nothing. Take zero for granted. Work to prevent the worst results and prepare to make a possible Trump presidency a complete failure.\" Meanwhile, CNN’s Harry Enten also raised concerns about a troubling sign for Harris. According to Mediaite, he pointed out that assessing whether voters feel the country is headed in the right direction reveals a challenge for Harris’s campaign.

It looks likely that the result will confirm that the nation is divided into three camps, unable and unwilling to interact. Many do not vote, while the rest are roughly evenly split between voting Republican or Democrat.\nThe strength of a democracy is that the electorate listens to debates, opinions and programmes of the candidates, judges the parties on the basis of their record in office and weighs the candidates’ opinions against what they see in daily life. It appears that there is little of this in the United States.\nThis year’s election will determine seats in the US House of Representatives and Senate as well as the presidency. In the House, Republicans hold a majority of 220 seats to 212 with three vacancies. If polls suggesting a close election prove accurate, the House could be pushed into a case-by-case approach with compromises and horse-trading. Some members hold extreme views on issues and cannot be expected to vote for the party line.\nSuch a situation has been seen in the preceding 12 months. When facing crucial decisions, the Republican leadership conducted painful and drawn-out internal negotiations to all Republican members of the House on board.\nThe picture in the Senate is not much different. Democrats hold a 51-49 majority, thanks to four independent senators who caucus with the Democrats. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, at times appears to be out of step with Donald Trump, former US president and the party’s candidate this year. A small swing in votes could change the majority party or create a 50-50 tie, giving the vice-president the decisive vote.\n\nThe polls for the presidential election are close to unequivocal in one sense and ambiguous in another. The popular vote – which US President Joe Biden won by more than 7 million votes in 2020 – seems likely to be won by US Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s nominee.\nThe picture in the electoral college is more ambiguous. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes in 2016 but lost 227-304 in the electoral college. It is possible for the two votes to contradict each other, and if they do the result in the electoral college is decisive.\nBiden’s 306-232 majority in the electoral college in 2020 might have looked solid, but in fact it was almost too close for comfort. He won Arizona by about 10,000 votes, Georgia by about 12,000, Michigan by 150,000, Pennsylvania by 80,000, Nevada by 33,000 and Wisconsin by 20,000. A small number of votes swinging Republican could have produced a picture analogous to 2016.\n\nThe first scenario for this year’s election is that Harris wins both the popular vote and the electoral college. If her margin in the electoral college is at least comparable to Biden’s in 2020, that could take the wind out of Trump’s attempts to contest the result.\nHowever, if Harris’ winning margin in the electoral college is thin, Trump could once again refuse to concede the election. Constitutionally, that would not constitute a barrier to Harris taking office, but Republicans in Congress could take action to stymie the process.\nSome Republican senators and representatives filed objections to the electoral college results in 2020, and they could do so again this year. The US could overcome a repeat of the turmoil that followed Biden’s victory over Trump, but such a situation overshadowing the incoming president could be a distraction at a time when she faces momentous decisions at home and abroad.\n\nThe second scenario is that, like Clinton, Harris wins the popular vote but loses the electoral college, sending Trump back to the White House. How would Democrats react? Suppose Trump’s margin in the electoral college is wafer-thin while Harris secures a decisive margin in the popular vote. Constitutionally there is little question over the victor, yet a large part of the US voter base could feel something is wrong, not least because of it being a repeat of the 2016 election. Democratic majorities in one or both houses of Congress would likely mean that they will do their best to frustrate Trump’s agenda while the president tries to work around them.\nThe third scenario is that Trump wins the electoral college with a clear majority and Republicans carry both chambers of Congress. A strong Republican majority in Congress would make it easier for Trump to pursue whichever policies he sees fit, but what if his party’s majority in Congress is too small to function effectively? Democrats in a more hostile Congress could create a stand-off and move in ways meant to flip the majority in the 2026 midterm elections.\nSo far, this analysis has looked at the US as a whole. However, the government is structured as a federal constitutional republic. It can be taken for granted that if the president is elected with a blurred or contested victory, some states which voted for the opposition will try their best to stymie federal policies. If Trump is elected despite suffering a clear defeat in the popular vote, how will reliably Democratic states such as California, New York and Illinois react? What might they do to frustrate Trump as he attempts to pass his Republican policies?","summary":"In a tight result, expect more turmoil given the nature of the electoral college and narrow margins in Congress.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3280750/how-another-close-election-could-add-rampant-us-dysfunction","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/04/0e41dcae-b36f-4477-8ef4-29db44c0f439_254159cf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 21:30:07","author":"Joergen Oerstroem Moeller","authors":["Joergen Oerstroem Moeller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":258608896,"title":"JD Vance blasts Trump critics’ ‘inflammatory rhetoric’ at Butler, Pa., rally: ‘Only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him’","text":"Standing on the very stage where his running mate narrowly avoided death, Republican vice presidential hopeful JD Vance admonished former President Donald Trump’s critics for stoking animosity against him. Vance, 40, called out Vice President Kamala Harris by name as well as the media for trafficking in “inflammatory rhetoric” against Trump that he contended has culminated in political violence. “With all the hatred they have spewed and President Trump, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him,” Vance bellowed out to a packed venue at the Butler Farm Show grounds Saturday. With bulletproof glass shielding him, Vance lamented how the onslaught against Trump, 78, has raged on — even in the aftermath of two high-profile attempts on the former president’s life. “Even after that terrible assassination attempt that took one man’s life and nearly took many others, they continue to use dangerous, inflammatory rhetoric. The media has continued to call Donald Trump — the guy who actually won his primary — a threat to democracy,” Vance bemoaned. The precise motivations behind the July 13 Butler, Pa., shooter, Matthew Thomas Crooks, 20, are still somewhat murky because he was killed by a Secret Service sniper. But authorities managed to detain Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, who attempted to carry out the second major would-be assassination attempt against Trump on Sept. 15. Because of that, they’ve been able to piece together a clearer picture of his motivations. “In fact, before the gunman in Florida tried to kill Donald Trump, he wrote, ‘Democracy is on the ballot,’ the exact same words that Kamala Harris wrote after accusing Trump of being a dictator only days before the first attempt on his life,” Vance chided. Earlier in his speech, which was intended to warm up the crowd before Trump took to the podium, Vance admonished Harris over that rhetoric. “I think you all will join me in saying to Kamala Harris, how dare you talk about threats to democracy. Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy. What the hell have you done?” he said. Vance also gave his running mate props, noting how “despite being shot here in Butler, President Trump immediately called for national unity.” Trump had adjusted his speech for the Republican National Convention to call for unity, but as the 2024 campaign season carried on, the two rival campaigns resumed hurling bitter broadsides at one another. “I honestly believe that what happened right here in Butler is a metaphor for the United States of America. In this land, we may get knocked down, but we get right back up, and we keep fighting,” Vance said. On July 13, Trump had been clipped in his right ear by a bullet and crouched down before Secret Service agents piled on top of him to keep him safe. After the gunshots stopped, Trump emerged standing with blood seeping down his face and pumped his fist in the air, telling his supporters to “fight, fight fight” before being rushed away. Shortly thereafter, Trump made clear he intended to visit the Butler Farm Show grounds again and finish what he started. “At this exact spot nearly three months ago, we thought, President Trump was going to lose his life. But God still has a plan for him just like it’s he still has a plan for the United States of America,” Vance later added. Saturday, which happens to be exactly one month out from Election Day will mark Trump’s first return to Butler, Pa. since the tragic shooting that took place in July. He vows to hit the campaign trail “almost every single day” in the lead-up to Nov. 5, The Post exclusively revealed Saturday.","summary":"Vance, 40, called out Kamala Harris by name as well as the media for trafficking in \"inflammatory rhetoric\" against Trump that he contended has culminated in political violence.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/us-news/jd-vance-blasts-trump-critics-only-a-matter-of-time-before-somebody-tried-to-kill-him/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/jd-vance-on-trump-shooting.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728148962&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 21:24:25","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":258606902,"title":"Harris visits North Carolina to survey Helene's aftermath","text":"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris visited North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene, arriving there one day after a stop in the state by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster. The vice president was greeted at the airport by Gov. Roy Cooper among others, and quickly headed into a briefing with emergency response officials about the recovery effort. Earlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed. The two have been vocal and visible about the government's willingness to help, and the administration's efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage. In a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund \"has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year.” He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program. More than 200 people have died. It's the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change. But in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states. Trump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn't doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene's aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it “one of the great scams of all time.\" During a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Thursday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal response and cited “lousy treatment to North Carolina in particular.\" In fact, Cooper said this week that more than 50,000 people have registered for FEMA assistance and about $6 million has been paid out. Biden has suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is withholding money for disaster relief needs. Harris’ visits present an additional political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She’s trying to step into a role for which Biden is well known — showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy — in the closing stretch of her White House campaign. Until this week, she had not visited the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice president. That duty was reserved for Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and more. Harris said this week that she wanted to “personally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary.” She expressed admiration for how “people are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.” She said that shows ”the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,” an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail. “We are here for the long haul,” she said. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Yet this devastation and despair is not enough for the extremist groups, disinformation agents, hucksters and politicians who are exploiting the disaster to spread false claims and conspiracy theories about it and the government's response. According to former President Donald Trump, the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. Far-right extremist groups warn on social media that officials plan to bulldoze affected communities and seize the land from residents. A tale straight from science fiction asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. The claims, according to experts and local officials dealing with disaster response, say less about the reality of the widespread damage from Helene than they do about America's fractured politics and the fear and distrust shadowing an election year marked by assassination attempts and escalating global tension. As rescue work continues and authorities try to separate fact from fiction, the conspiracy theories are not helping. Elected leaders from both parties have had to set the record straight and urge people not to give into fear and rumor. \"If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great,” posted Glenn Jacobs, the retired professional wrestler known as Kane, who is now the Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Jacobs' post was intended to rebut rumors that workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were seizing relief supplies from private citizens. Many of the conspiracy theories focus on hard-hit North Carolina, a state key to winning the White House. Rumors circulated that FEMA was raiding storm donations and withholding body bags, forcing local hospitals to stack the bodies of victims. One claim suggested federal authorities would condemn the entire town of Chimney Rock and prohibit resettlement in order to commandeer a valuable lithium mine nearby. Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, X and SpaceX, posted that private relief flights to North Carolina were being blocked by the Federal Aviation Administration, a claim dismissed as false by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Despite the tradition of Democrats and Republicans putting aside politics for disaster response, many conspiracy theories suggest Democrats such as President Joe Biden or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are intentionally withholding aid from Republicans. Trump has pushed the claim, as has North Carolina's lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, the embattled GOP nominee for governor. “They’re being treated very badly in the Republican areas,” Trump told Fox News, ignoring reports and photo and video evidence of recovery efforts underway throughout the region. “They’re not getting water, they’re not getting anything.” Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones endorsed Trump's fact-free allegation. Jones, the founder of InfoWars, popularized the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children in 2012 was faked. “Exclusive: Victims of Hurricane Helene Confirm The Federal Government is Purposely Blocking Rescuers and Stealing Aid In an Attempt to Keep Deep Red Areas From Voting,\" Jones posted Thursday on X. State-run media and disinformation campaigns run by China and Russia have amplified false and misleading claims about the response to the storm. Both countries have used social media and state news stories to criticize responses to past U.S. natural disasters, part of a larger effort to stoke division and distrust among Americans. State and local officials from both parties have condemned the conspiracy theories as rumors, saying the focus should be on recovery, not political division and hearsay. Responding to the hoaxes is taking up time that should go toward assisting victims, said North Carolina state Sen. Kevin Corbin, a Republican who urged his constituents not to give into hoaxes. “Friends can I ask a small favor?\" Corbin posted Thursday on Facebook. “Will you all help STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet... Please don’t let these crazy stories consume you.” After Robinson, the GOP candidate for North Carolina governor, posted that state officials had not prepared for the storm, a spokesman for the governor accused Robinson of mounting “an online disinformation campaign.” North Carolina officials say the response to Helene is the largest in state history, including thousands of members of the National Guard and other recovery workers, millions of meals, dozens of aircraft and more than 1,000 chainsaws. Trump has tried to tie the hurricane’s aftermath to immigration, a leading issue of his campaign. He falsely claimed that FEMA had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for undocumented immigrants. The agency's funding for disaster aid is stretched, but that is because of the many parts of the country dealing with the effects of hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities. Disaster aid is funded separately from other Department of Homeland Security programs that support immigration-related spending. Bizarre stories proposing that the government used weather control technology to aim the hurricane at Republican voters quickly racked up millions of views on X and other platforms. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., endorsed the idea, posting Wednesday on X: “Yes they can control the weather. It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.” Far-out tales of space lasers, fake snow and weather control technology -- sometimes tinged with antisemitism — have spread after recent natural disasters, including a snowstorm in Texas and last year’s wildfire in Maui. Experts who study conspiracy theories say big events like disasters — or the Sept. 11 attacks or the COVID-19 pandemic — create perfect conditions for conspiracy theories to spread because large numbers of anxious people are eager to find explanations for shocking events. Responding to the volume of false claims about Helene, the Red Cross urged people to consult trustworthy sources of information and to think twice before reposting conspiracy theories. “Sharing rumors online without first vetting the source and verifying facts ultimately hurts people — people who have just lost their homes, neighborhoods, and, in some cases, loved ones,\" the organization wrote in a public plea. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ramos appeared on PBS' \"Amanpour & Company\" this week to address the trend covered in her new book, \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means.\" Trump appears to be outperforming his 2020 support among Latinos who prefer the Republican over Vice President Kamala Harris on handling the economy and immigration. The Democratic Party's advantage with these voters is shrinking, according to NBC News, whose poll last week found the Democrats' edge is at its lowest level in the past four presidential election cycles. MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS ‘WANT TO BE WHITE’ WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP In discussions with Trump-supporting Latinos for her book, Ramos said she found that \"tribalism, traditionalism, and political trauma\" were the three driving forces behind this growing trend. \"Really understanding the sort of racial baggage that I believe a lot of Latinos, including myself, and a lot of us are carrying from Latin America. What it means to sort of been colonized for so many years, the weight of colonization, that, in of itself, I believe, creates a lot of internalized racism, a lot of colorism, that then manifests in American politics in so many ways,\" Ramos began. \"And that's then how you can explain the fact that even someone like Donald Trump feels so comfortable going to the Bronx, talking to a group of Black Latinos, and Latino Trump supporters, because he believes that he can sort of tap into a racial and ethnic grievance that is very familiar,\" she continued. Ramos told USA Today that traditionalism and trauma also play into the trend. \"There's traditionalism which is just breaking down what centuries of colonization have done to us and has led us to be so fixated on certain gender norms and sexual norms and then also leads us to this slippery slope of admiring things like Christian nationalism and then the trauma of this sort of admiration and a lot of Latinos flirting with the strongman rule and where that comes from,\" she said.

A widely shared video has reappeared on X, featuring comedian Jason Selvig grilling the senator from Ohio. In the viral clip, 'The Good Liars' co-founder asks Vance several times whether Trump has won the 2020 election as he follows him. \"Who won the 2020 election? Could you just answer? Did Donald Trump win?\" Selvig can be seen inquiring. Vance responds: \"Yes,\" prompting the comedian to corroborate his observations. \"He did win?\" Selvig asks, to which Vance once again responds: \"Yep.\" According to the Daily Mail, in addition, Vance declined to respond to Selvig's inquiry on whether or not he would give in if Vice President Kamala Harris won the 2024 election. The video was re-posted after Vance stated during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday night that he would have supported Trump's plan to use \"alternative electors\" to rig the results of the election. Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz questioned Vance on whether Donald Trump lost the 2020 election during their major debate. \"Did he lose the 2020 election?\" following the debate moderators' lengthy questioning of the Ohio senator, Walz questioned Vance, bringing up the fact that Trump and his allies have had 62 election claims dismissed from court. \"Tim, I'm focused on the future,\" Vance responded and quickly interjected with another point. \"Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation,\" the Republican candidate stated in a bid to overthrow the main topic. \"It's a damning non-answer,\" Walz attacked. \"First of all, I think we're focused on 'how to solve the inflation crisis caused by Kamala Harris, make housing affordable, make groceries affordable,\" Vance continued by diverting from the question. \"What President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020 and my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square.\" \"And on January 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House,\" Vance stated. According to the Daily Mail, Trump's attempts to force states to discard ballots cast legitimately, his campaign of pressure on Mike Pence, and his call for followers to gather in D.C. on January 6 were all briefly mentioned by Vance. He claimed that Harris was \"censoring\" on social media and that the problem \"to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January the sixth.\" \"Donald Trump refused to acknowledge' the results,\" Walz then said. \"He was very clear. I mean, he lost this election, and he said he didn't. One hundred and forty police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died. Sometimes you really want to win, but democracy is bigger than winning an election.

He said he'd come back to finish his speech, and to me (that takes) guts,\" said Robert Dupain, 53, a local construction worker who was at the July rally.\"That's what (these) 50,000 people stand for,\" said Dupain who described having \"nervous excitement all week\" about attending.Though there was no official count, Saturday's rally was significantly better attended than the one in July.Trump's return to Butler, a deeply conservative community in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, was also marked by noticeably tighter security.Secret Service sniper squads were stationed on several buildings around the Butler Farm Show grounds, while drones could be seen buzzing overhead and bulletproof glass was erected around the podium.The complex of buildings from where the would-be assassin fired, that in July was left outside the security perimeter despite its proximity to Trump's podium, was ringed by state police on Saturday.Semis were also parked around the venue, blocking potential sightlines.\"There's a lot going on that's unnerving,\" said Heather Hughes, 43, who had traveled from New Castle in Pennsylvania.\"Do I think he's safe?

This return rally comes one month before the presidential election, with Trump’s campaign marred by ongoing security threats and the spectre of political violence. Trump’s speech will take place behind protective glass, a stark reminder of the heightened security concerns following two assassination attempts in recent months. The most recent attempt, which was foiled last month, has underscored persistent fears for the former president’s safety. Security at the rally is notably tighter, with sniper squads stationed on nearby buildings and surveillance drones monitoring the area. This follows the July incident, where a gunman managed to fire eight shots at Trump before being shot dead by Secret Service agents. Two supporters were injured during the attack, and firefighter Corey Comperatore tragically lost his life. The incident also led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, ten days after the attack. Heather Hughes, a supporter at the rally, reflected the anxieties shared by many in the crowd. “Do I think he’s safe? No, I think there’s going to be another attempt. But I think he’s going to make it through,” she told AFP. Trump’s supporters have embraced the former president’s narrative of defiance. Pictures of him, blood-streaked and shouting “fight, fight, fight” as Secret Service agents rushed him away during the July attack, have become rallying images for his campaign. Many attendees on Saturday donned shirts bearing assassination iconography, with some referencing the bandage Trump wore after the shooting. Despite the growing tensions and the added security, Trump has continued to use the assassination attempt as a political rallying point, claiming he “took a bullet for democracy.” The former president remains a central figure in the ongoing political landscape, despite the violence and controversies surrounding his campaign. Trump’s return to Butler comes as the presidential race sees significant shifts. Following the failed assassination attempt in July, President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, and Vice President Kamala Harris took over as the Democratic nominee. Harris has since clawed back in the polls, even reversing Trump’s lead in some key states. Trump’s campaign is pushing to regain momentum, bringing along running mate J.D. Vance to the rally, while billionaire Elon Musk also hinted at addressing the crowd via his social media platform X. As the election draws near, Trump remains at the center of a deeply polarized race, with the looming threat of further violence casting a shadow over the final weeks of the campaign. Asked on Friday about the possibility of more election-related violence, President Biden expressed uncertainty, telling AFP, “I don’t know if the vote will be peaceful.” For Trump’s supporters, however, the former president’s resilience in the face of danger continues to fuel their devotion. “He said he’d come back to finish his speech, and to me that takes guts,” said local rally-goer Robert Dupain, recalling Trump’s promise after the July attack.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump is set to speak in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, a location that holds a dark significance as the site of a failed assassination attempt against him in July.
