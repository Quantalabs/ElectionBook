Barbara Lee has won the Oakland mayoral race and vowed to work with city residents to ease racial and economic tensions.\n\n\"Oakland is a deeply divided city,\" Lee said after being calculated as the winner, and said that she \"answered the call to run\" so the community could address its issues together, NBC News reported.\n\n\"While I believe strongly in respecting the democratic voting process and boots will continue to be counted, the results are clear that the people of Oakland have elected me as your next mayor,\" she continued. \"Thank you, Oakland!\"\n\nCouncilmember Loren Taylor conceded the race Saturday morning after it became clear that Lee's lead was insurmountable. Lee made a brief appearance at an Easter event Sunday at the Arroyo Viejo Center where she thanked interim Mayor Kevin Jenkins for his work.\n\nLee, 78, represented Oakland in Congress for 27 years before retiring last year following an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate.\n\nShe was endorsed by a handful of California Democratic party stalwarts, including former Gov. Jerry Brown.

Plus, Americans are waking up to climate change threat","text":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about. You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n2028 favorites: Harris slips, Booker booms, but what about AOC?\n\nIt’s April 2025, five months after an enormously depressing presidential election, so you know what that means: It’s time to talk about the 2028 presidential race.\n\nSince last year’s election, Echelon Insights has conducted four polls asking voters who they’d support if their party’s 2028 presidential primaries were held today. And in its first poll, fielded mere days after the 2024 election, 41% of Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents supported Kamala Harris to be their next presidential nominee. \n\nBut now, three months into President Donald Trump’s fresh hell, only 28% would back Harris if the 2028 Democratic primary were held today, according to new data from the same pollster. \n\nWhile Harris still leads the survey’s field of 20 potential candidates, her support has fallen in each survey the pollster has run.\n\nWho else are Democrats eyeing, then?\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has leapt into second place. In March, only 2% of Democratic voters wanted him to be the next nominee, but now, coming off his fiery, marathon anti-Trump speech on the Senate floor, his support has jumped to 11%.\n\nAfter him are New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (7%), former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (7%), and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (5%). No other name got more than 5% support. (Buttigieg, Booker, and Ocasio-Cortez also lead another poll that excludes Harris from the list of options.) \n\nHowever, Ocasio-Cortez’s prospects could be underrated. For one, she’s currently on a cross-country tour with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and drawing tens of thousands of people, even in some dark red areas of the country. And with a certain endorsement from Sanders, she’d likely have the progressive lane to herself, all while other candidates probably try to out-moderate each other.\n\nMore importantly, though, Yale University’s new poll shows her a close second behind Harris when it comes to 2028. Among Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents, Harris pulls 27.5% support and Ocasio-Cortez scores 21.3%. No other named option received more than 15% support. \n\nThe poll also finds that she’s the most liked among potential 2028 Democratic candidates, with a net favorability of +62. Harris is in second place, at +59.\n\nHarris’ 2028-related support is likely to keep falling as well. After all, she did lose last year’s election, and Democrats will likely get even more wary about backing her for a second go at the White House. Also, Harris is currently weighing a run for governor of California and has set a self-imposed summer deadline to decide. She’d be an obvious favorite in that race, with 31% of California’s overall likely-voter electorate already backing her for the job, according to new polling from Emerson College. \n\nIf Ocasio-Cortez enters the 2028 Democratic primary, she would need to prove she can win general-election voters, who might be less keen on a candidate who sells “Abolish ICE” dad hats. Democrats will surely be hesitant to take an electability risk after being burned last year.\n\nThat said, an idealistic, fresh-faced, anti-establishment Democrat of color beloved by young voters, known for delivering powerful speeches, and with one parent who was born outside the U.S. does ring a few bells. \n\nGlobal warming, personal threat\n\nGood news for people who love bad news: More Americans than ever before are worried about how much climate change will harm them personally.\n\nForty-eight percent of Americans say that global warming will pose “a serious threat” to them and their way of life in their lifetime, according to new data from Gallup. That’s up from a previous high of 46% in 2023 and well above the 39% average of Gallup’s polling since 1997.\n\nThat said, 51% of Americans say it won’t pose a personal threat to them. \n\nThe odd thing is, more Americans than ever before also say the effects of climate change are currently playing out. According to Gallup, 63% say global warming’s effects have already begun, with another 23% saying they will begin in the future. Just a scant 12% say those effects will never happen.\n\nThe burning-hot silver lining in these numbers is that Americans are taking climate change more seriously than ever before. The downside, though, is that the issue still ranks at the bottom of their biggest environmental worries, with problems like drinking-water safety and river pollution ranking much higher.\n\nStill, 63% of Americans worrying a great deal or a fair amount about global warming ain’t terrible. But for the worry to become big enough that U.S. politicians are forced to meet the moment, it’ll no doubt take things getting even worse.\n\nThe “good” news here is that things very much are.\n\nRepublicans soften on China—wait, what?\n\nAs infamous sinophobe Trump slaps heavy tariffs on China, fewer Americans see the world’s most populous country in a negative light, but more curiously, it’s Trump’s base that is softening.\n\nAccording to new data from Pew Research Center, 33% of U.S. adults overall have a “very” unfavorable opinion of China, down from 43% last year, making for a drop of 10 percentage points. Another 44% have a “somewhat” unfavorable view of China. That marks the first time in five years that the percentage of Americans with an unfavorable view has declined from the year prior.\n\nLargely responsible for that drop are Republicans, whose very unfavorable view of China has fallen 16 points since last year. And the percentage of those with an unfavorable view (“very” or “somewhat”) has fallen 8 points. \n\nThe reason for this may be that Republicans see China as less of a threat, with fewer considering the nation to be the world’s leading economic and military power, according to Pew.\n\nFor Democrats, the survey finds a 5-point drop from 2024. Democrats have also long been less critical than Republicans when it comes to China.\n\nThe survey was fielded before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, though, so it’s possible that his 145% tariff on China (or is it 245%?) has reminded Republicans to start hating the nation again.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Maine’s perennially concerned Republican Sen. Susan Collins holds a seat Democrats must win to have a real shot of retaking the chamber in the near future, and a new poll brings welcome news: Collins is much more unpopular than she was at this point six years ago, ahead of her 2020 reelection, according to Morning Consult. In 2019, 52% of Maine voters approved of the job she was doing, while 39% disapproved. Now only 42% approve, and 51% disapprove. \n\n As the Trump administration illegally deports Maryland fathers and student activists without due process, it does so with very little public support. A new poll from Data for Progress finds that even most Republicans support giving common due process rights, such as the right to a fair trial, to legal immigrants. Additionally, 57% of likely voters think the government should be able to deport undocumented migrants only if it provides evidence for their deportation and offers them a hearing.\n\nDemocratic voters’ view of Harris has soured slightly since the 2024 election, according to Civiqs. The day before last year’s election, 93% of Democratic voters had a favorable view of her, while only 5% had a negative view. \n\nHowever, as of this past Monday, only 87% have a favorable view of her, and 8% have an unfavorable view. \n\nAlso notable is that Civiqs has been tracking her favorability since November 2017, and she has never once had a net-positive rating among all registered voters.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

Biden has been at the center of the turmoil within the Democratic Party ever since President Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election. Many Democrats have blamed him for not withdrawing from the presidential race sooner and allowing time for an open primary to select a new Democratic nominee rather than rallying behind then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the final months of the campaign.

Since the move, Morgan has not only engaged in heated debates himself but also presided over tense arguments between his own guests. (RELATED: ‘Ludicrous’: Piers Morgan Quarrels With Panelist Accusing Him Of Wanting To ‘Eradicate Trans People’ Over Sports Issue)\n\n1. A Historic Meltdown From A Progressive Activist\n\nIn the summer of 2024, Democrats ramped up their attacks on President Donald Trump after a New York jury convicted him on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in a case brought by Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nWhile Republicans and Trump supporters argued the case was politically motivated against the then-Republican presidential nominee, Democrats rejected the claim. During a June 2024 episode, Daily Wire’s Michael J. Knowles called out progressive activist Francesca Fiorentini for her lack of understanding of the case as she pushed back against the panel’s defense of Trump.\n\n“Well, let’s just ask quickly…just on that point, what crime did Trump commit?” Morgan asked Fiorentini.\n\n“It was, it was — campaign — it was financial crimes,” Fiorentini responded. “It was white-collar crimes. That is exactly what they charged him and he was convicted on.”\n\nBoth Morgan and Knowles pressed Fiorentini to specify the exact crime Trump had committed, prompting her to shout, “It’s New York state law!” The progressive activist tried to push back against the panel but was later seen looking down — presumably at her phone —while criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos called out her lack of understanding of the case.\n\n“I don’t mean to pick on Francesca too much here, but it’s very telling that even the liberals who are going on television to defend this ruling have to Google in the breaks to figure out what the crime was. And even then, I’m sorry to say, misrepresent what the actual supposed crime was —” Knowles stated.\n\n“I will Google it because it’s literally not my [job]! I said he was cooking the books. That’s the same thing,” Fiorentini jumped in.\n\n2. Panelist Wants To Throw Down\n\nJust a month before the November 2024 election, Democrats and former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign ramped up attacks on Trump, comparing him to Hitler and warning he would end democracy if elected to a second term.\n\nDuring an Oct. 23 CNN town hall, Harris publicly said that Trump was a fascist, further escalating tensions between the parties. In an episode that same month, journalist Wajahat Ali and conservative radio host Ben Ferguson got into a heated exchange, with Ali threatening Ferguson after being challenged over his defense of comparing Trump to Hitler.\n\n“When you start calling people Hitler, it’s in context. If you start talking about context — ” Ferguson said.\n\n“Ben, don’t gish gallop. Ben, I’m about to kick your ass. Don’t gish gallop. Just listen to me. I listened to you,” Ali responded.\n\n“There’s nothing that was just talked about that matters to the people that are hurting and suffering in this country right now. Nothing that was just said there was unifying. Nothing that was just said there was about the concerns of people that are struggling in this country with inflation, with illegal immigration, with convicted terrorists coming across the border, with those that are convicted of murder and rape that are coming across the border,” Ferguson said.\n\nWhile Democrats pointed to allegations from former Trump aides comparing the president to Adolf Hitler, former President Joe Biden also sparked backlash after calling Trump supporters “garbage” in an interview — only to later clarify on X that he was referring to their “rhetoric.”\n\n3. Lack Of Empathy\n\nIn addition to Trump being a frequent flashpoint on Morgan’s panels, tensions flared during a December 2024 episode focused on the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\nThompson, 50, was fatally shot outside his New York hotel on Dec. 4, allegedly by 26-year-old Luigi Mangione. Following a manhunt and Mangione’s capture, some Democrats and online activists began expressing sympathy for the alleged killer—pointing to frustration with the healthcare system as motivation.\n\nDuring the segment, Democrat political commentator Briahna Joy Gray told Morgan she had “infinite empathy for any individual as a person in their personal capacity,” but said she would be “saving” her empathy when it came to Thompson’s role at UnitedHealthcare. Morgan pressed her further, clarifying whether she had “any empathy” at all for the CEO after his public execution.\n\n“I personally don’t,” Gray said.\n\n“Right. OK, well, at least you’re honest,” Morgan responded. “I mean, I find this staggering. You’ve got to remember the left is supposed to be the party that cares so much. All of them have their ‘be kind’ hashtags. They’re the caring ones, the kind ones, and they can’t even bring it in their hearts to say they find a shred of empathy for a man who’s just been executed, who’s the father of children, the husband of a loving wife, and so on.”\n\nThe response from Gray later triggered Steve Bannon’s “War Room” host Natalie Winters to call out the response.\n\n“I’m not a supporter of the United States healthcare system or apparatus. Believe me, there’s so many problems that need to be fixed and adjusted there. But condoning, which is in effect what these two panelists are doing, the assassination of him by a roundabout way by saying, ‘Well, the healthcare system,'” Winters said, with Gray attempting to interrupt her.\n\n“You just told me that you had absolutely no empathy and that you think what people are doing by gunning down healthcare executives because of bad decisions.”\n\n4. Smirking and Assassinations \n\nIn another tense exchange over the defense of Mangione’s alleged actions, Morgan called out former Washington Post columnist Taylor Lorenz while discussing Thompson’s assassination.\n\nLorenz, who was already facing backlash for her public comments about Mangione and the assassination, appeared to smirk as Morgan and the panel discussed the death of the 50-year-old CEO.\n\n“Taylor, I don’t mean to be rude, but why the fuck are you laughing all the time?” Morgan jumped in. “I don’t get it. Sorry. Apologies for my language, but, honestly, I find it unbelievable. What are you laughing at?”\n\n“I am laughing at Tomi’s insane mischaracterization of why people are angry. It has nothing to do with Occupy Wall Street. This is a feeling that people feel across the left and the right,” Lorenz said. “We do not think that this health care system is murdering, again, thousands of innocent Americans who, by the way, Tomi, also have families, also have children. These people are being killed by our barbaric and evil for-profit health care system.”\n\nAfter Thompson’s death, Lorenz got pushback online after she took to BlueSky and responded to Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield releasing a now-retracted policy to deny claims for certain anesthesia procedures.\n\n“And people wonder why we want these executives dead,” Lorenz wrote.\n\nThe former Washington Post columnist later took to her online blog to clarify that she did not “mean people should murder them.”\n\n5. The Damage Of TDS\n\nIn one of Morgan’s more recent March episodes, the panel burst into laughter after ‘PBD Podcast’ co-host Vinny Oshana brought out photos of celebrities to show the before-and-after effects of so-called “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nThe term, popularized during Trump’s first term, refers to individuals who express extreme or irrational views about the former president. While many in Hollywood once embraced Trump, the tide shifted after his 2016 win, with celebrities like Kathy Griffin and Rosie O’Donnell repeatedly attacking him.\n\n“This is Rosie O’Donnell before Trump, right? Nice, good. Look what happens, Piers, with Trump Derangement Syndrome, alright? Rachel Maddow! Look at how hot Rachel Maddow was. Then look, Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Oshana said. “She looks like Stephen Colbert.”\n\nAs Oshana revealed the first photo of O’Donnell, some of the panel struggled to hold back laughter before he continued showcasing more examples of “TDS” effects.\n\n“Then look, Kathy Griffin, someone that I might have hooked up with if I was drunk. They turned her into Carrot Top, OK? That’s what it does to you people, OK? You guys have lost your freaking mind,” Oshana added.\n\nAfter Trump’s second victory in November 2024, O’Donnell announced in March that she had left the U.S. with her daughter, saying they’d be living in Ireland because of the current political climate.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

So, was The View canceled?\n\nBelow, Hollywood Life has a full breakdown on what’s going on and whether or not ABC’s The View could be canceled.\n\nThe View Current Co-Hosts\n\nSunny Hostin, Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Alyssa Farrah Griffin, Ana Navarro and Sara Haines are the current co-hosts of the daytime TV show. Whoopi is the longest-running co-host of The View, having worked with the show for nearly 20 consecutive seasons.\n\nIs The View Canceled?\n\nNo, The View has not been canceled by ABC. Rumors of a cancelation have been spreading all over social media since at least 2024, with many criticizing the show for its political segments. While all co-hosts have criticized Donald Trump and his administration, the most outspoken critic on the show is Whoopi. Lately, in April 2025, fans have wondered why there have only been reruns of the show. Fortunately for them, The View is on a hiatus and will return on April 22, 2025.\n\nThe View had its highest viewership in about two years back in February 2024, according to The Wrap. At the time, Executive Producer Brian Teta told the publication that the show’s uptick in audience numbers was due, in part, to the guests they’ve invited onto the show in recent years.\n\n“Daytime audiences turn to The View for news and politics, and this presidential election year is off to a great start,” Brian told The Wrap. “We’ve had some tremendous political guests in January including Vice President Kamala Harris, Liz Cheney and Chris Christie and just this week, we welcomed Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies. Politicians know that if they want to speak to an engaged audience, there’s no better place to be. There are conversations happening at this table during ‘Hot Topics,’ and with our guests during interviews that aren’t happening anywhere else on television … and we’re also having a lot of fun.”\n\nCanceled News Shows\n\nToward the end of 2024 and at the start of 2025, a wide array of news shows were axed from their networks. Joy Reid‘s MSNBC show The ReidOut is reportedly being cut from the network. Previously, CBS Evening News‘ Norah O’Donnell, TODAY’s Hoda Kotb, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto and several other anchors stepped down from their positions.","summary":"Amid a string of media outlet layoffs and TV anchor departures, social media users are speculating about the fate of 'The View' since it's been showing reruns for days.","url":"https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/is-the-view-canceled-5371938/","image":"https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/the-view-season-27-embed3_904ba8-e1740410384637.jpg?fit=619%2C350","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 18:23:23","author":"Elisabeth McGowan","authors":["Elisabeth McGowan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.187},{"id":313059010,"title":"Pope Francis Meets JD Vance On Easter Sunday For Brief Conversation After Clash Over Immigration","text":"According to Politico, Vance’s motorcade entered Vatican City through a side gate and parked near Francis’ hotel residence while Mass was being celebrated in St. Peter’s Square. The pope, who has greatly cut back his workload to recover from a near-fatal case of double pneumonia in February, met with the vice president for a few minutes at the Domus Santa Marta.\nVance, who was baptized as a Catholic six years ago, has been in Rome for the weekend to celebrate the holiday and visit with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and leaders within the Vatican. His wife, Usha Vance, is there as well.\nThe Sunday meeting, which the Vatican called “brief,” comes after the pope called the US’s immigration crackdown a “disgrace” and criticized the policies of Trump’s administration, including deep cuts to foreign aid and social services.\nDays before being hospitalized in February, Francis penned an open letter to American bishops urging them to reject anti-immigrant narratives—a decisive rebuke from the pope.\nDeporting migrants who often come from difficult situations, Francis wrote, violates the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families.”\nThe pontiff said he has “followed closely the major crisis that is taking place in the United States with the initiation of a program of mass deportations,” and believes that any policy built on force “begins badly and will end badly.”\nIn his letter, the pope specifically referenced Vance’s use of Catholic doctrine to justify the administration’s treatment of immigrants. In late January, the vice president invoked the concept of “ordo amoris,” a Christian motto that refers to how believers prioritize giving love and charity to others, when talking about immigration. He said that Americans ought to focus on family, neighbor, community, and “your fellow citizens in your own country,” before “you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.”\nThe pope didn’t like that interpretation, writing, “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.” “The true ordo amoris that must be promoted,” he continued, is “love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.”\nVance later acknowledged Francis’ criticism during a late February appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Vance didn’t address the issue specifically—and has said he will continue to defend his views—but called himself a “baby Catholic” with “things about the faith that I don’t know.”\nWhile Pope Francis has critiqued Trump and his administrations in the past—even suggesting in 2016 that he was “not Christian” for his hopes for the border wall—the supreme pontiff didn’t go as far as endorsing a candidate in 2024. In September of last year, he criticized both Trump and then-vice president Kamala Harris for being too anti-immigration and pro-abortion, respectively. He told reporters, “One must choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser of two evils? That lady or that gentleman? I don’t know.”\nPrior to exchanging Easter greetings with the Pope on Saturday, the Vances received a private tour of the Sistine Chapel before the vice president met with the Vatican’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.\nWhile the Holy See reaffirmed a good relationship with Vance, he also noted “an exchange of opinions” on current international conflicts, migration, and prisoners.\n“There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions, and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” a statement from the Vatican said. “Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.”\nThe vice president’s office confirmed the meeting between Vance and Parolin, but didn’t mention any differing opinions, saying they “discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump’s commitment to restoring world peace.”\nBefore Vance’s visit, Cardinal Parolin told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that “it is clear that the approach of the current US administration is very different from what we are used to.”\n“And,” he noted, different, “especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years.”","summary":"A Catholic convert, the vice president spent the weekend in Rome meeting with various Italian and Vatican leaders.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/pope-francis-meets-jd-vance-easter-2025","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68052dee6cd2e7c0c5cf9759/16:9/w_7072,h_3978,c_limit/2211102877","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 18:15:26","author":"Katie Herchenroeder","authors":["Katie Herchenroeder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":313044648,"title":"Sarah Palin’s defamation suit retrial against the New York Times raises first amendment concerns","text":"When Sarah Palin arrived at a federal court on Monday, her appearance promised little in the way of legal fireworks.\n\nPalin was in downtown Manhattan for a retrial in her defamation lawsuit against the New York Times. She lost her first trial against the newspaper in 2022 and the legal basis of Palin’s civil claim – that an incorrect editorial unlawfully smeared her – remains the same.\n\nThe retrial granted to the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential contender stems from procedural errors rather than factual questions. The US second circuit court of appeals revamped Palin’s case in 2024, having determined that Judge Jed Rakoff wrongly intruded on jurors’ decision-making.\n\nWhile the jury was originally deliberating, Rakoff decided that if they delivered a verdict in Palin’s favor, he would set aside this decision. Rakoff, who stated that he presumed Palin would appeal what he expected to be an unfavorable verdict, told both sides that an appeals court “would greatly benefit from knowing how the jury would decide it”, according to NBC News.\n\nSome jurors received push notifications on their phones about Rakoff’s decision while they were actually deliberating. The second circuit also found that Rakoff erred by keeping information from jurors potentially showing that James Bennet, then the editorial page editor at the New York Times, knew this piece was incorrect.\n\nWhile trial proceedings that started last week are largely a replay of Palin’s initial trial, first amendment constitutional advocates contend that they reflect a troubling trend. Politicians and public figures – especially Donald Trump and his allies – are waging campaigns against US media organisations that are critical of them.\n\nMany of these lawsuits are unlikely to pass legal muster: public figures have a high burden in proving defamation. But many outlets lack the resources to fight a costly years-long legal battle against defamation claims in a culture that’s increasingly media-averse, suppressing free expression.\n\n“Every libel case these days feels like it has significant implications because of the fear and concern that the supreme court might ultimately want to change the legal standards for public officials and public figures,” Roy S Gutterman, the director of the Newhouse School’s Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University, said.\n\nThat said, Palin’s case might not be a referendum on the first amendment outright as “the actual malice standard, which requires the plaintiff to prove that the false information published about them was done either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth, is not an easy standard, which is why plenty of libel plaintiffs like Governor Palin do not win defamation lawsuits”, he added.\n\nIf Palin loses again, however, this does not equate to an automatic victory for first amendment rights. “She will almost certainly appeal again and keep appealing,” Gutterman said. “Appellate courts set precedent, so we might still be a ways away from seeing how strong the first amendment ultimately is these days.”\n\nAnd if Palin were to land a shocking win, “it would not be great for the New York Times or the free press altogether. Even if she wins a nominal amount of money, both sides might still keep appealing,” Gutterman said.\n\nRobert Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire), said the Palin proceedings hinge on procedural issues rather than a referendum on the first amendment. Philadelphia-based Fire is defending Iowa pollster J Ann Selzer from the US president, who is suing her over a poll which concluded that he was trailing Kamala Harris in the state just before his decisive victory in Iowa as well as nationally in the 2024 election.\n\n“The retrial is more of a standard defamation claim,” Corn-Revere said. “The question is whether or not Sarah Palin will meet the very high bar that is required for a public figure deflation case.”\n\nThat said, the case is unfolding in a time where there is “contempt for constitutional norms”.\n\n“People who want to bring some kind of action will do so regardless of whether or not they have some kind of valid claim, or whether or not such a claim even exists,” Corn-Revere said.\n\nThe 2017 editorial referred to the 2011 mass shooting that gravely injured then Arizona Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords and left six people dead. Prior to this attack, Palin’s political action committee (Pac) published an ad, featuring cross-hairs, spanning over several congressional districts led by Democrats.\n\nThe editorial article in question erroneously associated the Pac’s political rhetoric with the mass shooting. Asked about Palin’s claims, the Times said: “This case revolves around a passing reference to an event in an editorial that was not about Sarah Palin. That reference contained an unintended error that was corrected within 18 hours.”\n\nTom Spiggle, the founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, said that the retrial presents a “second bite at the apple” for Palin but “it really comes down to a factual issue at this point”.\n\n“Can they show actual malice?” Spiggle said. “That’s going to be a jury question.”\n\nAlthough the legal question is very specific, the case does speak to broader ongoing public discourse about free speech in the Trump era. “Trump has in the past made statements that he would like to reform defamation law and make it easier for people to win defamation cases,” he said.\n\nBut if Palin loses again, this could make an important statement for free speech.\n\n“I think it does send a message that just because you’re angry at the New York Times – or insert your media source here – doesn’t mean you’re going to prevail. The standards are still high,” Spiggle said. “Actual malice is tough to prove, and there’s a reason for that, right? It’s because we want these reporters … not [to] be on pins and needles every time they publish a story.”\n\nLawyers for Palin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe retrial is scheduled to resume on Monday. Jurors are expected to start deliberating midweek.","summary":"She lost the first trial in 2022, but she gets ‘second bite of the apple’ due to a judge’s procedural errors\n\nWhen Sarah Palin arrived at a federal court on Monday, her appearance promised little in the way of legal fireworks.\n\nPalin was in downtown Manhattan for a retrial in her defamation lawsuit against the New York Times.

When others appeared exhausted, Biden was raring to go, Reed said. Biden showed “unbelievable stamina”.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian in January 2023, Whipple said Biden’s “inner circle” was “bullish about Biden’s mental acuity and his ability to govern. I never heard any of them express any concern and maybe you would expect that from the inner circle. Many of them will tell you that he has extraordinary endurance, energy.”\n\nPut it this way: much has happened since.\n\nObviously, there was that whole 2024 election thing. You know – the one when Biden dropped out after a disastrous debate exposed his decline for all to see. There was also the day in February, before the campaign kicked off, when the special counsel Robert Hur declined to charge Biden with mishandling classified documents, because he found him too addled and sympathetic a prospective defendant.\n\nHur wrote: “He did not remember when he was vice-president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended (‘If it was 2013 – when did I stop being vice-president?’) and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term began (‘In 2009, am I still vice-president?’) … He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died.”\n\nWhipple, a former CBS producer, has emerged as a go-to author on the White House and those who work there. In The Gatekeepers, he examined the lives of chiefs of staff. Then came The Fight of His Life. With hindsight, Whipple seems to have missed key evidence of Biden’s decline.\n\nBut Whipple is back with a vengeance. Uncharted, his third book, hits Biden and his aides like a bludgeon. Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic nominee after Biden withdrew, fares little better: Whipple depicts a candidate who never should have been there, a sentiment repeatedly expressed by senior Democrats.\n\nWhipple had access. People talked. Ron Klain, Biden’s first chief of staff, is a key source – and demonstrates startling cognitive dissonance about Biden’s mental and physical decline. Klain says Biden should have stayed in the race – but also gives an absolutely withering account of debate prep at Camp David.\n\nAt his first meeting with Biden in Aspen Lodge, the president’s cabin, Klain describes Biden as “startled”. Whipple writes: “He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.” He fell asleep.\n\n“‘We sat around the table,’” says Klain in the book. “‘And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with Nato leaders.’” Klain, Whipple writes, “wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US”.\n\nCome the debate against Trump, Biden gave perhaps the worst performance of all time. He shuffled, he stared, he made verbal stumbles and gaffes. He handed Trump the win.\n\nKlain also tags Biden for skipping a post-debate meeting with progressives in favor of a family photoshoot with Annie Leibovitz.\n\n“‘You need to cancel that,’” Klain says he told Biden. “‘You need to stay in Washington. You need to have an aggressive plan to fight and to rally the troops.’” Biden rebuffed him and instead held a Zoom call with the progressives. It went badly.\n\n“‘All you guys want to talk about is Gaza … What would you have me do?’” Biden said. “‘I was a progressive before some of you guys were even in Congress.’”\n\nHow do you remind people you’re old without saying you’re old?\n\nWhipple also pays attention to Trump. Susie Wiles, now Trump’s chief of staff, and Karl Rove, a veteran of the George W Bush White House, speak on the record. So does Paul Manafort, a campaign manager in 2016, later jailed and pardoned.\n\n“Democrats wanted to know why Harris had lost to Trump and his MAGA movement,” Whipple writes. “Susie Wiles wanted to know why Harris and her team had run such a flawed campaign.”\n\nWiles did not view a Trump victory as inevitable. Whipple asks Wiles: “‘Did that mean Harris couldn’t have won?’”\n\nTrump’s campaign chair didn’t mince words.\n\n“‘We’ll never know,’” she replies, “‘because it didn’t seem like she even tried.’\n\n“‘Voters want authenticity … and they didn’t get that from her.’”\n\nLeon Panetta, chief of staff to Bill Clinton, echoed Wiles.\n\n“‘I thought they were thinking they could tiptoe into the presidency without getting anybody pissed off at them,’” he tells Whipple. “‘Baloney. You’ve got to make the American people understand that you’re tough enough to be president of the United States.’”\n\nRove does take a jab at Trump and Chris LaCivita, the ex-Marine who became a senior adviser. Rove introduced LaCivita to Trump, via the late megadonor Sheldon Adelson, but didn’t think LaCivita would take the gig. “‘I’m surprised because I know what he thinks of Trump,’” Rove tells Whipple. “‘He thinks Trump’s an idiot.’”\n\nLaCivita condemned January 6, after which he “liked” a tweet that urged Trump’s cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment and remove him from power. LaCivita deleted the post – but did not join the second Trump administration.\n\nBack in 2023, in The Fight of His Life, Whipple wrote: “Presidents do not give up power lightly.” Andy Card, chief of staff to George W Bush, weighed in: “‘If anybody tells you they’re leaving the White House voluntarily, they’re probably lying. This applies to presidents, of any age, who are driven by vast reserves of ego and ambition.’”\n\nBiden did go – but not voluntarily. In Uncharted, in merciless detail, Whipple shows he should have gone much sooner.\n\n Uncharted is published in the US by HarperCollins","summary":"Chris Whipple’s third book, Uncharted, hits Biden and aides like a bludgeon, with key sources who speak on the record\n\n“Biden was mentally sharp, even if he appeared physically frail,” Chris Whipple wrote in The Fight of His Life, his 2023 book on the 46th president, who was then warming up his re-election bid at the age of 80.\n\nIn that book, Whipple quoted Bruce Reed, a senior aide, describing a long-distance flight.

Marcus resigned after the Post’s publisher Will Lewis killed a column she’d written criticizing Bezos and his efforts to align the opinion pages more to his libertarian viewpoint.\n\nAccording to media reports, Amazon founder Bezos also had directed the opinion section to not publish contrary views but limit opinions to support of ideals such as free markets.\n\nMarcus’ resignation came a few months after Bezos killed a planned endorsement by the Post’s editorial board of Democrat Kamala Harris for president over Republican Donald Trump. She had worked for the Post in various roles for four decades.\n\nBezos’ move came at a time his once-contentious relationship with Trump was warming. Critics, including thousands of Post subscribers who canceled, feared he was putting his business interests ahead of editorial independence.\n\nRobinson, too, had worked more than four decades at the Post. He also departed, resigning the column-writing role he had held at the Post since 2005 and citing the Bezos-directed shift in the opinion pages.\n\nI probably received more complaints about Robinson over the years than any other opinion columnist. His reliably left-wing take frequently angered conservative readers.\n\nMy response was typically this: An opinion section everyone agrees with is neither attainable nor desirable.\n\nOr I might recount a phone call I overheard once in the newsroom between longtime Metro columnist Steve Duin and a disgruntled reader. “Perhaps for the sake of your blood-pressure and mine,” Duin said, “you should just stop reading me.”\n\nSome readers will rejoice at the departure of the two liberal Washington Post columnists, for balance. A not-infrequent complaint is we don’t publish enough conservative voices.\n\nWhile we do try for a mix of viewpoints, I would say there are fewer syndicated columns available to us that reliably express cogent right-wing viewpoints.\n\nIt probably doesn’t help reader perceptions that conservative columnist George Will has strongly criticized Trump. He still counts as a right-wing voice.\n\nAs Opinion Editor Helen Jung told a reader, “For each section, we aim to publish a range of opinions on a variety of topics, but columns might not line up exactly in balance. For one thing, we can only publish what the columnists deliver. … We do try to include a balance of voices -- both to satisfy our diverse readership and to promote consideration of differing views. Even if the selection of op-eds on one particular day feels off to you, we hope the selection over time does hit the mark.” \n\nI have received several queries from left-leaning readers about whether we will stop publishing anything from the Washington Post.\n\n“With Jeff Bezos running the Washington Post, I beg The Oregonian to remove any articles or editorials from him,” one reader wrote. “It’s disgusting how they are trying to tell us what to think.”\n\nIronically, readers who lean right have been complaining for years about what they see as a left-wing bias in Post news articles, which we have long published in The Oregonian.\n\nWe will continue to check the range of wire service materials available to us, including the Post, and choose the best work for our audience.\n\nChanges to the comics, another place where commentary regularly appears, rekindled readers’ dislikes of certain strips.\n\n“Doonesbury,” which has long published on Sundays, returned to daily publication.

First hosted by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878, the White House Easter Egg Roll has become a tradition that now includes 30,000 eggs.The White House unveiled the full list of the event's partnerships on Friday, revealing what appears to be yet another effort by Big Tech companies to make nice with the Trump administration.Meta will provide an \"AI-Powered Experience and Photo Opportunity,\" while Amazon will provide a reading nook and a \"Family Photo Opportunity Celebrating Reading.\" YouTube, owned by Google, arranged the Bunny Hop Stage.The New York Stock Exchange also agreed to partner and provide a \"Ringing of the Bell Photo Opportunity.\"The White House used event company Harbinger to find corporate sponsors for this year's event, according to CNN. The outlet reported that offers ranged from $75,000 to $200,000 with logo and brand opportunities. While the event has had sponsors in the past, it was previously tightly controlled. The expanded branding opportunities are new territory for the Oval Office.\"I understand that there are corporate sponsors for the Easter Egg Roll,\" Donald Sherman, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CNN. \"What I have not seen before is sort of the outright solicitation and the use of the imprimatur of the White House to give corporate sponsorship.\"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are among the Silicon Valley titans who've worked to gain favor with Trump in recent months. The pair, alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and others, pledged $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee last December.In January, Zuckerberg named longtime Republican Joe Kaplan as Meta's head of policy, replacing former UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Meta also announced several policy changes to how it moderates content, including axing third-party fact-checkers — a move likely meant to appease Trump, who once sued Zuckerberg and threatened him with prison after Facebook banned Trump's account in the wake of the Capitol riots.Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, meanwhile, prevented the newspaper from endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. In February, Bezos also shook up the Post's opinion section, saying it would now focus on defending \"personal liberties and free markets.\"For its part, Google also donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. A spokesperson for YouTube told Business Insider that its participation in the White House Easter Egg Roll \"has become an annual tradition, and we do so in line with the administration's process.\"It's the tech giant's third consecutive year participating in the White House Easter Egg Roll. \"Our goal is to provide an opportunity for kids to meet their favorite creators, and we look forward to having a presence once again this year,\" the statement said.A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. Meta, the New York Stock Exchange, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.The partnerships come as the tech industry navigates Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week said tech companies would be excluded from reciprocal tariffs, but could be subject to additional tariffs in the near future.Ahead of the event, Melania Trump shared an X post thanking White House staff.\"As families across the nation gather to celebrate Easter, I extend my gratitude to the dedicated East Wing Staff for their tireless effort in preparing the upcoming White House Easter Egg Roll,\" she wrote on X. \"This cherished tradition, rooted in history since 1878, brings joy, storytelling, and laughter to America's children.

We're 2,000 miles from the Oval Office, at Bannon's Tuscan villa outside Tucson, an Italianate fountain gurgling away beside him. You might think Donald Trump's former strategist-in-chief is out of the loop these days, relegated to basking in the Arizona sun. But the call is from Alexandra Preate, a Bannon protégé who's now a top advisor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The stock market has just gone into a nosedive, spooked by Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, and Preate wants to consult with Bannon on Bessent's markets-calming remarks to reporters that morning outside the White House.\"He was so brilliant,\" Bannon tells her. \"He has got to do that every day.\"Fresh out of federal prison for his refusal to talk to Congress about his role in the attempt to overturn Joe Biden's election, the man Time magazine once called \"The Great Manipulator\" remains an influential force in Washington. As I saw during my two days with him, Bannon, at age 71, is still crafting MAGA's message at the highest levels. He says he speaks daily with Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, who served as Bannon's cohost of \"War Room,\" the rowdy, MAGA-fueled podcast Bannon helms twice a day, six days a week. Bessent, whom Bannon calls \"my guy,\" and FBI Director Kash Patel are friends, and Sen. Josh Hawley, a right-wing populist, is a frequent guest on the show. Just last week, Bannon was summoned back to what he calls the \"Imperial Capital\" to assist the administration \"on messaging for Flood the Zone\" — Trump World-speak for overwhelming the president's opponents with fresh MAGA initiatives.Prominent Democrats are also paying heed. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028, featured Bannon as the third guest on his new podcast. \"He's a serious thinker,\" says Rep. Ro Khanna, another California Democrat touted as a 2028 contender. \"Bannon got it right on the challenge deindustrialization poses\" to the American economy. Khanna tells me he'd be open to appearing on \"War Room,\" which The Wall Street Journal recently called \"the hottest stop in DC's media circuit.\"Despite his continued influence, Bannon doesn't agree with Trump on every issue. And this time around, there's a major new player separating the two: Trump's former right-hand man is at complete odds with his current right-hand man. Elon Musk, Bannon tells me, is basically the devil incarnate. \"Elon was always evil,\" he says. Don't get him wrong: Bannon supports what Musk is doing with DOGE, which he lauds as \"a shock troop to deconstruct the administrative state.\" But he says there is a \"very deep chasm\" between him and Musk — one based not only in politics, but in spirituality. Musk, as Bannon sees it, is the embodiment of a new form of satanism. By seeking to implant computer chips in people's brains, Musk is attempting to disrupt humanity itself, a grandiose vision that is antithetical to what Bannon, a Catholic, sees as God's will.\"He's a techno-feudalist,\" Bannon tells me with barely concealed venom. \"We are on the side of the human being.\"Musk's dark plot to engineer a race of computer-enhanced superhumans has done nothing to diminish Bannon's enthusiasm for Trump. In fact, Bannon tells me he is undertaking perhaps his most ambitious project yet: ensuring that Trump wins a third term in 2028. Bannon is confident, he tells me, that Trump will carry at least 331 electoral votes next time — a triumph even greater than his victory over Kamala Harris.How, I ask, can that happen within the bounds of the Constitution?He's working on it, Bannon tells me.Bannon's villa is nestled in a quiet neighborhood of ranch houses, saguaros, and mesquite trees overlooking the Santa Catalina mountains. He still spends most of his time in Washington, at a townhouse he owns behind the Supreme Court. But sometimes, he tells me, it's good to escape the unceasing procession of visitors who call on him in the capital. Besides, he can host \"War Room\" just as easily from here, in a small corner room in the villa.Welcoming me to his retreat, Bannon asks why I became a journalist. I suppose journalism suited my skeptical cast of mind, I say.\"You're a dick,\" he says.I'm momentarily speechless. That's a good thing, he assures me. Real journalists are always dicks.A massive coffee table perched in front of Bannon's armchair supports four stacks of newspapers: not just mainstream periodicals like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, but outliers like The Epoch Times, a paper founded by Chinese American adversaries of the Chinese Communist Party. Where Trump professes admiration for Xi Jinping as a strong leader, Bannon, who once lived in Shanghai, views China as America's mortal enemy and dreams of a popular rebellion that will overthrow the communist regime.A collection of books and periodicals sprawls from the table to the base of the fireplace to the kitchen counter. I leaf through \"The Money and the Power,\" a book on the making of Las Vegas, and see Bannon's hand-scrawled circles and underlines strewn across the pages. His omnivorous reading, he tells me, is a key advantage in political strategizing, a calling in which few of his rivals are known for being avid readers. The TV on his wall is set not to CNN, which he views as aimless, or Fox News, which he dismisses as weak neoliberal tea, but to MSNBC, which he treasures as a true-blue voice he can push back against in the \"War Room.\" \"There's my girl,\" he says when MSNBC afternoon host Nicolle Wallace appears on the screen.Some in Washington suspect that Bannon may be weighing a presidential run of his own in 2028. A straw poll of attendees at the recent CPAC conference placed him second among possible Republican nominees, albeit a distant second to JD Vance. But Bannon dismisses the speculation. \"I'm not running for president,\" he tells me. He's all in for Trump to serve a third term. He's cagey on how he plans to make that happen, but he says he's working on it with legal experts he declines to name. One possibility, he says, is a so-called Article V convention, in which delegates could propose amendments to the Constitution requiring ratification by at least 38 states.Bannon believes that another run by Trump — his fourth — would be his biggest victory ever. \"I think he does better in 2028,\" Bannon says. The president, he predicts, would take three states he failed to win in 2024: Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New Mexico, the latter delivered by Trump's rising support from Latino voters.If Trump can't or won't run, I ask, will you support Vance? Bannon pointedly refuses to anoint the vice president as Trump's rightful heir. If the president is not the nominee, Bannon says, he will favor an open primary for the Republican nomination.It's time for War Room. Throughout our conversation, Bannon has been relentlessly affable. But now, as showtime approaches, he barks at Will, his 21-year-old production assistant, over some unresolved camera issue. \"I don't want bullshit,\" he tells Will. \"I don't want spin.\" Will is clearly accustomed to such scoldings and takes it in stride. So, he has a temper, I scrawl in my notebook.To look at Bannon and his happy-hour red nose is to think, drinker. And he was, in earlier chapters of his life in finance. But his \"boozer\" days ended, his younger brother, Chris, tells me, when Steve realized he could be far more productive if he laid off the sauce.Most of today's morning show is wonky and kind of boring: an analysis of whether Democrats will shut down the government, an interview with economics writer Spencer Morrison about his new book, \"Reshore: How Tariffs Will Bring our Jobs Home and Revive the American Dream.\" But Bannon concludes the show with a spectacular detonation: an unscripted, full-throated rant over \"the $350 billion of your money\" — he repeats the number several times — that the United States has spent to help Ukraine combat Russia's invasion. Bannon shows a MSNBC clip of Washington Post columnist David Ignatius defining America's national interest as keeping Ukraine \"European\" and out of Putin's clutches.\"This is insanity!\" Bannon bellows. \"We don't give a damn about whether Ukraine is European!\" Ignatius, he declares, \"is the spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency.\" And the liberal media, as always, is the true enemy. \"There's blood on the hands of MSNBC!\" Bannon thunders.The show over, Bannon immediately becomes subdued again. As we chat on the terrace, I call him out on the $350 billion figure, which Trump also uses. It's a fake number — an exercise in raw demagoguery. On this very day, Trump's own State Department is releasing a statement saying the United States had provided $66.5 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, and about another $20 billion has been disbursed in other aid.Bannon shrugs. Whatever the correct number is, he says, it's a lot.As unprecedented as it is to have someone with a felony conviction serving as president of the United States, it's equally rare to have a leading political strategist who has spent time behind bars on the president's behalf. Bannon was released in October after completing a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress at a low-security prison in Danbury, Connecticut. In February, he pled guilty to defrauding donors who contributed over $20 million to build a border wall, but received no jail time. He's extremely proud to have served time. Sitting in his comfy living room armchair, he takes his hands off his ample belly and points to his black sneakers. \"These are my prison shoes,\" he tells me. \"I wear them every day.\"I ask him what prison was like. \"Yeah, I don't want to talk about it too much,\" he says. \"Too personal.\"Then he proceeds to talk about it. He wasn't sent to a \"camp,\" he stresses, but to a true prison, \"massively overcrowded\" with hardened drug offenders. Standing in line one day to return to his cellblock, he saw a prisoner shanked in the rib cage, his skin ripped open, \"blood everywhere. It turns out he was a rat.\"Bannon's military training, including his time on a cramped Navy destroyer, helped him get through the confines of prison life. No one threatened him, he tells me. \"You've got to be very tough. My attitude was just like my attitude every day. I don't give two fucks. And you're not going to fuck with me. Right?\"It wasn't all grim survival mode. Bannon, a graduate of Georgetown's School of Foreign Service and the Harvard Business School, was asked to teach a class. So the man who tried to stage an insurrection offered a course on the rule of law. \"We went back to the founding documents of the country,\" he says. He had his students read Alexander Hamilton's \"Report on Manufactures\" — dear to Bannon's heart for its appeal to turn the United States into an industrial powerhouse \"independent\" of foreign nations.\"It's interesting,\" he says of his course. \"They had seats for 25. My class always had 50 people in it. It was oversubscribed. These people thirst for this information.\"In prison, he also tried to convince viewers of the \"White TV\"— the Black prisoners controlled a second screen, the Hispanics a third — to watch MSNBC. No dice. They insisted on Fox News.He was released a week before Trump's victory. \"I came out more empowered than ever,\" Bannon says. \"Tougher, more focused,\" he stresses. \"Your dedication has to be to the mission.\"Bannon works virtually around the clock. On the second day of our time together, I join him in the War Room for the cold open at 7 a.m. He fell asleep at 9 p.m. after watching MSNBC, he tells me, and has been up since 1 a.m.\"War Room,\" which often cracks the list of top 10 politics podcasts on Apple, is a platform for conspiracy theorists. The flamboyant election denier Mike Lindell advertises his MyPillow products on the show. On this morning's episode, Mary Holland, an ally of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., attacks the measles vaccine as potentially dangerous to children, even as a measles outbreak in Texas has already killed an unvaccinated 6-year-old. \"Fuck no, not in a zillion years,\" Bannon tells me, when I ask whether he took the COVID vaccine. \"Poison.\" I push back, but he dismisses me as a brainwashed tool of Big Pharma. \"Bobby is doing a great job,\" he says. His other guests today include Jack Posobiec, who spread the lie that Democratic bigwigs were operating a pedophilia ring out of a Washington pizza parlor, and Laura Loomer, who shared a video claiming 9/11 was an \"inside job.\" Spotify banned the show in 2020 and YouTube in 2021.Later, after his afternoon show, Bannon repairs to his armchair. He looks fried, and says as much. I tell him I can't tell when he's serious with his routines and when he's just acting up, to troll the libs. He denies he does anything as a troll. Yes, he assures me, he is serious about having the J6 Choir — a music group composed of insurrectionists turned prisoners — perform at the Kennedy Center. He'd like to have all of the J6 families there, seated in the \"elite boxes,\" and he's hopeful Trump would attend.Then we come back to Musk. In February, the Times reported, Trump ordered Bannon to halt the attacks on Musk and said he wanted the two men to meet privately and work out their differences. I ask Bannon whether Trump is trying to referee between him and Elon. No, he says, Trump has more important things to do. Musk, returning fire, has lashed out at Bannon, calling him \"a great talker, but not a great doer.\"I tell Bannon that I get his dispute with Musk over the H-1B visa program, which Bannon sees as a globalist scam that denies rightful jobs to American workers. But what, in his mind, accounts for Musk's evilness?\"He's a transhumanist,\" Bannon says. \"Elon's piece is tied with actually taking your phone and putting it inside your brain.\"Transhumanism is an intellectual movement that advocates enhancing humans through technology, in order to protect them against existential crises ranging from pandemics to artificial intelligence. Musk has said the ultimate aim of his brain chip company Neuralink — which today focuses on helping quadriplegics control computers with their thoughts — is to merge humans with AI so the species doesn't get \"left behind.\"Bannon believes we are unprepared for a near future when humanity is divided between those who have a brain-enhancing chip and those who don't. \"It is a massive, massive leap for humankind,\" he tells me, \"and we won't be the same people on the other side. We're not ready as a society, we're not ready as a culture.\" He rises from the chair and hands me a book on the coffee table. \"Dark Aeon: Transhumanism and the War Against Humanity.\" It was published by War Room Books, an imprint of Skyhorse, in 2023. The tome, which features a forward from Bannon, accuses the \"cyborg savior Elon Musk\" of being the embodiment of \"satanism with a brain chip.\" Bannon, like Musk, is a disrupter — but he draws the line, apparently, at disrupting God.Afew days after I depart Arizona, Bannon texts me. If I want to understand \"War Room\" and his leadership style, he tells me, I need to watch \"Twelve O'Clock High,\" a 1949 World War II movie starring Gregory Peck as Brig. Gen. Frank Savage. In it, Savage assumes command of a bomber group and whips the demoralized soldiers into men, placing the needs of the mission above the well-being of any individual trooper He goes on hazardous bombing runs himself. But his zeal comes at a cost: By the end of the movie, he suffers a mental breakdown. \"Gen. Savage turns out to be human,\" I say to Bannon. \"Frail.\"\"He did exactly what he had demanded from his men,\" Bannon replies. \"No exemption. It broke him — as he knew it would if you commit to 'maximum' effort.\"I suggest to Bannon that his method is the inverse of Carl von Clausewitz's famous dictum, that war is a continuation of politics by other means. In Bannon's world, politics is the continuation of war by other means.\"Nailed it,\" he responds. And for Bannon, the battles, the shifting alliances, never seem to cease. Where Bessent is \"my guy,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the former chief of Cantor Fitzgerald, is the \"crazy man,\" he tells me. It seems one is either with Bannon or against him.Bannon derives his power, ultimately, from two sources. The first is the following he commands among his \"War Room\" posse, as he calls his followers. But it's possible his legions aren't prepared to follow him into every battle. He wants the United States to go to war, if need be, to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion — a position directly at odds with his overriding imperative to put an end to America's global empire. Yet a recent poll found that barely a third of Republicans would support sending US troops to Taiwan. Bannon may be ready to lead the charge, but he's likely to find himself with few troops at his disposal.The second source of Bannon's power stems from his ability to influence the man he went to prison to protect. As Bannon sees it, he is winning his war for populism. Tariff walls are going up; federal programs are coming down; America First is the slogan of the hour. But plenty remains to be done, and Trump may prove an obstacle to some of his goals. Bannon doesn't just want to kill the H-1B visa program; he aims to impose a moratorium on all legal immigration, a stance Trump has not embraced. The president also appears poised to deepen America's involvement in Ukraine, through a minerals deal that Bannon opposes and a possible acquisition of its power plants. I mention a news report that the Democratic Republic of Congo offered Trump access to minerals of value to Musk and other high-tech barons, in exchange for US military help to put down an internal rebellion. A good idea, I ask Bannon? \"No,\" he says.Yet Bannon insists that Trump is a truly transformational president, on par with Washington and Lincoln. On our second day, after he finishes the morning podcast, Bannon heads to the kitchen, where he brews big cups of espresso and toasts bagels for the two of us. As we eat standing up, he tells me of his first meeting with Trump, back in 2010. At the time, with Barack Obama still in his first term, Trump was mulling a presidential run. Bannon, eager to advance the cause, walked Trump through the history of American populism — only to have the future president offer a correction.The word is \"popularism,\" Trump said.No, Bannon explained, it's populism.But Trump, who liked his own rendition better, would not be moved.Paul Starobin is the author of \"Putin's Exiles: Their Fight for a Better Russia.\"","summary":"I spent two days with Steve Bannon.

In a YouTube video titled Mark Cuban on Trump’s Tariffs, Elon Musk, and Biggest Shark Tank Regrets, posted on April 17, 2025, Mark shed light on the negative and positive impacts of the laws.While expressing his take on the border policies surrounding the further militarization of the US-Mexico border, Mark said:\"There's a lot of ways to scare people. Just walking up to somebody with a mask on, that's not... That's not the way to do it.\"The Shark Tank investor added that he would appreciate Trump's border work if it meant deporting \"criminals.\" He believed that it was conceptually a \"good\" idea for the betterment of the United States. However, Mark criticized when, under the guise of the law, the authorities simply went up to people on \"the streets\" to remove them.Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban shares insight on Trump's policies that stand outAfter retaking the White House, the President of the United States of America vowed to stage the \"largest deportation operation in American history,\" while referring to the individuals crossing the US-Mexico border to seek asylum in the country. The President planned to target such people by conducting raids and deportations in undocumented communities. The policy and its effects spread fear among the legal as well as the illegal immigrants living in the United States. As the administration continued to expand on its deportation mission, images of masked federal agents detaining people emerged in the latest week. It not only instilled a sense of anxiety within the citizens but also brought the methods of Trump's administration into question.It also invited scrutiny as critics wondered if the people wearing the masks were trying to hide their identities. View this post on Instagram Instagram PostShark Tank panelist Mark Cuban, while speaking about the government's work, criticized the emergence of masked agents detaining international students on campus or near their homes. Although he appreciated the concept behind introducing strict measures, he was not in favor of having masked agents dislocate random people from their residences. Mark opined that it was not the right way to instill fear among those involved in unlawful activities, adding that it was one of Trump's policies that stood out the most for him.When the interviewer asked the Shark Tank investor if he could name policies under the Trump administration that he appreciated, he confessed that he liked the work on the border. He added that although he had campaigned for Kamala Harris, he wanted someone to \"fix the border.\" However, while he liked the concept, he found flaws in its execution. View this post on Instagram Instagram PostOn the contrary, the Shark Tank expert also commended the policy to sell American citizenships for $5 million. He believed it was \"easy money,\" especially for corporations, and could emerge as a \"great alternative\" for H1B visas.Hearing that, the interviewer asked Mark if he would go back and change his vote, since he appreciated some of the changes introduced by Trump. Mark replied by saying that although he was \"not a fan of Donald Trump,\" he helped his government with healthcare and other things and would continue to do so because he wanted to do \"what's best for the country.\"Mark then explained his vote by saying that while there was no \"perfect candidate,\" Kamala's \"pluses and minuses were stronger than Donald Trump's.\" Soon after, the interviewer asked the investor if he would ever run for office. Mark immediately rejected the idea, saying there was \"no chance.\"\"I wanna lay in bed and read my emails,\" he added.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nMcCarthy, who served as speaker for nine months in 2023 before being voted out, made an appearance on Jesse Watters Primetime where he attempted to analyze the state of the Democratic Party and its leadership, as well as its future prospects.\n\nInitially asked about DNC vice chair David Hogg’s group Leaders We Deserve and its $20 million campaign to primary House Democrats in safe seats in order to facilitate the entry of younger people into politics, McCarthy said the move was “unheard of” and an example of the “civil war” currently taking place inside the Democratic Party.\n\nHe drew comparisons with Ocasio-Cortez, telling Watters, “Remember, AOC did this exact same thing a couple years ago and the party tried to shut her down when she would primary other members in Congress.” He continued, “But she raised the most money of any member in Congress in the last quarter. She’s getting the biggest crowds.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez had her biggest three-month fundraising period ever this year, raising almost $9.6 million in the first quarter. She has been campaigning with Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as part of their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour that has seen them visit six states across the western U.S. since late March.\n\nMcCarthy continued, sharing his prediction for the future of the Democratic Party: “They’re going to fight to see who becomes leader of this party. Right now, it’s really AOC, and Bernie Sanders... They’re going to run against Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Schumer and Hakeem. That will be a motivating factor.” \n\nHe continued, “They will raise more money running against Democrats than they will running against Republicans, and whoever comes out of that will become the leader of the Democratic Party.”\n\nMcCarthy’s comments may have been made partly in jest, but they echo sentiments political analyst and pollster Nate Silver made earlier this week when he predicted in his newsletter that Ocasio-Cortez is currently the candidate most likely to top the 2028 Democratic presidential ticket. Podcaster Galen Druke argued that Ocasio-Cortez “has broad appeal across the Democratic Party,” and pointed to a recent Yale University poll that found she had incredibly high favorability ratings amongst Democrats, which Silver agreed with, though he noted that Ocasio-Cortez isn’t “sure to run.”\n\nWhile many hopeful young progressives see Ocasio-Cortez as an example of how the Democratic Party can move left, McCarthy sees her rise as a portent of doom: the doom in question being socialism.

McFadden of the federal District Court in DC, disagreed. \n\nHe said Friday that he needed more time to study the issue but that the White House seemed to be acting in “good faith,” presumably because the new policy follows his order about the AP and its peers.\n\nIndeed, as the White House put it, “No other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP. The AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.”\n\nBeyond exposing the AP’s sense of entitlement, the case opens the door to the administration’s plan to break up the stranglehold legacy media have on privileged access to the White House as well as to other federal agencies, such as the departments of State and Defense.\n\nGatekeeper mentality\n\nTheir gatekeeper mentality has become an acute problem in Trump’s two terms because so many of the legacy outlets are openly hostile to him and the Republican Party.\n\nThere are next to zero “straight” reports, with nearly every story every day distorted by personal animus toward the president and conservative ideas.\n\nThe approach is the opposite of how those same organizations covered the Biden presidency. \n\nTheir lockstep behavior in those years featured soft-ball, friendly coverage even as the public turned thumbs down on inflation and open borders, adding to the evidence that big media is out of step with most Americans.\n\nThe resulting decline in public trust in the media is warranted, with nearly all of those organizations ignoring the Hunter Biden laptop scandal.\n\nAnd despite supposedly being guardians of free speech, none opposed the censorship schemes orchestrated by the White House to protect the first family from reports in The Post and elsewhere of corruption.\n\nMoreover, none of the legacy outlets showed any curiosity about Joe Biden’s obvious mental and physical decline. \n\nIndeed, some like The New York Times, repeated the White House lie that claims of the president’s decline involved altered videos and right-wing talking points.\n\nIt was only after Biden’s disastrous debate performance last June, and the panic that Trump would win the election, that the media noticed his condition and declared, in unison, that he had to drop out of the race.\n\nAs soon as he did, they all jumped on the Kamala Harris bandwagon and unanimously declared her campaign full of “joy.”\n\nSo they can spare us now their claims that they are essential to good government and public knowledge. Too often, they have shielded corruption and misled the public.\n\nThis control of like-minded outlets creates a near-monopoly of coverage, one that involves the White House Correspondents Association.\n\nIt is a private group that has for decades set up the pool for small-space events and also assigns the 49 seats in the separate briefing room, all of which are held by legacy media.\n\nUpset media apple cart\n\nThey, along with the Times and others, are furious that Leavitt has upset their apple cart by scrambling the pool and opening the briefing room to newcomers. \n\nOften as many as 20 people with new credentials can be seen standing along the sides of the room, with some getting a chance to ask a question.\n\nAnd now reports say she is considering going even further by changing the assigned seats.\n\nOh, no, the Sky is Falling, screams the correspondents’ association. \n\nActing like a thuggish union losing its grip on power, it is warning Leavitt against making changes to the seating chart.\n\nIn a statement, it said the White House “should abandon this wrong-headed effort and show the American people they’re not afraid to explain their policies and field questions from an independent media free from government control.”\n\nTherein lies the conceit — that only media hostile to Trump are “independent.”\n\nThis is the attitude the AP took with grossly inflated claims that its demotion “centers on the government blocking AP’s access to cover events,” as if the agency had been banned from the White House.\n\nFact check: False!\n\nIn truth, Trump is the most accessible president in modern times, and probably takes more questions in a month than Biden took in four years.\n\nTo even suggest otherwise is fake news, which unfortunately describes what the AP and its fellow travelers are peddling these days.","summary":"The AP has become just another outlet peddling leftist opinion disguised as straight news.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/opinion/michael-goodwin-left-leaning-ap-is-out-of-step-with-the-rest-of-the-us/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-s1v5otnez-1745109658423.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1745095390&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 01:17:45","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":312853092,"title":"Fuming Democrats tell Biden’s handlers to keep ex-prez out of spotlight","text":"Democratic figures and even the former first family’s aides are saying that former President Biden needs to stay out of politics, according to a new report from “The Hill.”\n\nThe outlet’s senior political correspondent, Amie Parnes, spoke to former first lady Jill Biden’s communications director Michael LaRosa, who stated that Biden’s staff needs to steer him away from the spotlight because the party is not interested in seeing him.\n\n“If they had advisers who had their hand on the pulse of the Democratic Party or national politics, they would have understood the intense level of anger or indifference to them that remains inside our party and isn’t going away anytime soon,” the former Biden staffer said.\n\nParnes spoke to LaRosa following Biden’s speech at a disability advocacy conference in Chicago earlier this week. \n\nThe speech, which the ex-president gave on the state of the Social Security Administration, was Biden’s first major address since leaving the White House in January.\n\nDuring the speech, Biden ripped the Trump administration, saying, “fewer than 100 days, this new administration has made so much damage… and so much destruction. It’s kind of breathtaking.”\n\nAccording to LaRosa, Biden’s return was not a welcome moment within the party and that his handlers should recognize that.\n\n“I love both Bidens dearly, but staff loyalty means there is a responsibility to provide them with an honest situational awareness, especially when it comes to their public image, no matter how hurtful it is to hear,” he said.\n\nThe former Jill Biden staffer continued, noting the party feels that the only people benefitting from Biden’s return is the Trump administration and conservatives, who have been able to use the unpopular ex-president’s appearance as a distraction.\n\nIt was a “lovely gift for the White House, President Trump and conservative media at a time when they were playing defense and under the kind of heavy scrutiny over the botched tariff policy in ways we haven’t seen since Trump was elected,” LaRosa told Parnes.\n\nWeeks before leaving office, CNN polling revealed only 36 percent of Americans approved of Biden’s job as president, with 64 percent disapproving. \n\nThe CNN poll also showed that 61 percent of respondents saw Biden’s presidency as a failure overall. \n\nParnes co-authored “Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” a recently-published book that has delved into the Democratic Party’s chaotic 2024 campaign featuring major scoops from people close to Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama on how these figures navigated Biden’s withdrawal from the race and his subsequent replacement by Harris.\n\nIn one excerpt from the book, Parnes and co-author Jonathan Allen, an NBC reporter, wrote about how Biden may have sabotaged her campaign by controlling her policy points. \n\n“Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him — especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans. To the extent that she wanted to forge her own path, Biden had no interest in giving her room to do so,” they wrote, adding that Biden met with Harris to ensure she knew to protect him.\n\nIt has been widely speculated that Harris not deviating enough from Biden’s policy damaged her own chances.\n\nIn his comments to Parnes, LaRosa lamented this sad end to Biden’s political career, stating again that both the Bidens and their handlers should recognize the moment and act accordingly.\n\n“It’s a heartbreaking and tragic ending to their time in public life, but it’s also the truth, and they should index the political realities into their decisionmaking.”","summary":"Democratic figures and even the former first family’s aides are saying that former President Biden needs to stay out of politics.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/former-biden-official-warns-him-to-avoid-spotlight-says-party-is-mad/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/102982314.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CitAl28D-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:09:32","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.493},{"id":312978092,"title":"From Oakland County to Downriver, protesters rally against Trump, Musk and deportations - Detroit Free Press","text":"Protesters across metro Detroit — including Troy, Detroit and Trenton — gathered for rallies against the Trump administration.Protesters cited an array of concerns, ranging from economic instability to concerns over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.Across the three cities, thousands of people showed up to make their voices heard.\n\nProtesters across metro Detroit spent another Saturday rallying and protesting against the Trump administration.\n\nA handful of protest movements, ranging from Oakland County to Detroit, and farther south into Trenton, took place April 19 as a follow-up to the nationwide “Hands Off! Day of Action\" protests on April 5, which saw thousands of Michiganders rally against President Donald Trump, his administration and tech billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nThousands turned out, but the shouts of the crowds across Michigan stood in contrast to how the state voted in 2024. President Donald Trump won the state by a bit over 80,000 votes, earning 49.7% of the vote to then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ 48.3%.\n\nProtesters take to the streets in Detroit\n\nUnder the watchful eye of Detroit police, approximately 2,500 people marched through the streets of downtown Detroit, protesting the Trump administration.\n\nThe protesters began at Hart Plaza and marched through downtown Detroit along Lafayette Boulevard and Michigan Avenue before returning to the plaza.\n\nThe event attracted people who feel Trump's policies are treading into illegal territory.\n\nMitch Mantey, a 30-year-old attorney from Detroit, said he sees Trump's deportation efforts as illegal.\n\n\"Sending people out of the country without due process — you know, I'm an attorney, — and that is just, you know, fundamentally not permitted by the Constitution,\" Mantey said, referencing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported. \"And there's a reason for that, right? Because if they can do it to anybody — and they can do it to anybody — that includes you, that includes me.\"\n\nSarah Sewick, 44, of Farmington Hills, said she has been trying to go to every protest she can recently.\n\n\"It just seems like a really vital time to make our voices heard,\" Sewick said, echoing Mantey's concern over the legality of Trump's policies. \"I feel like, you know, our president is not obeying the law of the land, and I feel like that's really dangerous.\"\n\n'No Kings' in Troy\n\nTo an endless din of honking cars, more than 2,000 protesters crowded the sidewalks on Big Beaver Road in Troy for the \"No Kings Rally,\" organized by the Troy Democratic Club.\n\nJustine Galbraith, the vice chair of the Troy Democratic Club, said the turnout at the rally in Troy reflects fear and disdain for the first three months of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I think everyone's really disturbed about what we're seeing coming out of Washington,\" Galbraith said.\n\nWhile Galbraith doesn't anticipate the Trump team to immediately change course in the face of protests, she said her goal is to build community and encourage people to make their voice heard.\n\n\"I think hope keeps it going. I think community keeps it going,\" Galbraith said.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Harris carried Troy, winning about 54% of the vote to Trump's 42%, on par with the broader vote in Oakland County, which has voted reliably for Democratic officials and presidential candidates in recent years.\n\nTo Joey Bernert, a 35-year-old social worker, the growing protest movement reminds him of the Occupy Wall Street movement he experienced after he graduated from high school.\n\n\"It's surreal for me, because I've never been in a protest this big since Occupy,\" Bernert said, gesturing toward the crowd of protesters around him.\n\nBernert worries about the impact Trump's policies have on his community and clients. But most of all, Trump's contentious policies — sweeping job cuts, rollbacks on federal programs and aggressive tariffs — leave him confounded.\n\n\"I can't rationalize it,\" he said. \"Because to me, it doesn't make any sense what he is doing.\"\n\n'Good Trouble' in Trenton\n\nSome passing motorists honked and pumped their fists while others raised middle fingers and gave thumbs down on April 19 as hundreds gathered in Trenton for a “Good Trouble March” that condemned the Trump administration. \n\nTrump carried Trenton in 2024, winning about 55% of the votes cast in the presidential election. While Democrats dominate Wayne County, Trenton and other Downriver cities make the county's purple southeast corner home to some of the most competitive state legislative races.\n\nAt least one home along the protesters’ path had Trump signs staring.\n\nBorrowing the name \"Good Trouble\" from the words of the late activist and U.S. Congressman John Lewis, the rally featured a food pantry collection for a local church and brought politicians U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.\n\nAttendees Leslie Olmstead, 68, and Ed Bondy, 70, of Rockwood, said they think the president is moving too fast with his policies. \n\nBoth said there’s some waste within the government, referring to Trump administration efforts to cut jobs seen as inefficient, but as Bondy put it, personnel is still needed. \n\nBoth also had major concerns with Trump’s tariffs and the fluctuating stock market; Olmstead expressed concern over Trump's tariff policies, while Bondy, who worked for decades in the steel and auto industry, said his 401(k) has been collapsing. \n\n“I can’t afford to lose $20,000 every two weeks,” he said. “It took me 40 years to get what I got in my 401(k).”\n\nIn perhaps one of its loudest rallying moments, the crowd repeated in unison phrases offered up by protest organizer Celina Peters of Rise Up Downriver. \n\nThe words: No to lies, authoritarianism, homophobia, transphobia, racism and genocide. \n\nThe loudest of them all: “No to Trump.”\n\nStaff writer Clara Hendrickson, staff photographer Eric Seals and editor Emily Lawler contributed to this report.","summary":"From Oakland County to Downriver, protesters rally against Trump, Musk and deportations  Detroit Free Press","url":"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/04/19/metro-detroit-protesters-rally-against-trump-administration/83142535007/","image":"https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTF/83176433007-trump-protest-041925-es-07.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y146&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 23:23:23","author":"Darcie Moran,Liam Rappleye","authors":["Darcie Moran","Liam Rappleye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":312833714,"title":"Shocking poll reveals the 2028 Democratic hopeful who is the LEAST liked candidate among young voters","text":"Shocking poll reveals the 2028 Democratic hopeful who is the LEAST liked candidate among young voters\n\nREAD MORE: Polling guru reveals most likely Democrat to take on Trump in 2028\n\nBy SAMANTHA RUTT FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 21:41 BST, 19 April 2025 | Updated: 22:36 BST, 19 April 2025\n\nA recent Yale University Youth Poll has identified Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman as the least favored potential 2028 Democratic candidate among young voters.\n\nThe Spring 2025 Yale Youth Poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 self-identified registered voters aged 18 to 29, found that Fetterman registered a dismal -17.2 net favorability among young voters.\n\nThe blatant disliking of the Pennsylvania senator stood out as a stark contrast to the +60 net favorability enjoyed by other Democratic figures like former Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes.\n\nThe surprisingly low ranking places Fetterman in the same unfavorable category as ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith, who garnered a negative net favorability of -16.9 among Democrats.\n\nBoth men were the only two figures tested with negative net favorability ratings among Democrats, according to the poll.\n\nThe survey's shocking findings, however, may come as a surprise to Fetterman, who has been considered a potential frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic nomination.\n\nHis poor favorability among young voters - a demographic that has increasingly become a cornerstone of the Democratic base - now raises questions regarding the embattled Senator's actual viability as a candidate in the upcoming election cycle.\n\nThe Spring 2025 Yale Youth Poll, which surveyed over 2,000 self-identified registered voters aged 18 to 29, found that Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman (pictured) registered a dismal -17.2 net favorability among young voters\n\nThe blatant disliking of the Pennsylvania senator stood out as a stark contrast to the +60 net favorability enjoyed by other Democratic figures like former Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes\n\nPolitical analysts suggest Fetterman's struggles with young voters may stem from several factors, including his centrist positions and past collaborations with Republicans.\n\nSuch stances may not resonate with the more progressive leanings of the younger electorate, who have demonstrated a preference for candidates with more liberal stances on issues like immigration and social justice.\n\n'It seems like [Fetterman] really does not want to open his mind at all,' Kinnan Abdalhamid, a Palestinian-American student at Haverford College on Philadelphia's mainline told Teen Vogue in June 2024.\n\n'I was very bewildered and aggravated [by his stance],' another student by the name of Mitch, disclosed to the teen-centric publication last year.\n\nMitch, who asked to withhold their last name to protect their privacy, also said: 'He ran this whole stance on being progressive.\n\n'Now it's just really shocking to see how he's completely turned on a dime to betray all of the people who voted for him. I definitely feel like he has betrayed the trust of his constituents.'\n\nThe Yale Youth Poll also highlighted the rising influence of alternative figures within the Democratic party like the Former United States Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg.\n\nMeanwhile, Smith's unexpected appearance in the 2028 presidential polls has since sparked discussions about the party's 'bench strength' and its appeal to younger voters.\n\nSmith himself - a longtime sports television personality - has expressed skepticism about his inclusion in the polls, suggesting that his presence suggests a 'lack of compelling options' in the ailing party.\n\n'They talk and they talk and they talk. But what can they do? They position themselves to do absolutely nothing,' Smith said during an interview with ABC News on Sunday.\n\nThe surprisingly low ranking places Fetterman in the same unfavorable category as ESPN commentator Stephen A.

It doesn't have a vision,' he concluded.\n\nHowever, the telling poll also showed a slight favoritism toward the struggling Democratic party with a +6.4 net favorability among voters aged 22 to 29.\n\nBut, among voters ages 18 to 21, the generic ballot came in at +11.7 net favorable lean in favor of the Republican party.\n\nThe survey also found that if the 2028 Republican primary were held now, 50 percent of Republican voters under the age of 30 would support Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThe Yale Youth Poll was conducted entirely online between April 1 to April 3, pulling from a sample of 4,100 registered voters, of which 2,025 were under the age of 30.\n\nThe survey reported a margin of error of +/- 1.9 percentage points for the full sample of 4,100 respondents and +/- 1.8 percentage points for those under 30.\n\nAnother poll conducted by polling guru Nate Silver earlier this month revealed the most likely Democrat to challenge President Donald Trump's 'MAGA dynasty' as New York Rep. Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nSilver made the bold claim in a video for his Silver Bulletin Substack on Wednesday alongside journalist Galen Druke, who actually brought up AOC as a viable contender first.\n\n'That was going to be my f***ing pick!' Silver exclaimed. 'We both are on the AOC bus.'\n\nPolitical analysts suggest Fetterman's (pictured) struggles with young voters may stem from a myriad of factors, including his centrist positions and past collaborations with Republicans.\n\nPolling guru Nate Silver (left) and journalist Galen Druke (right) both picked Rep.

'In a Yale poll just out late week, AOC has the highest net favorability rating of any of the Democrats that they asked about.'\n\nOcasio-Cortez had a 62 percent positive rating among Democrats in the survey, with former Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, trailing her slightly.\n\nHowever, an earlier poll, conducted back in March, showed the failed presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, as the likely 2028 frontrunner.\n\nIn a political twist few would have predicted in the aftermath of 2024, Harris - was for a short time - leading the early 2028 Democratic primary field by a staggering 26-point margin, according to the Morning Consult poll.\n\nThe Morning Cosult poll also noted the Former United States Secretary of Transportation as the likely second.\n\nPennsylvaniaDemocratsSteve SmithNew York\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nShocking poll reveals the 2028 Democratic hopeful who is the LEAST liked candidate among young voters\n\nAdd comment","summary":"A shocking poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 registered voters aged 18 to 29, found that one aspiring Presidential candidate registered a dismal net favoribility among young voters.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14628335/worst-2028-democratic-candidate-young-voters-poll.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/21/97470787-0-image-a-93_1745095024026.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 21:36:02","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":312833718,"title":"Jill Biden aide's brutally honest advice to the former president and first lady","text":"Jill Biden's former aide dished out some brutal honesty to his former boss and her husband as he encouraged them to stick to retirement and leave politics behind. \n\nMichael LaRosa, who worked as Jill's press secretary from 2021 to 2022, believes the Biden camp's team is pulling all the wrong moves since Biden left office on January 20. \n\n'I love both Bidens dearly, but staff loyalty means there is a responsibility to provide them with an honest situational awareness, especially when it comes to their public image, no matter how hurtful it is to hear,' LaRosa told The Hill. \n\n'Biden’s reemergence, while it changed very little in the news cycle, provided a detour for the president to distract his cadre of supporters with Biden taunts and blame, giving Fox News nearly 48 hours of fresh new programming, taking editorial aim at the former president instead of the current one.' \n\nThe former aide accused the Bidens' advisors of not having their 'hand on the pulse of the Democratic Party or national politics' with their timing of the former president's reemergence. \n\n'They would have understood the intense level of anger or indifference to them that remains inside our party and isn’t going away anytime soon,' he told The Hill of what a competent advisor would have noticed. \n\n'It’s a heartbreaking and tragic ending to their time in public life, but it’s also the truth, and they should index the political realities into their decision-making.' \n\nJoe stepped back into the public spotlight on Tuesday for his first post-presidential address to criticize President Donald Trump's dismantling of Social Security.\n\n'Who in the hell do they think they are?'

Under his leadership, the club has moved far to the right. It’s hosted events attended by white nationalists, budding foreign authoritarians, and of course, George Santos, whose congressional campaign it endorsed before he became a convicted felon.\n\nWax announced this month that he was stepping down as the club’s president, and on Friday he revealed that he would be taking a post in the Trump administration as chief of staff and advisor to Federal Communications Commissioner Nathan Simington. The 31-year-old former day trader has long been a die-hard Trump loyalist.\n\n“Once President Trump is back in office,” Wax said at the 2023 NYYRC annual dinner, according to Politico, “we won’t be playing nice anymore. It will be a time for retribution. All those responsible for destroying our once-great country will be held to account after baseless years of investigations and government lies and media lies against this man.”\n\nLike Trump, Wax was once a staunch opponent of media censorship and “Big Tech,” and had called for an end to legal protections for social media companies. An online libertarian magazine Wax founded, Liberty Conservative, once devoted quite a bit of ink to trolling Trump’s new benefactor, Elon Musk. (“Elon Musk: The Corporate Arm Of The Deep-State,” was one such 2017 article.)\n\nMuch of that rhetoric seems to have vanished since Musk bought Twitter and most of the tech world has gotten on board in support of Trump. Now, Wax’s focus at the FCC, like Trump’s, appears to be mainstream media outlets. In an email, he told me, “The issues of censorship, content moderation, and platform accountability remain important—not just in the context of individual CEOs, but as broader questions of public policy and civil liberties. We’re also focused on ensuring that licensed broadcasters are truly serving the public interest, as required by law. That includes holding legacy media to account just as much as newer tech platforms, and ensuring that all players in the communications space operate on a level playing field.”\n\nIn 2023, Mother Jones identified Wax as one of a number of MAGA influencers who’d been defending the exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui with op-eds suggested by Guo’s supporters. Guo was convicted of racketeering and fraud last year. Wax had once been the marketing director for Gettr, a social media site allegedly controlled by Guo. But Wax told me that an important part of the FCC’s work now is “defending against foreign influence in our information ecosystem.”\n\nWax’s ascension to the FCC was met with cheers in MAGA world from everyone from Steve Bannon to Kari Lake. \n\nThank you Kari! https://t.co/JXWES8zUR6— Gavin Mario Wax 🇺🇸 🗽 (@GavinWax) April 19, 2025\n\nHe seems a natural fit for the FCC under its Trump-aligned chairman Brendan Carr. Carr has touted his own MAGA credentials and has taken up Trump’s call for the agency to investigate NPR and PBS over their sponsorship practices, and ABC and NBC over DEI efforts. The FCC also recently reinstated a complaint against CBS over an interview with Kamala Harris during the presidential campaign that Trump has alleged was deceptively edited to influence the election. Trump is suing the network for $20 billion over the interview. Trump’s FCC also revived complaints against NBC for allowing Harris to appear on Saturday Night Live during the campaign.\n\nLast month, several congressional Democrats launched a probe of what they called the FCC’s “sham” investigations designed “to target and intimidate news organizations” that were unpopular with Trump and Musk.\n\nEven at this FCC, however, Wax is likely to be a controversial hire. His ties to the more extreme fringes of the far-right are unusual credentials for a government job, though less so in this administration. For instance, in 2018, Wax penned a column in the American Thinker headlined, “We are all Proud Boys now,” in which he decried “Antifa” and “leftist terrorist” attacks on conservatives like himself.\n\n“Out-of-context quotes from Gavin McInnes are being used to paint him as a right-wing militant leader when he in all actuality he just runs a patriotic fraternal group who like America and beer,” he wrote, defending the founder of the far-right militia group whose members later helped orchestrate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.","summary":"For the past six years, Gavin Wax has held court as the president of the New York Young Republican Club, a group he helped turn from a small, stodgy establishment outfit into “a vanguard of the Trump movement,&#8221; as he said last year.

KAMALA HARRIS WAS ‘VERY ANNOYED’ WITH OBAMA AS SHE SOUGHT HIS ENDORSEMENT, BOOK REVEALS Parnes spoke to LaRosa following Biden’s speech at a disability advocacy conference in Chicago earlier this week. The speech, which the ex-president gave on the state of the Social Security Administration, was Biden’s first major address since leaving the White House in January. During the speech, Biden ripped the Trump administration, saying, \"fewer than 100 days, this new administration has made so much damage… and so much destruction. It’s kind of breathtaking.\" According to LaRosa, Biden’s return was not a welcome moment within the party and that his handlers should recognize that. \"I love both Bidens dearly, but staff loyalty means there is a responsibility to provide them with an honest situational awareness, especially when it comes to their public image, no matter how hurtful it is to hear,\" he said. The former Jill Biden staffer continued, noting the party feels that the only people benefitting from Biden’s return is the Trump administration and conservatives, who have been able to use the unpopular ex-president’s appearance as a distraction. BIDEN RETURNS TO PODIUM FOR FIRST TIME TO SLAM TRUMP'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLANS: 'WRECK IT SO THEY COULD ROB IT' It was a \"lovely gift for the White House, President Trump and conservative media at a time when they were playing defense and under the kind of heavy scrutiny over the botched tariff policy in ways we haven’t seen since Trump was elected,\" LaRosa told Parnes. Weeks before leaving office, CNN polling revealed only 36 percent of Americans approved of Biden’s job as president, with 64 percent disapproving. The CNN poll also showed that 61 percent of respondents saw Biden’s presidency as a failure overall. Parnes co-authored \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" a recently-published book that has delved into the Democratic Party’s chaotic 2024 campaign featuring major scoops from people close to Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama on how these figures navigated Biden’s withdrawal from the race and his subsequent replacement by Harris. In one excerpt from the book, Parnes and co-author Jonathan Allen, an NBC reporter, wrote about how Biden may have sabotaged her campaign by controlling her policy points. \"Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him — especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans. To the extent that she wanted to forge her own path, Biden had no interest in giving her room to do so,\" they wrote, adding that Biden met with Harris to ensure she knew to protect him. It has been widely speculated that Harris not deviating enough from Biden’s policy damaged her own chances. In his comments to Parnes, LaRosa lamented this sad end to Biden’s political career, stating again that both the Bidens and their handlers should recognize the moment and act accordingly. \"It’s a heartbreaking and tragic ending to their time in public life, but it’s also the truth, and they should index the political realities into their decisionmaking.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Former communications director for Jill Biden, Michael LaRosa, told The Hill recently that the Democratic Party does not want former President Biden in the spotlight any longer.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-biden-official-warns-ex-president-stay-away-from-spotlight-says-democratic-party-angry-him","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/931/523/Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 19:30:59","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.57},{"id":312877294,"title":"Did Tim Walz's Daughter Hope Compare Kilmar Abrego Garcia To Jesus?

Progressives have been tempted to console themselves with congenial fantasies or to sink into despair and blame the voters for their ignorance and vulgarity. Conservatives have been inclined to believe that the scales have fallen from the people’s eyes, that the right’s electoral dominance is secure, and that voters have given them a mandate to disrupt, shatter, and overturn – dramatically illustrated by President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to justify a raft of hard-hitting tariffs.\n\nThoughtful figures in both camps recognize that ordinary citizens’ discontents with elite performance contributed decisively to the improbable return of the nation’s 45th president to the White House as America’s 47th president. It is far from sinking in on either side, however, that the future of freedom in America hinges on reconciling the nation’s tradition of individual liberty, equality under law, and limited constitutional government with the powerful populist and nationalist turn in American politics.\n\nAmong Democrats, Minnesota governor and former Kamala Harris running mate Tim Walz exemplifies the self-deception crowd. At a late-March townhall meeting in Texas, Walz lamented those occasions “when we see people back off and we see corporations back off to the threats, instead of leaning into” diversity, equity, and inclusion. For Walz, embracing DEI is a political must “because it’s not only morally the right thing to do, it’s economically the right thing to do.” Contrary to Walz, however, government classification of citizens based on race and ethnicity violates America’s founding principles, and the 2024 elections results indicate that clinging to DEI would further erode Democrats’ electoral prospects.\n\nIn contrast, a day or two later, the New York Times editorial board published a sober reflection about where Democrats went wrong and how to right the ship. In “The Democrats Are in Denial About 2024,” the Times editorialists recognize that while Trump’s victory did not confer the mandate he claims, Democrats suffered last November a “comprehensive defeat.” They “lost control of the Senate and failed to recapture the House of Representatives,” writes the editorial board. “Of the 11 governor’s races held last year, Democrats won three. In state legislature races, they won fewer than 45 percent of the seats.”\n\nThe Times editorialists reject the soothing tales that Democrats have been telling themselves. The party was not unlucky in 2024, and the problem was not an ineffective messenger delivering a winning message. Yes, post-pandemic inflation hurt Democrats as the incumbent party but, as the Times does not say, the Biden administration’s enormous spending as the pandemic receded aggravated matters. Furthermore, the Times acknowledges, incumbent parties “in Denmark, France, India, Japan, Mexico and Spain” won reelection. And, the Times stresses, low voter turnout did not harm the party last November because those who stayed home favored Trump.\n\nWhat then, according to the Times, was the problem? Party leaders’ lying about Biden’s declining mental acuity eroded voter trust. The transparent fibbing reinforced voters’ suspicions that Democrats “refuse to admit uncomfortable truths” on matters of prime importance such as “crime, illegal immigration, inflation and Covid lockdowns.” In addition, “the party moved too far left on social issues after Barack Obama left office in 2017,” and it “remains too focused on personal identity and on Americans’ differences – by race, gender, sexuality and religion – rather than our shared values.” While understating matters in asserting that “progressives sometimes adopt a scolding, censorious posture,” the Times editorialists recognize that identity politics “has alienated growing numbers of Asian, Black and Latino voters.”\n\nTo broaden the party’s appeal, the editorial board urges Democrats to generate “new ideas” for “improving life for all Americans” and to search for political leaders who “deftly mix boldness and moderation.” This, though, does not capture the depth and breadth of the divide that has opened in American politics.\n\nProgressives would do well to consult Henry Olsen’s recent analysis, as would conservatives. An Ethics and Public Policy Center senior fellow and host of the weekly podcast “Beyond the Polls,” Olsen is an uncommonly astute observer of American politics. In “Germany and the Future of National Populism” he turns his attention to large social and political forces that are transforming rights-protecting democracies on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n“In Germany and elsewhere in the world, populist parties and figures continue to increase in size at the expense of the old parties, left and right,” writes Olsen. The reason is simple: “Populists of all stripes are gaining because the old elites are failing.” Following the Allies’ victory in World War II, elites in American and Europe “rose to power by delivering peace, social solidarity, and prosperity.” In recent decades, however, they have frittered away their credibility by failing to secure these crucial political goods.\n\nIn Germany, France, and Italy – with Hungary and Poland ahead of the curve – the trend lines suggest “that in a decade, perhaps two, most of the West will be governed by a conservative-populist coalition not unlike what Donald Trump has created in America.” One could add to the list Israel: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hollowed out the old Likud, with its staunch commitment to individual rights and equality under law, in favor of a coalition of the ultra-Orthodox, religious ultranationalists, and traditionalists united by a resentment of Israel’s own post-World War II elites.\n\nWhile the European left is losing more ground, the continent’s traditional center-right parties are seeing substantial numbers of their voters switch allegiance to the national populists. The center-right has sought to keep at bay the rising nationalist-populist challenge by cobbling together centrist coalitions. These coalitions, however, are proving too heterogeneous and fragile to handle the discontents that have driven voters to far-left parties as well as to the national populists. Olsen suspects that as immigration further strains European politics, the center-right will increasingly – and with an increasingly clean conscience – join the national populists.\n\n“Those coalitions will likely take Europe in a much different direction than it has been traveling for decades,” argues Olson. Instead of pursuing multicultural and social democracy priorities, the new national-populist-led governments will crack down on illegal immigration and raise the bar for legal immigration. They will vigorously oppose the woke-progressive sensibility and stand up for the West. They will combine free-market elements and a social-welfare state favoring lower taxes for the working class but not for the wealthy and for corporations. They will adopt a host of family-friendly measures. And they will exhibit ambivalence toward NATO and express skepticism concerning a common European defense policy but will demonstrate a greater readiness to rearm to defend their traditional ways of life.\n\nEuropean national-populist-led governments, in other words, will look a lot like the merging of national populism and the center-right presided over by President Trump in the United States, and pursued by Nigel Farage in Britain and Pierre Poilievre in Canada. This consolidation of traditional-right and national-populist factions across the West’s rights-protecting democracies, maintains Olsen, marks not “a populist moment” but the dawn of “a populist age.”\n\nIn the new populist age, progressives face a harsh political landscape. If they move left, they likely turn their back on the voter anxieties and dissatisfactions that have fueled national populism’s rise. If progressives move to the center, which has shifted rightward, they risk abandoning their distinctive political commitments.\n\nWhile the traditional center-right faces a clearer path to exercising political power in the new populist age, it too faces difficult choices. National populism marshals popular discontent with highly credentialed, overweening, and incompetent elites while supposing that the people are a reliable repository of good sense and moral decency. It also attacks the nation-state’s subordination to universal principles and international institutions while insisting that law and public policy should uphold religious faith. But not all wishes of the people, even those backed by a supermajority, are wise and lawful. And many aspects of the people’s faith should not be translated into political imperatives and enforced by government. When clashes arise between popular will and basic rights, or between religious faith and fundamental freedoms, traditional center-right parties – which seek to preserve individual liberty, equality under law, and limited government – may be compelled to choose between their principles and their access to power.\n\nAt the same time, American conservatives, national-populist as well as center-right, enjoy an advantage in reconciling nationalism, populism, and universal principles. That’s because the principles of individual freedom, equality under law, and limited government form constitutive features of the American political tradition. So too does the conviction that a nation-state grounded in the consent of the governed is the best vehicle for securing basic rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nAs the country confronts the momentous changes and challenges that mark our populist age, America’s national populists – along with center-right conservatives and indeed all Americans – should regard fidelity to the nation’s founding principles and constitutional form of government as a political imperative, not least because such fidelity honors the nation’s precious inheritance.","summary":"Analysis: Fibbing reinforced voters' suspicions the party won't admit uncomfortable truths on crime, immigration, inflation","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/dems-failed-in-2024-because-leaders-were-lying-about-bidens-mental-acuity/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joe-biden-dementia-walk-like-a-joe-biden-video-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 18:43:56","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":312798038,"title":"Federal election 2025: Tune in to Australia’s first podcast election","text":"“I can’t believe you took the time to come on my silly podcast.”\n\nThat was how Abbie Chatfield, the host of It’s a Lot started her recent interview with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\nThe former reality TV star quickly corrected herself: “It’s not that silly . . .

Podcast audiences tend to skew young and male.\n\nIt is a strategy lifted from the US election, where Mr Trump’s appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience — at the time the most listened-to podcast in the world — helped deliver Mr Rogan’s key audience of 18-34-year-old men.\n\nThat interview has been viewed 57 million times on YouTube.\n\nMr Trump’s rival Kamala Harris appeared on Call Her Daddy, Spotify’s most popular podcast among women, among others.\n\nA senior source from Labor told The Sunday Times the decision to join popular podcasts “is modelled on other countries”, where it was used to target disengaged men and women.\n\n“On both sides of politics podcasts were used in the US election,” he said.\n\n“We also saw it in the UK election.”\n\nMore important than the podcasts themselves, he said, was the chance to have those podcasts recorded and repackaged for TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.\n\n“This is all about the disaggregation of media audiences,” he said.\n\n“It’s just going to grow in time as the market matures.”\n\nSusan Grantham is a lecturer in communications at Brisbane’s Griffith University. She said this was the first Australian election where podcasts were really playing a part.\n\n“It’s absolutely unsurprising that they’re being used in this election campaign and they’re being used by both sides,” she said.\n\n“The number of (Gen Z and millennial) voters has now surpassed the number of baby boomer voters.\n\n“Because of that, the focus has to shift. Those traditional techniques about engaging voters are null and void when it comes to that younger generation.\n\n“We are engaging with content online and we are engaging with short-form video. That’s why we have seen such an increase in the importance of short-form video.”\n\nFans of podcasts gravitate towards the medium in part because of their perceived authenticity.\n\nUnlike traditional media, hosts are not expected to be objective and guests are allowed to talk more casually and at greater length.\n\nMs Grantham said the format favoured politicians who were able to present themselves as “the guy or girl you can have a drink with”.\n\n“That only works for some personalities,” she said.\n\nPodcasts with politicians have been criticised — at times unfairly — for being lightweight.\n\nNot every podcast favours a softball approach to politicians, although Ms Grantham said the need to “keep people entertained” lent itself to a more light-hearted approach.\n\nNor is a perceived light touch necessarily an obstacle to political journalism.\n\nHowever, if podcasts focused more on personality than politics are allowed to replace more in-depth media scrutiny, society may have a problem, according to Cardiff University media and culture PhD candidate Maxwell Modell.\n\n“Traditional candidate interviews are meant to be combat zones, where journalists and politicians spar over key issues,” he wrote for The Conversation website.\n\n“They are democracy in action — and should be serious and focused on policy, political record and suitability for office — everything these podcasts are not.\n\n“There is value in getting to know politicians better as everyday people outside of politics. But this can become a problem when podcasts flood the media landscape or fully replace meaningful media scrutiny.”","summary":"‘I can’t believe you took the time to come on my silly podcast.’ That was how Abbie Chatfield, the host of It’s a Lot started her recent interview with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-election-2025/federal-election-2025-tune-in-to-australias-first-podcast-election-c-18250712","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18250712/6b023a6cb7bf22ed7f25db20097db6075cf81740-16x9-x0y25w2990h1682.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 18:00:00","author":"Kate Emery","authors":["Kate Emery"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.166},{"id":312923886,"title":"Media’s ‘Maryland man’ narrative collapses, but Democrats still coddle Abrego Garcia","text":"Here’s a more accurate description:\n\n“Illegal immigrant and an alleged MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, and wife-beater.”\n\nThe wife-beater part was revealed this week in court documents in handwritten testimony by his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, detailing Abrego Garcia’s domestic violence against her.\n\n“At this point, I am afraid to be close to him.

Every passenger gave their address as Abrego Garcia’s home address, and he claimed he was driving all of these people from Texas to Maryland for “construction work.” The case was referred to the FBI, which ordered his release. \n\nBut despite the fact that Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally, was arrested, has alleged MS-13 gang ties, was (rightly) suspected of human trafficking, and repeatedly assaulted his wife, Democrats have decided that he absolutely should be brought back to the U.S.\n\nLeading this charge is Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), who flew to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia and demanded that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele release him.\n\n“I’m not asking [Bukele] to smuggle Mr. Abrego Garcia into the United States,” Van Hollen told reporters. “I’m simply asking him to open the door of CECOT and let this innocent man walk out.”\n\n“This innocent man…”\n\nThe senator later met with Abrego Garcia to sip margaritas. \n\n“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”\n\n“Message of love…” \n\nYou can’t make this stuff up. \n\nIn 2023, a 37-year-old mother of five went for a hike in Bel Air, Maryland, where she was raped and brutally murdered by a man from El Salvador illegally in the U.S. \n\nVan Hollen barely acknowledged this heinous killing that occurred in his state. He didn’t attend the funeral to show his respect, and he voted against the Laken Riley Act last month, which requires the federal government to detain and deport illegal immigrants who are accused of committing crimes. Twelve Democrats in the Senate voted for it. \n\nRachel Morin’s mother, Patty, attended the White House press briefing this week to share her disgust with Van Hollen’s priorities. \n\n“Why does this illegal immigrant have more rights than my daughter, Rachel Morin, did?” she asked. “You represent me as the U.S. senator from Maryland, and you have barely even acknowledged my daughter and the brutal death that she endured because of another illegal immigrant. Why are you using my taxpayer money to fly to El Salvador to bring back someone that’s not even an American citizen?”\n\nGood questions. \n\nA CNN poll out this week shows that 56% of all Americans support deporting all illegal immigrants in the country. What do you think that number jumps to when asking voters if they support deporting illegal immigrants with gang ties who are accused of spousal abuse? 98%? 99%?\n\nDemocrats have an opportunity to ding President Donald Trump as the tariff war is hurting his numbers on the economy. A new CNBC poll has the president 12 points underwater on the economy and 16 points underwater on tariffs. \n\nBut instead, Democrats are making Abrego Garcia’s freedom their focus on social media and at rallies. On the latter, enter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) during a recent “Fight Oligarchy” speech. \n\n“We can tell President Bukele if we believe in democracy, he must be returned,” Ocasio-Cortez told a crowd in Idaho. “It is criminal he is being held abroad! And we demand these things because we do have power in this moment!” \n\nActually, Democrats have little power at this moment, and one big reason for that is this continued stubbornness to put the lives of those here illegally over those of the legal citizens they’re supposed to represent and protect. \n\nBy the way, it should be noted that while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Ocasio-Cortez are fighting oligarchy and taking on billionaires, they each flew on a luxury private jet to get there. Cost? $15,000 per hour. But again, they swear they’re fighting for the little guy. \n\nThe most effective ad of the 2024 campaign came when former Vice President Kamala Harris said during her 2019 presidential run that she supported U.S. taxpayer dollars being used for sex changes for illegal immigrants serving jail time. The 2024 Harris campaign had no response to it.\n\nLook at Starr County, Texas, as an example. This is a border county. In 2020, then-candidate Joe Biden topped Trump by 5 points there. It hadn’t voted Republican since 1892. But in 2024, Trump won it by 16 points, a 21-point swing in just four years, because of illegal immigration and the Biden-Harris administration’s failure to do anything about it. Starr County said that enough is enough. \n\nIn that same CNBC poll mentioned earlier, Trump, while underwater on the economy and tariffs, is plus-12 above water on the southern border and plus-7 on deporting illegal immigrants. This is his strongest issue because illegal crossings have nearly come to a complete halt without legislation being passed in Congress. In March 2024, under Biden, there were 189,359 border crossings. In March 2025, that number was 11,017, a 94% drop. \n\nBut instead of Democrats being laser-focused on the economy, they’re walking right into Trump’s wheelhouse by not only voting against the Laken Riley Act but also by visiting with and demanding the release of an alleged wife-beating gang member. \n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is reportedly heading to El Salvador next. He’ll be cheered on by the usual suspects at the New York Times, Washington Post, and MSNBC. \n\nWe keep hearing that Democrats must pivot to the center if they want to win any elections again. \n\nInstead, by coddling the likes of Abrego Garcia, they continue to move hard to the left. \n\nAnd right off a political cliff.","summary":"Another narrative was blown to smithereens this week, leaving Democrats and their media allies looking as out of touch as they’ve ever been.

The payment was made on January 28, 2025, just days after US president Donald Trump was sworn in as president following his election victory, and the paymemnt was only revealed months later, as per the report.

But some worried that any efforts to slash administrative functions would hamper agency functions and further sink morale. Curran has yet to communicate how the DOGE cuts will be implemented, despite Noem’s email saying that news would come directly from individual agency heads.\n\nOn Monday, the Secret Service released a new recruiting video featuring several Secret Service agents and officers in action, narrated by Noem and featuring her appearance in its final scenes. In early February the agency spent $2 million on a different recruiting video produced by Hollywood blockbuster director Michael Bay on jumbotron screens at the Super Bowl and on X.com that evening.\n\nRowe may be staying on the payroll while burning through accrued vacation days and sick leave, but it’s the title of senior adviser that is irritating agents and Uniform Division officers in the Secret Service community. Secret Service agents are questioning whether Rowe is providing advice to Curran and other agency leaders, and whether the agency has established a departure date for Rowe and when that will take place.\n\nRowe, 51, has 25 years and 10 months of federal service and has been eligible to retire since November, two sources tell RCP. In the Secret Service, unused annual leave has a cash value and is typically taken as a lump sum upon departure or forfeited. Unused sick leave doesn’t have any cash value so people planning to leave usually burn it off before officially retiring, these sources say.\n\n“There is no legitimate reason to keep him on the payroll, and every day he is kept on and allowed to telework as a ‘senior advisor,’ he is accruing more sick leave and annual leave and federal service time towards a bigger pension, which is costing the taxpayers more money,” one source complained.\n\nThe Secret Service responded to RealClearPolitics’ Monday inquiry but by Tuesday night had not provided answers to questions about Rowe’s title and continued employment. Efforts to reach Rowe were unsuccessful.\n\nThe agency in early February confirmed RCP’s reporting that Rowe would retire after Curran became the director. At the time, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi described Rowe as a “valued executive and leader” who is “currently enjoying a well-deserved break before retirement” after 26 years of service.\n\nThe Secret Service has a history of allowing senior agents under a public relations cloud or facing disciplinary action to remain on the payroll. In 2015, Alvin Smith, a veteran agent who served as chief of staff to then-Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, resigned in the wake of several highly publicized security lapses but remained on the payroll for months afterward.\n\nAt the time, then-House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz chastised Clancy for misleading Congress about Smith’s departure.\n\n“You have done a very good job of building trust and confidence, and it’s flushed down the toilet when I read and hear about these things,” Chaffetz said.\n\n“Don’t ever come back here to Congress and tell me that you have a financial problem when you’ve got A.T. Smith on your payroll, and you say you don’t have enough money. You shouldn’t have to pay for that out of your budget.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kerry O’Grady, a senior agent who suggested she wouldn’t take a bullet for Trump in 2016, was allowed to remain on the payroll while facing disciplinary action and working from home for more than two years so she could hit retirement and pension goals.\n\nFormer Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas tapped Rowe to head the Secret Service after Kimberly Cheatle resigned following the July attempted assassination against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, leaving rallygoer Corey Comperatore dead and two other attendees wounded. Rowe’s brief tenure was marked by several testy exchanges with members of Congress who questioned the agency failures before and during the assassination attempts.\n\nIn December, Rowe notably got into a shouting match with Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, during a hearing of the House Task Force investigating the Secret Service failures.\n\nIn late January, when Trump elevated Sean Curran, his protective detail leader during the campaign, to the director position, Curran initiated a house-cleaning, telling 10 senior officials, including Rowe, to resign, retire, or face being reassigned, several Secret Service sources told RCP at the time.\n\nA few days later, Rowe sent out a three-paragraph goodbye email, a tradition for outgoing directors. Rowe notably used the opportunity to sing Curran’s praises without a hint of bitterness over Trump’s decision to replace him. The letter also made no reference to the turbulent and toxic period the agency had just experienced in the months after the assassination attempts.\n\n“Throughout his career, Director Curran has led and played critical roles in both protective operations and the investigative mission,” Rowe wrote. “He has consistently demonstrated outstanding leadership, integrity, and courage. … His vision, dedication, and ability to drive results have earned him respect inside the agency and from law enforcement partners,” he continued.\n\n“I am confident that under his leadership the Secret Service will continue to grow, innovate, and remain steadfast in our unwavering commitment to succeed in our missions.” Rowe’s conclusion that he’s “proud of all that we have accomplished together” without any mention of the monumental failures in Butler and during the second assassination attempt on Trump’s life at a Florida golf course spurred instant ridicule among rank-and-file agents.\n\nBut it was the way he signed the letter that gave fellow agents and USSS officers the most pause. Rowe listed his title as deputy director, the post he held before Mayorkas elevated him to the acting director role after Cheatle resigned.\n\nSoon thereafter, Curran named a new deputy director, Darryl Volpicelli, a 24-year Secret Service veteran who has led the presidential protective division and served as the agency’s top liaison to Congress. On the agency website, however, Volpicelli’s position is curiously listed as “acting deputy director” without an explanation for the more temporary-sounding title.\n\nWhen Rowe listed his title as deputy director in his goodbye email in late January, agents told RCP that any attempt to retain Rowe in a leadership or advisory post would demonstrate a lack of commitment to reforms and lead to continued protection failures, retention problems, and low morale.\n\n“When are we going to seriously fix the problems instead of putting lipstick on a pig?” one source remarked.\n\nAgents and officers hope the recruitment videos and bonuses bring some manpower relief but are also eager for more serious reforms to the agency.\n\nNine months have passed since the first attempt on Trump’s life and no one has been publicly disciplined for Secret Service failures that led to the assassination attempts. Multiple agency sources allege that agents in the Pittsburgh Field Office, which was partially in charge of devising and executing the security plan for the Butler rally, are set to take the fall for the assassination attempt while two members of the Trump detail, who were under Curran’s leadership at the time, are either not facing the same disciplinary measures or will walk away without being disciplined.\n\nThose disciplinary actions also do not adequately reflect findings from two congressional investigative reports and the bipartisan Independent Review Board that reviewed the failures at Butler and made recommendations to the Secret Service.\n\nThe Secret Service’s severe manpower struggles have continued after the campaign and Trump’s inauguration.\n\nIn January, Brian Northcutt, head of the Secret Service’s Office of Investigations, sent an email titled, “Field Operations Manpower Update” which thanked the agents for their continued commitment to the heavy lifts over the campaign and for the inauguration but also said there was likely no relief until the late spring or early summer once protective assignments for the outgoing Biden family ease.\n\n“Unfortunately, there will be continued needs for significant numbers of Field Operations personnel to support protective assignments as the transition continues in the coming months,” Northcutt wrote.\n\nMany agents say they are working harder than ever at an unsustainable pace after Rowe promised “a paradigm shift” – that they would not have to continue “doing more with less,” a constant refrain from agency managers in the years leading up to the assassination attempts against Trump.\n\nEven though Trump ended Secret Service protection for President Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley Biden, and several other members of Biden’s extended family no longer receive agency protection, the demands of the job have only increased in recent weeks. Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance are far more active with more weekend events than Biden and Kamala Harris were for the entire four years of the Biden administration, while Trump’s large family and their travel have posed ongoing manpower challenges.","summary":"Given title of senior adviser, which is 'irritating agents and uniform division officers'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/former-secret-service-chief-still-on-agency-payroll/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kristi-noem-dhs-20250225-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 16:34:24","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.63},{"id":312804964,"title":"Report Highlights States With the Best and Worst Economic Outlook for 2025","text":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—A Tuesday report from the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative nonprofit, highlighted the states with the best and worst economic prospects for 2025.\n\nThe 18th edition of ALEC’s “Rich States, Poor States,” an annual report that examines all 50 states’ economic outlook “based on a state’s current standing in 15 state policy variables,” ranked Utah in first place for the 18th year in a row, followed by Tennessee, Indiana, North Carolina, and North Dakota. Meanwhile, New York ranked in last place in the “Economic Outlook Ranking.”\n\nNew York is notably one of the states with the highest income taxes, which ranges from 4% to 10.9%, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank. Meanwhile, Utah has a flat 4.55% individual income tax rate.\n\nNotably, several of the states that notched high marks on ALEC’s economic scorecard voted for President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election by large margins. Trump swept Utah in the November presidential election, securing 59.4% of the vote to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 37.8%.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris won New York in the 2024 presidential election, notching 56.3% of the vote to Trump’s 43.7%.\n\nMoreover, the report found that states that spend less—especially on income transfer programs—as well as states that tax less—particularly on activities such as working or investing—generally experience higher growth rates than states that tax and spend more.\n\n“This ranking reflects what happens when we trust Utahns to lead, solve problems, and shape their own future,” Republican Utah Gov.

Cillizza, on his YouTube channel, said Harris should run for governor rather than president, citing two new Democratic presidential polls in which she leads the field, but not in a commanding fashion.\n\n“Kamala Harris absolutely should not—should not—run for president in 2028 … Any poll that’s done right now … is going to show Kamala Harris in first place,” Cillizza said. “Okay? And the reason for that is not because lots and lots and lots of people want Kamala Harris to be president again—Democrats, that is—but because they know her name more than they know the names of anybody else.”\n\n“But there’s been two polls out in the last four days that I think should be a bright siren, a red flashing warning for Kamala Harris as she looks at what she wants to run for next—and the presidency,” he continued.\n\nCillizza first referenced a Wednesday Zeteo/Data for Progress poll that found Harris leading with 18% support in a hypothetical Democratic presidential primary among likely Democratic primary voters. Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg had 14% support while Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker each had 12%.\n\nHe then referenced the Spring 2025 Yale Youth Poll, which found Harris leading the field with 27.5% support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. Ocasio-Cortez had 21.3% support, while Buttigieg had 14% and other Democrats failed to obtain over 5% support.\n\n“Alright, what conclusion should you draw from that? You should draw the conclusion that despite the fact that Kamala Harris is totally known by Democrats in this country, somewhere between 1/5 and less than a third of Democrats say, ‘Yes, I would vote for her.’ So 28% in the Yale polling, 18% in the Zeteo/Data for Progress polling,” Cillizza said. “That is not a good sign. Right?”\n\nThe NewsNation political contributor asserted that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was polling at around 60% in 2013 and completely dominating the field of potential Democratic presidential candidates.\n\n“Kamala Harris is at 28% and 18%. Now, I’ve seen her as high as sort of the mid-30s in some of this very early 2028 polling,” he said. “But if I’m her campaign or people advising her, I look at that and I say: ‘You’re totally known. Right? So you’re much better known than any of these other people. You’re better known than Pete Buttigieg, you’re better known than AOC, you’re better known than Cory Booker, and yet you’re basically running even or close to even with these people.’ That does not bode well.”\n\nCillizza argued that since Harris is already well-known, she is unlikely to persuade voters to support her. He said other candidates who are less known will have the opportunity to sway more voters.\n\n“So if I’m Harris’ campaign, I look at this early, early polling and I say, ‘This is not telling me I can’t win, but it is suggesting that at least right now, there is not a clamor within the Democratic Party for me,’” he said.\n\nTherefore, Cillizza said Harris should seek the California governorship in 2026, arguing she would be much more likely to win that race.\n\nOriginally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation.","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—NewsNation political contributor Chris Cillizza said Thursday that former Vice President Kamala Harris definitely should avoid making a 2028 presidential run based...

Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nWe all know the meme:\n\nThe leopards have been feasting. Today we’re checking in on two big Trump-loving constituencies: truckers and soy farmers. \n\nTruckers love Donald Trump. Per FEC donation data, truck drivers are nearly three-quarters Republican, making it one of the reddest professions. You can imagine why. This group is mostly rural, mostly white and male, and tied to a job that lives and dies by the cost of fossil fuels, particularly diesel—which can account for up to 40% of costs. They also hated environmental mandates to electrify their fleets. \n\nIn 2014, truck driver was the most common job title in most American states—and a significant one in pretty much all of them. I wasn’t able to find more recent statistics, but demand for shipping has only intensified in the e-commerce age. Truck driving is one of the last professions that provides a path to financial security without a college degree. \n\nAnd Trump is single-handedly breaking that path. \n\nPer Econ 101, as demand for products craters in the face of Trump’s chaotic tariffs and the supply of truckers remains the same, what does that mean for prices? Exactly. \n\nIt is also not surprising that Mack Trucks is laying off about 20% of its workforce in response to the economic havoc Trump’s tariffs are generating. And if you follow that link, you’ll see plenty more terrible news for the trucking industry. \n\n“I think they’re all smart enough to know that if you go all in on tariffs, there’s the potential for counter tariffs and inflation as a result,” said the Trump-supporting Chris Spear, who heads the American Trucking Association. “So I don’t think they want to do anything that’s going to have an adverse impact on the economy,” Spear said back in December.\n\nHa ha! Imagine thinking Trump and his team of degenerate sycophants are “smart.” Now, the full horror of Trump’s tariffs is dawning on the guy.\n\n“The 100,000 full-time hardworking truckers hauling 85% of the surface trade in goods with Mexico and 67% of the goods traded with Canada will bear a direct and disproportionate impact,” Spear whined.\n\nCanadian truckers will suffer as well, of course. But don’t worry—they’re also assholes. \n\nRelated | West Virginians love Trump—and he's screwing them anyway\n\nNow let’s check out the soy industry. \n\nDuring the first Trump administration, his tariffs on China cost American soybean growers billions, all to Brazil’s delight. The economic damage was so severe that Trump had to bail out farmers to the tune of $28 billion. So what did these farmers do?\n\nVote for Trump again, of course! \n\nTrump has now killed what was left of the Chinese market, dramatically increased the cost of fertilizer thanks to his idiotic trade war with Canada, and turned the world against American goods. And these idiot soy farmers are relegated to penning columns like this one: “I’m a Soybean Farmer Who Voted for Trump. I’m Begging the President to End the Trade War.” \n\n“Like many of my fellow farmers, I voted for President Donald Trump in the past three elections,” wrote Kentuckian Caleb Ragland. “The president won me over with his commitment to business-friendly tax cuts as well as his track record of reducing regulation and cutting government spending.”\n\nYou see, Farmer Caleb was voting to kill other people’s jobs, not his own! \n\n“I am one of the 500,000 soybean farmers in America who feels the pain,” he wrote. “I rely on my own farm for 100 percent of the income for my family and the families of our three full-time workers. We have 1,500 acres of soybeans on my farm. At $600 an acre, our production costs are $900,000. But in the current climate, an acre brings in only $500 of revenue, which means we’re yielding $750,000—a $150,000 loss.”\n\nYup, sure sucks. But don’t worry—he blames Biden. Really.\n\n“Back in 2018, President Trump negotiated a trade deal with China that would have been very good for our farmers. We had one problem, though, that derailed its effectiveness: Joe Biden.”\n\nBailouts needed in 2018: Trump made a good deal! \n\nNo bailouts needed between 2021 and 2024: Boo, Joe Biden is bad!\n\nFarm going bankrupt in 2025: Begging Trump to change course but still, the president is operating “in good faith.” \n\nDon’t weep for the guy. He is literally reaping what he sowed. \n\nAnd unfortunately, that kind of wilful ignorance appears to be incurable. Take three-time Trump voter and Ohio soybean farmer Josh Yoder. \n\n“The world is trying to figure out if Trump is playing chess or checkers,” he said. “If it’s the former, it would be a cool, long-term benefit. If it’s the latter, we’re going down a path we’ve never gone down in my lifetime.”\n\nThe world isn’t trying to figure it out. \n\nThe world knows.\n\nBut Josh and his fellow MAGA drones refuse to acknowledge the reality, despite all the evidence staring them in the face. \n\n“The worst thing our farmers run into is that we can’t plan for anything,” said Texan grain manager Andy Riffe. Planning is a thing they could’ve done—had they voted for Kamala Harris. \n\nAt least trans kids are being bullied and innocent people are being sent to a Salvadoran gulag, which is what Trumpers were really voting for anyway.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

Next would be Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, at 8% support and Republican Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco was third with 4%, as per the report. The survey included 18 hypothetical candidates for the June 2026 primary, reported KTLA5.Kamala Harris’ Decision Could Reshape the RaceDirector of Emerson College Polling, Spencer Kimball said, “How competitive the 2026 gubernatorial primary in California is depends on whether Harris runs. Other candidacies, like Katie Porter’s, are contingent on whether the former vice president enters the race,” as quoted in the report. Kimball mentioned that, “Harris garners 49% of Democrats, while Porter gets 13%. Without Harris in the race, Porter’s support among Democrats rises to 21%, which would make her an early frontrunner in a crowded field,” quoted KTLA5.Voters Are Split on Whether Harris Should RunHowever, voters have a divided opinion on whether Harris should run for this position. Voters are tied 50-50 on whether they really want her to. Other Topics on Voters’ MindsThe Emerson College/Inside California Politics survey didn't only examine Kamala Harris' prospects for the 2026 governor's race, it also took a peek at what Californians think about a couple of other topics, including the political future of Gavin Newsom, US president Donald Trump's trade policy, and even the upcoming Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, reported KTLA5.According to the report, the majority of the respondents do not want Newsom to run for president in 2028, with 59% voting against him but 41% think he should. With respect to party affiliation, 61% of registered Democrats voted that Newsom should run, while 78% of Republicans and 75% of independents voted he should not, as per KTLA5.When California voters were asked about the president’s tariffs, most consider it as more of a tax on the consumer than a tax on trade partners, 60% to 22%, and 18% view it as neither as per the report. However, Kimball also shared that, “A majority of Democrats, 77%, and half of independent voters see tariffs as more of a tax on the consumer, while 48% of Republican voters see them as more of a tax on the foreign country,” as quoted by KTLA5.When the participants were asked about the 2028 L.A. Summer Games, 32% said they are very interested in the games, 44% are somewhat interested , and 24% are not interested at all , reported KLTA5.According to the KLTA5 report, a majority of California voters, 58%, would want to see the Olympic Games in person if they could afford it, while 42% would not.FAQsHow much support does Harris have among voters right now?According to the poll, 31% of voters say they’d vote for her in the 2026 primary.

Chris Van Hollen’s, D-Md., sudden trip to El Salvador to try to free deportee Kilmar Abrego Garcia is getting the attention of critics who believe the Maryland Democrat may have violated a 1799 law prohibiting unauthorized diplomacy. The Logan Act – named for former Pennsylvania Sen. George Logan – stipulates a fine and/or imprisonment for Americans corresponding with foreign officials \"with intent to influence the[ir] measures … in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States.\" Logan met with French diplomat Charles de Talleyrand after Paris rebuffed President John Adams, and he attempted to entreat him – in part via a letter from Vice President Thomas Jefferson – to end the Franco-American hostilities of the so-called \"Quasi War.\" In that way, several prominent conservatives questioned whether Van Hollen’s actions similarly violated the law.

Notes from former FBI agent Peter Strzok read, \"VP: Logan Act\" and suggested then-Vice President Joe Biden floated using it against Flynn, while then-FBI director Jim Comey said the Kislyak correspondence appeared \"legit.\" NOT A MARYLAND MAN: GOP BLASTS DEMOCRAT SENATOR FIGHTING FOR RETURN OF SALVADORAN NATIONAL Fox News contributor Byron York responded to an X question on the matter by saying that he repeatedly argued during the Flynn matter that the act is a \"dead letter.\" \"But politically, it's useful to know that Sen. Van Hollen traveled to a foreign country to bash the President of the United States.\" The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) sent a letter to Senate Ethics Committee Chairman James Lankford, R-Okla, asking to probe for violations, according to the New York Post. AAF’s Thomas Jones said Garcia \"is essentially an enemy combatant in the ongoing invasion … by transnational gangs.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Lankford for comment. The act was last invoked by Trump critics after a book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward claimed the mogul held several calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin between his terms in the White House. Trump was lambasted by the \"Never-Trump\" Lincoln Project and Kamala Harris over Woodward’s book’s claims. Agents also considered getting Flynn to admit to breaking the Logan Act: \"What is our goal?\" one of the notes from ex-FBI counterintelligence chief Bill Priestap read: \"Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\" After that situation, Rep.

'Way to go, way to stand up to the bully.'\n\nThose remarks earned a strong rebuke from venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who bought a 10 percent stake in the team in 2010 before ultimately selling off his ownership last year. \n\n'Normally, when an executive at a company where I own equity speaks on topics beyond their knowledge and reveals themselves to be an idiot I usually just fire them or sell my equity,' he wrote on X.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr infuriated Donald Trump supporters by publicly supporting Harvard\n\nTrump has launched a widely condemned crackdown against top American universities\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, a former stakeholder in the Warriors, called Kerr a 'hapless rube'\n\n'Fortunately, I already sold all my equity in the Warriors last year at the-then all time high so this isn't my problem but the total ignorance of his comments still stands.'\n\nPalihapitiya accused Kerr of 'blindly defending' Harvard, which he called 'a Corporation with a $53B balance sheet masquerading as a non profit' and said the school had 'the absolute worst scores for freedom of speech amongst ALL colleges in America.'\n\nThe Sri-Lankan born investor also said Harvard had been 'admonished' by the Supreme Court for discrimination in their admissions process, and accused the school of allowing antisemitism to 'fester unchecked on campus.' \n\nPalihapitiya also blasted Kerr's basketball acumen, saying owner Joe Lacob, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson deserve all of the credit for the team's four titles under Kerr.\n\n'my 4 [year old] could have won as many championships with the talent Joe assembled,' Palihapitiya said.\n\nHarvard came under immense scrutiny over campus antisemitism in response to Israel's war against Hamas, forcing then-President Claudine Gay to resign amid mounting pressure from forces outside the university. \n\nThe Trump administration has been campaigning to eradicate antisemitism from college campuses, and got Columbia University to agree to several policy changes with the school fearing it could lose $400million in funding.\n\nHowever, Harvard President Alan Garber rejected the White House's demands with a blistering letter and Kerr used his post-game availability following his team's play-in tournament win over the Grizzlies to speak out against the Trump administration.\n\nKerr has been routinely outspoken on progressive issues and endorsed Kamala Harris\n\nTrump has also called Harvard a 'joke' and said it should lose government research contracts\n\n'I believe in academic freedom,' he said. 'I believe it's crucial for all of our institutions to be able to handle their own business the way they want to, and they should not be shaken down and told what to teach, what to say, by our government. \n\nSteve Kerr attracts fury with Harvard protest amid Trump's feud with college\n\n'That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, but it's kind of par for the course right now. This is me supporting Harvard.'\n\nKerr noted that the shirt was sent to him by his friend, Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker.\n\nKerr is the son of late professor and political scientist Malcolm Kerr, and he has frequently been outspoken on progressive issues.\n\nIn addition to the federal funding freeze on Harvard, the Department of Homeland Security also canceled $2.7million worth of research grants to the school and threatened the university's ability to enroll international students unless it turns over records on visa-holders' 'illegal and violent activities.'\n\nThe Warriors face the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs on Sunday.\n\nDonald TrumpGolden State Warriors\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nEx-Warriors owner attacks Steve Kerr after legendary NBA coach called Donald Trump a 'bully'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Steve Kerr has been called a 'hapless rube' and an 'idiot' by a former minority shareholder of the Warriors after the Golden State head coach labeled President Donald Trump a 'bully.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-14627805/warriors-owner-steve-kerr-donald-trump-attack.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/14/97460121-0-image-m-12_1745068016715.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 13:14:36","author":"Editor,Jake Nisse","authors":["Editor","Jake Nisse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":312745818,"title":"Dana Carvey thought his ‘SNL’ Joe Biden impersonation was finished after disastrous debate","text":"Dana Carvey knew his stint on “Saturday Night Live” would be cut short thanks to former President Joe Biden. \n\nThe “Wayne’s World” actor was slated to spend six weeks in New York City to impersonate Biden at the request of the show’s head honcho, Lorne Michaels.\n\n“Lorne is very persuasive,” he tells Page Six in an exclusive interview before imitating Michaels, “‘It’ll be Autumn in New York … and then afterwards you can tell us to f–k off.’ It was like, ‘OK, six weeks in New York.'”\n\nHowever, the 69-year-old actor thought his return to “SNL” was over after Biden’s disastrous June 27th Presidential debate against now-President Trump, which precipitated him dropping out of the presidential race. Weeks later, former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped up as the Democratic candidate.\n\n“When that first debate was sort of going awry with President Biden, I turned to my wife and I said, ‘We’re not going to New York,’ during the debate,” he recalls. “That’s absolutely true.”\n\nAnd Carvey’s premonition came true … to a point.\n\nThe “Masters of Disguise” actor got to appear in 10 episodes alongside Maya Rudolph, who was impersonating Harris, and Jim Gaffigan, who took on the role of Governor of Minnesota and Vice President-hopeful, Tim Walz. \n\nHis Biden impersonation included a familiar scratching of the face, an affectation that Carvey calls his “favorite,” and little mannerisms that included picking up “toys on the carpet.”\n\nCarvey — who stresses that he likes the peope he imitates — tells us that he approached his impersonation carefully, likening it to “threading” a needle to “make it funny but not make it in any way sad or cruel.”\n\n“I’m not trying to really make political points or put them down,” he explains. “I’m trying to find what is fun about them.”\n\nThroughout his stint on “SNL” from 1986 to 1993, Carvey got to impersonate another president: George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe comedian tells us that Bush, who died in 2018, loved his impersonation so much that he invited Carvey to the White House after he lost the 1992 Presidential election.\n\n“He calls me out of the blue in December to come to Washington, DC,” Carvey recalls.\n\n“And in that moment, I’m a young man.

For U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, who represents Colorado’s newest congressional district north of Denver, and Rep. Jeff Hurd, the congressman for a sprawling 27-county Western Slope-anchored district, the president’s aggressive tariff and immigration policies have put pressure on sectors of the economy — agriculture, ranching and manufacturing — that play outsized roles in their districts.\n\nIn March, both legislators were put “on notice” by Emily’s List as “top targets for defeat in the 2026 midterm elections.” The political advocacy group supports Democratic women candidates who favor abortion rights in their bids for office across the country.\n\nThe hazards for Evans, a freshman representative from Fort Lupton, are greater than for Hurd because his 8th Congressional District was created four years ago to be Colorado’s most politically competitive — a promise it’s lived up to in two election cycles.\n\n“Hurd has a bit more wiggle room than Evans does,” said Colorado State University political science professor Kyle Saunders, who has been closely watching both districts.\n\nEvans, who narrowly beat incumbent Rep. Yadira Caraveo in the November election, was the only Republican House member in Colorado to make this month’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s list of “districts in play.” That means his eventual Democratic opponent will be getting a targeted splash of national money in next year’s election.\n\n“There is a long way to go yet,” Saunders said, “but Evans will have to be very careful with how he plays his cards over the next year-plus — both in how closely he stands with Trump as well as with any votes that can be used against him in the 2026 campaign.”\n\nWhile both congressmen have largely toed Trump’s line at the start of the Republican’s second administration, there are signs they are willing to push back — albeit cautiously.\n\nIn early March, they were among 21 Republicans who signed a letter to Rep. Jason Smith, the GOP chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. They urged their party to keep clean energy tax credits from the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act climate law that fund development of “traditional and renewable energy sources alike.”\n\nThe appeal came in the face of efforts by Trump to make it easier for companies to produce oil and gas and to empower public officials to halt already approved clean-energy projects.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurd this month took a public swipe at the president by introducing a bipartisan bill that would require that unilateral tariffs proposed by the executive branch undergo congressional review, and be limited in duration.\n\n“I think it’s pretty clear under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution that Congress has authority with respect to tariffs,” Hurd, a Grand Junction attorney, told The Denver Post in an interview. “I thought it was an important thing for me to be part of the legislation that would reassert Congress’ authority.”\n\nFormer Colorado Republican Party chair Dick Wadhams said both Hurd and Evans “have done really well” in their first 100 days pledging fealty to Trump’s agenda. They’ve done so without attaching themselves too closely to some of its harder edges, he said — like supporting false claims of a stolen 2020 election.\n\n“Gabe is first and foremost a congressman for the 8th District,” Wadhams said. “And I think Jeff Hurd is in the tradition of what 3rd District voters are looking for. They’ve set themselves up as strong incumbents.”\n\n“Tying them to Trump”\n\nBut the 2026 election is still more than 18 months away. A lot can happen between now and then, Saunders said.\n\nTrump’s polling numbers have fallen since he took office on Jan. 20, according to a CBS News-YouGov survey taken a week ago. His approval rating has flipped from 53% in favor of his overall performance in February to 53% disapproval now.\n\nSimilar declines were recorded in the poll on Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\n“What we can say is that President Trump’s honeymoon is very likely over,” Saunders said. “Does that mean that his favorability will decline further from here? What we do know is that economic uncertainty, rising prices and other fundamentals do not usually help the sitting president — we saw that as recently as President Biden’s struggles with inflation in 2023 and 2024.”\n\nThe danger of an unpopular president is that unaffiliated voters may break towards Democrats next year, Saunders said. In Evans’ case, his prospects are complicated by the fact that the 8th District, which covers portions of Weld, Adams and Larimer counties, has an 8,000-voter registration advantage for Democrats, he said.\n\n“In a district where Evans only won by approximately 2,400 votes, those factors alone could easily turn the tide the other way,” Saunders said.\n\nHal Bidlack, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who unsuccessfully ran in Colorado’s 5th Congressional District nearly 20 years ago, advises the Democrats running in the 3rd and 8th districts in 2026 to burden their opponents with Trump — and the task of trying to explain Trump. He also taught political science at the Air Force Academy for nearly 20 years.\n\n“I would have the attitude of tying them to Trump as tightly as I can,” the Democrat said. “I would make them defend Trump and Trumpism completely.”\n\nHurd, who beat Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by 5 percentage points last year, hasn’t drawn a Democratic challenger yet. But Evans has two of note already.\n\nCaraveo, who on Tuesday announced a bid to retake the seat she lost nearly six months ago, told The Post that Evans is “falling in line completely with Donald Trump and Elon Musk.”\n\n“He’s not really taking into account that this is a very middle-of-the-road district that doesn’t fit into the right MAGA extremism that he’s voting for, and I haven’t seen him veer at all from the path that Donald Trump wants him to be on,” she said in an interview.\n\nHer Democratic primary opponent, state Rep. Manny Rutinel, voiced a similar criticism of Evans. He announced his candidacy less than a month after Evans took office Jan. 3.\n\n“Even though Congressman Evans was elected to represent the people of CD-8, his only focus has been representing the interests of the ultrawealthy and defending President Trump’s disastrous policies against working people,” Rutinel wrote in an email to The Post.\n\nEvans, a U.S. Army veteran and former Arvada cop, dismisses the criticism.\n\n“I’ve done over 40 in-person meetings, roundtables, town halls — things of that nature,” he said. “My staff has done over 300 other meetings, and so we’re 100% committed to being out, active and engaged in the district.”\n\nWhile Evans strongly backs the administration’s efforts to secure the border and deport criminals and gang members who are in the country illegally, he often tells the story of his grandfather, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico “the right way.”\n\nThe 8th District is Colorado’s most heavily Latino district.\n\n“We have to recognize their key contributions,” he said of immigrants, “and we have to make sure that we are moving the ball forward to get some sort of meaningful immigration reform — so that the people who are trying to do it the right way and are bringing so many positive contributions to our communities don’t get left behind.”\n\nTariffs and farming\n\nIn the meantime, the political winds have already started blowing ahead of 2026.\n\nEarlier this week, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, met with about 30 northern Colorado manufacturers in Loveland — right on the doorstep of Evans’ district. The discussion focused on the “devastating impacts of Trump’s tariff taxes on the industry and economy,” according to a news release from the governor’s office.\n\nBut manufacturers are hardly the only sector impacted by tariffs. Trade duties are especially challenging for farmers and ranchers in Colorado. They need to remain competitive on price to sell their products overseas and need the costs of imported equipment and parts to remain reasonable.\n\nChad Franke, the president of the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, said many farmers in Colorado desire a more level playing field in global trade but would rather not incur financial damage trying to get there.\n\n“The broad-ranging tariffs are going to be harmful to family farmers and ranchers because of reciprocal tariffs, which will be levied (by foreign countries) against commodities,” he said. “We’re hopeful they can put pressure on Washington, D.C., to lessen the impact of broad tariffs on the ag economy.”\n\nHurd’s bill calling for congressional review of tariffs could be an effective check on their impacts, Franke said.\n\nBut any effects from Trump’s trade policies on Colorado farmers, Franke said, won’t come into view until closer to harvest season — “If there is going to be a problem, we’ll hear about it through the summer and into the fall” — when it’s that much closer to the November 2026 election.\n\nEvans acknowledges that tariffs aren’t popular among producers in his district. But he says farmers and ranchers are also tired of being taken advantage of by other countries.\n\n“Nobody loves the chaos, but they’re actually pretty excited about the potential for the playing field to be level,” he said.\n\nEvans, who as a state lawmaker represented some of the same area north of Denver that’s now in his congressional district, said farmers tell him they want nothing more than to crack markets like Spain, Italy, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n“They’ve had willing buyers. We’ve had willing producers here, but they couldn’t get through with the lack of trade deals in the last five years,” he said. “And so I think what we’re seeing with this administration is (that) through tariffs, they’re using that as a mechanism to get those trade deals done.”\n\nHurd sees tariffs as a “tool in the toolbox” to creating a fairer global trading system. But they must be administered judiciously, with an eye toward limiting their “breadth and scope.”\n\n“I do believe that tariffs can have a strategic role when it comes to approaching these issues, but I just think we need to be thoughtful in how we approach it,” Hurd said. He added that “broad-based tariffs cause me more concern than tariffs that are targeted towards a specific end.\n\nDespite his support for Trump’s goals of bringing manufacturing back to the United States, Hurd said it can’t be done at the expense of Congress’ power. Thus, the bill he introduced earlier this month.\n\n“We just need to make sure that we do that the right way and that we comport with the requirements under the Constitution,” he said.\n\nTrump’s checkered Colorado history\n\nBidlack, the retired lieutenant colonel and political scientist, lauded Hurd for signing on to the bill despite its dim prospects for passage in a Republican-majority Congress with deep allegiances to Trump.\n\n“It is remarkable to me that a freshman Republican would thumb his nose at Trump so dramatically in what is a doomed effort,” Bidlack said of Hurd, who has never publicly revealed whether he has voted for the president. “But it’s smart to distance himself from Trump.”\n\nThat’s especially true in Colorado, where Trump was beaten by Hillary Clinton in 2016, Joe Biden four years ago and Kamala Harris last year, Wadhams said.\n\nHurd has taken a principled stand guarding the separation of powers at the top of American government, Wadhams said — a position that should help him in a district that nearly ousted Republican Lauren Boebert in 2022 over concerns about her behavior and gravitas.\n\n“He’s a truly constitutional conservative,” Wadhams said.\n\nDespite the strong Republican lean of the 3rd Congressional District, which hugs the borders of Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico and swoops from Rangely to Pueblo, it was less than 20 years ago that Democrat U.S. Rep. John Salazar held the seat. If public opinion goes into a tailspin under the second Trump administration and Democrats find the right contender next year, Wadhams said, the district has a chance of going blue again.\n\n“A Trump presidency is a surprise every day,” he said.\n\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.","summary":"Freshmen congressmen face question of how much to embrace president as Dems target them in 2026.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/19/colorado-gabe-evans-jeff-hurd-donald-trump-tariffs-election-2026/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TDP-Z-GettyImages-2184216746.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 12:00:55","author":"John Aguilar","authors":["John Aguilar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":312713984,"title":"Michelle Obama flashes her wedding ring after shutting down Barack divorce rumors once and for all","text":"Michelle Obama continues to silence the haters. \n\nThe former first lady, 61, flashed her wedding ring while out and about in Los Angeles Thursday after shutting down rumors that she and husband Barack Obama are headed for divorce.\n\nMichelle sent a clear message to skeptics while rocking her diamond bands during a visit to The Academy headquarters with her brother and podcast co-host, Craig Robinson.\n\nThe mother of two added some other chunky jewelry, including knot earrings, to her olive green ensemble.\n\nMichelle looked stylish in a cardigan and matching sweater, baggy cargo pants, brown sling-back kitten heels and a $3,700 Bottega Veneta “Arco Intrecciato” Leather Tote Bag.\n\nShe wore her braided hair back in a long, low ponytail. \n\nAlthough Barack did not join the outing, the siblings seemed to be in great spirits as they walked and talked with staffers. \n\nThe Obamas, who wed in 1992, have not been spotted together since December 2024 following a tiring months-long campaign to support Kamala Harris’ run for presidency. \n\nMichelle decided to take a step back from the spotlight after Donald Trump won the ticket, leading to unfounded speculation that there was trouble in paradise. \n\nThe chatter first picked up steam after the 44th US President attended Trump’s inauguration without Michelle.\n\nAlthough the couple posted about each other on social media, the rumor mill continued to swirl after the “Becoming” author continued to skip public-facing events. \n\nMichelle spent nearly three months out of the spotlight before making her first public appearance of 2025 on the “Jennifer Hudson Show” in March. \n\nMichelle and Robinson, 62, launched their podcast that same month and the former attorney has shared insight into her relationship with Barack in several episodes since. \n\nShe also directly addressed speculation that she and the politician, 63, were on the rocks during an episode of Sophia Bush’s “Work in Progress” podcast last week. \n\nMichelle explained that she stopped going to political events because it no longer served her — not because there was any tension between her and her husband. \n\n“The interesting thing is that when I say ‘no,’ for the most part, people are like, ‘I get it,’ and I’m OK,” she explained of her choice to take a step back. \n\n“And that’s the thing that we as women struggle with — disappointing people,” she continued. “So much so that people, they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”\n\nMichelle laughed about the notion that there was anything wrong with their marriage, adding that it’s hard for people to comprehend “a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself.”\n\n“But that’s what society does to us,” she said. “We actually finally start going, ‘What am I doing? Who am I doing this for?’ And if it doesn’t fit into the sort of stereotype of what people think we should do, then it gets labeled as something negative and horrible.”\n\nAfter spending so many years appeasing others and doing her job as first lady, she noted that it was “time to make some big girl decisions” in her life and “own it fully.”\n\n“If not now, when? What am I waiting for?” she asked. “Now is the time for me to start asking myself these hard questions of, ‘Who do I truly want to be every day?’ And that changes.”\n\nShe added, “So, who do I want to have a lunch with? How long do I want to stay in a place? Do I want to travel? If a girlfriend calls and says, ‘Let’s go here,’ I can say ‘Yes!’ I can.

Al Green’s outburst and exit from the chamber. But give the man credit for speaking truth to power: Trump received no mandate.\n\nThe presidential election of 2024 was one of the closest in recent history. More than half the country voted for someone other than Trump, and if just 115,000 votes in three states (out of 155.2 million cast nationally) had gone the other way, Kamala Harris would be president, and we would still be enjoying the global stability and robust economy that the Biden/Harris administration left us.\n\nThe extremely close margins in the House and Senate also fail to support any claims of a mandate, so let’s get real.\n\nThere was no mandate to pardon 1,500 criminals who, with Trump’s encouragement, attacked our Capitol and the brave police officers who protected the lawmakers inside, many of whom have since turned their backs on the very people who saved them from harm that shameful day in 2021.\n\nThere was no mandate to give Elon Musk, an unaccountable, unelected billionaire immigrant, who has enriched himself with taxpayer subsidies and contracts, unprecedented and likely illegal authority to gleefully take a wrecking ball to our federal government in the name of efficiency. In doing so, he is destroying vital services and the lives of thousands of experienced, dedicated public servants, many of whom are veterans who served this country in ways that Trump and Musk can’t even begin to understand.\n\nThere was no mandate to fill cabinet and other high-level positions with people whose main qualifications are denying the outcome of the 2020 election and unquestioning fealty to a wannabe dictator.\n\nThere was no mandate to fire all the inspectors general and independent watchdogs and to fill the Justice Department and FBI with people who will hunt down Trump’s perceived enemies and look the other way for his friends.\n\nThere was no mandate to abandon the people of Ukraine bravely fighting for their freedom by cutting off assistance, attacking their courageous leader and cozying up to the murderous dictator who invaded their homeland three years ago and has wantonly killed thousands upon thousands of children and adults as he continues to destroy schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure in a war that Trump said he could end in one day.\n\nThere was no mandate to remove anyone from the top leadership of our military who happened to be Black or female or to erase the historic struggles and triumphs of minorities from our government websites.\n\nThere was no mandate to wreck our economy by imposing tariffs and picking fights with vital economic partners around the world, many of whom have been trusted friends and allies for generations. Nor was there any mandate to conquer Greenland, bomb Mexico or insult our Canadian neighbors with a preposterous and wholly unwanted quest to make them the 51st state.\n\nAnd there certainly was no mandate to ignore our Constitution, violate our laws and shred the norms that have bound us together since the earliest days of the republic.\n\nTrump and the neutered Republicans in Congress who bark and clap like trained seals at his every utterance can say mandate over and over again to justify the carnage that is taking place here in Maine, across the nation and around the world, but the numbers don’t lie. They may have won a close election, but they received no mandate.\n\nIf anything, a closely divided election is a plea for our leaders to find common ground and work together to solve our problems. Since that clearly isn’t happening, it’s going to be up to the rest of us to continue to speak out, stand up and fight back — and to get ready to demonstrate what a real mandate looks like in next year’s election and the presidential contest that follows.","summary":"President Trump and the neutered Republicans in Congress can repeat 'mandate' to justify the carnage that is taking place in Maine and around the world.

disconnected Democratic elites are","text":"Following Democrats’ defeat in the 2024 election, some pointed to a systemic issue within the Democratic party: progressives and political elites who dominate the party have pushed it so far to the left, that it is out of touch with what voters want.\n\nNow, a new first-of-its kind poll conducted by UC Berkeley and Politico has quantified just how out of touch California’s Democratic political elites are with the wider electorate.\n\nTo be sure, this survey was only conducted in one state. \n\nHowever, there are indications that the chasm between Democratic elites and average voters is not confined solely to California but rather is a national problem for Democrats.\n\nDavid Hogg, the vice chair of the DNC, is reportedly planning to spend $20 million on primary challenges against Democratic incumbents he considers too passive in opposing Trump.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, if not corrected, the disconnect between the activists and elites versus the rest of the electorate – including Democrats – will make it virtually impossible for the party to coalesce around a presidential candidate.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,025 California voters and more than 700 “political influencers” – a sample which included political insiders, federal and state lawmakers, as well as their staffers – found a considerable gap between what voters want from their elected officials and what political elites want.\n\nIndeed, while a plurality (43%) of voters feel their representatives have been “too confrontational” with the Trump administration, nearly one-half of influencers say officials have been “too passive” according to Politico, which did not publish the specific percentage.\n\nPut another way, whereas voters want California to have a working relationship with the Trump administration, the smaller group of political elites want California at the forefront of anti-Trump “resistance.”\n\nMoreover, on specific policies, such as immigration and climate mandates, there was an even starker divide. \n\nAccording to Politico, whereas voters “were more likely to support reducing legal immigration and encouraging assimilation,” elites, on the other hand, “favored more legal immigration and maintaining distinct cultures.”\n\nFurther, when asked about California’s strict emission standards, voters supported it by a 5-point margin (45% to 40%), a significant difference from the 68-point margin in elites’ support (82% to 14%). \n\nSumming up the poll, Politico noted that the political elites are more eager than voters to “embrace California’s progressive agenda.”\n\nGiven that California voters are significantly more liberal than the national electorate, it’s entirely reasonable to believe that the disconnect between national elites and voters nationwide is even greater.\n\nTo that point, as Jack Citrin, a political science professor at UC Berkeley noted, “The influentials (influencers in this survey) are a much more homogenous group than the registered voter public.”\n\nThis has been to the detriment of the party’s relationship with everyday Americans, particularly working class voters, who used to be the core of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn no small measure, Democrats’ shift to the left – on the economy and social issues in particular – is why Donald Trump made considerable inroads with working class voters last November.\n\nEven in California, Kamala Harris’ 20-point margin of victory was nearly 10-points lower than former President Biden’s in 2020. \n\nWith the exception of Alpine, every county in the state shifted to the right in 2024 versus 2020, including a 9% move in Riverside, and 6% in both Orange and San Diego counties, per the New York Times. \n\nSpeaking of the former Vice President, the same survey indicated diverging opinions on her possible run for Governor of California. \n\nAsked which word most encapsulates their emotions towards a Harris candidacy, political insiders most often said “indifferent” (36%), followed by “mostly excited” (22%). \n\nRegistered Democrats however were significantly more upbeat – slightly more than 4-in-10 (41%) said they were “mostly excited” and one-third said “joyful.” \n\nConversely, roughly one-half (47%) of Independents said they felt either “irritated” (26%) or that Harris’ campaign was “hopeless” (21%). \n\nOf course, given Democrats’ dominance in the state, Independents would likely be unable to deny Harris the governor’s mansion should she run. \n\nAlthough, these findings further reinforce the disconnect between Democratic political insiders and the wider electorate. \n\nTo that end, the Democratic Party has allowed itself to be captured by progressive elites which has steered the party further to the left, damaging its political viability.\n\nBefore next year’s midterms, Democrats must reorient the party away from the elites’ far-left politics and back to its traditional values. \n\nIf they don’t, then even the chaos Trump is causing with his haphazard economic policies, and constant constitutional overreach won’t be enough to bring voters back to the Democratic Party.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"New California poll underscores how disconnected Democratic elites

Ed Howe of St. Hedwig Church in Logan Square. “It’s about looking past right in front of us to something greater.”\n\nAs Christians prepare to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Sunday, some priests and pastors have identified similarities between the darkness felt when he was crucified on Good Friday and modern-day heaviness. \n\nBut as the Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor at St. Sabina Catholic Church in Auburn Gresham, plans to remind his congregation Sunday, darkness can be followed by light — just as the crucifixion was followed by the resurrection.\n\n“There was that Good Friday that we can’t ignore, where it seemed hopeless and it seemed like the skies were dark, and fear and hopelessness and had paralyzed people, and it looked like it was all over,” Pfleger said. “But you know that was not the end of the story that Sunday came and it changed everything.”\n\nMass federal layoffs, the war in Gaza, an economic downturn sparked by President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, mass deportations and the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion are all examples of the “darkness” weighing on believers, but Pfleger and others are urging them to fight back.\n\n“If we keep our eye just on what we see in the world, we do get overwhelmed,” Pfleger said. “But faith gives you the spiritual vision that’s beyond the world. Faith is what tells you this isn’t the end. Faith is what tells you this doesn’t win. Faith is what tells us that darkness and death don’t have the last word.”\n\nIn his sermon, the Rev. Marshall Hatch at New Mount Pilgrim Church in West Garfield Park is planning to focus on the simple message “do not be afraid.” Hatch acknowledged mass layoffs in the federal government and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s admission that she and others are afraid to criticize Trump, stirring anxiety and fear across the country.\n\nIn that context, he’ll remind parishioners to lean on one another.\n\n“And so I want the congregation to know that even in the midst of it all, you know, we still have each other,” he said. “We have the church. Christ is risen and somehow we’ll get through this together; do not be afraid. God is with us.”\n\nIn the Rev. Michael Nabors’ sermon titled “It’s Just Like the Women Said” at Second Baptist Church in Evanston, he’ll draw parallels between the women who discovered Jesus’ empty tomb and the women who have fought to break barriers in the modern era — specifically, the ones who ran and lost in their bids for the U.S. presidency. Women are under threat of losing their rights, Nabors said, referring to the SAVE Act, a bill that was recently passed by the Republican-controlled House that could make it harder for married women who have changed their name to vote, and the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which protected the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n“I will say if we had heeded Hillary Clinton, if we had heeded Kamala Harris, then it could very well be that we would be on a different road leading to a new and brighter day, just like the resurrection, instead of being on a road into the unknown,” he said.\n\nAt St. Clement Catholic Church in Lincoln Park, parishioners attending the Rev. Brett Williams’ Mass can expect to hear a resounding call to take the joy and energy from Easter Mass and spread that feeling far beyond Sunday.\n\n“It is our hope that we live as Easter people,” Williams said. “That we take the joy of the resurrection into our own personal lives and relationships and families and friends and colleagues, but also that we, in some way, make sure that the good news of Jesus risen from the dead is spread to our community.”\n\nWilliams pointed to the strength and resilience of Pope Francis, who continued his work despite kidney failure and pneumonia that left him hospitalized this year.\n\n“I think his service is inspiring for us Catholic Christians throughout the world that even frail and infirm, he makes an effort to serve. We’ve always [been] called to serve,” Williams said.\n\nFor Pfleger, the main message he wants his parishioners to take with them is simple.\n\n“Decide they’re going to live out of their faith and get up on Monday morning and fight like hell.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/religion/2025/04/18/easter-sermons-chicago-priests-pastors","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/56f1e7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd6%2Fe8%2Fb5db553b49c4b67acc20d1f9a81d%2Feast","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 02:35:54","author":"Adora Namigadde | Wbez,Mary Norkol","authors":["Adora Namigadde | Wbez","Mary Norkol"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.197},{"id":312604584,"title":"Katy Perry gets ready for sci-fi inspired world tour days after controversial trip to space","text":"In less than a year, Katy Perry has released an album, campaigned for Kamala Harris and, just this week, flown to space. As she heads to Mexico City, Mexico, to kick off a world tour on Wednesday (Apr 23), the pop superstar shows no intention of slowing down.\n\n“I’m always open and I say, ‘Why not?’ and ‘Let’s just try,’” she told the Associated Press recently at her Southern California rehearsal space. “The power of your thoughts is so incredible because everything starts with a thought. I had this thought, ‘I want to go on tour.’ And here we are.”\n\nWith that openness to try comes accepting that not every endeavour will be a victory. Her September album, 143, was critically panned, and she was simultaneously criticised for reuniting with embattled producer Dr. Luke.\n\nCelebrities like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski critiqued the spaceflight’s use of resources as superfluous and indulgent. And Harris ultimately lost the November election to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Perry’s longevity and the scale of her fame since her 2008 breakout hit, I Kissed a Girl, are attributable at least in part to her willingness to get back up in the wake of a setback, as she belts in her 2013 empowerment anthem, Roar.\n\n“I can control what I can control,” she said.\n\nThat mantra has been refined over the past 15 years through her practice of transcendental meditation. The meditation technique has been embraced by a handful of celebrities, including – perhaps most zealously – the late David Lynch, whom Perry credits with spreading the practice and its message.\n\n“That changed my life. And I’ve gone on a long inner space journey to untangle some wires, to answer some questions, to become more grounded, to find the power within myself,” she said.\n\nPerry is fascinated by all things spiritual, casually weaving into conversation references to astrology, the enneagram and cardology, which purports to impart mystical insights into an individual’s personality through playing cards. Perry also credits having her daughter, Daisy, with propelling her along a journey of self-discovery and enhancing her “feminine divine.”\n\n“Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she said. “I think I’ve just grown into the strong woman that I’ve always dreamed of and idolised.”\n\nThat journey has informed her approach to music and performing, down to the narrative of her sci-fi-themed Lifetimes Tour. Citing films like Blade Runner and The Fifth Element as visual and thematic inspirations, Perry will play a video game character who faces off against evil forces.\n\n“It’s really about believing in yourself and leading with love. Those are always my messages, no matter how I wrap it or whatever tour I bring. It’s love and empowerment,” she said. “When I can lead by example, it just ripples.”\n\nPerry’s tour of more than 80 performances will primarily be a career-spanning showcase of past hits, but with a dance-infused flair to some of the traditional pop songs. “I tell everybody they have to wear some sensible shoes,” she explained.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since Perry emerged as a pop star, she has made tongue-in-cheek lyricism, in line with her sense of humor, and catchy messages of empowerment a signature of her songs. Critical reception to her more recent albums has been less than enthusiastic, but that hasn't stopped the 40-year-old from going all out for this tour, calling it “Disneyland on wheels.”\n\n“I feel a responsibility to my audience who have really been with me on this ride during this whole lifetime to give them that feeling that they had when they first heard Teenage Dream,\" she said.","summary":"Her global Lifetimes Tour will kick off in Mexico City, Mexico on Apr 23.","url":"https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/katy-perry-sci-fi-tour-463456","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--XXJDxyYh--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/music-katy_perry_56684.jpg?itok=WpOo_ykG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 01:19:39","author":"Cna Lifestyle","authors":["Cna Lifestyle"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.311},{"id":312601060,"title":"Trump infuriates liberals as he shares 'PROOF' deported thug is MS-13 gangster","text":"Donald Trump showed a photograph he offered as 'proof' that deported migrant El Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member. \n\nAbrego Garcia has become a flashpoint for polarized politics, with Republicans labeling him a terrorist who should never have been in the country in the first place.\n\nLiberals, meanwhile, see him as a man both here legally and wrongly deported in their latest outrage toward Trump.\n\nTrump seemed to offer a rebuttal to the left by posting what he said were photos of knuckle tattoos representing MS-13 and belonging to Abrego Garcia on Truth Social Friday night. \n\n'This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such 'a fine and innocent person,'' Trump wrote. \n\nIt features tattoos on his fingers that officials have previously described: a marijuana leaf, a smiley face, a cross, and a skull. 'MS-13' is now spelled across the knuckles in the photo Trump posted. \n\nHowever, those letters and numbers are digitally added on and Pam Bondi made no mention of any tattoos representing the deadly gang in documents accusing Abrego Garcia of being a member.\n\nStill, some have alleged that the tattoos are meant to be code, a marijuana leaf representing the letter M, a smiley face representing the letter S, a cross being a cover up for the number one and a skull meant to be covering up the number three.\n\nTrump sees it as proof that he's found out Abrego Garcia as a member of the infamous gang. \n\n'They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he's got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc.' \n\nAbrego Garcia's lawyers have denied any links to MS-13, the notorious prison gang that Trump insists he is affiliated with, and stated he has no criminal convictions. \n\nDailyMail.com did find Abrego Garcia's wife filled out a petition accusing her husband of domestic violence but never signed or submitted it.\n\nTrump wrote: 'I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' \n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Senator Chris Van Hollen - who visited with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador - and representatives for Abrego Garcia for comment. \n\nThe post came as Trump got a legal victory Friday, with a divided appeals court in Washington halted Judge James Boasberg's contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for the deportation flights to El Salvador.\n\nIt is not a ruling on whether those proceedings should take place but gives the court a chance to hear the Trump administration's appeal against Boasberg's ruling.\n\nVan Hollen met Thursday in El Salvador with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was sent there by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation.\n\nVan Hollen posted a photo of the meeting on X, saying he also called Abrego Garcia's wife 'to pass along his message of love.' \n\nThe lawmaker did not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia, whose attorneys are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.\n\nA spokesman for the Trump administration remained on message, claiming Van Hollen was worried more about a 'terrorist' illegal migrant than his own constituents.\n\n'Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist. It is truly disgusting. President Trump will continue to stand on the side of law-abiding Americans,' Kush Desai told DailyMail.com\n\nEl Salvador´s Presidnet Nayib Bukele posted images of the meeting minutes before Van Hollen shared his post and took a more confrontational approach, decrying beliefs that Abrego Garcia was suffering. \n\nBukele wrote: 'Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the `death camps´ & 'torture,' now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!'\n\nThe tweet ended with emojis of the U.S. and El Salvador flags, with a handshake emoji between them. A spokeswoman for El Salvador´s presidency said she had no further information. \n\nThe meeting came hours after Van Hollen said he was denied entry into an high-security El Salvador prison Thursday while he was trying to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being and push for his release.\n\nThe Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about two miles from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, even as they let other cars go on.\n\n'They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,' Van Hollen said. \n\nAbrego Garcia entered the US illegally in 2011. A judge blocked his return to El Salvador in 2019, citing the fact that gangsters were after him, but said he could be deported elsewhere. \n\nIn court filings this week, the Trump administration said he was deported to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court has since ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US. \n\nLate Thursday, a three-judge panel from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to suspend a judge's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with the court's instruction to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. \n\nThe Trump administration´s claims that it can't do anything to free Garcia from an El Salvador prison or return him to the US 'should be shocking to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,' the court said Thursday in a blistering order that ratchets up the escalating conflict between the government's executive and judicial branches. \n\nJudge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, said: 'It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all.' \n\nHe added that he and his two colleagues 'cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.'\n\nTrump officials insist Garcia is not an innocent American, as claimed. They say he's an MS-13 gangster who deserves to be sent back to El Salvador. \n\nAdditionally, a 2021 petition for protection from domestic violence filled out by Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, which was obtained first by DailyMail.com, states that the alleged MS-13 member beat his wife multiple times over the years. \n\nShe told The Post she was 'acting out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar … in case things escalated' after being abused 'in a previous relationship.'\n\n'Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling,' she added.\n\n'Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect.'\n\nDemocrats, furious about his deportation, are up in arms, with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen traveling in an attempt to get answers.\n\nDetermined to save Garcia, he flew to El Salvador in an effort to get him out of jail and back in America. \n\nBut when he showed up asking for a meeting, he was denied. \n\nHe is now being mocked by Republicans and Conservative Americans, including the mother of a woman who was murdered by an illegal migrant. \n\n'Senator Van Hollen has done more to bring a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker and illegal alien back to Maryland than he has to help keep his American constituents safe or advocate for the victims of these vicious gangs like MS-13. \n\n'While Senator Van Hollen and the mainstream media peddle a sob story about a brutal MS-13 gang member, Secretary Noem stands with the victims of illegal alien crime, like Maryland mom Rachel Morin. \n\n'We hear far too much about the gang members and criminals sob stories and not enough about their victims,' the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on X. \n\nThe efforts by Van Hollen have also been criticized by Morin's mother Patty who spoke about the lack of any correspondence from state officials when her daughter was murdered. \n\nSpeaking on Fox News with anchor Sean Hannity, she said: 'I'm very angry, I'm outraged. I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time.\n\n'He did not call our family, he did not give condolences. There was no action [from] the Democratic party in anyway. \n\n'From Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, anyone here in Maryland, none of the Senators did anything to help search for the murderer of my daughter.'\n\nRachel Morin's illegal immigrant killer Victor Martinez-Hernandez was found guilty of first degree murder, first degree rape and kidnapping on Monday - and is now awaiting sentencing. \n\nAbrego Garcia, who is a legal resident, arrived at the notorious supermax prison CECOT in El Salvador March 15 on one of three planes from the US.\n\nHe first entered the U.S. in 2011 but was granted permission to stay by a judge in 2019. He later settled down in Maryland and has an American wife and son.\n\nThe Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia on March 15 after files indicated that he had connections with MS-13, a vicious Salvadorian-American gang.\n\nHis wife and lawyer deny his gang affiliation and have sued the administration for improperly removing him from the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration initially said his removal was a mistake. The Supreme Court then ordered the facilitation of his return.\n\nBut the Trump administration is standing firm. \n\nIn the Oval Office on Monday, Trump and Bukele led a united defense of their actions in the case of Abrego Garcia.\n\nBukele argued he couldn't return, saying: 'How can I return him to the United States?\n\n'I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it.\n\n'The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him to the United States.'\n\nTrump supported Bukele's claim and went further, lobbying the El Salvadorian leader to take more migrants and build more prisons hold them.\n\n'I just asked the president, you know, it's this massive complex that he built, a jail complex. I said, 'Can you build some more of them, please?'' Trump said.","summary":"Donald Trump showed a photograph he offered as 'proof' that deported migrant El Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14626985/Trump-infuriates-liberals-shares-PROOF-thug-MS-13-gangster.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/02/97449193-0-image-a-41_1745024823760.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/16/1734277532721528733/1024x576_MP4_1734277532721528733.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-19 01:19:21","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:50 BST, 19 April 2025 |Updated:01:51 BST, 19 April 2025 \n\nDrew Carey sparked up romance speculation when he stepped out with OnlyFans model Niki Skyler this week to grab lunch in Los Angeles.\nThe Price Is Right host, 66 — who revealed back in February that he was still not dating five years after his ex-fiancée's murder — had kept it casual for the recent outing at Swingers Diner with Skyler, 37.\nNiki — who was named Penthouse Pet of the Month back in 2017 — also opted for comfort in a black tank top and baggy pants.\nThe pair spending time together fueled relationship rumors and a source clarified to DailyMail.com that they are only good pals.\nThe insider explained that the model is 'just a friend. They've been friends for about a decade.'\nAfter enjoying a meal, the two were seen exiting the restaurant with Carey sporting a blue button up as well as a pair of dark navy trousers.\n\nDrew Carey, 66, sparked up romance speculation when he stepped out with OnlyFans model Niki Skyler, 37, this week to grab lunch in Los Angeles; seen in 2024 in West Hollywood \n\nNiki — who was named Penthouse Pet of the Month back in 2017 — also opted for comfort in a black tank top and baggy pants\nThe daytime excursion came just two months after Drew shared that he is still not dating after his former fiancee Amie Harwick was murdered in 2020 by ex-boyfriend Gareth Pursehouse. \nPursehouse had pled not guilty but in 2023 he was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. \n\n Drew Carey, 66, reveals he is STILL not dating after ex killed \nCarey and Harwick became engaged in 2018 but called it quits later that same year. \nDuring an interview with Us Weekly in February, the TV personality got candid about her tragic death and admitted to the outlet, 'It destroyed me for a while. I still don't date. \n'I have women I go out with and spend time with, but it's all platonic, and I don't care about anything else. Amie's death really affected everything.' \nHe also expressed, 'I think about her every day. It's such a loss. Her death still affects me and my ideas about relationships and intimacy. \n'It was all damaged by first our breakup, and then, the day before she died, when she texted me. It had been a really bad breakup for both of us, but a necessary one. I couldn't think about her or see a picture of her.' \nThe day before her passing, Carey recalled receiving a message from Amie who brought up the topic of forgiveness and asked to meet up. \n\nThe insider explained that the model is 'just a friend. They've been friends for about a decade'\n\nThe daytime excursion came just two months after Drew shared that he is still not dating after his former fiancee Amie Harwick was murdered in 2020 by ex-boyfriend Gareth Pursehouse; seen with Harwick in 2017 in Hollywood \n\nHe also expressed, 'I think about her every day. It's such a loss. Her death still affects me and my ideas about relationships and intimacy'; seen in 2023 in L.A. \n'I texted her that I loved her and that I'd see her the next week,' the TV host said.\n'I heard from one of her friends that she shed tears about my saying that I loved her still. Which I did. I loved her madly even though we had broken up.'\nDrew further reflected on the people in his life and stated, 'I have this great female friend group that I cherish, and I'm godfather to several sets of kids from the group.\n'We hang out together, went on vacation together and we talk to each other every day. That's the biggest blessing in my life right now.' \nWhen her murderer was sentenced to life in prison, Carey opened up to People about finally having closure. \n'I can barely remember the guy's name — that's how much I've put him out of my life — but ever since the final sentencing, it feels like we've all let out a breath and are able to finally move on.' \nHe continued, 'The whole process is over now, and there's nothing else to be done and nothing else to worry about. … Just speaking just for myself, it's been quite a load off.' \nDrew also shared that following her passing, he still has photos of Harwick inside of his house. \n\nDrew further reflected on the people in his life and stated, 'I have this great female friend group that I cherish, and I'm godfather to several sets of kids from the group'; Niki Skyler seen above \n'She's with me always. A lot of times I'll feel like I'll be thinking things through, and it's almost like I can hear her voice saying, \"Well, really, it's because of this and that.\" It's really nice, honestly.' \nCarey is known for hosting the game show The Price Is Right since 2007 after he took over for Bob Barker. \nIn February, the beloved series celebrated its 10,000 episode. \nWhen he first became host of the show, Drew told Us Weekly, 'I mainly didn't want to get the show canceled or be responsible for ruining such an institution. \n\nCarey is known for hosting the game show The Price Is Right since 2007 after he took over for Bob Barker. In February, the beloved series celebrated its 10,000 episode (seen above) \n'Once I got comfortable after a couple of years, it felt like it was more my show instead of me just being a steward of somebody else's. And now I just want to do it forever, as long as I'm mentally and physically able to show up. \nHe further gushed, 'It's such a fun thing! The money's nice, but it's just a cool job. I don't have to go to work, I get to go to work! It's a privilege to be here, an honor. So we'll see how long I hold up.' \nIn regards to his love for the game show and the job, the star explained, 'I'm playing games all day! There are more than 70 different contests on the show, so I'm never bored. \n'It's like game night at home: What are we going to play tonight? Is it going to be Scrabble or Monopoly or Cards Against Humanity? I'm also really interested in how people arrive at decisions under pressure...' \nOnlyFansLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe TRUTH about Drew Carey, 66, and OnlyFans model Niki Skyler, 37, after flirty lunch date\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 26\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

two months after his McDonald's collaboration.\nThe TV personality dipped her toes into the fast food business shortly after the rapper released his personalised menu in February. \nStormzy's McDonald's collaboration, called The Stormzy Meal, includes nine chicken nuggets, fries, BBQ dips, a Sprite Zero, and an Oreo McFlurry or apple pie.\nMeanwhile, Maya's Uber menu includes a burger with watermelon jam, which she praises for its inflammatory benefits.\nThe menu also offers ackee and saltfish, a staple Jamaican breakfast which she says will revive fans due to it being rich in vitamins A and C.\nA griddled chicken salad and coffee-infused sticky toffee pudding are also up for grabs. \nMaya said: 'I rarely get time off, but when I do, I love to simply sit back on the sofa, indulging in a little self-care and devouring a takeaway - and nothing helps me bounce back from a late one like it.\n\nMaya completed her beach look with a camouflage Von Dutch baseball cap and dainty gold hoop earrings\n\nLetting her dark curls tumble freely over her shoulders, she embraced a natural glow by going makeup-free for the sunny outing\n\nShe also captured a serene moment as she cooled off in the crystal-clear sea, soaking up the idyllic surroundings\n\nMaya captioned the stunning snaps with: 'Every other day another time zone'\n\nMaya went her separate ways with Stormzy last year and she has since been linked to Ruben Dias (pictured in December) \n'That's why I'm happy to be teaming up with Uber Eats to bring my Revive And Thrive menu to life.\n'Featuring classics that I always crave, like mac 'n' cheese and sticky toffee pudding to ackee and saltfish, these dishes are packed with flavour - and a few secret ingredients that I swear by to help me get back on form.'\nMaya went her separate ways with Stormzy last year and she has since been linked to Ruben Dias. \nMaya is reportedly being followed on Instagram by Ruben's mother, prompting speculation over a relationship between the Love Island host and the Manchester City star.\nDuring the international break, Maya flew to Lisbon to watch Ruben, 27, play for the Portuguese national team.\nShe was pictured in the stands at the José Alvalade Stadium to witness Portugal's 5-2 victory over Denmark in the second leg of their Nations League quarter-final.\nThe presenter was seen with a friend and glasses of wine in a VIP hospitality box - usually reserved for friends and family of players.\nMaya then posted a picture on social media of the two celebrating together at their romantic fireside retreat at 3:30am the following morning.\nThe snap is believed to have been taken at the footballer's home in the Cascais region of Portugal, with a vast swimming pool and fire pit glimpsed in the picture.\nThailandMaya Jama\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMaya Jama flaunts her jaw-dropping figure in a skimpy black bikini as she hits the beach during sun-soaked Thailand getaway\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
