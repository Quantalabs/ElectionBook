Phil Murphy by four points in 2021, and Trump by three points last year. \n\nOn Tuesday, Passaic went for Sherrill by 15 points.\n\nIn New Jersey municipalities that are more than 60% Hispanic, Sherrill completely wiped out the gains Trump made in 2024 — and in many cases, built on Murphy’s margin in 2021.\n\n“In this area, there is no fault to be found in the Ciattarelli campaign,” said Alex Wilkes, a New Jersey-based GOP consultant who worked for Ciattarelli’s 2021 gubernatorial bid.\n\n“This was a campaign that went into large Hispanic neighborhoods, made partnerships, built real relationships over the last four years. It clearly just didn’t translate on Election Day.”\n\nProminent Hispanic and Latino Republicans warned that future election days won’t go much better for the GOP if things don’t change. \n\n“Hispanics that helped deliver a tremendous victory to President Trump are slipping away, right under our own watch,” Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) observed on X.\n\n“Last night, in New Jersey and Virginia, Hispanics swung more than 25 points to the LEFT. Those states are swing states only if you bring Hispanics to the GOP.”\n\nFormer Rep. Mayra Flores (R-Texas) was more dramatic, warning that without investing in the Hispanic community, “the future of the Republican Party is at risk.”\n\nNew Jersey-based GOP strategist Jeannate Hoffman suggested that Ciattarelli faced one major obstacle he didn’t four years ago: With Democrats the out-party in Washington and Trump off the ballot, their voters were more fired up to turn out and make a statement about the GOP administration’s actions. \n\n“Trump wasn’t at the top of the ticket,” Hoffman pointed out. “Certainly, now, the immigration policies could be having a negative effect when we’re talking about ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] raids on a lot of those communities.”\n\nDan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Farleigh Dickinson University and executive director of the FDU Poll, argued it was too early to tell whether the leftward shift among Hispanics was a blip or a sign of a more substantial pendulum swing. \n\n“My sense is, what’s going on is much more about turnout than it is about persuasion, because the turnout in those areas was severely depressed in both ’21 and ’24,” he said. “I’m not sure there’s much of any persuasion going on.”\n\nCassino added that Trump is a figure who drives “thermostatic” shifts in public opinion, meaning “whenever the government goes one way, the public goes the other.”\n\n“I think that’s what we saw [Tuesday night],” he added.","summary":"Republican gains with New Jersey Latino and Hispanic voters over recent years seemingly evaporated in the gubernatorial race, helping propel Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill to Drumthwacket, in a major warning sign for the GOP.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/05/us-news/nj-hispanic-latino-voters-swung-sharply-to-mikie-sherrill-wiping-out-2024-gop-gains-data-shows/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-18p36xxvj-1762382618927.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1762364633&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/roNVaHl9-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-05 23:54:49","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":376166648,"title":"91 ‘Coordinated’ Indictments to Trump’s 3. Which Is Worse?","text":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. There’s been a lot of recent controversy over the indictments of former national security adviser John Bolton, former FBI Director James Comey, and now New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nAnd people are arguing that President Donald Trump had promised not to have a so-called revenge tour and use the law, in a weaponized fashion, against his political enemies, given what they did to him. And now he’s doing it.\n\nI think it’s time to pause.\n\nFirst, there’s a question of magnitude. Donald Trump was indicted 91 times in four different jurisdictions, local, county, federal. Those were coordinated.\n\nFulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis’ main prosecutor, Nathan Wade, met with the White House counsel just three days after Donald Trump announced his 2020, Nov. 15, reelection bid. That same day, Jack Smith was appointed by Merrick Garland, the Biden Justice Department attorney general, to be special counsel, to go after Donald Trump at the federal level. That same day, Matthew Colangelo, who had come from the Letitia James state prosecution of Donald Trump, resigned his blue-chip job—No. 3 in the DOJ—to go to work for whom? Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nAnd that was 91 indictments. So far, we’ve only seen three key people indicted. In addition to that, we’re not even talking about the SWAT raid on Donald Trump’s home or the effort to get 25 states to de-ballot him.\n\nI haven’t seen Donald Trump saying to red state governors, “We’ve gotta get California Gov. Gavin Newsom off the ballot. He’s dangerous.” Or, “We’ve gotta make sure former Vice President Kamala Harris is not on that ballot.” Or, “You know, we found some evidence about former President Joe Biden. Let’s raid his home.” That hasn’t happened.\n\nSo, we have to keep some fair sense of magnitude. Indicting three people doesn’t compare to what they did.\n\nThen there’s the question of high-profile people. Do prosecutors tend to select high-profile people more than the average Joe? I know that seems counterintuitive. We always think wealthy people have privilege. But sometimes, prosecutors think, “If I take this person down or I target them, then it will send a message to encourage the others.”\n\nLook at Patrick Fitzgerald. Why did he go after Scooter Libby? Remember that case? He said Scooter Libby had unlawfully disclosed the secret status of Valerie Plame, the CIA operative. But he knew at the time that Colin Powell, his own deputy—Colin Powell’s own deputy, Richard Armitage—had first done that. But he wanted to go after Scooter Libby to point out that I can take down anybody. Was it wrong? Yes. But that’s what prosecutors do. I’m not trying to excuse it.\n\nWhy did James Comey—remember when he was in the DOJ? He went after Martha Stewart, put her in jail for insider stock trading. But it was kind of a minor—it was very minor compared to what the Pelosis have done. But he wanted to take down Martha Stewart.\n\nDonald Trump’s not doing that. But what they’re doing is they’re saying, if a national security adviser like John Bolton transmitted classified files and was exempt, then anybody can do it. If Letitia James is the attorney general of New York and she lies about her mortgage circumstances or her tax circumstances, or her primary residence, then anybody can do it. So, it’s logical, you go after people both wrongly and rightly.\n\nBut more importantly, which is the real sin? Under the Biden administration, they knew that John Bolton had transmitted—they had information that a foreign intelligence source had interrupted or intercepted his own communication. And he was transmitting, allegedly, classified materials to his wife and daughter. They didn’t do anything. They didn’t do anything because he was useful. He was writing a biography that would embarrass Trump during the Biden/Trump election. Which is the greater sin? To let felonious behavior go unaudited, unaddressed, or to address it?\n\nMaybe you can say it’s selective, but a jury will find that out. At least you’re not giving exemptions and amnesty to people who have helped you.\n\nWhy did they not prosecute former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former National Intelligence Director James Clapper? They, all three, had one thing in common. They all lied, either to federal investigators or under oath to Congress. Why didn’t the Biden team go after them? Because they were all useful to them.\n\nClapper and Brennan were on MSNBC and CNN, and night after night, attacking Trump. Andrew McCabe was on occasion. So, they felt, we’re going to excuse their sins, their illegalities—allegedly—because they’re useful.\n\nSo, Trump comes in, and the DOJ under Attorney General Pam Bondi says they all have criminal exposure. And I’m going to enforce the law. You can call it selective, but I would rather see somebody enforce the law than give an exemption for political purposes. But we don’t talk about that.\n\nThere is a lawfare. And the lawfare is not just prosecuting people in a political fashion, but more importantly, not prosecuting them, giving them exemptions.\n\nThere’s another consideration. Whether we like it or not, almost all of these high-profile cases occur in the East Coast corridor, from the financial capital of New York to the nation’s political capital in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs we saw with the E. Jean Carroll case and Judge Lewis Kaplan, as we saw with the Letitia James case and Judge Arthur Engoron, as we saw with the Alvin Bragg case and Judge Juan Merchan, and as we saw with the Fani Willis case and the Georgia judge—that was an exception—but the judiciary is more or less to the left, and especially juries and judges in Washington, D.C., and in New York.\n\nAnd the chances are that most of these cases, if they come to trial—and remember, these are not, the prosecution does not hinge on what Pam Bondi says. It’s what a grand jury of one’s peers decides. John Bolton, for example, was indicted by a grand jury. So was James Comey. And these are in blue jurisdictions. All down the East Coast, these jurisdictions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it’s going to be much more difficult for the Trump Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, to find a Clapper or a Brennan or a Bolton guilty in a blue jurisdiction, where you’re going to have juries that are, for the most part, decidedly anti-Trump. Much more difficult.\n\nSo, they’re gonna have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a far greater degree than was true of Donald Trump. Donald Trump came in as a conservative, and in an era of rampant Trump hatred and Trump Derangement Syndrome, and he had to face predominantly left-wing grand juries, left-wing juries, and left-wing judges.\n\nSo, if Donald Trump is accused of waging lawfare, there’s going to be a natural check on that. And that check is that he is going into hostile territory. He, I’m personifying it, but his attorney general will be going into areas that are not sympathetic to the prosecution but will be sympathetic to the opponents of Donald Trump.\n\nEditor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson.

These gains have reignited Democratic optimism ahead of the 2026 midterms, as the party pushes to reclaim control of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nSilver, in his Silver Bulletin newsletter, lamented on polls being “not great,” particularly in New Jersey. A flurry of them released before Election Day showed a tight race between Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Real Clear Politics’ aggregate gave Sherrill only a 3-point advantage.\n\nBut Sherrill ended up winning by a much larger margin. She held a 13-point lead over Ciattarelli with 95 percent of the vote in, meaning she performed 10 points stronger than polls predicted. She also outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the state. In November 2024, Harris only carried New Jersey by about 6 points in the presidential election—a disappointing result compared to past Oval Office candidates.\n\nSilver described that as a “huge miss,” noting that it was “more than twice as large as the overestimation of Hillary Clinton in 2016.”\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill addresses the crowd during her election night watch party at the Hilton East Brunswick Hotel on Tuesday in East Brunswick, New Jersey. (Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images)\n\n“There’s also, just perhaps, a question of whether the polls are actually overestimating Trump after three presidential elections in a row where they lowballed him,” Silver wrote.\n\nHe added that Democrats have a “considerable upside” in the midterms, as they prevailed with “different sorts of Democrats in different sorts of elections all performing strongly.”\n\nTrump’s 2016 victory upended political polling, as surveys heading into Election Day gave former Secretary of State Clinton a comfortable lead. Polls also narrowly overestimated Democrats in 2020 and 2024. Last year, polls gave Harris only a narrow popular vote lead; Real Clear Politics gave her a 0.8-point edge. Trump ended up winning by 1.5 points.\n\nPolitical analysts have pointed to theories including “shy” Trump voters, as well as the president’s ability to turn out lower- propensity voters, to explain the discrepancies. Silver wrote that Democrats’ strength among highly educated voters, who are generally more likely to vote, could be beneficial in off-year elections.\n\nPolls were closer in Virginia, where Democratic former U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger easily defeated GOP Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears. Real Clear Politics gave Spanberger a 10-point lead. She is up nearly 15 points with 96 percent of the vote counted.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nJournalist Dave Weigel, on X: “Polls underestimated Mikie Sherrill’s strength in #NJGov – and some Dems fretted it was closer after [Governor Phil] Murphy’s 2021 near-death experience. Also, decades since a Dem replaced a two-term Dem. But she’s ending up w biggest Dem margin in 24 years, bigger than Murphy ’17.”\n\nLakshya Jain of SplitTicket, on X: “A lot of forecasters and pundits went out on a limb to say that Mikie Sherrill struggling was proof of moderates flopping. Not sure those takes have aged particularly well — it was weak reasoning then and looks worse now.”\n\nSherrill, during her victory speech: “Here in New Jersey, we know that this nation has not ever been, nor will it ever be, ruled by kings. We take oaths to a Constitution, not a king. We’ve chosen liberty, the very foundation of democracy, and we’ve chosen prosperity necessary to create opportunity for all.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nEvery seat in the House of Representatives and one-third of Senate seats are up for reelection. Democrats have expressed optimism about their chances, particularly after the party’s victories on Tuesday, but polls suggest competitive races.","summary":"Silver lamented that polls were &quot;not great&quot; ahead of Democrats&#039; election sweep on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silver-says-polls-may-be-overestimating-trump-after-huge-miss-11000128","image":"https://www.newsweek.com/Newsweek_logo_social.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 22:51:13","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":376166646,"title":"Election Results Leave GOP Glum, Democrats Giddy","text":"Democrats on Tuesday night swept election races in New Jersey, New York City, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, leaving Republicans saying they weren’t surprised and Democrats gloating on Wednesday. \n\nIn New Jersey, Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., triumphed over former New Jersey General Assembly member Jack Ciattarelli, cementing four more years of Democrat control over the executive branch of the Garden State. \n\nIn Pennsylvania, all three Democrat justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court won additional terms in office with potential consequences about how late ballots and redistricting are decided in the future. \n\nDemocrats wrestled back control of the Virginia governor’s mansion after four years of Republican rule. Virginia voters elected former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger to succeed GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin, while Jay Jones defeated incumbent Republican Jason Miyares to become the next attorney general of Virginia. Jones was widely seen as the underdog after text messages from 2022 were leaked in which he fantasized about killing a Republican legislator and his children, but he still won.\n\nAnd in New York City, Zohran Mamdani bested former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa in a three-way race for mayor. \n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, D-Wyo., told The Daily Signal that she was not shocked by the outcomes of the elections.\n\n“Well, these were solidly Democrat states and cities, where [then-Vice President] Kamala Harris secured strong victories in 2024, so frankly, last night’s results came as no surprise to me,” Lummis said, adding that she worried more about the effects of the federal government shutdown on the American people.\n\n“What concerns me now is whether my colleagues across the aisle will finally abandon the reckless strategy of holding our government hostage to energize their progressive base. [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.] and congressional Democrats made a calculated decision that shutting down the federal government and inflicting real hardship on American families was an acceptable price to pay for political points,” the Wyoming lawmaker said.\n\n“The result is that Mamdani is now the leader of their party, and Democrats are going to have to live with that decision,” she concluded.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., concurred with Lummis about the sorts of states Democrats won in last night.\n\n“Blue states went for blue candidates,” he told The Daily Signal before adding, “This includes radical socialist Zohran Mamdani, who is going to deeply damage New York City, and Jay Jones as Virginia’s attorney general, who fantasizes about the murder of Republicans and their children.” \n\n“Democrats have picked their champions—and the rest of America is watching,” Lee said.\n\nSen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., also emphasized the ideological component of the electoral results in a comment to The Daily Signal.\n\n“It shows the Democratic Party is only moving farther and farther to the left. Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, is now the mayor of our largest city, and in Virginia, Jay Jones won his election to be attorney general despite his heinous comments fantasizing about the death of the former speaker of the Virginia state House [of Delegates] and his children,” Schmitt said.\n\n“The bottom line is—the Democrats have not hit rock bottom yet, but every day they barrel closer and closer,” he said.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, deputy secretary of the Senate Democratic Caucus, attributed the Democrat wins to the affordability crisis.\n\n“I can save you a dozen hours of podcast listening: People are pissed about high prices and corruption,” Schatz posted on X.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., meanwhile, emphasized the populist component of the elections, writing on the social media platform X, “Populist Dems won. Moderate Dems won. We won in blue states. We won in purple states,” adding: “Maybe the take is that (a) people think [President Donald] Trump is out of control; and (b) people like Dems when we’re taking a stand and fighting for what we believe in—as we have been for the last month.”","summary":"Democrats on Tuesday night swept election races in New Jersey, New York City, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, leaving Republicans saying they weren&#8217;t surprised and Democrats gloating...

Gavin Newsom, voters have allowed the all-Democrat legislature to gerrymander even more, this time trying to take another five seats away from the Republicans.\n\nThat would mean 40% of the population is represented by only four seats in the House, or less than 10% of the state’s delegation.\n\nSuch is democracy in leftist California.\n\nBut, in fact, the state, only hours after the vote became final, got sued over the “unconstitutional” plan.\n\nA report at the Washington Examiner said, “Republicans claim in a lawsuit that the new map that will be enacted as a result of Proposition 50, giving Democrats five more favorable congressional districts, is unconstitutional. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by the Dhillon Law Group on behalf of the California GOP.

New Yorkers handed Gotham to the Joker, the man with a smile painted on his face married to ideologies of destruction and chaos. New Jersey and Virginia gave governorships to, as The Daily Signal’s Tony Kinnett described, two “Karens”—two shrill liberals who dressed up as moderates eager to force-feed males into girls’ locker rooms and playing fields. And finally, Californians voted to strip Republican voters of nearly all congressional representation.And most sickening of all, Democrats demonstrated, with the election of the despicable Jay Jones in Virginia, their full embrace of political violence. The night’s biggest losers were those who held to the mistaken belief—even after watching all the left-wing celebration over the execution of Charlie Kirk—that a majority of Democrats don’t wish them harm.\n\nTell me, how do you reach across the aisle with people who want to see you dead and your children dead in your spouse’s arms? How do you break bread with people who can know full well Jones’ deadly desires and go, “I’m fine with that, I’ll vote for him for attorney general”?\n\nThat makes for a tough pill for us to digest. But all is not lost.\n\nBlue People in Blue States Are Going to Do Blue Things\n\nFirst, as bad as the night was for Republicans, the reality is that blue people in blue states simply did blue things. Sure, Virginians are tossing way the gains made under Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin like the Washington Commanders tossed away their football season. But thanks to the massive growth of Northern Virginia—a population grown fat on federal government spending—the Old Dominion is basically a blue enclave. As a Daily Signal colleague remarked, Virginia might as well recede itself back to Washington, D.C.Blue is going to do what it’s going to do and did so last night. That’s all. Red states and Republicans now understand, if they didn’t already, that they must put on their big boy pants and, to borrow a phrase, “Fight! Fight! Fight!”\n\nDemocrats Are Setting Themselves Up for a Colossal 2028 Fail\n\nWho were the big winners last night? Well, Karl Marx and the “Globalize the Intifada” crowd, you might grumble. But in election terms, it was California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has seen her Democrat Socialists of America become the straw that stirs the Democratic Party’s drink. (That drink being Jim Jones’ Kool-Aid, as New Yorkers will soon find out.)\n\nThere is no way Newsom, with his ego and coiffed hair, is not seeing yesterday’s victory of Proposition 50—the measure he pushed to redistrict the state to reduce California’s GOP representation in Congress by five seats—as a sign from God Himself he’s destined for the Oval Office.And there is no way AOC doesn’t see the vote in New York for Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani as a mandate from Marx himself that the time has come for an avowed socialist … in the form of a former bartender, perhaps … to head the ticket and damn the Democratic National Committee if it gets in the way again.\n\nRegardless of who crowds the Democrat field for president in 2028, it’s going to come down to Newsom and AOC or a similar AOC-backed Mamdani-type radical. But let’s stick with AOC for simplicity. Standing next to Newsom on a debate stage, she is going to look small—not just physically, but intellectually. He’s going to bake her like a California pizza.And after suffering the humiliations of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris failing in their runs for the presidency, the misogynistic party that wants men in girls sports is going to side with the slick, rich, straight, white frat boy Newsom.\n\nWhile AOC will be carrying with her into the primary all the baggage of the disaster Mamdani will bring New York, and that will help the California governor, Newsom will be burdened with every ounce of the Mamdani disaster in the general election, along with his record of destruction of the once-Golden State.\n\nMost critically, the Democrat nominee for president in 2028 will carry the anti-American spirit of the Democratic Party and Democratic Socialists just as the entire country is chanting “USA! USA! USA!” thanks to its hosting of the Olympics. (That’s one reason Bill Clinton breezed to re-election in 1996.)\n\nThe hubris of Tuesday night’s elections erases the lessons the Democrats should have learned from 2024 and guarantees a good election night in 2028. Call JD Vance “Mr. 48.”\n\nPolitics Is Downstream From Culture … and the Culture Is Coming Clean\n\nFinally, take great heart in this fact: We are winning the culture war, and the politics will eventually reflect that as sure as Christmas follows Thanksgiving. Look at the countless high school and college students who are embracing the vision and passion of Charlie Kirk. Look at the religious revival among the young. Look at the collapse of the woke; of diversity, equity, and inclusion; of cancel culture; even of the transgenderism fad. Look at how the legacy news media, rigged social media platforms, and leftist entertainment are crumbling.Take the news from just the past couple days:\n\nTMZ reporting that new CBS News boss Bari Weiss is aiming to poach Fox News of some of its conservative talent.The box office failure of Trump-hater Bruce Springsteen’s movie “Deliver Me from Nowhere” and Hollywood as a whole having its worst October in 27 years.\n\nThe birth of Elon Musk’s Grokipedia, a powerful new competitor to Wikipedia, but without the woke, left-wing bias.\n\nAnd the death of Teen Vogue. The teen magazine was at the cutting edge of indoctrinating the young and vulnerable into LGBTQ ideology and into the cult of abortion. Teen Vogue is no more. Traditional concepts of womanhood are rapidly becoming in vogue once again instead.\n\nA Bump Along the Highway\n\nSo, while it’s tempting to play the blues after Tuesday, there is reason to be whistling a happy tune.

Democratic candidates won the Virginia governor’s race by around 15 points, the New Jersey gubernatorial election by 13, and Georgia’s statewide public commissioner elections by more than 25 points. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Supreme Court justices retained their seats in a landslide.\nAll these results represent huge improvements on the Democratic Party’s showing just one year ago. Kamala Harris won Virginia and New Jersey by just 6 points, while losing Pennsylvania and Georgia by about 2. \nPolls had anticipated Democratic victories in Tuesday’s major gubernatorial races. But they drastically underestimated the scale of the Democrats’ success. The party appears to have both engineered exceptionally high turnout among its base for off-year elections — and won a significant number of swing voters. Indeed, Tuesday’s blue tide rose high enough to lift even the Democrats’ leakiest boats: In Virginia, Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones managed to secure a comfortable victory, despite having wished for the death of Republican children in leaked text messages.\nTuesday’s results will directly undermine the Republican Party’s broader political project in various ways. For example, Virginia Democrats are now likely to draw a new congressional map that’s less favorable to GOP candidates.\nBut to many Republicans, this year’s elections are most alarming for what they may tell us about their party’s future. Put simply, the results suggest that the GOP has become perilously reliant on voters who will only turn out for President Donald Trump — a man who will (almost certainly) never be on the ballot again. \nThe GOP majority hinges on voters who aren’t that into politics\nOver the past 10 years, Trump has reshaped the Republican coalition. Between 2012 and 2024, the GOP gained 6 points of vote share with non-college-educated voters while losing 2 points with college grads. \nBut Trump did not merely build a less educated Republican coalition — he also crafted a less politically engaged one. During his time at the helm of the GOP, Americans began polarizing on the basis of their political engagement — by how often they tended to vote and how important politics is to their identity. Highly politically engaged Americans moved left, while the disengaged moved right. \nAt first glance, this might look like a bad trade for Republicans. All else equal, you’d rather have the voters who reliably show up at the polls (hence why politicians have historically catered to retirees with lots of free time on election days). But Trump’s realignment worked out well enough for his party — because there are a lot of politically disengaged, working-class people in swing states. And in presidential years, Trump’s personal appeal was sufficient to mobilize them in great numbers. \nYet there had been a catch. Although Trump’s GOP has held its own in presidential races, they’ve tended to disappoint in less high-profile election years. Democrats dominated the 2018 midterms and did unusually well for an in-power party in the 2022 elections. In general, it appears that Democrats now have an advantage in low-turnout elections, a reversal of the long-term historical norm. \nTaken together, winning two out of three presidential races — at the cost of doing poorly in off-year special elections and some midterms — isn’t a bad deal. The worry for Republicans, however, is about whether the upside of this bargain will end with Trump’s political career.\nBarring a constitutional change (or crisis), Trump will never be the GOP’s presidential nominee again. Perhaps the biggest question in American politics is: What happens to the Trump-era realignment, once Republicans nominate someone else?\nThe nightmare scenario for the GOP is that college-educated Never Trumpers will remain solid Democrats — while less engaged, working-class Trump voters will slink back into political apathy. \nTuesday’s results make that future look a bit more plausible. In Virginia and New Jersey, Democrats dominated in highly educated suburbs that were once highly competitive. Meanwhile, Republican turnout in those states was dismal, at least relative to Democrats’ showing. After examining Tuesday night’s returns, the conservative commentator Erick Erickson dejectedly declared, “Trump cannot turn out the vote unless he is on the ballot, and that is never happening again.”\nIn many respects, the GOP has been going out of its way to reinforce the leftward shift of highly educated, politically engaged voters. Vice President JD Vance, Trump’s heir apparent, has prioritized defending his party’s young neo-Nazis over making Trumpism more palatable to cosmopolitan college grads. Meanwhile, the president himself has been deliberately increasing consumer prices, prosecuting his enemies, trying to deplatform his critics, desecrating his office, and engaging in blatant corruption. \nDemocrats shouldn’t plan their 2028 victory parties just yet\nAll this said, the outcomes of off-year gubernatorial elections are not a reliable guide to future political developments. A lot can happen between now and the midterms (let alone, between now and 2028). \nFurther — precisely because Democrats now have an advantage in lower turnout elections — Tuesday’s events might paint a misleadingly favorable picture of the party’s long-term prospects. When Democrats dominated 2023’s special elections, many in the party concluded that it was on track to beat Trump the following year. But this proved to be a mistake. The subset of voters who bothered showing up for off-year elections were simply much more Democratic than the electorate as a whole.\nThis same pattern could play out again. It’s possible that the GOP’s most disengaged supporters will only turn out for Trump. But an equally valid hypothesis is that they will only turn out for presidential elections — in which they will vote for any MAGA nominee on the ballot. Until Republicans nominate someone not named Donald Trump, we simply cannot know.\nWhat’s more, the Republican coalition remains better matched to America’s electoral geography. The median US state is more conservative and working-class than the US as a whole. For this reason, Trump’s GOP has a structural advantage in the fight for Senate control, one that Democrats still don’t have good odds of overcoming in 2026 or 2028.\nRegardless, the Trump GOP’s reliance on low-propensity voters is a clear vulnerability. And the 2025 elections showed us why: If you want a picture of a Democratic future, imagine hyper-engaged, suburban wine-moms stomping on Vance’s face — forever (or, you know, in the 2028 election).","summary":"The Republican Party has had better days.

Jon Ossoff (D-GA) aiming to seize on the momentum from this election and Republicans working to reclaim the seat. The GOP might be thinking about the legacy of Bobby Baker in 1992. Baker was the first Republican to win statewide office since Reconstruction and then went on to usher in an era of GOP dominance in the state.\n\nOff-year elections often favor the party not in power nationally, so these results shouldn’t be taken as certain of the way the wind will blow next November. However, Ossoff’s early polling strength, along with the shocking margin for Democrats this week, may be a bellwether. \n\nDNC Vice Chairwoman Jane Kleeb said Democratic candidates are headed into the 2026 midterm elections “with incredible wind behind our backs.”\n\nWhat Democrats did right in Georgia \n\nThe Democratic candidates for public service commissioners in Georgia both narrowly focused on cost-of-living messages. Their ad buys and public statements veered away from broader national conversations. In his victory speech, Hubbard held the line on affordability, saying, “Affordability is front and center in voters’ minds, and today they overwhelmingly said they’re tired of subsidizing corporate interests at the expense of their families.”\n\n“As I serve out my first term on the Public Service Commission, I will work tirelessly to lower utility costs, to bring more clean, reliable energy resources to this state, and to refocus the Commission’s work on the public interest,” he continued. \n\nPublic service commissioners regulate pricing and access for public utilities, including gas and telecommunications.\n\nWith energy prices rising, the candidates honed in on higher electricity and gas prices in their campaigning. Outside spending drove home messaging about energy price concerns, with Georgia Conservation Voters contributing at least $2.2 million in the races, according to the Georgia Recorder.\n\n“The message of this election is unmistakable: Georgians demand an end to utility bill rate hikes and corporate politics as usual on the PSC,” GCV Executive Director Brionté McCorkle said during the campaign. \n\nThis was the first race since Charlie Bailey was chosen as chairman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, and strategists praised his leadership. He ran biweekly phone banks, canvassed in metro Atlanta and college towns, and spent thousands in media buys, including a last-minute $250,000 spot. \n\n“We are officially putting Georgia Republicans on notice,” Bailey said. \n\nOssoff praised Bailey’s results, calling the Democratic Party of Georgia an “unstoppable turnout juggernaut” in a positive sign for his attitude going into the 2026 midterm season. \n\nThe Georgia senator waded into the leadership battle for the state party, favoring Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA) to be replaced as chairwoman after Democrats’ poor showing during the 2024 election. \n\n“Having a message that people can touch, and the organizing behind it to remind them who’s responsible, gives Democrats a roadmap for 2026 and beyond,” Dasheika Ruffin, a Georgia Democratic political operative, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nWhat Republicans did wrong in Georgia\n\nThe public service commissioner position hadn’t been put in front of voters since 2020 due to a lawsuit challenging the commission’s at-large voting process. Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA), had voiced concerns that holding the election alongside other races on the ballot would mean they’d face greater mobilization from their opposition. \n\nOn top of that, Kemp’s political machine poured over a million dollars into the races, running ads on Fox News that featured the popular governor. One of the ousted commissioners, Troy Echols, criticized the at times cultural attacks, saying, “We’re attempting to scare our Republican base.” \n\nMany Republican strongholds swung to the left. Paulding County, which President Donald Trump won with 61% of the vote, ended in a draw on Tuesday night. Columbia County, which Trump won with 62% of the vote in 2024, went to the Democratic candidates, with 51.9% of the vote.\n\nForsyth County, which didn’t flip for the Democratic candidates, still saw a leftward swing of about 10 points. Democratic strongholds such as Clayton and DeKalb counties, which former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024 with about 80% of the vote, became even stronger, with 92.% and 91% of voters, respectively, choosing the Democratic candidates for public service commissioner on Tuesday.\n\nDespite Echols’s criticism of Kemp’s PAC’s efforts, Republican operative Garrison Douglas said the group intends to be “heavily involved in the 2026 cycle,” according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHOW THE ‘SCHUMER SHUTDOWN’ BACKFIRED ON GOP, DELIVERING HUGE NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nA handful of Republicans have already announced their candidacy for the Senate spot, though, notably, leadership’s wishes for Kemp to throw his hat in the ring didn’t come true. Reps. Mike Collins (R-GA) and Buddy Carter (R-GA), as well as ex-football coach Derek Dooley, are running in 2026. Kemp has endorsed Dooley against the wishes of the Republican National Committee. \n\nNone of the three Republican candidates has come close to Ossoff’s fundraising as of October. The senator raised more than $12 million between July and September, whereas the most one of his opponents has raised is Collins with $1.7 million.","summary":"Georgia Democrats are touting their wins on Tuesday as a sign of what’s to come in the 2026 Senate election as Republicans face concerns about their messaging.&#160; On Tuesday, Georgia voters ousted two Republican public service commissioners in favor of Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson.

In special elections around the country Tuesday night, Democratic candidates notched striking victories, toppling political dynasties and securing historic margins in races that many have taken as an encouraging sign for next year’s midterms. Still, as Republicans move to downplay last night’s blue wave, some Democrats are similarly hesitant to fully embrace their wins, fearful that highlighting progressive victories like that of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani could stunt the party’s efforts to move toward an electoral center.\n\n‘Major questions’\n\nFor Democrats broadly, last night’s victories were a “circuit-breaker” that ended the past “annus horribilis” for the party, said Politico. Beyond simply winning “every closely-watched election,” the striking takeaway from the races is that their victories “were so sweeping.” There were double-digit gubernatorial wins for Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively, two states previously expected to be close.\n\nWhile gubernatorial success was “perhaps unsurprising in Democratic-leaning states,” their margins “far exceeded” those of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 results, said Reuters. At the same time, the wins are an “early warning sign” for Republicans struggling to “mobilize Trump’s coalition when he is not on the ballot.”\n\nThe Democrats’ “good news” continued in “lower-profile elections” as well, said Vox, including in two statewide seats that Georgia Republicans had warned could be a “bellwether for the 2026 midterms.” But even if election night was a “sign of tides turning Democrats’ way,” the spectrum of candidates and their ideological leanings “leave major questions about the party’s path forward,” said The Wall Street Journal.\n\n‘Tug-of-war’\n\nPerhaps no race has engendered those types of “major questions” like Mamdani’s dark horse upset of Andrew Cuomo, scion of New York’s Cuomo political dynasty. While Mamdani’s specific policies are “broadly popular with the electorate,” his primary focuses are “not beloved by more moderate Democrats,” said The New York Times.\n\nMany “top Democrats,” including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), have been “reticent” to embrace Mamdani for fear his progressive stances could “alienate their voters,” said Al Jazeera. Democrats are “embroiled in a tug-of-war over the future of the party” with moderates warning against “overreading Mamdani’s success in an overwhelmingly blue city,” said Bloomberg.\n\n“The factional grifters will hate this,” said The New Republic’s Greg Sargent on Bluesky, but despite their ideological and campaign differences, the “Mamdani-Spanberger-Sherrill axis” isn’t a sign of intraparty discord at all. Instead, it highlights a “broad, emerging Dem coalition” focused on “affordability politics” and on being “anti-Trump.”\n\n“It doesn’t really matter if you run as a Democratic socialist, as a moderate, as a conservative,” said Democratic strategist Trip Yang to Al Jazeera. “Voters care if you are a disciplined candidate who can speak to their most pressing issue.”","summary":"High-profile wins are helping a party demoralized by Trump’s reelection regain momentum","url":"https://theweek.com/politics/democrats-mamdani-spanberger-2026-trump-midterms","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ARVorVLWF5zLsV22GEs55G-1680-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 20:52:13","author":"Rafi Schwartz","authors":["Rafi Schwartz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":376141362,"title":"Senator Wants to Give Trump ‘Chance to Save This Country’ By Nuking Filibuster","text":"President Donald Trump made a “sales pitch” to Republican senators Wednesday, calling on them to eliminate the filibuster.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted Republican senators for breakfast the morning after sweeping Republican losses in off-year elections Tuesday night.\n\nTrump gave senators a “sales pitch” for “why we should do away with the filibuster and try to save the country,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told The Daily Signal.\n\n“He’s on his soapbox about selling the opportunity to have a 51-vote to get the country going again,” he said in a phone interview after the breakfast.\n\nTrump told Republicans, “If you don’t terminate the filibuster, we won’t pass any legislation. There will be no legislation passed for three or four years,” adding that Republicans needed to eliminate the filibuster to end mail-in voting, pass election-integrity measures, and pass voter-ID laws.\n\nThe pitch resonated with Tuberville, who said the American people voted for Trump, and Republicans need a mechanism to pass his agenda. \n\n“The American people unanimously, in the biggest election ever, voted for Trump to be in office,” he said. “We knew it was going to be a fight. We knew that the Democrats were going to try to block him in every possible way they could. We know that at the end of the day, they will not do anything for three years but try to block everything President Trump does.”\n\nHowever, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., was not swayed.\n\n“I don’t doubt that he could have some sway with members,” Thune said after the breakfast. “But I know where the math is on this issue in the Senate, and … it’s just not happening.”\n\n“Government is not working right now,” Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach, said. “We’re $38 trillion in debt. We’re not doing something right. So, I think we give President Trump whatever he wants, and we go from there and give him a chance to save this country, because if we continue down this path, we’re not going to make it as the country that you and I grew up in.”\n\nTuberville doesn’t think ending the filibuster is the only way to end the government shutdown because, he says, “four or five of the Democrats will come to their senses and say, ‘enough is enough.’”\n\nBut Republicans need to eliminate the filibuster to pass the president’s other priorities, he said, such as slashing the national debt.\n\n“We’ve got to draw a line and stand here and say, ‘Are we going to get something done? Are we just going to sit back and punish the American people?’ Because that’s who’s going to get punished if we don’t open the government,” he said, “and if President Trump doesn’t get his agenda through.”\n\nAfter the government reopens, Tuberville said, Trump will likely have discussions to “correct and get Obamacare put in its right place.”\n\n“It’s been a disaster since it started,” he said. “Twelve years afterwards, we’ve got a lot of kids in debt financially because Obama said he’s going to pay for Obamacare through student loans. Now you got millions and tens of millions of kids that have student loans that value up to $2 trillion that they’re in debt.”\n\nThe senator hopes Trump “takes a front-row seat on this and says, ‘OK, let’s straighten out our health care, and let’s work with the Democrats to where the federal government and the taxpayers don’t have to fund it.’”\n\nTuberville said Republicans’ second meeting with the president at the White House in three weeks was fruitful. \n\n“He’s trying to tell us the things that he wants to get done,” he said. “But again, I think what’s standing in the way right now is going to be the filibuster, and the Democrats know that no longer they can put it off, the less that we can get done.”\n\nWhile Trump said he thinks the shutdown played a role in Republican losses in New York, New Jersey, and Virginia, Tuberville said those areas were “already lost to socialism and big government.”\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., also said she was unsurprised by the poor election results last night.\n\n“These were solidly Democrat states and cities where Kamala Harris secured strong victories in 2024, so frankly, last night’s results came as no surprise to me,” she told The Daily Signal. “What concerns me now is whether my colleagues across the aisle will finally abandon the reckless strategy of holding our government hostage to energize their progressive base.”","summary":"President Donald Trump made a “sales pitch” to Republican senators Wednesday, calling on them to eliminate the filibuster.

Every day it becomes clearer that this wasn’t a legitimate investigation – it was a massive and politically motivated fishing expedition,” the legal team explained.\n\n“We recently learned that Smith abused his prosecutorial power to spy on at least eight sitting U.S. senators and hundreds of prominent conservatives and groups. He unconstitutionally subpoenaed the phone records of these senators, including some of the most vocal defenders of liberty and due process in Washington, in the Arctic Frost investigation he took over from the FBI,” the ACLJ said by way of background.\n\n“When the executive branch spies on the legislative branch, it not only threatens the constitutional separation of powers, but it also confirms that the Biden-Garland Justice Department was weaponizing the government and targeting political opponents under the guise of law enforcement. This is not oversight. It’s overreach.”\n\nThe organization said, “Those responsible for this unconstitutional attack on liberty must be held accountable. At the ACLJ, we’ve seen what happens when unchecked power is allowed to fester. We fought and won FOIA battles against the Biden DOJ. Now, we’re going to do everything we can to help the Trump administration, along with the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, expose what Jack Smith did during Arctic Frost.\n\n“If they can spy on sitting U.S. Senators, they will spy on you.”\n\nThe scheme assembled by Democrats under Barack Obama and Joe Biden first tried to falsely link Trump to Russia, using made-up claims sponsored by Hillary Clinton. Then the Democrats launched a series of lawfare cases against Trump and other Republicans, and used Arctic Frost to spy on their constitutionally protected statements and comments.\n\nIt was FBI chiefs Kash Patel and Dan Bongino who confirmed that Smith “was tracking the private communication of 8 GOP U.S. senators.”\n\nOnline commentary has suggested Smith was scheming to file more lawfare cases against Trump and Republicans had Kamala Harris won the White House, and accessing their communications records was a preliminary step in naming them in charges.\n\nHarris, of course, lost by landslide proportions in the popular vote and the Electoral College.\n\nExplained the ACLJ, “So not only was the Deep State going after President Trump, but it was going after conservative members of Congress. Such a shocking revelation should be the top headline on every mainstream media outlet. It should also put Congress on high alert that a Special Counsel was going after them.”\n\nACLJ Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow called the scenario out “outrage.”\n\n“I want everybody to put this into context. Could you imagine if it were a different situation and the DOJ under President Trump was spying on six Democratic senators? What would the reaction be? . . . Why in the world did Jack Smith try to get the phone records of a co-equal branch of government – senators and a member of the House of Representatives – for what purpose?”\n\nHe said, “This action by Jack Smith just typifies what was going on with the weaponization of the DOJ.”\n\nAnd since the records were accessed just before the 2024 election, “Obviously, Smith and the Biden DOJ were engaging in election interference.”","summary":"'Every day it becomes clearer that this wasn't a legitimate investigation – it was a massive and politically motivated fishing expedition'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/11/this-is-not-oversight-legal-team-launches-demand/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/spying-surveillance-camera-security-unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 20:42:42","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":376145286,"title":"Virginia voters push back hard on Trump administration efforts to reshape federal government","text":"By HELEN WIEFFERING, BILL BARROW and OLIVIA DIAZ\n\nARLINGTON, Va.

(AP) — Not everyone who voted in Northern Virginia in Tuesday’s election has felt the impact of President Donald Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government, but even many who haven’t said they have colleagues or neighbors who are dealing with the consequences.\n\n“I’ve seen so many federal families lose their jobs, lose their income, lose their certainty here,” said Karina Valdez, who voted at the Barcroft Sports & Fitness Center in Arlington.\n\nValdez, a 40-year-old mom who works at an elementary school, said she voted for Democratic candidates across the ballot, adding her voice to a Democratic sweep of all statewide offices in the commonwealth that sent a blistering message to President Donald Trump and his party.\n\nAbigail Spanberger, elected as the state’s first female governor, ran on a promise to protect Virginia’s economy from the aggressive tactics of Trump’s second administration, which has culled the civil service, levied tariffs and shepherded a reconciliation bill curtailing the state’s already fragile health care system.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of Spanberger’s double-digit victory over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome-Earle Sears showed a dramatic swing toward Democrats from four years ago, when Republican Glenn Youngkin won the state’s top office, and from last November, when Democrat Kamala Harris won Virginia by less than 6 percentage points in the presidential race.\n\nThe 2025 AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of Tuesday’s electorate, found that voters with a federal government worker or contractor in their household were likelier than other households to support Spanberger, while a majority of Virginia voters said their family’s finances have been at least “a little” affected by federal government cuts under Trump.\n\nRepublicans acknowledge the blowback\n\nEven Youngkin acknowledged that the federal government shutdown fueled “quite a turnout yesterday.”\n\n“People are going without paychecks. They’re worried about mortgages and rents,” he told reporters in Richmond on Wednesday. “They’re worried about how they’re going to feed their families. The challenge of this government shutdown is real, and I am incredibly understanding of that challenge for all Virginians. And I think it is, I think it caused quite, quite a turnout yesterday.”\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Don Scott said the election was about more than federal jobs. He noted that Democrats picked up roughly a dozen seats in Virginia’s 100-member House of Delegates on Tuesday — securing the party’s largest majority in three decades.\n\n“We saw a little wave, but we didn’t see this doggone tsunami,” he said.\n\nTrump himself acknowledged the effects in his first public appearance since Democrats swept governors’ races in Virginia and New Jersey, won the New York mayor’s race, flipped two Public Service Commission seats in Georgia and won voter approval to redraw California’s congressional district map to combat the president’s partisan gerrymandering push elsewhere.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Wednesday to Republican U.S. senators, Trump called the shutdown “a big factor, negative” in the shellacking, and he urged lawmakers to end it.\n\nTrump did not push for yielding to Democrats’ demands to extend premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance customers. He urged Republican leaders to end the Senate filibuster so they won’t need any Democratic votes to approve spending measures — or anything else — as long as the GOP retains its majority.\n\nThat may not be enough to appease some Virginia voters. Some Spanberger supporters on Tuesday made clear they blame Republicans in Washington, given GOP control of the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\n“They have the majority and they should be able to get something done,” Sherry Kohan, a 56-year-old accountant, said at her Arlington polling place, where the former Republican voted for Spanberger.\n\nVoters said they feel and see the effects\n\nPaul Capetanakis, a 37-year-old restaurant owner, cited the ripple effects of Trump’s National Guard deployment in the nation’s capital, the shutdown and price hikes when explaining his votes for Spanberger and other Democrats.\n\n“I lost probably $300,000 from the previous year,” he said, comparing this year’s receipts with 2024. “I’m still doing okay, but I could be doing much better.”\n\nTuesday’s voter poll found that about 6 in 10 Virginia voters reported that their family’s finances had been affected “a lot” or “a little” by federal government cuts this year. About two-thirds of those voters supported Spanberger, while about 6 in 10 voters who said they hadn’t been affected by the cuts supported Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee.\n\nAbout two-thirds of voters who live in a household with a current federal employee or contractor voted for Spanberger, compared with just over half of voters in households without a family member who works for the government.\n\nAlonzie Scott, who voted early in Arlington, said he retired in September from the Office of Naval Research in disagreement with new performance plans that would require him to “faithfully execute the president’s agenda.”\n\n“When I saw that, I told my bosses back then that I was going to retire,” Scott said. “I’ve been working for 40 years, and it was just time to walk out the door.”\n\nScott said he’d like to see the nation go down a better path and plans to volunteer with local politics as soon as he’s able.\n\nNorthern Virginia swings to Democrats\n\nThe swing toward Democrats was especially strong in Northern Virginia, near Washington, D.C, where many federal workers live.\n\nFour years ago, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe led suburban-exurban Loudoun County in 2021 by 11 points. Harris outpaced Trump there by 16 points. Spanberger’s margin Tuesday was about 29 points.\n\nIn Fairfax County, McAuliffe led by 30, Harris by 35 and Spanberger by 47. In Prince William, Spanberger nearly doubled Democrats’ 2024 margin, leading the county by 34 points compared with 18 for Harris. McAuliffe led Youngkin there by 15 points.\n\nIn southwest Virginia, meanwhile, a more rural, heavily Republican area with a smaller federal government footprint, Spanberger gained ground but typically by single digits.\n\nRebecca Wolfinger, a 49-year-old health care worker, said the shutdown fallout was a key issue for her.\n\n“Everything that’s been going on with the federal government and people losing jobs all over Arlington and other places in Virginia affected my vote a lot,” she said. “I felt like the Republican candidate didn’t show a lot of concern for people losing their jobs,” she said.\n\nBarrow reported from Washington.

Several Republicans closely aligned with Trump were defeated despite his large win in 2024.ADDITIONAL REPORTING | Democrats win big in first election since Trump took officeDemocratic leaders said they hope the outcomes could signal a new path for winning races, though most victories were in strongly Democratic states.California voters also approved a redistricting measure that will redraw the state’s congressional boundaries. The change could increase the number of Democrats representing California in Congress.Observers say Election Day 2025 should not be equated with last year’s national election, as many states did not hold contests Tuesday. In places that did, however, the races served as a morale boost for Democrats after internal debate over the party’s direction. Supporters say the wins illustrate the breadth of Democratic policies.RELATED STORY | After election night, GOP expected to center messaging on Mamdani and socialismRepublicans noted the victories were in states and cities that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in last year’s presidential race, rejecting the notion that the contests reflected a shift in swing states. Trump attributed GOP losses to his absence from the ballot and the ongoing federal government shutdown.The results could prompt Republicans in Washington to reconsider negotiations with Democrats to end the shutdown.

On this day, November 5th, one year ago, we had one of the Greatest Presidential Victories in History — Such an Honor to represent our Country,” he said, highlighting the “BOOMING” economy and the fact that costs are coming down.\n\n“Affordability is our goal,” Trump said. “Love to the American People!”\n\nIndeed, costs have come down significantly since Trump took the helm from former President Joe Biden and his administration — an administration that oversaw record high gas prices reaching an average of $5.016 in the summer of 2022, egg prices that shot up 147 percent, and skyrocketing inflation. As Breitbart News reported in November 2023, at that time the average U.S. household needed an extra $11,434 per year just to maintain the same standard of living they had only a few years prior.\n\nIn contrast, President Donald Trump’s policies have reduced the cost of living on various fronts, with inflation cooling more than expected. During Biden’s term, the annual inflation rate actually peaked to the highest rate in over 40 years at over nine percent.\n\nIn addition, gas prices soared to record highs, but this past October, gas prices dipped to their lowest level for any October since 2020 near the end of Trump’s first term. The national average on Wednesday clocked in at $3.079 — significantly lower than the average high recorded during the Biden administration.\n\nFurthermore, mortgage rates have dipped since January, and rental prices are growing at their slowest pace in over four and half years.\n\nThe Trump administration also prevented a massive tax increase on the American people with the “big, beautiful bill” which included no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security. A readout from the White House indicates that this resulted in bigger paychecks, boosting “take-home pay for a typical hardworking family by OVER $10,000 a year.”\n\nEggs — and the cost of groceries in general — also became center of controversy and concern during the Biden years. As Breitbart News reported in January 2025, prior to Trump’s inauguration:\n\nRising prices in key categories are once again weighing on consumers. Grocery prices, which had been relatively stable through late 2023, resumed their upward march, with the price of eggs surging by more than one-third over the past year. Meanwhile, gas prices, though still below year-ago levels, posted a sharp increase for the month.\nSigns that inflation appears to have become entrenched means consumers may have to wait longer for relief in the form of lower borrowing costs. Higher rates on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards are likely to persist, as the Fed holds steady on its current policy stance.\n\nBut now, the price of household staples, including eggs, are dropping. This made headlines over the summer.\n\nAs Breitbart news reported at the time:\n\nThe price of fresh eggs plunged in June, the third time in the past four months in which prices have declined by around 20 percent or more.\n\nSince February, the price of eggs has fallen by 61.2 percent. By contrast, in the final months of Joe Biden’s presidency, the price of eggs rose by 227.1 percent.\n\nOther items including butter, ice cream, fresh fruit, cereal, and more are all falling as well.\n\nAnother key example of this can be seen in Walmart announcing the price of its annual Thanksgiving meal basket, which will cost less than $4 per person this year. As Breitbart News’s Economics Editor John Carney wrote, this marks the “lowest price point since the retail giant launched the program in 2022,” in the midst of the Biden administration:\n\nThe bundle, designed to feed 10 people, includes more than 20 items such as a 13.5-pound Butterball turkey priced at 97 cents per pound — its lowest cost since 2019 — along with traditional holiday staples including stuffing, cranberries, green beans, dinner rolls, and ingredients for pumpkin pie. The complete basket rings up at under $40.\n\nFor greater perspective, last year, the price rang up at around $7 per person.\n\nThese realities come as New Yorkers opted to vote for a Muslim socialist — who has advocated for state-run grocery stores — as their mayor in New York City. Trump warned that with Mamdani at the helm, the city would have “ZERO chance of success, or even survival!”\n\nTrump also warned on Election Day that voting for Republicans was the only way to properly address the affordability issue.\n\n“If affordability is your issue, VOTE REPUBLICAN! Energy costs, as and example, are plummeting — Getting close to 2 Dollar a gallon gasoline. When energy goes down, everything else follows, and it has!!!” Trump said.","summary":"President Donald Trump is celebrating the strides made in the affordability crisis since he took office in January 2025.\n\n\nThe post Trump Celebrates Affordability One Year After Historic Election — Groceries, Gas, Rental Prices Falling appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/11/05/trump-celebrates-affordability-one-year-after-historic-election-groceries-gas-rental-prices-falling/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/pexels-gustavo-fring-4971967-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 20:30:03","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":376154584,"title":"Vance's 2028 Chances Up in Flames?: Veep's Supporters Scramble Following Republicans' Nightmare Election... as JD's Downfall Continues Amid Suspected Marriage Troubles","text":"The Republican Party had such a bad night on Election Day JD Vance's hope of becoming president in 2028 may have crashed and burned, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe Democrats had several big wins on Tuesday, November 4, including Zohran Mamdani becoming New York City's new mayor, despite President Trump backing his rival, the disgraced Andrew Cuomo.Vance Attempts to Fix Nightmare Election NightFollowing their embarrassing defeat, Vance rushed to X to react and said, \"I think it's idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections in blue states, but a few thoughts,\" and added his party has to \"do better at turning out voters than we have in the past.\"\n\nHe later added: \"...

People are already exhausted from dealing with his moods.\"\n\nDeSantis, the governor of Florida, ran for president in 2024 before dropping out and supporting Trump.During the Democrat onslaught, Vance's half-brother, Cory Bowman, also suffered a humiliating loss, getting just 22 percent of the vote in his battle against Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval.\n\nVance had endorsed Bowman's campaign ahead of the mayoral primary in May, and with hours to go before the polls closed, said his half-brother is a \"good guy with a heart for serving his community.

Forty-seven percent of voters said their own financial situation was worse than it had been four years earlier, which exceeded the share who held that view in the immediate wake of the Great Recession in 2008.\n\nInflation and the economy consistently ranked as a top concern among voters in polls conducted ahead of last year’s presidential election.\n\nPrice increases slowed earlier this year but they have picked up in recent months, arriving at the same level registered in January at the time Trump took office.

Vance downplayed the significance of the elections a day earlier, but he also acknowledged the importance of voters’ financial worries.\n\n\"I think it's idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections in blue states,\" Vance said.\n\nHe added: \"The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn't built in a day.\"\n\n\"We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond,\" Vance said.\n\nABC News' Ivan Pereira and David Brennan contributed to this report.","summary":"The bread-and-butter advantage among Democrats marked a sharp turnabout.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/economy-flipped-red-blue-issue-exit-polls/story?id=127213518","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d3785292-2e16-41d8-ba78-8d65fd150ea6/mamdani-gty-er-251105_1762361905212_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 20:08:03","author":"Max Zahn","authors":["Max Zahn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":376139382,"title":"Larry Donnelly: The Democrats got the big win they needed - now they need to unite","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

The party has been adrift, arguably unmoored and desperate to chart the best possible way forward since Donald Trump’s return to the White House in 2024.\n\nThis internal conflict is evident in the publication of a compelling, research-based report, entitled “Deciding to Win” and authored by committed moderate Democrats who believe strongly that their party has veered too far left in recent years and urge a pivot to the centre. (Due disclosure: I am in their tribe and am personally sympathetic to their analysis).\n\nProgressives have pushed back vociferously in response. They claim, on one hand, that there has not been a genuine leftward lurch. On the other, they deny that any perception of such a move has resulted in a loss of support. (A further due disclosure: I think they are demonstrably wrong on each count).\n\nThis is the latest outgrowth of the oft-cited, left vs centre battle between the cohort purportedly led by US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and US Senator Bernie Sanders and the one supposedly embodied by the Clintons, the Obamas, Joe Biden, James Carville, et al.\n\nThe question this week is, in the wake of an undeniably successful round of elections, where should Democrats pitch their tent as the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential contest approach in the land of the eternal campaign?\n\nIn New York, a self-identified Democratic Socialist, Muslim and Ugandan immigrant, the youthful Zohran Mamdani, emerged from relative obscurity to beat the state’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo. More than 50% of voters in the Big Apple chose him to serve as their mayor. He pulled off the upset with the help of an army of volunteers attracted to his upstart candidacy, above all, by his unapologetically radical plans to cut the exorbitant cost of living in the city.\n\nZohran Mamdani waves to his supporters as he departs his election night watch party in Brooklyn.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nMamdani’s lengthy victory address was forthright and combative. Commencing with a quote from legendary American socialist Eugene Debs, he steadfastly defended members of the Trans community; he condemned Islamophobia; he pledged not only to defend New Yorkers against Trump, but also “the next one”; he guaranteed he would protect tenants from landlords when necessary; and he assured the crowd he will be an unflinching champion of labour unions “because…when working people have ironclad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed.”\n\nConciliatory language this was not. There was little in the form of outreach to adherents of Cuomo, who was actually quite generous to Mamdani in defeat, or to those who opted for the third hopeful, Curtis Sliwa, of the GOP. And the audience loved every second of it. Many who were present also expressed, in colourful words, their extreme distaste for establishment Democrats who declined to endorse their man. The left has a new hero.\n\nDire predictions about what will befall New York City and its people when an inexperienced, “tax the rich” socialist is sworn into office now abound. They are likely overwrought. Mamdani, however, has promised promiscuously and will inevitably let some of those who rallied to his cause down. But he has accomplished an extraordinary feat and is certainly the man of the moment, even as President Trump and leading conservatives see him – for obvious, not very nice reasons – as an ideal bogeyman who they intend to turn into the national face of the Democratic Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo of Mamdani’s fellow Democrats, Mikie Sherrill in neighbouring New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, performed similarly well. That said, these centrists employed entirely different tactics in their campaigns. They and their advisers clearly learned lessons from the dismal presidential bid of Kamala Harris and from other colleagues who failed to win races that were there for the taking.\n\nIn short, and without using the rhetoric that bolstered Mamdani in America’s largest metropolis, Sherrill and Spanberger honed in on inflation and associated “bread and butter” topics that Democrats have forever had the advantage on.\n\nSimultaneously, and without disavowing their convictions, they avoided the “Trump is a threat to a republic” line of attack that falls on the deaf ears of a jaded citizenry and de-emphasised the culture wars which Republicans have exploited to great effect. This shrewd messaging facilitated their triumphs. Democrats made gains in territory less favourable than New Jersey and Virginia, too.\n\nAbigail Spanberger was elected Virginia's first female governor.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nSo, neither is probably the answer to the question posed previously as to whether the party of Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger should go definitively centrist or left. Instead, the answer is that, in the US, a vast, diverse country with a nonsensical two party system, the tent should be broad enough to include those drawn to both factions. Given that individuals within them have sincere differences on multiple social and economic issues, that’s not easy.\n\nIt means that the Democratic tent must have room for unabashed leftists on the coasts and in urban areas, as well as moderate to conservative populists in Middle America. That will require a lot of “sucking it up” – cognisant that allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good is not a tenable 50-state strategy, no matter what the rigid ideologues, moneyed special interests or high-powered lobbyists say.\n\nThe struggle for the past while has been one that will be readily apparent to readers in Ireland, where political parties are much more cohesive and disciplined entities.\n\nWhat is there to unite this putative Democratic coalition when their views and bearings more generally are, at times, divergent?\n\nAnd here is why the elections this week are significant, in the immediate and perhaps longer terms. They reveal what the clarion call is at this juncture: the affordability agenda. In the US, just about everything – from health care, to higher education, to hamburgers – is extortionate.\n\nHammering home that reality, which is currently devastating so many women, men and children, together with developing concrete, feasible initiatives for improving things, can unite Democrats of all stripes and win over a decent sized cadre of Americans so beleaguered that they went for Donald Trump.\n\nBut do they have it in them collectively to grasp the nettle?\n\nLarry Donnelly is a Boston lawyer, a law lecturer at the University of Galway and a political columnist with The Journal.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nLarry Donnelly\n\nView 17 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Larry Donnelly: The Democrats got the big win they needed - now they need to unite”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Larry Donnelly: The Democrats got the big win they needed - now they need to unite”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy SHARON MAI, ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER \n Published:19:53 GMT, 5 November 2025 |Updated:19:55 GMT, 5 November 2025 \n\nJennifer Lawrence revealed she is working with Emma Stone to produce an upcoming Miss Piggy movie.\nThe Oscar-winning actress, 35, said she may also be starring in the film in addition to working behind the camera to produce the project.\nThe Die, My Love star made an appearance on Wednesday's podcast episode of Las Culturistas with Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang.\nOn the podcast, she opened up about working with Stone and Cole Escola to produce a Muppets movie.\n'I don't know if I can announce this, but I'm just going to,' she told the podcast hosts. 'Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie and Cole is writing it.' \nThe news comes shortly after she opened up about why she no longer discusses and publicly shares her political beliefs amid President Donald Trump's second term. \n\nJennifer Lawrence revealed she is working with Emma Stone to produce an upcoming Miss Piggy movie; seen on November 1 in NYC\n\nLawrence also admitted that she almost starred in Oh Mary! instead of the current star — Tony winner Jane Krakowski. \nShe said Escola had contacted her about starring in his acclaimed Broadway comedy play, but she had to turn down the offer because of scheduling conflicts. \nLawrence did not share any further details about her forthcoming Muppets-related project. \nHowever, she did address another movie rumor about her starring in a remake of Death Becomes Her. \nShe denied the speculation but said she would 'love' to work on such a project. \n'No, that was just, like, fan casting,' she explained. 'It would be great. I would love to. I mean, I would be there.' \nShe recently explained why she stopped criticizing Trump and discussing her politicial beliefs in public. \nLawrence said and she didn't want to prevent potential moviegoers from seeing a film she did that could 'change consciousness or change the world' by stating a controversial political opinion. \n\nThe Oscar-winning actress, 35, said she may also be starring in the film in addition to working behind the camera to produce the project\n\nThe Die, My Love star made an appearance on Wednesday's podcast episode of Las Culturistas with Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang\n\nOn the podcast, she opened up about working with Stone and Cole Escola to produce a Muppets movie; pictured with Stone in September 2017\n\n Jennifer Lawrence says David O. Russell's blunt directing style 'never felt degrading' \nShe also said she hoped to make her thoughts on the world clear through her work, as she has a production company called Excellent Cadaver that has been doing documentaries about topics such as abortion and issues abroad. \n'A lot of movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape, and that's how I feel like I can be helpful,' Lawrence said.\nLawrence last year indicated in an interview with people that she would be voting for Democratic candidate, ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, when she took on Trump after ex-President Joe Biden dropped out.\n'Abortion is literally on the ballot,' she told People in September of 2024. 'I'm voting for Kamala Harris because I think she's an amazing candidate and I know that she will do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights.\n'That's the most important thing, is to not let somebody into the White House who is going to ban abortion.'\nEmma StoneJane KrakowskiJennifer Lawrence\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJennifer Lawrence reveals she is working on a Miss Piggy movie with Emma Stone\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

No Republican presidential candidate had ever won a higher percentage with Latino voters.\n\nAnd while he wasn't on the ballot on Tuesday night, there were some potentially concerning signs for his Republican Party. The winning candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey both had wide leads of around 30% with Latino voters, according to exit poll data.\n\nThere are interesting shifts, too, when examining the results more closely.\n\nPassaic County in New Jersey - which census data shows is almost half Latino - is often cited by analysts as a bellwether for Trump's support among those voters. He won it by 3 percentage points in 2024, yet Sherrill won it by 15 on Tuesday.\n\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who specialises in Latino voting trends, suggested the cost of living - a key theme in the Democratic campaigns - was a major factor. \n\n\"No poll taken anywhere in the country in the past month has anything other than the economy as the top issue for Latinos,\" he said.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40qx532e0o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5343/live/88bb38c0-ba70-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 19:44:56","author":"Donovan Slack And Gareth Evans","authors":["Donovan Slack And Gareth Evans"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":376125140,"title":"‘Blowback’: Democrats’ agenda still features fear, despite Tuesday’s win by Mamdani","text":"The Democrat Party was left in shambles by the 2024 presidential race.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., sent out donor letters noting that the fight against socialism will be ‘shaping every major Senate Democrat primary in 2026,'” the analysis confirmed.\n\nHe noted, “The Democrats know what they have wrought here, and they are terrified.”\n\nOn that, Politico said, “Some national Democrats are sounding alarms about the coming GOP onslaught,” about the coming GOP agenda to remind Democrats and other voters about the “communist” Mamdani.\n\nIn fact, a campaign advisory team already has put into memo form that Mamdani is “politically toxic,” and his ideals are anathema in states that Democrats need to win in 2026.\n\nThe analysis said, “Mamdani could have only won in an area that is a clear-cut deep blue outlier. Tying his policies to more mainstream congressional races will no doubt drag down any Democrat candidate trying to portray themselves as being distanced from the fringe extremists in their party.”\n\nFor example, the platform of Democratic socialists includes “free[ing] all people from involuntary confinement” (i.e., closing all prisons and releasing ALL prisoners), “disarm[ing] law enforcement officers,” “abolish[ing] the U.S. Senate,” and “the nationalization of businesses.”\n\nMamdani wasted no time, declaring his allegiance to such objectives in his first speech after the election.\n\n“I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this,” he boasted.\n\nPolitico offered the warning that Mamdani now will be a “glaring distraction” in the 2026 election, which otherwise would have been a referendum on the party in power.\n\nCNN analyst Scott Jennings after the election warned, “This is a terrible night for national Democratic image, given what is happening inside their party. Mamdani is an avowed socialist. It’s not what people say that he is, it’s what he says that he is. He’s now the leader of their party.

The Virginia governor’s race was a blowout. So was a New Jersey governor’s race that many expected to be close. A GOP effort to oust liberal justices from Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court flopped, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s effort to redistrict his state in Democrats’ favor took a critical step forward. But as big as Tuesday night’s results were, the question everyone focused on was what this means for the midterms, when Democrats hope to retake some federal control and slow down Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nDemocrats spent the evening projecting confidence: “American voters just delivered a Democratic resurgence. A Republican reckoning. A Blue Sweep,” Ken Martin, Democratic National Committee chair, said in a statement Tuesday night. Republicans, meanwhile, displayed something between rationalization and cope. CNN’s Scott Jennings, the network’s lonely MAGA mouthpiece, dismissed any connection between the results and Trump, claiming that this was just a run-of-the-mill set of reliably blue states producing blue-state results.\n\nSo who’s right here? Was Tuesday night a sign that voters have soured on Trump and are ready to hand Congress to Democrats next fall? Or is that wishful thinking?\n\nWith no nationwide elections to look at, sussing out the answer requires an election expert who can look granularly at the races. Enter Steven Shepard, associate director of politics at Pew Research Center and a longtime polling reporter at Politico. He has a well-earned reputation among journalists as a perpetual skeptic, someone who refuses to be bamboozled by hype, cope, spin, and anything in between. So I trust Shepard for a straight answer on what to make of these elections, and whether Democrats are right to be as excited as they’re projecting.\n\nHis answers were neither comforting nor too depressing. In short, we shouldn’t read too much into these elections, because they’re a small sample size that features a different electorate than the one we should expect to turn out next year. “One of the things we’ve seen pretty consistently over the last four to eight years is Democrats holding a turnout advantage, especially in elections outside of the federal elections every two years,” he said.\n\nBut Shepard also noted that traditionally, the midterms swing away from the president who was just elected—and that Democrats have been very motivated to turn out against Donald Trump.\n\nIn short, Democrats shouldn’t take Tuesday night’s results as a sign of any certainty that the midterms are in the bag. And if they want to take Trump down a peg, they better stay busy between now and next November.\n\nHere’s our conversation, edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nShirin Ali: From a bird’s-eye view, how would you look at Tuesday night’s election results as a barometer for the 2026 midterms?\n\nSteven Shepard: Well, obviously the sample size here is very limited, right? We had governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia, a statewide ballot measure in California, what are traditionally very sleepy judicial retention races. Even in the couple states that are competitive in general elections, generally speaking, [we] had races that are typically very, very low-turnout, sleepy races. There was also a public service commissioner race in Georgia, judicial retention races in Pennsylvania. These are not the types of things that motivate voters to come out typically, and I would caution against over-reading. I think there’s a sort of known tendency—and we’ve seen it this century, among voters, especially the year after a presidential election—to react in a thermostatic way. We choose a new president, things move maybe a little too far to one side, and they try to dial it back to where things were before.\n\nGeorge W. Bush wins in 2000, in 2001 Democrats win the governorship in New Jersey and Virginia. Barack Obama wins in 2008, and Republicans win the governorships in New Jersey and Virginia, flipping those from Democratic control. Donald Trump wins in 2016, and in 2017 Democrats win the governorships in New Jersey and Virginia. Then, in 2021, after Joe Biden’s victory, Democrats barely hold on in New Jersey and the incumbent governor comes pretty close to losing in a surprise, and Republicans flip Virginia. In that way, this is what usually happens. Now, you mentioned 2026; what usually happens in a president’s midterm is his party loses seats in Congress the next year. Does what happened last night mean that’s going to happen in 2026? Not necessarily, but the trend that we have seen in modern politics held last night, where the party that loses the presidential election does well in these off-year races in this handful of states. We’ll see if that trend holds a year from now.\n\nSince November 2024, the Democratic brand has taken a severe beating, but given the party’s success last night, can they make any serious assertions about how voters are feeling about the party now?\n\nI do think all indications are that voters hold pretty low opinions of both political parties. Our polling is consistent with that, and especially what we’ve seen in our most recent survey in September was Democrats are very frustrated with their own party. Two-thirds of Democrats that we interviewed said they felt frustrated by the Democratic Party. I think that’s pretty consistent with some of the voter surveys in New Jersey and Virginia we saw this week that showed Democratic voters may be frustrated with their own party, but they’re still motivated to come out and vote against Republicans.\n\nDemocrats now are more frustrated than Republicans were with their party four years ago. Democrats today are angrier with the Democratic Party than Republicans were four years ago. Democrats today, in our polling, are less hopeful about the Democratic Party than Republicans were about their party four years ago. After losing the 2020 election and after Jan. 6, Republicans were still more likely to say they were hopeful about the Republican Party than Democrats were hopeful about the Democratic Party. These polls were conducted before the elections this week, but I think there’s a sort of disconnect between how Democrats feel about the Democratic Party and how Democrats feel about voting in these elections. I think that that chasm was on display in these states.\n\nThe Democratic candidates who won on Tuesday span a pretty wide spectrum, by basically every measure, including ideology. And when you look at this Democratic frustration, it’s pretty across the board, in our polling. Democrats who identified as liberal were a little bit more likely to say that they were frustrated with their party than Democrats who identified as moderate or conservative. This just means that this battle is going to play out in primaries throughout the country in the next two and a half years, culminating with the presidential primary in 2028.\n\nDid last night reveal any Republican-held House or Senate seats that now seem more flippable?\n\nWell certainly if there’s one thing we know especially about the House, it’s that the map is constantly changing, including last night where Democrats were able to get voters to approve mid-decade redistricting in California. We also saw Republicans, at least for the time being, apparently abandon an effort to redraw the congressional lines in Kansas to flip another seat back. I’m hesitant to try to draw too many conclusions about the race for the House, just because the rules of the game and the lines under which candidates are going to be running are constantly changing, and may change more in light of what we saw last night.\n\nFor example, in Virginia, Democrats are trying to push through a very creative legislative maneuver, a ballot measure that would theoretically go to the voters early next year that would allow them to redraw the lines in Virginia. It’s hard to look at, say, the House seat that Abigail Spanberger once held, for example, in the D.C. suburbs, and say that Eugene Vindman, the Democratic member there, should feel good running a year from now. We don’t know what the lines are going to look like, necessarily, a year from now. In the Senate, we all know that the map is difficult for Democrats. There aren’t a lot of seats in states where Kamala Harris did well in the last presidential election. However, you know, you see the kind of range of outcomes that are perhaps possible, and certainly I think both parties will be looking at the map again in light of what we saw last night.\n\nOutside of Virginia, New Jersey, and California, states that are reliably blue, local Democrats in deep-red states like Georgia and Mississippi also managed to flip some Republican-held seats. That feels significant! But does it mean much?\n\nEspecially given the modern turnout dynamics, one of the things we’ve seen pretty consistently over the last four to eight years is Democrats holding a turnout advantage, especially in elections outside of the federal elections every two years, and also outside of the presidential elections every four years. Whereas in the Obama era, it was Democrats who struggled to get their base voters to turn out for lower-turnout elections like those in off years, or even midterms, and certainly in special elections held outside of the usual calendar.\n\nWhat we have seen in most of the Trump era, on the Republican side, is that it’s Republicans now who are having that kind of trouble. For example, our Pew Research Center–validated voter study back in 2016 and 2020 asked people who they voted for right after the presidential election and whether they voted. We then validated responses according to their voter file and whether they turned out to cast a ballot or not. We found in 2016 and 2020, people who said that they didn’t end up voting in the election would have favored the Democratic candidate, so either Hillary Clinton in 2016 or Joe Biden in 2020. But in 2024, it was Donald Trump who benefited from lower-propensity voters, seemingly, and it turned out that among nonvoters in that election, there was a slight plurality that would have actually supported him had they voted.\n\nRepublicans now have this turnout challenge of getting some of the voters that they’ve brought into their coalition to turn out, especially when Trump’s name is not on the ballot, when it’s not a presidential election. When you look at some results around the country that seem a little weird—you just had a presidential election in Georgia that Donald Trump won by a fairly decent margin, it wasn’t super, super close, and then to see these races for lower statewide offices tilt so much toward the Democratic candidate, it might look strange, but I think turnout and turnout motivation might explain some of that.\n\nLots of attention was paid to Virginia and New Jersey, as they held the biggest races last night for governors’ seats, but these are historically blue states, so can they really offer an accurate representation of how all Americans feel about the president and the majority party in Congress?\n\nThere’s definitely a lot of risk of over-reading some of these results. Exit polls are really imprecise, but in Virginia and New Jersey, they both showed the president’s approval rating around 40 percent, and that was also his approval rating in our last national survey here at Pew Research Center. Obviously, 40 percent is about 10 points fewer than the vote share he earned in the last presidential election among those who turned out to vote, and Pew’s 40 percent is among all adults. That’s obviously a challenging place for the president and his party. Historically, presidents who’ve had approval ratings that are that low have, just like most other presidents, lost seats in their midterm elections. Just two years ago, in a similar off-year election, Democrats held the governorship in Kentucky, when Andy Beshear won a second term. That didn’t mean that Joe Biden was more popular than people thought in Kentucky, these are just elections for governor. These are not federal elections. There’s a lot of risk of over-reading them, but we do know that right now, more Americans disapprove of the job that President Trump is doing in the White House than approve. The results in the polling of these elections were fairly consistent with that, and that will certainly be a challenge for his party over the next year heading into the midterms.\n\nWhat do voters tend to prioritize in local and statewide elections versus federal races?\n\nWell, we don’t know what the issue set is going to be in 2026 at this point. We don’t necessarily know what voters are going to be considering when they vote in the midterms. We do know that the economy weighed heavily on voters in New Jersey and Virginia this week, as it has in recent elections here, including presidential elections in this country. For example, in both states a plurality of voters said the economy is the most important issue, and generally speaking, the Democratic candidate, during the exit polls—again, imprecise—suggested that those voters voted for the Democratic candidate. Voters who said that the economy was their most important issue in the last presidential election, generally speaking, voted for the Republican, Donald Trump.\n\nOne of the things we found in our national polling is that two years ago, Republicans enjoyed an advantage when we asked Americans which party they agree with more on various issues and on the economy. Significantly more voters said they agreed with Republicans on the economy two years ago than agreed with the Democratic Party. In our most recent poll back in September, that gap had closed almost entirely. Republicans held a 3-point edge on that question, which is very competitive. Voters, when they thought about the economy, were roughly equally likely to say they agreed with the Republican Party as they were to say they agreed with the Democratic Party. That’s a change, and that is going to be the argument that both parties are going to be making looking ahead to the midterm elections about the economy. If that is going to be the most important issue right now, you don’t necessarily see at the national level either party having a clear edge, at least according to our polling. That is probably a fault line ahead of the next election, and both parties have work to do.","summary":"An election expert explains whether Tuesday night’s races suggest a blue wave is coming next year.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/11/what-do-the-2025-elections-mean-for-the-2026-midterms.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/e04c961f-66f5-42f1-9171-02ff168f3ab0.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 19:02:50","author":"Shirin Ali","authors":["Shirin Ali"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":376111120,"title":"Michael Taube: Dick Cheney was a conservative’s conservative","text":"Cheney broke with the GOP near the end of his life.

In Virginia, former Representative Abigail Spanberger flipped the governorship with a 15-point victory against GOP Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears. Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by about 13 points in New Jersey, and Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.\n\nAlthough there are differences between those candidates, an emphasis on affordability was a common thread through each of those campaigns that helped propel them to victory.\n\nThat’s a contrast from last November, when Republicans used the affordability issue to defeat Democratic candidates up and down the ballot. The results underscore how the political environment has shifted in just a year—and is good news for Democrats hoping to reclaim control of the House of Representatives and the Senate next November.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nVoters often name the economy as among their top concerns. CNN’s exit polls of the 2024 election showed that 32 percent of Americans said it was their most important issue. Of that voter group, 81 percent supported Trump while only 18 percent backed former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to CNN exit polling.\n\nOne year later, Democratic candidates’ focus on affordability played a key role in their sweep of major elections. The focus on affordability spanned ideology, as Mamdani, a socialist, as well as centrist Democrats Sherrill and Spanberger, all zeroed in on the economy during their campaigns.\n\nAbout the election last night and how Democrats in NYC, VA and NJ largely won by focusing on affordability and cost of living. This was seen as Trump and Republicans big winning issue in 2024 and as a key driver to Trump’s return to power. In this election, it appears Dems significantly reclaimed the issue for their party.\n\nSpanberger focused on issues such as the Trump administration’s federal layoffs, which may have been particularly salient in the state’s Washington, D.C., suburbs that are home to many federal workers. Sherrill emphasized issues including housing and energy costs, which loomed over the New Jersey gubernatorial race. Mamdani also discussed ways to tackle New York City’s high costs of living, including housing and transportation policies.\n\nTrump’s tariffs also loomed over each of these races. Trump has argued they will benefit America in the long term by bringing back jobs, but critics have said they would lead to higher prices for Americans.\n\nThe election suggests that Democrats’ economic message resonated with voters.\n\nIn New Jersey, 32 percent of voters said the economy remained the most important issue. Sherrill won those voters with 65 percent of the vote, while only 35 percent backed Ciattarelli (though he held an advantage among voters who said taxes were the most important issue), according to CNN’s exit poll.\n\nVirginia’s results told a similar story. Forty-eight percent of voters said the economy was the most important issue in the state. Spanberger won those voters by a 63-37 margin.\n\nTrump successfully tapped into voters’ sentiment about being “left behind” in the 2024 election and ran a campaign people could relate to, Anne Danehy, professor at Boston University’s College of Communications, told Newsweek. She pointed to his focus on the cost of eggs as an example of a “simple” message that proved to be effective for Republicans.\n\nBut voters are still facing steep prices and are now questioning whether his policies are helping, giving Democrats an opening on affordability, she said. Democrats this time around did a better job of contrasting their economic plans with those of Republicans, she added.\n\n“That contrasting message. But are [voters] going to give up on Republicans? Only if Democrats come up with really concrete ideas about how they’re going to improve their lives,” she said. “It has to be a really personal message.”\n\nStephen Farnsworth, political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, told Newsweek the shift underscores “the nature of politics.” In 2024, Republicans could attack the Biden economy, but now, Democrats can attack the Trump economy as voters are “unhappy with the status quo.”\n\nSpanberger’s campaign can be a model for Democrats moving forward, he said.\n\n“Spanberger is a good example of what Democrats can do. You stay focused on the economy. Whatever the question is, the answer relates to the problems that people have making ends meet,” he said.\n\nHarris last year was dealt a “terrible hand” but could have better connected with economically anxious voters by talking more about the minimum wage or expanding free lunch programs for students across the country, he said.\n\n“Things like that could have given her more traction,” ...","summary":"Democrats&#039; focus on affordability—an issue that helped Trump one year ago—fueled their victories in Tuesday&#039;s elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-flipped-script-donald-trump-republicans-10998624","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Democrats-Just-Flipped-the-Script-on-Donald-Trump-and-Republicans.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 18:26:30","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.125},{"id":376113100,"title":"Inside Zohran Mamdani's woke, celebrity filled victory party after socialist won NYC mayoral election","text":"Zohran Mamdani's supporters partied with celebrities and influencers as they reveled in the socialist's success at becoming the next mayor of New York City.\n\nThe mayor-elect's victory party in downtown Brooklyn on Tuesday night saw raucous crowds erupt as Mamdani, 34, cruised to victory.\n\nSupporters, many wearing tradition dress representing their cultures, first gathered at the Brooklyn Paramount Theatre. \n\nThey then moved on to the Someday Bar, a gay bar selling $16 cocktails, where Mamdani merchandise-clad voters celebrated into the night. \n\nCelebrities including SNL stars Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman, Sex and the City's Cynthia Nixon, singers Lorde and Maggie Rogers and Ella Emhoff, the step-daughter of former Vice President Kamala Harris, were spotted in attendance. \n\nActor Kal Penn shared smiling selfies with Mamdani and comedians Hasan Minhaj and Aasif Mandvi to Instagram, captioning his pictures: 'That's my mayor!' \n\nDemocrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also showed her support at the party and embraced controversial influencer Hasan Piker. \n\nPiker raised eyebrows with his remarks at the victory bash, declaring that Mamdani's win as a socialist was a turning point for America, a nation that he said 'defeated the Soviet Union, unfortunately.' \n\nWhen Mamdani eventually took the stage shortly before midnight, he declared himself to be 'a new era of leadership'. \n\nMamdani told his supporters that his victory over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo showed that 'the next generation of New Yorkers refused to accept that the promise of a better future was a relic of the past'. \n\n'You showed that when politics speaks to you without condescension, we can usher in a new era of leadership. We can fight for you because we are you,' he continued. \n\n'For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands. \n\n'And yet over the last 12 months, you have dared to reach for something greater. Tonight, against all odds, we have grasped it. The future is in our hands.' \n\nSupporters could be seen hugging and cheering throughout the night, celebrating the election of New York City's first Muslim mayor and its youngest since 1892. \n\nMamdani's victory speech also saw him take several swipes at his political opponents, including directing his remarks directly at the White House.\n\n'Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!' he said.\n\n'If any city can show a nation how to stop Donald Trump, it is the city that gave rise to him,' said Mamdani, who represents a district in the same borough of Queens where the President was raised.\n\n'So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one.' \n\nMamdani's winning address was quickly slammed by CNN's Van Jones, who described the aggressive rhetoric as a 'missed opportunity' to offer a message of hope to the nation. \n\nVan Jones said Mamdani's speech was a far cry from the message that won him the leadership contest, saying the rhetoric 'will cost him going forward.' \n\n'I think he missed an opportunity. I think the Mamdani that we saw in the campaign trail, who was a lot more calm, who was a lot warmer, who was a lot more embracing, was not present in that speech,' he said.\n\n'And I think that Mamdani is the one you need to hear from tonight. There are a lot of people trying to figure out, can I get on this train with him or not? Is he going to include me? Is he going to be more of a class warrior even in office?\n\n'I think he missed a chance tonight to open up and bring more people into the tent. I think his tone was sharp. I think he was using the microphone in a way that he was almost yelling.\n\n'And that's not the Mamdani that we've seen on TikTok and the great interviews and stuff like that.'\n\n'I felt like it was a little bit of a character switch here, where the warm, open, embracing guy that's close to working people was not on stage tonight,' the panelist said.\n\n'And there were some other voice on stage. That said, he's very young. And he just pulled off something very, very difficult.\n\n'And I wouldn't write him off, but I think he missed an opportunity to open himself up tonight.

I’m Jon Wiener. Later in the show, rock critic Greil Marcus will comment on the new film about Bruce Springsteen writing the songs for his 1984 album “Nebraska.” The film misses the context: Springsteen’s theme is working class decline in Reagan’s America. But first: Americans voted in several key elections on Tuesday – John Nichols has our analysis – in a minute.[BREAK]The Democratic victories were big on Tuesday, big everywhere. For comment and analysis, we turn, of course, to John Nichols. He’s executive editor of The Nation. John, welcome back.\n\nJN: It’s great to be with you, Jon.\n\nJW: Briefly, some of the highlights: in New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race with 56%. That’s a 13 point margin.In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s race with 58%. That’s a 16 point margin.In California, the redistricting initiative won with 64%. That’s a 28 point margin.In Pennsylvania, the three Democratic Supreme Court justices all won retention by 61%. That’s a 22% divide.And in New York, of course, Zohan Ani broke 50% in a three-way race. Let’s start with New York City. They have elected a mayor who’s a Muslim, a democratic socialist, and an immigrant — as he made very clear in his victory speech on Tuesday night. The pundits have all been saying New York City is unique. It’s a great place, it’s an important place, but what works in New York won’t work in most other places. But you and Katrina vanden Heuvel have a editorial posted at thenation.com where you say Mamdani ‘has the potential to transform not just a city, but the politics of a nation.’ Please explain.\n\nJN: Well, there’s simply no question that the New York mayoral race was nationalized. Mamdani did that to some extent on his own, simply because he was an incredibly dynamic and interesting candidate. Are there ideas? Are there tactics? Are there stances that can go beyond New York? The answer is absolutely yes. He won because he communicated aggressively. He reached out to people. He used social media in very creative and dynamic ways. He was open and blunt and human. That’s a lesson right there. You don’t have to adopt all his stance on every issue, but the approach, the boldness, the clarity, that’s useful.But then let’s get into the issues. What did he say? The most important thing is affordability. That people can afford to live where they reside, right? I mean, that’s nothing radical about that.\n\nJW: I don’t know. It sounds like communism to me.\n\nJN: [LAUGHTER] I know. To ask people, ‘what do you need to get by?’ And then to come up with practical proposals that can help ’em do it — That’s not radical. That’s what we used to call ‘politics.’ And it’s only because the billionaire consultant class has come in and tried to define politics so narrowly that anyone questions that. So of course, Mamdani is transferable, not in exact details, but again, in the boldness, in the clarity, in the focus on accountability.And if I can offer one more thing, Zorhan Mamdani spoke bluntly about Gaza. He did so from the start. Now, Gaza is not necessarily an issue that New York is going to have a profound impact on any given day. But it offered a clarity about where he was coming from, and when he was attacked on that, he didn’t back off his position. Mamdani has shown Democrats across the country that, on controversial issues, on challenging issues, if you hold firm to where you’re at, if you talk about it and if you willingly engage with people who disagree with you, you often can get the support of people who may be convinced to adopt your position. But even if they’re not, who say, look, this is a person to principle who believes in what they’re saying, and I can agree with them on a whole bunch of other things. I’m going to vote for this person. Even though we might have this disagreement. Democrats desperately need to learn that lesson.\n\nJW: Mamdani had, in the end, a hundred thousand volunteers doing canvassing, knocking on doors to get out the vote. Not since Obama has there been such a massive outpouring of volunteers who want to work for a candidate. Bernie, of course, also had a massive outpouring of volunteers. But Obama never did anything with his volunteer army, and Bernie hasn’t done much with his. What do you think Mamdani could do? What should he do? What do you think he’s likely to do with his a hundred thousand volunteers?\n\nJN: Well, that’s a very important question. Probably the most important — because we know that, now that he’s won, Zorhan Mamdani is going to face a pushback and assault from Washington and from the billionaire class that spent tens of millions trying to beat him. They’re not going to stop. So what Momani needs is to have that base highly mobilized, to push back — and to push forward. And what I’ve heard in talking to the Mamdani folks is that that has already been a part of the planning. When we interviewed Zorhan Mamdani for The Nation, we asked him about this months ago, and he said very clearly that he intends to keep using his social media in the way that he does, to keep moving around the city in the way that he does, essentially to keep campaigning. Of course, he has focus on governing. That’s a given. But in this case, to govern, he needs to have the people on his side in a big way.For many of the things that Mamdani wants to do, he needs the state of New York, particularly Governor Kathy Hochel, who did endorse him toward the end, to remove barriers, to get funding, et cetera. And so having a highly mobilized base in New York City that is clearly supportive of what Mamdani is doing, where you can see the numbers, where you can see the communications that has a real potential to move Hochel and New York State government. If that happens, then Mamdani can start posting successes.And this is the critical thing. Mamdani promised a lot. Now that he is going to be mayor, he does have to deliver. The more quickly he delivers on some of those core promises, the more space he will have on the really difficult ones. So I think having that organized base is critical. I think you’re going to see the launch of a project to keep the base organized. I will tell you, I think in the coming days.\n\nJW: Mamdani in his victory speech explicitly addressed four words to Trump. He said, quote, ‘turn the volume up.’ That’s a challenge. That’s a provocation. That’s kind of daring Trump to attack New York City. And it’s true that Trump can do a lot to hurt ordinary New Yorkers — first by sending his armies of deportation thugs; and then by cutting funds for vital public services.That will make Mamdani more important nationally as the leading target of Trump. But can he actually succeed at defending New York — or is this challenge, this provocation, reckless?\n\nJN: I don’t think it’s reckless. I think it relates to your previous question, and that is how do you organize a city to Trump-proof it, to have a base of people that are ready to respond in nonviolent ways if you’re in the streets, but also input very political ways by petitioning, by communicating, by letting Republicans in New York state, outside of the city know that New Yorkers want their city to succeed. They want to work with people. There’s so much about turning the volume up on the positive messages of Mamdani’s campaign that I see as smart politics. It’s not a provocation, right?Look, Trump has provoked again and again and again. I think what Mamdani is saying is that, in the face of Trump’s provocations, Mamdani wants the people in New York to say what they believe, to be confident, to be strong in the face of threats from other places.What we know about Donald Trump is that when he faces a city, a state, that is strong, there are instances where he has backed off. LA has seen a horrible assault, but then some backing down on the part of the feds. And I think that’s rooted in the fact that people in LA really organized strongly and really pushed back. Remember, one of the things that happened in LA was that you had people on the street, but you also had very mainstream politicians, all the way up the ladder, aligning with these movements that are saying that we don’t want our city invaded and we don’t want Donald Trump doing all the stuff that he does. And I think that what Mamdani is saying is that New York will similarly seek to resist where necessary, but also seek to build the political base to push back.And can I offer one final notion on that? The results from yesterday, not just in New York, but nationally, suggest that there is a much broader political base to be built, a much broader political movement to be built around some of the concepts we heard with the No Kings protests, around many of the concepts we saw expressed in this election. And so with that in mind, the possibility that we are entering into a new political space, one where it is possible to say ‘no’ to Donald Trump and to amplify that ‘no’. And then cause, if not Trump himself, at least some Republicans, to rethink — that’s certainly worth exploring.\n\nJW: We have to talk about California redistricting. The initiative Prop 50 got 64%. Yes. And a surprisingly big turnout. This was an election with no candidates and only one thing on the ballot, this proposition, it’ll create five more Democratic seats in the House to match Texas gerrymandering.It wasn’t clear at the beginning that this was going to do so well. At the outset, the ‘no’ side had a lot behind it. It had a lot of money: $10 million from a right wing billionaire was what funded the initial mailers. We got a couple of them right away in the first week. Former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was kind of the face of the vote.But Gavin Newsom succeeded. He raised, they say, $114 million. We saw ads on this World Series out here, ‘Vote Yes’ ads, that featured Obama, AOC, Elizabeth Warren, Senator Alex Padilla, and others. And they say there was $38 million raised in small donations from supporters, responding to those, let’s call them, ‘irritating’ text messages, emails, Instagram posts.The New York Times said that the success of Prop 50 redistricting in California has made Gavin Newsom ‘the Democrats’ chief antagonist to Trump.’ Do you think that’s right?\n\nJN: Probably. Look, I think even before Prop 50’s results were in, it had become clear that Newsom has worked very, very hard to kind of counter Trump on Trump’s own ground, if you will. And that is to create social media that is combative, that is funny, that is challenging, that is mocking of Trump. You have to be careful to differentiate between someone who is a face of opposition to Trump and someone who would necessarily replace Trump as president.I’ll say one other thing, Jon, and this is separate, apart from the personalities. The California intervention at this point shows, A., that you can push back against Trump, but also even in red states where they are redrawing lines — in Ohio, in Indiana, in Missouri — there’s an effort to grab some seats from Democrats for the Republicans. Now that you’ve seen the success of the California pushback, I think you will see pushbacks, for instance, Ohio, where you can petition a referendum onto the ballot that puts changes on hold. \n\nJW: Same in Missouri. Same in Missouri.\n\nJN: That’s right. It’s a lot of work. Right. But what inspires you to go out and work to do something like that, to push back, prevent the gerrymandering than a massive victory in California? I think it’s very influential.\n\nJW: We have to talk about Virginia. Virginia had been until this Tuesday, a purple state, it had a Republican governor, and a Republican State Attorney General. The state legislature was very closely divided. Tuesday night, I think we can say. we turned Virginia blue. Abigail Spanberger won by a massive 15% margin. She got 57.5% of the vote. Kamala Harris just a year ago got 52%. And the Republican vote in Virginia fell from 46% a year ago to 42% this week. The hard one, which Democrats won was electing the Democratic candidate for Attorney General Jay Jones, who won by a comfortable margin.In the end, the most amazing one was the House of Delegates, where we need a clear majority in order to do the redistricting that will create a couple of more Democratic House seats. In Virginia, Democrats won every single targeted district for the House of Delegates, flipped 13 seats, expanded the Democrat’s majority in the House of Delegates from a one-seat majority to 64 to 36. This is really a historic blue wave that is probably going to change the whole future of Virginia. And Abigail Spanberger just won more votes than any gubernatorial candidate in Virginia history. Do you think it’s right that we turned Virginia blue this week?\n\nJN: What goes beyond blue? I mean, that’s the question. I mean, what you saw in these results are it’s like deep blue right now. Now Virginia, it’s a state where I think you still have to work. And I think I would caution against over confidence. However, if you look at Virginia, there’s no place that they didn’t do better. Every county in Virginia, every single county, the most rural Republican areas, all shifted significantly toward the Democrats. And so it was a stunning victory. And I think, I’m not trying to avoid the Virginia question, but let’s put it in context. Virginia is a state that was historically a southern state. I think now because of the DC suburbs, we look at it differently.But another state that’s sort of in that kind of transition is Georgia. And in Georgia, which is very much a battleground state, they were winning statewide, public or state public service commission seats. Democrats winning in counties where they have never won or at least never won in the modern age, they were winning. Their numbers were up all over Georgia. To the extent that there are people who follow Georgia closely who say, if you had this pattern last year, a couple or four years ago in some recent elections, Democrats would’ve been in a very, very good position.And so I think what we need to take away from this is that everywhere across the country you saw movement. And what that movement was that purple states became blue. In some cases, red states became purple. And even in the Reds to red places, you saw breakthrough winds.What this tells us is that there’s a combination of things going on. First, there’s a pushback against Donald Trump. It’s real. It’s national. It runs deep.Secondly, there is a pushback against, frankly, and I’m trying to find the scientific word for it — Oh yeah, ‘stupid’ approach of Republicans to this negative advertising, right? They got this theory that you could go wildly over the top on immigrant rights, on trans rights, on a host of other issues. And that somehow attack ads that said wild, crazy, irresponsible things were going to work. I think this election showed that people have developed some real perspective about that, and they don’t work as well. And I think one final thing is it is possible, not certain, but it is possible that Democrats may finally be figuring out that mobilization of their base is the way to win. Right? And Mamdani did that surely in New York, but the Virginia mobilizations were very effective as well.\n\nJW: Yeah. So where does this leave Trump in the Republicans? Trump didn’t even try to campaign, wouldn’t spend any of his own money on his own candidates. Obviously, he didn’t want to be associated with the worst people in the world – Losers. Those turned out to be his candidates.And as you say, what are their issues? Trans athletes. That doesn’t seem to be something that worked. How about the menace of illegal aliens? The poll show people like immigrants, they think immigrants are good for America. Tariffs. Is that a winner? That’s a huge loser. I don’t think so.So how can Republicans maintain control of the House a year from now? Really, there’s only one way. Voter repression. Using the power of the federal government to prevent people from voting. Send federal troops to intimidate people outside polling places in blue cities. Try to disqualify the Democratic winners. And of course, the Supreme Court allowing unlimited gerrymandering.They can really only win by attacking the whole system of voting itself. And that won’t be easy, because voting in America is not controlled by the federal government. It’s controlled by the states, which then empower the counties. The county Registrar of Voters is the one who runs the voting system. So we’re going to see a big battle over voting suppression in the next year. And it could get pretty ugly.\n\nJN: It’ll get very ugly. Look, somebody asked me in another program or something recently, will Trump change because of this? Will he adjust who he is? Well, we’ve been asking that question for a decade. The guy doesn’t change. The fact of the matter is that Trump is likely to continue to be bombastic, to make threats, to try and use the federal government in ways that might benefit his allies, particularly political allies, but also economic allies. And so you’re going to see a lot of stuff, right? I mean, that’s all true. But I want to emphasize, Jon, we saw quite a bit of it already in New Jersey. New Jersey was a state where there seemed to be a lot of dirty tricks being played out by the Republicans release of military records that was far more extensive than was appropriate release of financial records against the Democratic candidate. A lot of threats, intimidation, especially in cities with large minority populations. The arrest of a sitting member of Congress when she tried to inspect a detention center, the threatened arrest or brief arrests of the Mayor of Newark. These things are not all related to the election, but they have a tension around them, a pressure, a highlighting of issues. And in New Jersey, I think there are many people who thought that that race for governor was going to be close, that it was going to narrow down. And what Sherrill, the Democratic candidate, did at the end was just run clips of ads showing her opponent saying he didn’t disagree with Trump on anything. And I think it devastated the opponent who had previously been a relatively mainstream New Jersey Republican.End result here is that I think we’ve had test cases. I think we’ve seen that you can push back. It doesn’t mean that it isn’t going to be difficult. I think it’s going to be very difficult, challenging time. But this election gives lot of hope for how you can challenge us.And if there’s one final thing I would suggest it is that I think that Trump is not the only Republican, right? The party is a cult of personality. He is central to it. He does threaten fellow Republicans. But after this election, if I’m a Republican from a congressional district that voted for Joe Biden and for Kamala Harris, as there are a number, if I’m a Republican who’s facing a tough reelection, am I going to do everything Trump tells me to do? Or am I going to try to scramble toward a somewhat more sane position? Most won’t, most will stay with Trump. But I think there is the possibility that you start to see some real, some fissures, some divides within the Republican party. And of course, if Trump and his allies get all freaked out about that and are focusing on discipline within their own party, that creates a much more open lane for Democrats to just head toward November of 2026 with renewed energy — and with perhaps an opening up of hope, not just to flip the House, but even perhaps with a mobilized turnout, the right candidates to flip the Senate.\n\nJW: ‘An opening of hope.’ John Nichols, read him at thenation.com. John, thanks for talking with us today.\n\nJN: Great pleasure to be with you, sir.[BREAK]\n\nJW: Now it’s time to talk about the new movie ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.’ It’s about Bruce Springsteen in 1982 writing the songs for his ‘Nebraska’ album. For that we turn to Greil Marcus. He’s written many books, mostly about American music, including ‘Lipstick Traces,’ and most recently ‘What Nails It.’ His column ‘Real Life Rock’ has been running since 1986. Now it’s at Substack. And his first book, the classic ‘Mystery Train,’ has just been reissued in a special 50th anniversary edition, with a new introduction by the author. We reached him today in Minneapolis. Greil, welcome back — and congratulations on the 50th anniversary of ‘Mystery Train.’\n\nGreil Marcus: Well, thank you. I’m glad to be talking with you again.\n\nJW: ‘Nebraska’ was the Springsteen album that followed ‘The River,’ which had been his first number one album. ‘The River’ had a gigantic tour, 140 shows, performances that lasted up to four hours. At Madison Square Garden, he did four sold out shows, a total of 80,000 people, all of them singing along on ‘Everybody’s got a hungry heart.’ And then he did ‘Nebraska.’ Please explain why that album was such a shock.\n\nGM: Well, It’s essentially a folk album that’s also a punk album. Dave Marsh said at the time that it had more in common with punk records like the Adverts’ ‘Gary Gilmore’s Eyes,’ which was a song about what if Gary Gilmore donated his eyes to science. to an eye bank, and you got them, and you’re living your life seeing through Gary Gilmore’s eyes. And the Sex Pistols’ ‘Bodies. That’s what Dave Mars said, that there is something absolutely raw, unfiltered, dangerous, and damaging in this record.It’s also a folk record. It also goes back to Dylan’s early albums, goes back to Woody Guthrie, goes back to murder ballads by Clarence Ashley and Doc Boggs in the 1920s and 1930s. And that’s what ‘Nebraska’ is made up of. That’s the cosmos he’s inhabiting.\n\nJW: So Springsteen’s new songs in 1982 came out of this old American tradition. But they also came out in a specific context: Reagan had just been elected president.\n\nGM: It seemed to me that this was the most powerful, the most detailed, the most felt rejection of Ronald Reagan’s America, which was meant to enrich the rich, impoverish the poor, marginalize everyone who wasn’t white, wasn’t male, didn’t deserve power. That seemed to me absolutely inescapable.\n\nJW: You wrote in 1982 about Springsteen’s characters on ‘Nebraska” that they “speak with the bleakest acceptance, with a refusal that does not know itself.” Close quote. I thought that was terrific.Now the movie has a different approach, let us say. This is the movie starring Jeremy Allen White of ‘The Bear.’ Director Scott Cooper explained recently that in the movie his Springsteen is just trying to ‘understand himself, to reclaim a piece of his humanity.’ And of course, Springsteen himself has written about being depressed after The River tour. But you think this is not just about trying to understand himself.\n\nGM: No, not at all. Look, I don’t care. I never care about the performer, the artist. I don’t care what Bruce Springsteen was going through. I don’t care what he thought he was writing about or what he thought his motives were, any more than I care about those questions when they apply to Lana Del Ray or Bob Dylan. They’re meaningless to me.What I’m interested in are the songs and what they say, what they say in the world. Once you put a song into the world, you lose control of it. Other people hear it and they hear it in ways that make sense to them and maybe make sense of their own lives or part of their lives. So I have no interest whatsoever in this being some sort of confessional album or, as it appeared to me in the movie, an album made by Bruce Springsteen’s inner child, working out his childhood traumas and somehow coming to grips with his place in the world, whatever it might be. I could care less.I know Bruce. I like Bruce. I consider him a friend. But I’m not interested in his work as autobiography or anybody’s, and I think it’s a reductive way to listen to watch. I got very, very tired in the movie of the black and white flashbacks to his childhood and his abusive father and his protective but Ineffectual mother. This album may not have had a social motive, but it draws a social picture and it creates social characters, characters who make political in a political movement.\n\nJW: I’d like to talk briefly about the song that ends the Nebraska album, ‘Reason to Believe.’ A lot of people see it as a kind of anthem of hope.\n\nGM: ‘Reason to Believe’: I know to Bruce meant this to be a deeply cynical song about how people will always fool themselves that things are going to get better, that everything is going to be okay, that there’s a way out — when there isn’t. And I remember talking to Bruce at the time about this song and his utter bafflement that people took this as some sort of redemptive or even uplifting song, and he said, ‘look, it starts out with a guy standing over a dead dog, thinking that if he stood there long enough, that dog would ‘get up and run.’ It’s dead. Don’t you get it?’Well, Jeremy Allen talks about discussing this song with Bruce, and Bruce said essentially exactly that there’s no hope in this song, and Jeremy Allen White says, ‘well, I feel hope in this song’. And then he says, ‘I said to Bruce, don’t you think that when you record a song you lose control of it? It’s out there in the world for people to make of what they want.’ And I completely agree with that. Jeremy Allen White’s sense of that song may be completely different from mine, but it’s his. So if he performs that song in the movie with an element of redemption in it, that’s because that’s how he feels that song and that’s the way he can’t help but put it across.\n\nJW: I find it hard to imagine anything more hopeless than this image of the dead dog in the ditch as our world that we live in now. So I am kind of with you on this.\n\nGM: There are verses that follow that aren’t as rough. ‘At the end of every hard working day, people find some reason to believe.’ And isn’t that great? Isn’t that what keeps us human? That’s how a lot of people heard that song.\n\nJW: There is in the movie a very uplifting moment towards the end where Springsteen’s manager, John Landau, alone in a room with Bruce, plays him of the 1955 record ‘Last Mile of the Way’ by the Soul Stirrers; Sam Cook was the lead singer of the Soul Stirrers in those days. Tell us about that part of the movie\n\nGM: That was fascinating to me and utterly moving. I didn’t know that song. I’d never heard it. So this was completely new to me. And its majesty, its depth, its range, the way it creates an entire world that you want to be part of was just kind of shocking. And to me, that scene of John Landau puts on this little cassette and he plays this song and he and Bruce just sit back and listen to it — What that said to me was this is showing both of them a picture of a place in music’s heaven that they will never reach, and yet it’s something to reach for, even though you’ll never make it. There’s no way that Bruce Springsteen or just about anybody else on Earth will ever be the singer that Sam Cook was, and yet you hear that, and you say, ‘I want to feel the way he must have felt when he sang that song. And so I’m going to sing a song that seems as true to me as that must have seemed to him at that moment and go as far as I can.’So a picture of how far there is to go, even if you’ll never get to the end of the road, even if you’ll never get to the end of that last mile. That’s a great thing. That was my favorite scene in the whole movie.\n\nJW: Let’s talk a little about ‘Mystery Train,’ the 50th anniversary edition. The subtitle of the book is ‘Images of America in Rock and Roll Music.’ It changed the thinking of a lot of us and in some cases it changed the lives of a lot of us. It’s about six musicians: Robert Johnson, Harmonica Frank, Randy Newman, the Band, Sly Stone, and most of all Elvis, and about how each absorbed and transformed their moment in American culture.Bruce Springsteen said about ‘Mystery Train’ that ‘it gets as close to the heart and soul of America and American music as the best of rock and roll.’ ‘Mystery Train’ I know as an Elvis song, his last song for Sun Records: “That long black train got my baby and gone.’ You say in the book, ‘it’s one of those songs that say, “this is the way the world is and there’s nothing you or anyone can do about it.”’ But actually Elvis does something with this song. What is it?\n\nGM: Here is a song that goes back, it goes way back. It goes back most explicitly to 1930 when the Carter family recorded ‘Worried Man Blues’: ‘It takes a worried man to sing a worried song/I’m worried now, but I won’t be worried long’– meaning ‘I’ll be dead.’\n\nJW: They’ll be dead – and they’ll be in heaven. That’s why they’re not worried.\n\nGM: It’s a song that came out a year into the Depression, when the country was falling apart, when people were losing their jobs, when they were starving, two years before Franklin Roosevelt became president, and this is a song that touched a nerve all over the country. People heard this song as describing their lives.In that moment, a man lays down by the river to sleep, he wakes up, he’s bound in chains. He has no idea what he’s supposed to have done. There is no court, there’s nothing to appeal to. It’s just a completely absurd situation that described the actual lives in an allegorical way of anyone who listened to it in 1930.And this song travels through the decades until 1953 when Sam Phillips and Junior Parker write a new song, based on ‘Worried Man Blues,’ about a train. They take one verse out of ‘Worried Man Blues”: ‘Train I ride, 16 coaches long’: there’s a woman on this train and the singer can’t reach her. It takes her away from him.When Elvis records this song two years later in 1955, like you say, it’s the last record that he would make at Sun Records before he goes off to New York and RCA and world stardom. He sings the song as Sam Phillips and Junior Parker rewrote it. He sings it as this incomprehensible tragedy. But he turns it around. He chases the train down. ‘It took my baby, but it never will again. No, not again.’ And at the very end of the record, you can hear him laughing, just breaking out in laughter. I don’t know if that’s because he’s laughing that he did such a fantastic job singing the song, or if he’s laughing at the idea that the train thought it stole his baby and he got her back. I don’t know.It is an ending of triumph, of self-belief, of victory in the shadows, in the middle of an allegory. You’re not supposed to go into an allegory and come back with a prize. And it’s just marvelous. He is singing a blues and he turns the blues inside out and it rings absolutely true. It doesn’t sound like, ‘oh, let’s pretty this up. Let’s give this a happy ending. People like happy endings.’ It’s not like that at all. So it is just a marvelous moment.I was going to call this book ‘Photograph Blues’ after a song by Robert Johnson, but after I was listening to Elvis for a couple of years and listening to songs hundreds of times: ‘Mystery Train’ — God, what a great title. I’m going to take that.\n\nJW: Thank you for using it!\n\nGM: If that book had been called ‘Phonograph Blues,’ it never would’ve lived a life. There would be no 50th anniversary of ‘Phonograph Blues.’\n\nJW: The original text of ‘Mystery Train’ was 172 pages. The ‘Notes and Discographies’ at the end have been updated and expanded, and now are almost 275 pages. That’s because you’ve kept up with the literature. I have to say, there’s some fabulous things in the notes: Barack Obama singing Robert Johnson’s ‘Sweet Home Chicago’ at a White House gala in 2012. You have a link to the video. How did he do?\n\nGM: He sang the song as if he’d heard it all his life. He sang the song is like, ‘I know this. You know this.’ And you’ve heard Barack Obama sing ‘Amazing Grace.’ He can sing.\n\nJW: Greil Marcus wrote about the movie ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere’ at the latest Real Life Rock at Substack. Greil, thanks for talking with us today, and congrats again on the 50th anniversary of ‘Mystery Train.’ \n\nGM: Thank you.

From the start, his team outclassed his opponents online, publishing highly produced videos that reached massive audiences.\nBut that’s only half of the story. Much of the content about Mamdani online isn’t just coming from his campaign or the dozens of political influencers invited to cover it. It has come from his fans.\nFor the past few months, feeds have been filled with fancams, fan art, and videos created not just with Mamdani but for him. This form of participatory online fandom has traditionally been reserved for celebrities and musicians like Taylor Swift or K-pop idols. The young voters who came out in support of Mamdani in droves this week grew up engaging with their favs online in these ways, establishing something incredibly rare for the 34-year-old mayor-elect—a fandom.\n“They are using their experiences from online fandom to do politics,” says Ashley Hinck, an associate professor at Xavier University who teaches digital media and online communication. “Those are the skills to engage with culture and that means those are the skills we use to engage with politics.”\nThe Mamdani campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis fandom doesn’t look like average political organizing. Online, clips of Mamdani speaking at rallies and with influencers get remixed into tight video posts set to Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind,” songs from the Broadway musical Hamilton” or Charli xcx’s Brat. Digital artists have posted videos of them drawing Mamdani in their own styles. Mamdani’s own campaign quips, like when he instructed opponent Andrew Cuomo on how to pronounce his last name, have been edited into campaign anthems.\nUnlike many politicians online of late, the Mamdani campaign’s official social media presence avoided AI-generated content and the focus on popular audio trends, becoming a rare source of substance in slop-filled feeds. While other Democratic officials post online to manufacture authenticity with voters, Mamdani, voters say, simply shows up. He uses social media with the same seriousness he brings to issues like housing and affordability. This approach provides his audience with something tangible that they can engage with online in their own language, creating a community around Mamdani that exists online as well as in real life.\n“He's maintained utmost professionalism throughout the campaign, but he lets the fun swirl around him,” says Ravi Mangla, national press secretary for the progressive Working Families Party, which essentially endorsed Mamdani. “He encourages that culture around him, while he himself remains kind of laser-focused on politics, on this campaign, and on the real issues that people are facing.”\nWhile the Mamdani campaign invested heavily in creating its own slick content that focused on the issues, it also partnered with countless other creators based in New York City and across the country. Often, the creators were already eager to collaborate with Mamdani, making the interaction more communal instead of purely transactional. In doing so, the campaign expanded its reach online while also feeding the fandom machine.\nLauren Kapp, a digital strategist on the Kamala Harris campaign, tells WIRED that “a large portion of this is just the sheer accessibility of being able to clip Zohran in a way that we haven't really seen with most candidates before.”\nFor Democrats wanting to repeat the magic, simply posting won’t be enough. Mamdani’s fandom and excited voters transcended the internet and into the real world as well. Last week, a handful of creators joined Mamdani at an event with a local senior center. There, influencers mixed with elderly voters, painting with watercolors, drinking wine, and discussing politics.\n“I think I got invited to like make political content,” Christian Divyne, a TikTok creator with more than 700,000 followers, said in a video at the event posted to the platform last week. “I just did the paint and sip.” (Divyne later conducted a brief interview with Mamdani where he asked how his audience could encourage their families and friends to go out and vote in the election.)\nIn August, the campaign invited New Yorkers out for a scavenger hunt where they solved a series of clues by traveling across the city’s boroughs. The campaign sponsored meetups at bars where some of its nearly 100,000 volunteers could debrief after long days of door-knocking or cold-calling.\n“Doing social media well is about clicking the right buttons or posting at the right time or using the right phrases for the SEO,” says Hinck. “But fandom is about building a community that cares about values.”\nThis fandom, both online and off, will be one of Mamdani’s most valuable assets when he’s officially sworn in as mayor. Campaign cycles end, but fan communities endure. More importantly, they participate, fundraise, and come to the defense of the people they stan.","summary":"Much of the content about Mamdani online hasn’t come from his campaign or the dozens of political influencers invited to cover it.

Take the fight to the right | Aditya Chakrabortty","text":"Zohran Mamdani was forged in the era of Donald Trump. He came to socialism through watching Bernie Sanders run for the US presidency in 2016, in the contest that ultimately gave us Trump I. Last November, a few days after the election of Trump II, he asked voters why they’d backed that guy. The conversations prepared Mamdani in his battle for New York, and the film of them reveals so much about the politics of this era that it repays watching.\n\nThose of us schooled in the tactics of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair might roll our eyes at yet another “listening exercise”, starring a powerbroker and his retinue in some beautifully lit hall, but this is no such thing. Here stands an unknown on a street corner in the Bronx, waving a placard as doughtily as a Seventh-Day Adventist. Rather than read off a Rolodex of platitudes, this politician sees his public – some of whom look a little like him, yet whose faces and bodies are etched with the strains of the city. Never having spoken to power, even a lowly state assemblyman such as Mamdani, they talk of lives made smaller and shorter in an economy where the daily basics are too costly. Politics has failed them, so they consider politicians to be failures.\n\nSuch frustrations propelled Trump into the White House. This week they made Mamdani mayor of the US’s largest city. Analysts have often put the two side by side, only to utter banalities about how they are both good on TikTok or – that giveaway from pundits striving to earn their keep – “populist”. Yet the comparison carries far higher stakes.\n\nBoth New Yorkers, they embody opposite sides of the metropolis: Manhattan versus its suburbs ; towers versus the streets. They also represent alternative paths for the US. Trump leads his country towards ethnonationalism and Darwinian economics; Mamdani stands for immigrants and a city affordable for all. Crucially, he understands the urban working class is not just white, but often black and brown. It is only through an understanding of the grave dangers posed by Trump that you can glean the hopes vested in Mamdani.\n\nA few examples: in September, Trump’s guards grabbed Korean engineers, who had their papers in order, from a Hyundai factory to force them out of the country and thousands of miles away. Last month, ICE agents abducted a British journalist travelling the US on a valid visa for criticising the brutalities committed by Israel. Last week, only hours before 42 million low-income Americans lost their access to food aid, the president hosted a Great Gatsby-themed bash, featuring a scantily clad woman in a giant martini glass. The fete was titled: “A little party never killed nobody.”\n\nSuch guffawing, lethal thuggishness is why other cities are so enlivened by a contest of otherwise glancing importance to their own lives. Even in a globalised social media, the question of who heads five boroughs on the eastern seaboard of the US does not usually command transnational significance. In the country, the centre of financial power is shifting from east coast to west, from Atlantic to Pacific, Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Nor does the new boy’s crowd appeal derive solely from his youth and charm, or even his recognition of the enduring greatness of the Wu-Tang Clan – although none of those hurt.\n\nStill, the chief reason Mamdani has aroused such keen interest is because he is the first leftwinger to show that politicians can not only face down Trumpism, they can beat him. That is the defining task of our era, as New York’s new mayor knows. Amid the thank-yous of last night’s victory speech, he declared: “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.”\n\nOver the past year of Trump II, the finest talents on the centre-left have been stumped how to respond. Obama? Almost nothing. Kamala Harris? Writing her memoirs, of course. The fiercest hostility to Mamdani has come from those supposed to be on his side. After losing in the primary, serial sex pest Andrew Cuomo ran as an independent – and campaigned as Trump’s pick in this week’s contest. The man who is today the first Muslim to lead New York has faced constant innuendo that he is a terrorist sympathiser.\n\nAcross Europe, the prefects of social democracy have kowtowed to the US’s extremist-in-chief. Keir Starmer treated him to an unprecedented second state visit, while Nato chief Mark Rutte has called him “daddy”. Five years ago, US media moguls took the knee to show off their commitment to diversity; now they bend the knee to a racist loudmouth. Columnists and podcasters talk utter sausage about a “vibe shift” in US politics, even while two days of mass rallies against Trumpism drew something like 12 million people.\n\nThe centre-left should be taking on the extreme right and acting as the anti-Trump. Instead, as Fintan O’Toole writes in the latest New York Review of Books, it is playing at being not-Trump. Or: not-Farage, not-Weidel, not-Le Pen. In the UK, Starmer’s pitch is basically: we’ll adopt the language and the flags, but deploy them with greater civility. As a response to this moment, it is morally contemptible and politically myopic.\n\nIn his fine new book The Great Global Transformation, the former World Bank economist Branko Milanovic describes how our political and economic order is now coming to an end. China and the global south now account for more of the world economy than the US, Japan, Europe and the many others put together that he terms the “capitalist core”; at the same time, capitalism is being redefined. The elites who prospered under the regimes shaped by Reagan and Thatcher are now redefining their nations into narrower, meaner, harsher societies, ditching the old commitments to multiculturalism and equality for women. They are forcing upon the rest of us capitalism without secure contracts, unions or even the HR department.\n\nHold Milanovic’s lens over Trump and what do you see? Not an all-powerful emperor, nor some scheming bureaucrat like Putin – but the US’s Yeltsin. He is the buffoon presiding over his country’s decline in influence and importance, while behind him in the shadows the oligarchs carve up the spoils. And if democracy proves too troublesome, why, they’ll buy it. One of the biggest players in the New York elections was hedge-fund guy Bill Ackman, who offered to bankroll anyone who could bring down Mamdani.\n\nIn the 90s and 00s, the centre-left’s response to Reagan and Thatcher was Clinton, Blair and the third way. They compromised with the new money and triangulated their electoral bases – and they held power, for a while.\n\nBut this is a new era: you can’t reach an accommodation with an ICE agent when he’s kneeling on your neck. Climate chaos does not come with a moderate option. An oligarch is not interested in your pitiful attempts to strike a deal. To see the logical endpoint of the new left’s embrace of money, look no further than Peter Mandelson. Famous for being “intensely relaxed” about people getting filthy rich, he became especially relaxed in the company of the filthy rich, such as money man and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein – and is now discovering anew the meaning of “disgraced”.\n\nThe old foxholes and get-out clauses, abstractions and moist eyes, won’t work for the left now. Voters don’t talk about inequality; they worry about paying the bills and getting by. The young aren’t mollified by talk of “suffering” in Gaza; they want it stopped. And bang opposite, the right are bending politics and economics to their will.\n\nYou can see the past year between Trump’s election and Mamdani’s as real-time dialectic. Thesis, antithesis; right hook, southpaw. It is foolish to pretend that there is any equivalence of power between the White House and Gracie Mansion, but at least the left is still in the fight.\n\n Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist","summary":"For too long, the centre has been adopting the language of the right but deploying it with greater civility – to disastrous ends\n\nZohran Mamdani was forged in the era of Donald Trump.

I don't think it was good for Republicans. I'm not sure it was good for anybody, but we had an interesting evening, and we learned a lot,” Trump said. \n\nHe also suggested that the now record-breaking 36-day government shutdown — the longest in American history — had been a “big factor” that was a “negative for Republicans” and called for Congress to “get the government back open soon, and really immediately.”\n\nBut the president’s concession that keeping hundreds of thousands of federal workers at home on furlough or forcing them to work without pay for more than a month might have been a bad look for Republicans — particularly in Virginia, home to countless civil servants — was not a prelude to a call for the sorts of bipartisan talks that have ended prior funding impasses.\n\nInstead, he offered a solution that indicates absolutely no understanding of what voters were trying to tell him in last night’s election returns. Rather than admit that any problem exists, he exhorted senators to blow up the few remaining levers of power that Democrats currently hold by ending the upper chamber’s 60-vote threshold for most legislation.\n\n“I think it's very important, we have to get the country up. And the way we're going to do it this afternoon is to terminate the filibuster,” Trump said.\n\nIt’s an idea that’s almost certainly dead-on-arrival with most of the Senate GOP, many of whom have long opposed scrapping the supermajority requirement because it provides a useful check against Democrats when the GOP is out of power and forces senators to compromise when writing legislation that needs broad, bipartisan support to pass.\n\nMajority Leader John Thune, who has served in the upper chamber for two decades, admitted as such earlier this week when he told reporters the so-called “nuclear option” lacks enough support to garner the 51 votes (or 50 with the support of Vice President JD Vance) it would need to change the Senate’s standing rules. \n\nWhile Trump appeared to concede this point when he told senators it was “possible” that they would not scrap the filibuster and said he’d abide by their wishes, his justification for making the request revealed his lack of comprehension of last night’s results. \n\nEliminating Democrats’ ability to block legislation by requiring bills to receive 60 votes, he said, would let Republicans use their current unified control of Washington to pass a laundry list of GOP proposals that would lock Democrats out of power for a generation.\n\n“They'll most likely never attain power, because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine that is good and all good for the country, and there'll be no reason [to elect Democrats],” he said. \n\n “If you don't terminate the filibuster, we won't pass any legislation.”\n\nFor example, he suggested passage of a national voter ID law in response to last night’s California special election in which voters approved a ballot measure to temporarily alter the state’s congressional map in response to Republican gerrymandering in Texas. \n\n“We should pass all the things that we want to make our election is secure and safe, because California is a disaster. Many of the states are disasters,” he said.\n\nWhat went unsaid is that the legislation Trump wants to the Senate to pass after ditching the filibuster is almost entirely explicitly partisan — and deeply unpopular with the majority of voters who will decide whether to keep unified GOP control of Washington one year hence. \n\nBut 10 months into Trump’s second term, it’s clear he either doesn’t understand that the things that routinely get bottled up by the Senate’s supermajority requirement are unpopular — or he doesn’t care, because he’s been told the proposals are popular among his most fervent supporters.\n\nRight now, the MAGA faithful appear to be the only ones who are still all-in on the wholesale gutting and rebuilding of the government — and the country — in his image. \n\nLast night, Democratic candidates in both the Garden State and the Old Dominion carried bellwether counties where he’d made significant inroads just a year earlier by massive margins. The Latino voters and non-college-educated voters who powered his victory over then-vice president Kamala Harris in seven swing states last year swung back towards Sherrill and Spanberger by significant margins. \n\nEven Jason Jones, the embattled Democratic candidate for Virginia Attorney General, trounced his GOP incumbent opponent despite his history of disturbing and violent rhetoric about Republicans in the state legislature — and their children. \n\nIt was a clear signal that after ten months of DOGE layoffs, massive tax increases imposed by executive fiat, masked ICE and CBP agents and officers snatching non-white people off the street without warning, the revenge rampage against Trump’s adversaries and the literal demolition of the White House’s East Wing without any meaningful action to address the affordability issues he was elected to address, voters want him to change course.\n\nIt’s a message that one of Trump’s predecessors, Barack Obama, understood well. \n\nAfter his party took what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterm elections, he suggested the reason was that he’d lost touch with voters while enacting an agenda they weren’t fully on board with.\n\n\"There is an inherent danger in being in the White House and being in the bubble ... sometimes we lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place,” he said.\n\nTrump’s call to kill the filibuster after last night’s results shows he, like Obama, is trapped in that same “bubble.”","summary":"President’s demand for Republican senators to scrap filibuster shows he has no interest in hearing what voters have to say, writes Andrew Feinberg","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-virginia-new-jersey-elections-filibuster-b2859174.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/05/14/55/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-8gv04h09.jpeg?crop=7951.5,5301,x0.2,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/etYtjHqe-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-05 18:02:30","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.456},{"id":376117414,"title":"Election Night Ratings: MSNBC Tops Primetime Cable News Coverage With 2.9 Million Viewers","text":"Election night’s Democratic wins boosted MSNBC to lead the pack among its fellow cable news networks in primetime as the network secured its most-watched day and night since Election Day 2024.\n\nMSNBC averaged 2.92 million total viewers in primetime, outpacing Fox News, which averaged 2.76 million viewers, as well as CNN, which averaged 1.68 million viewers, according to Nielsen fast national ratings, which exclude out-of-home viewing.

It’s evidence that hatred of Trump’s party runs deep among many Democrats. \n\nThe most significant swing from 2024 was in Northern Virginia, part of metro Washington, which cast 33% of the state’s votes. That’s a high-education, upscale community with a high percentage of federal and government contractor employees, but Republicans would be unwise to dismiss the Democratic gains as just a response to the government shutdown. It could be a forecast of what’s in store for them in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania; Oakland County, Michigan; and Waukesha County, Wisconsin. \n\nIn New Jersey, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D), a Navy veteran, beat Republican Jack Ciatarelli by 56 to 43 percent, a big improvement on incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy’s 51 to 48 percent squeaker against Ciatarelli four years ago. Sherrill’s majority looked much like the 57 to 41 Democratic advantage in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections, which caused it to seem a solid blue state. \n\nThe big difference is that Ciatarelli was unable to duplicate the big gains that Trump made among Hispanic voters. Trump carried heavily Hispanic Passaic County with 50 percent; it voted only 42 percent Republican this year. Similarly, in Virginia, even Jason Miyares, despite his Hispanic ancestry, won only 37% in heavily Hispanic Prince William County. \n\nNew Jersey and Virginia also have large Asian populations. But Ciatarelli won only 37 percent in heavily South Asian Middlesex County, behind Trump’s 44 percent, and in heavily Asian Loudoun County, Virginia, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears’s 35 percent was below Trump’s 40 percent. \n\nHas the Trump administration’s rough-and-ready immigration enforcement hurt his fellow Republicans? Or are we just seeing sags in turnout from low-propensity voters in low-propensity constituencies, as we have in previous contests a year after their side wins, as Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini suggests? \n\nA possible cross-current: The Republican percentages held up pretty closely to Trump’s 2024 percentage in Monmouth and Ocean Counties on the Jersey Shore, whose demographics are similar to much of Florida’s, and in rural Southside and Southwest Virginia. \n\nThen there is New York City, similarly sized (8 million-plus) to New Jersey and Virginia, whose record (since 1969) turnout of 2 million-plus was nonetheless lower than each of those states’ 3 million-plus. \n\nSince he won the June primary, the young (he turned 34 last month) Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani has had wide leads in polls. His cheerful demeanor and clever ads, plus his emphasis on cost-of-living issues (free buses, city-owned grocery stores) has naturally produced sympathetic coverage from most media. \n\nThese media outlets have been happy to gloss over his positive attitudes toward terror-sponsoring Hamas and his immediate reaction to its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. They weren’t bothered by his protracted stubbornness in renouncing the “globalize the intifada” slogan (which means kill Jews everywhere) he once embraced. For months, he had wide leads in the polls thanks to split opposition from widely disliked former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. \n\nBut the results, with 91% of the votes in, have been somewhat different. In a city that voted 68 to 30% for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump, Mamdani is leading Cuomo by a decisive but far from overwhelming 50 to 42%, with just 7% for Sliwa. \n\nWhile Democrats improved on Harris’s performance in Virginia and New Jersey, Mamdani far underperformed Harris in New York City. One-quarter of New York’s Harris voters voted for the Republican or for the candidate endorsed by Trump. Mamdani’s core constituency is high-education, lower-income singles who congregate in central cities and university towns — what I’ve called the barista proletariat — a large bloc in New York City and decisive in the 2023 mayor race in Chicago but a small segment of the electorate in most of America. \n\nAs the Democratic nominee, Mamdani ran better among black people in central Brooklyn and southeast Queens than he had in the primary, and ran well below but still carried Puerto Rican and Dominican neighborhoods in the Bronx and northern Manhattan and, narrowly, heavily Mexican Corona. And he lost heavily Asian parts of Queens, though not quite as lopsidedly as Italian neighborhoods in Staten Island and Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn.\n\nMamdani’s weakness among some Democratic constituencies does not represent a danger for the party across the country generally. But it does suggest that the socialist wing of the party, and those Democrats whose antipathy to Israel can verge on antisemitism, are far from a majority force nationally. It underlines the importance, in my view, for conservatives to follow the example of Ronald Reagan and William Buckley in denouncing those like Tucker Carlson who have provided a friendly forum for the Nazi sympathizer Nick Fuentes.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump faces a tough constituency today: the Supreme Court. Will the justices, including those he appointed, accept his claim that the gauzy language of a 1977 law gives him the power to raise and lower his beloved tariffs singlehandedly? There’s a serious chance the majority-Republican-appointed Court may reject that claim, as a totally Democratic-appointed Court in 1952 rejected Harry Truman’s claim that he could seize the steel mills in wartime. \n\nA Supreme Court rebuff to Trump could turn out to be a political gift to the Trump Republican Party. Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs in April thrust his job approval downward and 3% inflation, which, though low, can be plausibly linked to continuing tariffs, provides a basis, as Mamdani has shown, for Democratic campaigns. Also, should Trump acquiesce to an adverse Court decision, as Truman did 73 years ago, voters’ fears of an authoritarian presidency will be mitigated.","summary":"Virginia and New Jersey, the two states that voted for governor, both voted for Vice President Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump by 52 to 46 percent margins.

Texas rammed through its maps, even as Democrats in the state legislature absconded in an attention-grabbing, yet ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to deny quorum. Meanwhile, in California, Mitchell dug into the data and discovered not only that it would be possible to retaliate by drawing five friendlier districts for Democrats but that voters just might approve of the plan. And so Newsom and his allies teed up a ballot measure—known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act—that would ask Californians to sanction a temporary revision of the state’s congressional lines, with the proviso that the independent commission would kick back in after 2030. Opponents of the proposition got a boost when the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger—the godfather, to mix movie metaphors, of the independent commission—warned that “two bad behaviors don’t make a right behavior.” But the “No” campaign ended up outgunned. Good-government groups that typically oppose partisan redistricting stayed on the sideline; former President Barack Obama got off of it to support Prop 50, despite his own past advocacy for nonpartisan mapmaking. On Tuesday, the polls closed, and the measure’s victory was called almost immediately. “We stood firm in response to Donald Trump’s recklessness,” Newsom said. “After poking the bear, this bear roared.”\nAs Texas and California made their moves, the redistricting war spread across the nation. Initially, it looked as though Republicans, who currently enjoy a razor-thin 219–213 majority in the House—not counting an Arizona Democrat who has yet to be seated, after winning a special election in September—would have more opportunities to create favorable seats. Democrats, in the states they control, appeared hamstrung by a combination of institutional constraints, a lack of political will to circumvent them, and maps that were already disproportionately blue, making it hard to squeeze out further advantage. Last week, for instance, the leader of the Maryland Senate rejected a push to redraw the state’s sole Republican seat, citing both legal difficulties and philosophical opposition. (This week, Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, pressed ahead, but it’s not yet clear how he’ll overcome the Senate-shaped obstacle.)\nRepublicans, meanwhile, voted to nix the seats of two Democratic congressmen—one in North Carolina, and one in Missouri. But the Missouri seat may yet survive, at least into 2026, if opponents succeed in forcing a referendum on the new map. And a maneuver to remove a Democratic seat in Kansas has stalled, at least for now, as have similar pushes in Nebraska and New Hampshire, despite sharp pressure from Trump. The pressure has perhaps been most obvious in Indiana, where Vice-President J. D. Vance has twice dropped by to cajole state Republicans into carving out a likely extra seat or two. The campaign made some headway: one reluctant state lawmaker flipped from “hard no” to “hell yes,” citing (and you really couldn’t make this up) an epiphany during treatment at Indiana Spine Hospital; last week, the state’s governor, Mike Braun, called a special session to move the ball forward. But it’s still far from clear whether he has the votes.\nWhat is clear is that both parties are eying more targets: recently, Democrats in Virginia, who already controlled the state legislature and ran the table in off-year elections this week, unexpectedly commenced a plan to net up to three U.S. House seats next year, though the process is complex and the timing tight; Florida Republicans could flip even more, though that, too, is shrouded in uncertainty. Despite Trump’s efforts, it’s hard to say what impact the redistricting war will have on the balance of seats in the midterms, which, as of this week, are less than a year away. It’s even hard to say whether redistricting will wind up being the most egregious element of Trump’s wider efforts to keep the House under his control.\nTrump has smashed precedent by triggering a mid-decade redistricting war that is divorced from the census. Sort of, anyway—this kind of partisan, mid-decade redistricting happened all the time in the late nineteenth century. (Ohio, for instance, redrew its congressional lines seven times in fifteen years.) The practice declined after that, but this had more to do with specific patterns of partisan control and polarization than an outbreak of good conscience, and in 2003 Texas (where else?) brought it back when state Republicans, then at a disadvantage in terms of congressional representation, forced a gerrymander through the state legislature. The new maps had “a revolutionary effect,” Lawrence Wright wrote in this magazine, in 2017. By then, Texas had twenty-five Republicans and eleven Democrats in its U.S. House delegation, “a far more conservative profile than the political demography of the state.”\nThe skew in Texas mirrored national trends: in the wake of Republicans’ 2010 gains, Democrats could conceivably have won the national popular vote by five percentage points or more and not won a majority of House seats. But that advantage eroded, such that, by last year, “the party that won the most votes for the House was quite likely to win the most seats,” as Nate Cohn, the data maven at the Times, recently explained to my colleague Isaac Chotiner. There are a variety of reasons for this reversal. Several states created California-style independent processes that took map-drawing out of politicians’ hands, and some state courts overturned partisan maps. In others, Democrats aggressively countered Republican gerrymanders with their own.\nChanging voting patterns also played a role, as did (at least at the margins) what political scientists call “dummymandering,” a term—named for the Massachusetts governor Elbridge Dummy (just kidding)—that describes when gerrymanderers inadvertently spread their party’s votes too thin, or fail to correctly predict voter behavior. Especially since Trump first won, in 2016, “our politics have been very volatile,” Michael Li, an attorney focussed on redistricting and voting rights at the Brennan Center, told me. When politicians gerrymander, “you’re placing a big bet that you know what the politics of the future look like, and if you’re wrong, it can really backfire.” By way of example, Li pointed me, again, to Texas, where state legislative maps drawn to maximize G.O.P. gains after 2010 proved less advantageous by 2018, when suburbs of Dallas, for instance, swung to the left, and demographic shifts made heavily white districts more diverse.\nLast year, politics shifted again: Trump performed surprisingly well with Latino voters in Texas, according to exit polls, winning fifty-five per cent to Kamala Harris’s forty-four. Since then, his approval among Latinos nationally has receded, and, after Texas passed its new maps this year, some Democrats expressed optimism that Republicans in the state might prove to be dummies—that the projection of five new seats was based on a risky bet that Latino voters would stick with the Party at Trump-2024 levels. Mitchell, who drew California’s retaliatory maps, told me that his Texas counterparts may have made existing G.O.P. seats less safe. (Mitchell claims that his maps in California will offer Democrats pickup opportunities and shore up vulnerable incumbents.) According to the Texas Tribune, Republicans in Texas were reluctant to redraw the maps before Trump demanded that they do so.\nThe independent data journalist G. Elliott Morris, however, told me that the Texas redistricting does not look like a dummymander, and other observers agree. (A lawsuit challenging the new maps alleges that they were drawn to distribute Latino voters who have lower rates of turnout in a manner that amounts to disenfranchisement.) Morris told me that, nationally, the worst-case net outcome of the current redistricting war for Democrats would lead to “potentially a pretty big drop” in representation. But predicting the precise number of seats they might lose is tricky, given that redistricting efforts remain in flux in several states—in addition to the purely partisan tit-for-tat, Utah and Ohio have been in the throes of mid-decade redistricting for mandated legal reasons—and, dummymanders or not, voter behavior can indeed buck expectations, especially in this era. (At least one Republican operative has expressed concern that moderate voters could punish the Party for initiating the mid-decade redistricting, which smacks of foul play.) Cohn told Chotiner that Democrats may have to win the over-all House vote by two or three points to gain the most seats in 2026—not a fair requirement, but hardly an insurmountable one given Trump’s unpopularity. If they fail, they won’t be able to blame redistricting alone.\nWell, they might be able to. Recently, the Supreme Court heard a case that could gut Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which currently prohibits racial discrimination in mapmaking and has been, as the law professor Atiba Ellis told NPR, “the most important check” on partisan gerrymanders in many G.O.P.-led states in the South. The weakening of Section 2 could swing as many as nineteen House seats in Republicans’ favor; even a lesser effect, per Cohn, would put Democrats severely on the back foot.\nMany observers expect the challenge to the V.R.A. to succeed. But it’s not clear whether the Justices will move in time for Republicans to reap the benefits next year. The Court normally issues decisions in June or July, and could explicitly state that its verdict doesn’t apply to the 2026 cycle. And even if it were to expedite the process and give G.O.P. mapmakers extra fodder, redistricting would not be the only dirty trick for Democrats to worry about next year. Trump, after all, seeks to tilt the playing field any way he can; just this week, he called the Proposition 50 vote in California a “GIANT SCAM” and warned darkly, if vaguely, that the process is “under very serious legal and criminal review.” Where does redistricting rank in light of all his other threats?\nIn this scary new world, partisan redistricting can look almost like politics as usual, even if Trump has pushed past the normal ways of doing it. But redistricting could help enable darker maneuvers; the Princeton professor Sam Wang has argued, for instance, that even if the two parties’ gains roughly cancel each other out, which he sees as likely, they will reduce the already low number of competitive districts, allowing Trump and his allies to concentrate, for instance, their preëlection ICE deployments and post-election lawsuits. And what is essentially cheating can only further erode Americans’ faith in the electoral system, especially when it is so overt. Texas Republicans may have cited (spurious) legal reasons for their redistricting push, but Trump, as he so often does, said the quiet part out loud when he claimed that he was “entitled” to more seats. Republicans around the country have since been similarly blunt. “They killed Charlie Kirk,” the Indiana senator Jim Banks said, in September. “The least that we can do is go through a legal process and redistrict Indiana into a nine-to-zero map.”\nDemocrats have been blunt about their motives, too—though they can convincingly argue that, at least as far as this particular redistricting conflagration is concerned, they didn’t start the fire. And if tit-for-tat gerrymandering is going to happen, it might be some small comfort that it isn’t playing out in smoke-filled rooms, but in the light of day. Mitchell, the California mapmaker, maintained a very public profile during the Proposition 50 fight; one article, in Politico traced his journey from being a self-described “stoner” to, in Politico’s words, “the most powerful person in California politics.” (When I asked him about this, Mitchell, whose wife leads Planned Parenthood Affiliates in the state, responded that he is “the second most powerful person in California politics in my own household.”) He also insists that the maps California voters just approved don’t constitute a gerrymander at all, since the new lines don’t arbitrarily split communities. Not that he sounded entirely comfortable with being asked to magic up Democratic gains. “I am a progressive in my political leanings and in process,” he told me. “My greatest hope was that we would have stopped Texas from doing this to begin with. That was the entire plan.” ♦","summary":"As the midterms approach, Republicans are trying to gerrymander new seats, and Democrats are responding in kind.

It will be in effect for the next three congressional election cycles and is expected to add Democratic seats to California’s 52-seat delegation, only nine of which are currently held by Republicans. It is a big win for California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, and for the state’s Democratic Party. Not all the news is good, though, when it comes to specific issues facing the state or even whether Californians want to see their governor run for president. According to preliminary results from the Fox News Voter Poll, on the redistricting question itself, Golden State voters who backed redrawing the maps overwhelmingly said they did so to counteract changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than because they think it is the best way to draw congressional districts. In contrast, the much smaller number who voted \"No\" said they did so because they do not think it is the best way to draw congressional districts, as opposed to being motivated to stop Democrats from gaining more seats in Congress. Meanwhile, the vast majority of voters generally think a nonpartisan commission should draw the districts, as opposed to the party in power – which is ironic in that such a commission is exactly what is being preempted by today’s vote. When asked how they generally feel about states redrawing their congressional districts in response to how other states have drawn theirs, most California voters oppose the idea – again, unusual seeing as that is exactly what they voted for with Proposition 50. More than half of Golden Staters approve of the job Newsom is doing as governor. Yet as to whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, more than half said it’s not a good idea. Even so, he outperforms former Vice President Kamala Harris on this measure, as these California special election voters would prefer she sticks to the sidelines – by more than two to one. Was President Donald Trump a factor in Prop 50’s success? The president remains deeply unpopular in the state, with close to two-thirds disapproving of the job he is doing. Half of those casting a ballot said they did so specifically to show their opposition to him. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT Meanwhile, California voters reject Trump's immigration enforcement policies, with more than six in ten saying they've gone too far. A similar number oppose sending the National Guard into U.S. cities. And these voters who oppose Trump and his policies also overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – in some instances by more than nine to one. It might be pointed out, however, that Trump lost California by more than 20 points in 2024, and his disapproval ratings could be exaggerated among voters in this special electorate. Despite all their negative feelings toward Trump, all is not candy and rainbows for how Californians see things at home. The economy was by far their top issue, yet the view of the Golden State economy is not so golden, as more than six in ten said the state economy is in \"not good\" or poor shape. CALIFORNIA FARMERS PUSH BACK ON PROP 50 AS DEMOCRATS EYE NEW HOUSE MAP The vast majority – close to nine in ten – also say their family financial situation is either holding steady or falling behind. Only about one in ten feel they are getting ahead. Plus, more than eight in ten lamented California’s cost of living as unaffordable. Another eight in 10 said crime is a problem. However, worried Californians are, they are equally perturbed by the state of the nation. More than seven in 10 said they are unhappy about how things are going in the U.S., with close to half angry about the direction the country is heading. More than nine in ten said they are concerned about political violence in the U.S. These concerns appear to play out in the vote to redraw the congressional map, with more than nine in ten who said it is important to them which party controls Congress. Black voters, young voters, Hispanics and college graduates were among those most inclined to back Prop 50, while those most likely to oppose it included voters with no college degree, voters ages 65 and over, and independents.

Next will come a fierce, yearlong fight, first in redistricting battles and then the midterm elections, for control of the House of Representatives and the fate of Trump’s agenda during the final two years of his term.\n\nHere are six takeaways from the first major elections of the second Trump era.\n\nDemocrats finally showed some fight.\n\nDemocrats have spent the past year locked out of power in Washington, searching furiously but mostly in vain for ways to stop Trump from expanding his power.\n\nThey held protests, spoke all night in the Senate and organized “No Kings” rallies that drew millions across the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, they finally hit back in a more concrete way.\n\nDemocrats won statewide elections in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania. They flipped seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission. And they were on the verge of winning a near two-thirds majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, an extraordinary sweep of battleground districts in races that serve as a plausible stand-in for how voters view both parties given the anonymous nature of most of the candidates.\n\nIn New York City, Zohran Mamdani was hovering around 50% of the vote in the mayoral race as he coasted past former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who won support from Trump and other Republicans.\n\nWhen Democrats roared to victory in 2017, during Trump’s first term, it foreshadowed a blue wave in the midterms a year later. On Tuesday night, House Democratic officials were crowing that this year’s results would help them recruit strong candidates to challenge Republicans next year.\n\nIt was a bad night for Trump.\n\nIn Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s race by focusing on Trump’s firing of federal workers and the impact of the government shutdown on her state.\n\nIn New Jersey, Rep. Mikie Sherrill finished her successful campaign by railing against Trump’s demand that a key Hudson River tunnel be “terminated.”\n\nIn New York City, Trump’s election eve endorsement of Cuomo caused Republicans to swing toward the former governor, but failed to thwart Mamdani.\n\nAnd in California, voters responded to calls to save the nation from Trump by approving a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional districts to shift five of them to Democrats from Republicans.\n\nThe president was not on the ballot in any of these places, but in each one, Democrats ran against his policies and yoked their opponents to him.\n\nAfter similar results in New Jersey and Virginia eight years ago, Democrats nearly ran the table in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats are already arguing that Tuesday was a harbinger for the 2026 midterms, while Republicans claim it was a blue-state blip.\n\nMamdani gives Democrats a new leader.\n\nIn a year’s time, Mamdani has gone from searching for random New Yorkers to talk to him to becoming one of the biggest stars in American politics.\n\nNow the New York City mayor-elect at 34 years old, he represents the vanguard of Democratic politics. He is an unabashed progressive and a self-described democratic socialist who is sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.\n\nHe also offers a new strategic blueprint to a Democratic Party that has for a decade been defined primarily by its opposition to Trump.\n\nMamdani, in defeating Cuomo in both the primary and general elections, gave New York voters a clear alternative with a defined vision. He focused relentlessly on the cost of living, spoke endlessly about the prices of nearly everything and expressed an adoration for New York City that few other politicians show for the places they call home.\n\nAnd he did it by blazing a creative, compelling path online, both through his own social media channels and his appearances with scores of influencers and podcasters.\n\nMamdani’s progressive politics may not play as well outside New York City, and Republicans have already signaled they will seek to tie the party’s candidates to a Muslim immigrant, but Democrats running in the midterm elections are likely to copy his tactics and message discipline.\n\nEven Democrats will shrug at a scandal.\n\nIn the final weeks of Virginia’s campaign for attorney general, it was revealed that Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee, had sent violent text messages about a political rival and had been caught driving 116 mph.\n\nBut no prominent Virginia Democrat called for him to quit the race. Jones apologized, withstood a torrent of attack ads and rode huge Democratic turnout to victory.\n\nThe post-shame era continues apace.\n\nSuch was the antipathy toward Republican candidates in Virginia that Jones, even saddled with controversy, performed better than Vice President Kamala Harris did last year in Loudoun County, a key exurb of Washington.\n\nJones’ political future might have a ceiling because of his scandals in this election, but for Tuesday night, at least, he is as happy as can be.\n\nNo Trump on the ballot? Advantage, Democrats.\n\nTrump drives Republican voters to the polls — but only when he is on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats have overperformed in every nonpresidential election year since 2017. Their voters are now the ones who turn out for off-year and midterm elections, while Trump’s loyal Republican base turns out in big numbers only in presidential years.\n\nThis played out this year in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race, when the liberal candidate prevailed by double digits, and in a series of special elections. It was again evident Tuesday as Democrats prevailed easily in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nTrump will not be on the ballot in next year’s midterm elections, but it is a safe bet that Democrats will again try to make him the centerpiece of their campaigns.\n\nNewsom helped House Democrats, and himself.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has been on a not-very-secret mission for national attention since before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd with a blowout victory in a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional map in Democrats’ favor, Newsom helped his party’s midterm chances and proved that he could turn out voters in a critical election.\n\nIn the short term, the nearly 2-to-1 margin for “yes” on California’s ballot measure may serve as fuel for Democrats in other blue states weighing their own redistricting plans. In his victory remarks, Newsom made an explicit call for other states — including ones with ambitious Democratic governors, like Colorado, Illinois and Maryland — to follow California’s lead on redistricting before the midterm elections.\n\nBefore the next presidential contest, it provides Newsom with concrete evidence of what he did to combat Trump in an era when Democratic voters are hungry for fighters.\n\nHow he uses that platform remains to be seen, but it is not much of a mystery where his ambition lies.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The results served as a rebuke of Trump and his Republican Party and a salve for Democrats who have not had many good nights in the past year. \n\n\nThe post The backlash has arrived: 6 takeaways from a good night for Democrats appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/politics/2025/11/05/the-backlash-has-arrived-6-takeaways-from-a-good-night-for-democrats/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/https___nytapi.wieck_.com_feed-photos_4mT9wBNn-690b7cb990a5c-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 16:41:17","author":"Heather Alterisio","authors":["Heather Alterisio"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":376085404,"title":"After crushing defeat, MAGA pauses to recall Trump victory a year ago","text":"“Happy One Year Anniversary to the Greatest Comeback in American History,” tweeted podcaster Katie Miller, wife of White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“One year ago today, President Trump won a historic election victory and secured a mandate to Make America Great Again,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who included a list of 11 fulfilled Trump promises in a posting on X.\n\nAnd Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “In just nine months, we’ve rebuilt our economy, strengthened our borders, and reignited American greatness, and the best is yet to come.”\n\nA year ago today, President Trump secured a landslide victory — sweeping all seven swing states, winning the popular vote, and leading the charge to Make America Great Again.In just nine months, we’ve rebuilt our economy, strengthened our borders, and reignited American… pic.twitter.com/XTD0nqJXg4— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) November 5, 2025\n\nExpected to lose in a tight election with former Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump instead pulled off a huge comeback by winning key battleground states in scoring a 49.8% to 48.3% victory.

Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman secured a second term Tuesday night, extending his tenure as the county’s first Jewish executive. Blakeman, a close ally of Trump who's worked to combat antisemitism and other crime and bolster cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), won reelection as neighboring New York City turned to a self-described Democratic socialist. Mamdani, notably, has refused to denounce the slogan \"globalize the intifada.\" \"I just got off the phone with President Trump, and he was delighted,\" Blakeman told the crowd at his victory party. \"And I said to the president, thank you for all you've done. We had faith in President Trump's policies, and the people of Nassau County wanted us to cooperate with ICE. They wanted to get criminals out of our county. They wanted it to be the safest county in America. Lower taxes.\" The mood in Nassau County was very different from the one across the East River. In New York City, voters embraced Mamdani's left-leaning agenda focused on housing, affordability and \"Trump-proofing NYC.\" In the platforms listed on his campaign website, Mamdani vowed to freeze rent for all stabilized tenants, build more affordable housing, introduce city-owned grocery stores, make buses free and to raise the minimum wage to $30 by 2030. SOCIALIST SHOCKWAVE: ZOHRAN MAMDANI STUNS NYC AS VOTERS HAND POWER TO DEMOCRATS’ FAR-LEFT FLANK \"Zohran Mamdani will fight Trump’s attempts to gouge the working class, and deliver a city where everyone can afford a dignified life. He’ll ensure our immigrant New Yorkers are protected by strengthening our sanctuary city apparatus: getting ICE out of all city facilities and ending any cooperation, increasing legal support, and protecting all personal data. He’ll make NYC an LGBTQIA+ sanctuary city and protect reproductive rights,\" the \"Trump-proofing NYC\" portion of Mamdani's website reads. While Blakeman had the president's endorsement, Mamdani garnered the support of several major Democrats, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. He was also backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Blakeman earned high praise from Trump just days before the election. The president described the county executive as \"100% MAGA\" and said he was \"doing a fantastic job\" in the position. \"He is working tirelessly with the brave heroes of law enforcement, ICE, and border patrol to safeguard our communities, ensure LAW AND ORDER, defend our always under siege Second Amendment, keep our now very secure border, SECURE, end migrant crime, and stop Communism from ruining our once great cities. Bruce is fighting hard to cut taxes and regulations, promote MADE IN THE USA, advance American energy DOMINANCE, and champion our nation’s golden age,\" Trump wrote. In 2024, a little more than 52% of Nassau County voters cast their ballots for Trump over then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The county has since seen Trump-aligned policies in action. OPINION: THE HIDDEN REASON NEW YORKERS VOTED FOR A SOCIALIST — AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK Recently, Blakeman spearheaded legislation that banned transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. While a New York appeals court has since put a freeze on the ban, the passage of the legislation stands in stark contrast to the policies of deep blue New York City. Blakeman vowed to push the law forward despite the freeze, telling the New York Post that \"Nassau County will continue to protect the integrity and safety of women's sports.\" Additionally, last week, Blakeman spoke with Fox News Digital about his county's cooperation with ICE, saying that under Trump, Nassau County had increased its relationship with the federal immigration enforcement agency. He said the partnership with ICE was a \"great asset\" in protecting Nassau County. In his victory speech, Blakeman highlighted the policies supported by Nassau County voters that distinguished their part of the Empire State from the Big Apple. \"Four years ago, we made promises. We said that we wouldn't be a sanctuary county. We said we would take the masks off the kids and stop oppressing our children here in Nassau County. We said wouldn't raise taxes. We haven't raised taxes one penny in four years. That's a pretty good record. And we've gotten seven bond upgrades,\" Blakeman said. NEW YORK LEADER PLEDGES MORE COPS, TOUGHER ICE PARTNERSHIP IF NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAYOR \"We are the safest county in America! I want to thank the PBA, the SOA, the DAI, the corrections officers, all of our law enforcement professionals for keeping us safe each and every day. Thank you to each and every one of them,\" he added. \"We have the greatest police department in the world, led by our great Commissioner Pat Ryder. And we are also blessed to have so many volunteer firefighters and EMTs who keep us safe here in Nassau County. Thank you and God bless you for all you're doing. Thank you to all the unions that backed us, the hardworking men and women of Nassau County. Thank you, to our building trades.\" At the end of his victory speech, Blakeman echoed Trump and even used one of the president's most iconic lines: \"Fight, fight, fight!\" \"We are going to continue the work that was started to make us an even more prosperous county, to bring job creation, economic development, keep taxes down, support our law enforcement, and continue to make this the best place to live in all of New York State. Leadership counts, and we've got great leaders. So, to each and every one of you, again, my sincerest thanks, and may God bless you all, and may god bless this great United States of America.

The results give some reason to doubt Trump’s claim that his 2024 victory was “a historic realignment” of American politics. But although the success of Democrats running the spectrum from moderate to progressive may soothe the pre-2026 nerves of Trump’s opposition, it also means there are no pat answers to the question of how best to run against him.\n\nZohran Mamdani, a charismatic Democratic newcomer, won the New York mayoralty by a wide margin. Mamdani captured roughly 50 percent of the vote in a three-way race, despite the president’s endorsement of his chief rival, Andrew Cuomo, and threats to cut off most federal funding to the city. Or was it in part because of Trump? The president is detested in his hometown, and although Mamdani relentlessly pivoted away from national politics toward issues of affordability in the city, the contrast between the young, cheerful immigrant and aging, cranky nativist president was unmissable. Mamdani was only too delighted to call attention to Trump’s late backing of Cuomo as a way of energizing his own voters. His victory immediately makes him one of the leaders of the Democratic Party’s left wing, alongside Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn Virginia, meanwhile, Abigail Spanberger staked a claim to leadership of the party’s moderate wing. The former U.S. representative and CIA officer trounced the Republican Winsome Earle-Sears by 15 points to become the commonwealth’s governor, replacing the term-limited GOP incumbent Glenn Youngkin. Spanberger’s victory was widely anticipated, but the margin is on the higher end of expectations. She carried to victory not only the lieutenant-governor candidate, Ghazala Hashmi, but also Jay Jones, the nominee for attorney general. Democrats gained at least 13 seats and maintained control in the House of Delegates as well.\n\nJones’s campaign was shaken late by the publication of text messages from 2022 in which he wrote that if he had two bullets and had a chance to shoot Hitler, Pol Pot, or the then-Republican speaker of the House of Delegates, he’d shoot the Republican twice. In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the messages caused a firestorm, but although Democrats condemned the messages, they did not seek to force Jones out of the race. On Election Day, the blue wave carried him over the incumbent Republican, Jason Miyares.\n\nAlso winning was the New Jersey Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a current U.S. representative who ran a campaign focused squarely on Trump. The race gave Democrats jitters: Four years ago, the Republican Jack Ciattarelli came within three points of unseating Governor Phil Murphy, and polls in recent weeks showed Ciattarelli—once again on the ballot—close behind Sherrill. In the end, though, Sherrill won by some 13 points.\n\nProposition 50, California’s referendum on redrawing U.S. House districts, scored an even larger win, with more than 60 percent of voters favoring it in incomplete results. The ballot initiative sought to bypass the state’s independent redistricting commission and create maps that would give Democrats a chance to pick up five more seats in Congress. Governor Gavin Newsom was the face of the gerrymander, arguing it was essential as a counterweight to several states, including Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, adding Republican districts at Trump’s behest. The vote not only aids Democrats’ midterm hopes but raises Newsom’s profile as a Trump adversary—and 2028 presidential hopeful.\n\nIt was that kind of night for Democrats: Up and down the ballot, races not only went their way but did so by wide margins. (In Pennsylvania, three Democratic justices on the state supreme court won elections to keep their seats.) That follows a run of successes in special elections. But drawing simple conclusions from these results is challenging, given the very different personalities, campaigns, and platforms that brought Democrats to victory. Perhaps the only unifying thread was former President Barack Obama, who campaigned for Spanberger and Sherrill, endorsed Prop 50, and reached out to Mamdani even as other national Democrats kept their distance. The big lesson may be that Democrats’ best bet is to run candidates who effectively represent and speak to the places they’re running, rather than pursuing a single ideology.\n\nThese results have only limited ability to restrain Trump’s abuses of power right now, and although they are the best that Democrats could hope for, they also don’t guarantee success in 2026. What the returns do show clearly is that Democratic voters are highly motivated to vote against Trump, despite polls finding that they are disgusted with their own party. This may sound familiar. Trump has never been popular with Americans as a whole: He won a minority of the popular vote in 2016, led his party to defeat in 2018, and lost in 2020. In the 2022 midterms, his unpopularity was a major reason Republicans underperformed.\n\nBut Trump’s victory in 2024 called that into question. Trump and his allies treated it as an “unprecedented and powerful mandate” for radical right-wing governance. A year later, this election suggests a different interpretation: that Trump’s victory was driven by high inflation, Joe Biden’s disastrous decision to try to run for reelection, an underwhelming Kamala Harris campaign, and an anti-incumbent mood. Americans still aren’t sold on the Democratic Party, but the anti-MAGA majority has reemerged.","summary":"Democrats won up and down the ballot yesterday, riding a backlash to Donald Trump’s second term.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/11/elections-anti-maga-democrats/684824/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/iJpEgTb4LGiygwAm8pI5aJR4gOc=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/11/2025_11_05_The_Daily_The_Anti_MAGA_Majority_Reemerges/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 15:06:00","author":"David A.

The election season was much more muted compared to 2024's wild federal election that delivered President Donald Trump a victory over then-Vice President Kamala Harris, with 2025 spotlighting the mayoral election in New York City, and a pair of gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey. Fox News Digital compiled Election Day 2025's biggest winners and losers following months of campaigning on top voter concerns, namely affordability and the economy. WHAT THE RESULTS OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS MAY MEAN FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WINNERS Democrat bench Following 2024's federal election that left the Democratic Party working to find its footing after Harris' loss, Democrats now have New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger ascending as the top leaders of their respective states, broadening the party's pool of leaders with new roles. New Jersey Democrats were on the edge of their seats in the deep blue state after Trump made inroads with voters during the 2024 election, teeing up what Republicans saw as the opening to potentially flipping the state. Democrats, however, held their ground in the historically blue state with New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeating Trump-backed Republican Jack Ciattarelli. \"This was a tough fight and this is a tough state,\" Sherrill said in her victory speech. \"But I know you, New Jersey. I have fought for you. I’ve spoken with thousands of you over this last year. I know your struggles, your hopes, and your dreams.\" Spanberger notched a victory over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears just roughly an hour after polls closed in the Old Dominion State. \"We sent a message to every corner of the commonwealth,\" Spanberger said in her acceptance speech. \"A message to our neighbors and our fellow Americans across the country. We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. We chose our commonwealth over chaos. You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy.\" THE TRUE COST OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS Upon her inauguration in January, Spanberger will become the first female governor of Virginia. The pair were viewed as potential new leaders of the Democratic Party as they worked to secure their gubernatorial wins. Now, they will head to their respective state Capitols armed with years of Congressional know-how and an opportunity to better cement their leadership within the party. Progressive socialists Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, who ran as a Democrat, secured his win as the Big Apple's next mayor in an election expected to deliver him favorable results as he ran against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who was forced to run as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June — and Republican Curtis Sliwa. \"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" Mamdani said in his victory speech. \"New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change,\" he added. \"A mandate for a new kind of politics. A mandate for a city we can afford. And a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that.\" MEET THE CANDIDATES AIMING TO MAKE HISTORY IN THE 2025 ELECTIONS The election notched a massive win for the left-wing faction of the Democratic Party. Mamdani was a relatively unknown state assembly member and democratic socialist who ascended the political ladder amid his primary campaign. He championed progressive plans for the city, such as freezing stabilized rents, increasing the city's minimum wage and canceling fares for bus rides. The race earned national coverage as conservatives slammed the socialist candidate as a threat to the city's massive economy and status as America's de facto symbol of capitalism, and warned he holds antisemitic views in a city with a massive Jewish population. Other socialist candidates also have made big waves this cycle, including in Minneapolis where left-wing candidate Omar Fateh who has been described as the \"Mamdani of Minneapolis.\" The mayor’s race advanced to ranked choice voting on Tuesday after none of the candidates received at least 50% of the vote. Minneapolis allows voters to rank up to three candidates in its municipal races. Incumbent Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey and Fateh received the most first-choice results, Fox News reported. Donald Trump Long before Election Day, President Donald Trump made clear he was no fan of New York City's Mamdani, teeing up an expected political battle between the pair for the forseeable future. Trump is famous for his long-running political spats with Democrat foes, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Sen. Adam Schiff, frequently spotlighting the opponents as examples as to why Democrat policies fail while championing his MAGA approach. Now, Trump has who likely will be another longstanding political foe as he continues his ongoing campaign against socialism and antisemitism. \"Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social in June. \"We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart.\" \"Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!\" the president claimed in a Truth Social post on Tuesday. Mamdani is Muslim and has been accused of holding antisemitic views, including for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" The democratic socialist, however, has denied the claims and vowed to \"do everything in my power to protect Jewish New Yorkers.\" EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELECTION DAY 2025: CRITICAL ELECTIONS, BALLOT MEASURES AND MORE LOSERS Republican candidates Republican candidates across the board in the handful of high-profile elections failed to rally enough support for their tickets, handing Democrats massive wins from the Virginia attorney general race to the party retaining control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The election cycle focused on the New York City mayoral race, and the pair of gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, where Democrats celebrated victories long before the clock struck midnight on Election Day. Republicans, however, failed to rally support in a handful of other state elections, including three Democratic justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court defending their jobs from challengers. Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares also failed to retain his seat against Jay Jones, who was mired in controversy after text messages showed him envisioning the murder of a former Republican leader. TRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY In California, Newsom and Democrats passed a ballot initiative to redraw the state's congressional lines, which could flip up to five Republican seats blue in the liberal state. Newsom launched the redistricting effort, Proposition 50, earlier in 2025 to counter the Trump administration's promotion that Republicans in states such as Texas redistrict their own lines. New York City business owners Ahead of Mamdani's election Tuesday, business owners and conservative political leaders sounded off with concern that the democratic socialist's policies could cripple the city’s economy and spark businesses to flee. \"We will lose businesses in droves,\" Republican Councilwoman Vickie Paladino said in July of Mamdani's candidacy. \"You got NASDAQ, you got Wall Street. They could work anywhere. They could work in Jersey, they could work in Connecticut. They don't need to be in Lower Manhattan.\" Mamdani campaigned on proposals to raise the corporate tax rate, shift more of the tax burden to \"richer and whiter neighborhoods\" and add a flat 2% income tax on earners making over $1 million to pay for other programs that will fund other \"free\" services for the residents. Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler added that the city is already strained by inflation, high taxes and regulation, and that the election of a socialist could cripple businesses. \"New York is the capital of capitalism and small businesses,\" Loeffler told Fox Digital in September. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Small businesses are very concerned about what might be coming down the road, particularly as they hear threats of socialist policies, government takeover of industries, rising regulation, rising taxes, a minimum wage that may skyrocket to $30 an hour and cost thousands of jobs,\" she said, adding that New York City businesses have already witnessed an \"eroding customer base.\" Fox News Digital's Amanda Macias, Alec Schemmel and Deirdre Heavey contributed to this report.","summary":"The 2025 election cycle delivered Democratic victories in Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races while Republicans failed to gain ground in key state contests.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/results-in-2025s-biggest-winner-losers-from-off-year-elections","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/mamdani-victory.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 15:00:18","author":"Emma Colton","authors":["Emma Colton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.306},{"id":376061048,"title":"Desi Dynasty In DC & Beyond: How Zohran Mamdani, Other Indian-Origin Politicians Are Reshaping US Governance","text":"The electoral success of Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, is not an isolated event but the latest and perhaps most striking demonstration of the surging political influence of Indian-origin individuals across all levels of government in the United States. With over five dozen such individuals now holding prominent positions—from local school boards to the halls of Congress and the vice president’s office—the community has firmly transitioned from a group focused purely on professional success to a powerful political force.\nMamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist lawmaker, scripted history in a fiercely contested mayoral race. His victory made him the city’s first Muslim, first Indian-origin, and youngest mayor in over a century. Born in Kampala, Uganda, to acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair and scholar Mahmood Mamdani, Zohran’s rise from a housing counsellor to the city’s highest office symbolises a new generation of political leadership rooted in progressive activism and a global identity.\nBeyond Local Races: The National Stage\nThe ascent is most visible at the national level and in crucial statewide offices:\nVice President Kamala Harris: The most prominent figure, Harris, whose mother was born in India and father was born in Jamaica, made history as the first woman and first Indian-origin Vice President of the United States. Her legal and political career, starting as California’s Attorney General and US Senator, laid the foundation for her rise to the nation’s second-highest office.\nThe ‘Samosa Caucus’: This informal group of Indian-American lawmakers in the US Congress has grown significantly. It includes Democrats Ami Bera (a practising physician before entering politics), Pramila Jayapal (the first Indian-American woman elected to the House and a prominent progressive voice), Ro Khanna, Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Shri Thanedar. These leaders bring a wealth of expertise, primarily in medicine, law, and engineering, which profoundly informs policy debates on healthcare, technology, and workers’ rights.\nStatewide Leadership: In recent elections, Indian-Americans have secured key statewide executive positions. Ghazala Hashmi made history by becoming Virginia’s Lieutenant Governor, making her the first Muslim woman elected to statewide office in the country. Similarly, Aruna Miller serves as the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland.\nA New Political Identity\nThe success of figures like Aftab Pureval, the Indian-origin mayor of Cincinnati who secured a second term, and others in judicial and municipal roles across states like Texas, New Jersey, and California, underscores a broader political awakening. The Indian-American community is highly educated and affluent, but it is now actively leveraging its economic and intellectual capital to shape policy.\nWhile the community primarily aligns with the Democratic Party, the recent presence of Republican candidates like Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy in presidential primaries showcases the ideological diversity and confidence of Indian-Americans to compete at the highest echelons of both major parties, demonstrating that the community has fully integrated into the American political mainstream.","summary":"With over five dozen such individuals now holding key positions, the community has firmly transitioned from a group focused on professional success to a potent political force","url":"https://www.news18.com/explainers/desi-dynasty-in-dc-beyond-how-zohran-mamdani-other-indian-origin-politicians-are-reshaping-us-governance-9683107.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-2025-06-25T183839.593-2025-06-d0db57f0a92b6f82166f8c303421b8d6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 14:54:24","author":"News18,Pathikrit Sen Gupta","authors":["News18","Pathikrit Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.66},{"id":376041252,"title":"‘You all own this now’: Scott Jennings warns Democrats Zohran Mamdani, Jay Jones winning will be ‘terrible’ for party in long run","text":"CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings predicted Tuesday that the victories of Democratic Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani of New York City and Attorney General-elect Jay Jones of Virginia would be bad for the “national Democratic image.”\n\nMamdani and Jones were among those elected Tuesday, defeating former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares of Virginia in a night that went well for Democrats in parts of the country carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Jennings offered Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York his “condolences,” hinting that he was a big loser based on the results of the off-year election.\n\n“These are blue states, and Democrats were supposed to win, so I wouldn’t overread it. Virginia, in particular, has never been a great bellwether,” Jennings said about the state where former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears. “I don’t think a lot of folks had a lot of confidence in the Virginia campaign that was run on the Republican side and New Jersey is New Jersey, so I would hesitate to overread it.”\n\n“I don’t think the concerns you raised are legitimate political strategy concerns. You know, I think — I just want to offer condolences to Chuck Schumer, honestly,” Jennings continued. “What I’m reading here in New York City is that AOC is going to be the next senator from New York after she gets done whipping his rear end in the 2028 Democratic primary.”\n\nJennings also suggested that the victories of Mamdani and Jones could hurt Democrats in the 2026 midterms, especially in parts of the country that are not heavily Democratic.\n\n“And for his Senate races in 2026, I see the energy in the Democratic Party tonight behind a socialist, and I see the energy in Virginia Democrats looking the other way on a violent candidate for attorney general who says he wants to murder Republicans and their children,” Jennings said. “If you think you’re getting rid of Graham Platner in Maine now, think again. This is a terrible night for national Democratic image, given what is happening inside their party. Mamdani is an avowed socialist. It’s not what people say that he is, it’s what he says that he is. He’s now the leader of their party. That’s their energy.”\n\nPlatner came under fire after it was revealed he got a tattoo with Nazi imagery. His campaign has since seen significant turnover since the revelations, while other scandals have emerged.\n\nMamdani campaigned on left-wing policies, including establishing government-run grocery stores, free child care and free use of transit buses and saying increased taxes on predominantly white and wealthy neighborhoods would fund those programs. Jones’ campaign was nearly derailed when text messages sent to a Republican colleague in the Virginia House of Delegates expressing a desire to kill the Republican speaker of that body and his children came to light, but Spanberger and other Democrats refused to call for Jones to end his campaign.\n\nAfter former Obama administration official David Axelrod tried to paint Jennings’ comments about Mamdani as him seeking “a life raft” because Republicans “got their asses kicked,” Jennings fired back.\n\n“You own this. You own this now. You all own this now,” Jennings told Axelrod.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
