He believes she will cut jobs by banning fracking and shutting down nuclear plants.\n\nMeanwhile, the former president wishes to encourage oil and gas companies to expand fracking, creating job opportunities for Pennsylvanians.\n\n“We will make Pennsylvania an energy supplier to the entire world,” he said, before playfully proclaiming, “drill, baby drill.”\n\nHarris encouraged a fracking ban before taking office, but now says she wouldn’t impose restrictions if she becomes president.\n\nTrump said it was “very special to be here” in Pennsylvania, especially after he survived an assassination attempt just hours away.\n\nFour days ago, he bravely returned to Butler with tech giant Elon Musk to urge supporters to “vote, vote, vote.”\n\nDuring his latest rally, the ex-president paid tribute to Corey Comperatore, a father who tragically lost his life while shielding his family from gunfire at the gathering in Butler.\n\nBut he also took time to acknowledge the efforts of his team in fundraising millions for Comperatore’s grieving family. He praised loyal supporters who stood their ground courageously in the face of the shooting incident.\n\nTo end the rally, Trump vowed to end the war in Ukraine, protect free speech, and defend the Second Amendment.\n\n“Every day will be filled with opportunity and hope,” he said.\n\n“But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all.”\n\nFIGHT FOR THE BLUE\n\nPennsylvania is a crucial swing state that Trump barely lost in 2020, sacrificing 20 electoral votes to Biden.\n\nHowever, recent polling found he’s edged 2 points ahead of Harris in the state, The Hill reported.\n\nTrump is planning to spend the majority of his time in Democratic states for the next month, including Colorado, California, Illinois, and New York.\n\nHe scheduled an event in New York City’s Madison Square Garden days before polls open in early November.\n\nTrump and Harris are both hunkering down to keep campaigning while another historic storm is set to make landfall in Florida.\n\nHurricane Milton is forecast to blaze through a Florida that is still recovering from the devastating brought on by Helene.\n\nThe storms have canceled a couple of events for the candidates, forcing Harris to reschedule one Miami, Florida, event for Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nBiden is also struggling under the pressure of the wreckage, as he canceled a trip to Germany and Angola to stay in the US for support.\n\nIt comes as…\n\nJames Davis, the former communication director of the 2012 Republican National Convention, expressed in an interview with The U.S. Sun that he sees the hurricanes as a potential pivotal moment for voters.\n\nHe linked the federal government’s response to Helene to Katrina rescue efforts in 2005 and felt that officials had dropped the ball.\n\n“Given their response to this hurricane, I cannot see that they’re anywhere in play for them. It’s been really atrocious,” he said.\n\n“It drives a national narrative of ‘Where are you spending your time?’\n\n“You might live in one of those Rustbelt states but have friends or family in the southeastern United States and they’re sitting down there saying ‘Everyone has forgotten about me.'”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDONALD Trump has hosted a rally in President Joe Biden&#8217;s hometown to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump expresses joy at being here and pledges to win Pennsylvania during rally in Biden’s hometown first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trump-expresses-joy-at-being-here-and-pledges-to-win-pennsylvania-during-rally-in-bidens-hometown/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Donald-Trump-boasts-its-‘very-special-to-be-here-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 23:32:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":259119370,"title":"Fox News Pitches Trump-Harris Debate in Final Hail Mary","text":"Fox News is trying once again to lure Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for a debate—with terms neither side will likely agree to.\n\nThe network announced on Wednesday it invited both campaigns to an Oct. 24 or an Oct. 27 debate in Pennsylvania.

Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said in an article for The Wall Street Journal that the administration of President Joe Biden has succeeded in expanding multilateral security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region and now is the time to consider adding new economic measures against China.\n\nOne idea could be such a trade-defense coalition, Emanuel said, and for that to be effective, he suggested it \"would need the economic equivalent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Article 5 -- an attack on one is an attack on all -- at its core.\"\n\nEmanuel said countries such as Australia, which had to grapple with higher tariffs imposed by China after calling for an independent probe into the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, have provided valuable lessons.\n\nHe suggested the importance of like-minded countries working even more closely, given that Australia curbed its economic reliance on China by expanding exports to other markets with the help of its network of allies and making it possible for Canberra to eventually force Beijing to back down.\n\nHe said the United States \"must now further integrate economic statecraft into its wider strategic latticework architecture.\"\n\nHis proposals come as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's idea of creating a NATO-like collective defense architecture in Asia has grabbed headlines.\n\nThe ambassador, known for his tough stance on China, was chief of staff to former President Barack Obama between 2009 and 2010, and speculation is rife that he will assume a key post if Vice President Kamala Harris wins November's presidential election.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need to better deal with growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia, many officials in Tokyo and Washington, as well as in other Asian capitals, view Ishiba's concept as unrealistic.\n\nIshiba has also played down the idea after becoming Japan's prime minister on Oct. 1.\n\nRelated coverage","summary":"WASHINGTON - The United

But the detail in journalist Bob Woodward’s book “War” raised eyebrows in light of a special counsel investigation during Trump’s presidency that examined potential ties between Russia and the Republican’s 2016 campaign as well as Trump’s more recent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion — statements that have hinted at a possible U.S. policy overhaul if he’s elected.\n\n“I would caution any world leader about trusting Vladimir Putin with anything,” said Emily Harding, who led the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and is now a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBoth Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favor of Trump, denied the reporting.\n\nAsked at a press briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration would have “serious concerns” if the reported calls were true.\n\n“We’re not aware of those calls. I certainly can’t confirm any of those calls from here,” she said. “But, if it is indeed true, are we (concerned)? Do we have serious concerns? Yes.”\n\nIt’s no secret that Trump has held multiple meetings over the last year with major world leaders: hosting Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sitting down in New York last April with Polish President Andrzej Duda and meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s trip to the U.S. last month.\n\nThe meetings offer Trump an opportunity to differentiate his foreign policy approach from that of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to shore up connections if he reclaims the White House. During Netanyahu’s visit in July, Trump boasted of a “great relationship,” drawing a tacit contrast with the more strained dynamic between the Israeli leader and Biden.\n\nWhile those meetings were known publicly, Woodward’s book cites an unnamed aide as saying Trump and Putin had as many as seven private calls. That adds to long-running questions about their relationship and what Trump may be trying to achieve, said Robert Orttung, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nAs president, “We never really understood why he liked Putin so much and why he was trying to develop such a close relationship with someone who is clearly an adversary and against everything the United States stands for,” Orttung said.\n\nSome claims about ties between Trump and allies and Russia have proved overheated or fizzled over time, but the subject continues to draw considerable public scrutiny, including after Trump left office.\n\nThe FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller spent several years investigating whether Russia had colluded with the 2016 Trump campaign to tip the outcome of the election. Though investigators did not establish a criminal conspiracy, they did find the Trump campaign actively welcomed Russia’s help during the election and that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency.\n\nIn 2018, after meeting Putin in Helsinki, Trump memorably and publicly questioned his own intelligence agencies ‘ conclusion that Russia meddled in the election.\n\n“I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said at the time. He added: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”\n\nMore recently, Trump called Putin “pretty smart” for invading Ukraine and has praised Russia’s military record in historical conflicts, saying last month: “As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.”\n\nThe book, which also says Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, does not describe the content of their conversations.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung denied they occurred, calling the book by the famed Watergate journalist the “work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.” Trump complained at a campaign event on Wednesday that “I had to go through years of Russia, Russia, Russia, and they knew it was fake.”\n\nA Kremlin spokesman also denied the calls happened.\n\nThe book’s details revived discussion about the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that bars private American citizens from trying to intervene in “disputes or controversies” between the United States and foreign powers without government approval.\n\nThe statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction. Former presidents from Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton have held talks with international figures after leaving the White House.\n\n“Trump could be technically liable just as I think dozens of prominent figures have been technically liable,” said Daniel Rice, a University of Arkansas law professor and constitutional law expert.\n\nAmong the possible reasons for the law’s dormancy, Rice said, is a disinclination by prosecutors to “turn violators into martyrs” or to be seen as targeting a sitting president’s political adversaries.\n\nFlynn was interviewed by the FBI about that conversation and pleaded guilty to lying to agents about it, though Trump pardoned Flynn in the final weeks of his presidency.\n\nTrump later called for former Secretary of State John Kerry to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act over his conversations with Iran after he left the Obama administration. Kerry was never charged.\n\nAssociated Press writer Will Weissert in Washington contributed.","summary":"Both Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favor of Trump, denied the reporting.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/09/trump-putin-ties-back-in-spotlight-after-new-book/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sjm-24-Trump-Putin_207133975.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 23:03:29","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":259118190,"title":"Harris Reports Her Campaign Has Raised a Massive Sum","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign operation has raised over $1 billion since her campaign launched in July, according to multiple reports.\n\nMultiple sources in the Harris campaign confirmed the staggering total to both The New York Times and NBC News on Wednesday.

It also far outpaces the fundraising tempo under President Biden. \n\nPast presidential cycles have seen candidates, including Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, leap past the $1 billion mark between totals raised across the campaigns and outside groups, but the breakneck pace at which Harris, 59, has reached the feat is unprecedented. \n\nFor context, Biden’s 2024 operation didn’t cross the $1 billion threshold until August, shortly after Harris ascended to the top of the ticket and rebranded the campaign.\n\nAt the time, the newly launched Harris campaign crowed about blowing past the $1 billion milestone at the fastest clip for a presidential campaign. \n\nHarris managed to get to the $1 billion tally even faster by herself, the New York Times first reported. All of those fundraising figures also include money raised by her campaign, allied joint committees and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nHer campaign has yet to publicly release its numbers for September, which has become customary ahead of the Federal Election Commission’s deadline for public disclosures from the presidential campaigns. \n\nBy contrast, the Trump-Vance campaign quickly announced at the start of October that it brought in $160 million in September and ended the month with some $283 million cash on hand across its political operation.\n\nFor comparison, the Harris-Walz campaign brought in $361 million and capped off August with $404 million cash on hand, across its political operation.\n\nSome Harris-Walz campaign allies have privately expressed consternation that the mammoth haul could give Harris backers a false sense of security and lead to complacency. \n\n“Talking about this type of big money doesn’t convey the sense of urgency to do every single thing in all of the big and small ways,” a source told The Washington Post. “We are in the margin of error. This will come down to grinding it out.”\n\nThe vice president and her allies have long held a campaign cash advantage over Team Trump, while spending more than two and half times as much, per data from AdImpact.\n\nThey’ve been sitting on such a large mountain of cash that the Harris-Walz campaign and DNC announced it was funneling over $25 million to down-ballot races last month in a bid to help Democrats. \n\nDespite the weeks of bonanza fundraising and constant blanketing of the airwaves against Trump, the 2024 presidential contest remains very tight. \n\nHarris has a 2.2 percentage point edge over Trump in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of national multicandidate polls. Trump is leading in the RCP’s no-tossup map of battleground states. \n\nFurthering Democrats’ anxieties are painful memories of Trump outperforming polls in 2016 and 2020, despite many party strategists feeling that Republicans underperformed polls in the 2022 midterm elections. \n\nThe Post contacted the Harris-Walz campaign for comment.","summary":"In fewer than 80 days since taking over the top of the ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris has reportedly pulled in over an eye-popping $1 billion across her campaign and allied committees.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/us-news/kamala-harris-camp-raked-in-over-1b-since-joe-biden-dropped-out-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-i61qw90qe-1728511912824.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728497547&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 23:00:02","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":259117536,"title":"These are the Pennsylvania voters who could decide the election","text":"Unexpectedly, Pennsylvania’s millennial and Gen X voters are poised to elect the next president of the United States. \n\nNo longer adolescents, millennials are adults striving for families and homeownership in a world of uncertainty.\n\nFor Gen X, 30-year mortgages locked in at 3% feel great, though the launch of MTV is now closer to the attack on Pearl Harbor than today. \n\nLife is coming fast for both generations.\n\nWith millennials leaning to the left and Gen X voting to the right, neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump likely anticipated these voters determining the outcome of the presidential election that’s deadlocked in Pennsylvania. \n\nStalemated at 48% for both Trump and Harris in the RealClearPolitics average, the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania will be won on the margins, public polling indicates.\n\nA significant number of Pennsylvanians have already decided to change their vote for president from 2020.

Three percent, or about 100,000, of Trump voters have switched to Harris. Trump wins the battle of voters switching sides. \n\nHowever, with potentially 7 million Pennsylvanians voting in the presidential election, the 4% of undecided voters represents about 300,000 people who are likely to determine the next president of the United States.\n\nThe last two Pennsylvania presidential elections were decided by 80,555 votes in 2020 and 44,292 votes in 2016.\n\nIn an era in which politics is religion, the undecided voters will likely outnumber the partisans who may not vote. The undecideds will be the deciders. \n\nAmong undecideds leaning toward Harris, 40% voted for Biden in 2020 while 28% voted for Trump.\n\nThis indicates Harris has not consolidated the Democrats and disaffected Republicans who placed Biden into office.\n\nThe undecided voters leaning toward Trump tell a much different story. Notably, none of these voters cast a ballot for Biden in 2020.\n\nIn fact, 50% of them skipped over the presidential ballot entirely, being unable to bring themselves to cast one four years ago. \n\nBetween these two pools of undecided leaners, neither candidate appears to have an easier road. \n\nTrump must persuade his leaners to do something they were unable to do in the past. \n\nHarris must rebuild a coalition that has not yet been consolidated just weeks before the election. \n\nWhile the education and gender gaps prominent in national polls are reflected in Pennsylvania, they are not as pronounced.\n\nAmong all Pennsylvania voters, Trump and Harris are virtually tied with the college-educated, but Harris wins post-graduate-degree voters by a 2:1 margin while Trump wins voters without a college degree by a similar margin. Harris wins women by 9 points while Trump wins men by the same spread.\n\nThe education and gender trends don’t provide much insight into Pennsylvania’s undecided voters. Age does.\n\nAmong the undecided voters leaning toward Harris, a whopping 73% are aged 30 to 39. This is a five-alarm fire for the Harris campaign as millennials are reflexively progressive.\n\nIt explains why Harris is spending her time with millennial-oriented media like the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and generating social-media clips from late-night TV.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump’s leaners skew a generation older. Nearly 45% of his leaners are aged 40 to 49, on the tail end of the Gen X cohort. This likewise presents a daunting challenge for Trump as Gen X wants to vote Republican.\n\nIt is likely why Trump has taken to long-form interviews like Lex Fridman and Theo Von to give Gen X a direct insight into his clear thinking on key issues. \n\nMillennials seek an idealist to implement progressive stability. The likely issue for these millennial undecided leaners is that the past four years have failed to deliver.\n\nGen X seeks pragmatic leadership. While endearing to many in his coalition, Trump’s idiosyncrasies may give pause to this critical bloc of voters who simply want the government to function effectively and no longer be a focus of national attention. \n\nTo sway these crucial undecided voters, Trump must prove he can govern effectively without distraction while Harris needs to rebuild trust with voters who have considerable doubts.\n\nAs the presidential campaign heads into the final stretch, the October surprise may be that public polling indicates the election hinges on a narrow margin of undecided Pennsylvania voters who are more reflective of generational divides than political realignment.\n\nAthan Koutsiouroumbas is a managing director at Long Nyquist and Associates and a former congressional chief of staff. \n\nTwitter: @Athan_K\n\nReprinted with permission from RealClearPennsylvania.","summary":"Unexpectedly, Pennsylvania voters in two different generations are poised to elect the next president of the United States. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/us-news/these-are-the-pennsylvania-voters-who-could-decide-the-election/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-1204jd9sj-1728508808495.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728499951&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:54:59","author":"Athan Koutsiouroumbas","authors":["Athan Koutsiouroumbas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":259117458,"title":"Professor Who Suggested Shooting Men Who Won't Vote for Women Suspended","text":"A University of Kansas professor has been suspended after controversy erupted over his rhetoric suggesting that men who refuse to vote for female presidential candidates should be lined up and shot.University of Kansas spokesperson Erinn Barcomb-Peterson told The Topeka Capital-Journal in an article published on Wednesday that athletics lecturer Phillip Lowcock had been placed on administrative leave and was the subject of an investigation after a video surfaced of him making the comments during a recent lecture.\"We are aware of the video, which was recorded during a class earlier this semester,\" Barcomb-Peterson said. \"The instructor is being placed on administrative leave pending further investigation.

The roughly $1.7 billion was approved by members on both sides of the aisle in Congress and allowed a slice of FEMA's funding to go to helping states and localities deal with the ongoing migrant crisis. Simultaneously, FEMA's disaster relief fund, which is entirely separate from the program helping migrants, has continued to receive funding to the tune of nearly $244 billion, ProPublica reported. \"Disaster relief ought to go to prepare and to respond to a disaster when it strikes American territory. Our government has got to focus on our citizens, put their interests first, take care of American citizens when a disaster hits,\" Vance said. \"Unfortunately, under Kamala Harris's leadership, you've got FEMA, which is doing resettlement and relocation for illegal immigration. \"FEMA should take care of American citizens when a disaster strikes.

So whether you're voting on Election Day, or voting by mail or voting early, get out there and make your voice heard. \"I talked to a lot of people who planned to vote for Donald Trump in 2020, and 95 out of 100 of them actually went out and voted for Donald Trump. But you talk to the five who didn't vote for Donald Trump, and it's not because they changed their mind, it's because … their kid got sick, so they had to go pick him up from school, or they worked late that night and weren't able to make it to the polls before they closed.

I have never heard of such a thing being done in ‘News.’ It is the very definition of FAKE NEWS! The public is owed a MAJOR AND IMMEDIATE APOLOGY! This is an open and shut case, and must be investigated, starting today!” he wrote, capitalization again his.\n\nPresidential candidates have agreed to sit with 60 Minutes for more than half of a century, according to CBS News reporter Scott Pelley, and at first Trump was no different. However, Harris’ appearance alone on Monday evening only came after Trump was also invited to an interview, apparently agreed, but then backed out at the last minute.\n\n“The campaign offered shifting explanations. First, it complained that we would fact check the interview. We fact check every story. Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020. Trump claims correspondent Leslie Stahl said in that interview that Hunter Biden’s controversial laptop came from Russia. She never said that,” Pelley said.\n\nBoth campaigns, Pelley said, were warned the show’s pre-election day special would air regardless of whether either party participated.\n\nTrump’s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called for the network to release an unedited version of the Harris interview, after the network allegedly cut out parts of the Vice President’s “word salad.”\n\n“What else did they choose not to air? The American people deserve the full, unedited transcript from Kamala’s sit-down interview. We call upon 60 Minutes and CBS to release it. What do they, and Kamala, have to hide?” she said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the Harris-Walz campaign, Trump has been dodging any unfriendly press for weeks, just like he ducked a second debate with Harris.\n\n“Americans are starting to have real questions about Donald Trump’s capacity. He is cocooned in his safe spaces in right wing media, he backed out of 60 Minutes, and he refuses to stand before the American people in another debate,” Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. “He should say whether it’s because he’s scared or because he just can’t hack it.

To disguise their objectives and more easily \"inject themselves into larger X/Twitter conversations,\" some accounts regularly shared content about subjects such as sports and cryptocurrency, the report said.It was not possible to determine the precise entity behind the pro-Russian accounts.With data restrictions imposed by X since Musk purchased the company in 2022 for $44 billion, it was also difficult to assess their exact reach.Researchers are now required to pay a hefty fee for access to its API, which allows third-party developers to gather the social platform's data.\"If researchers had data access restored, more of such activity would likely be visible,\" the ASP report said.Bots and other automated accounts, researchers say, are a cornerstone of the Kremlin's efforts to spread misinformation, in some cases supplanting state media accounts which have been restricted across several countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.X did not reply to AFP's request for comment. Ahead of his purchase of the platform, Musk pledged to \"defeat the spam bots or die trying.\"But bot activity remains entrenched on the platform, a report from Australia's Queensland University of Technology said last year, after an analysis of about one million posts.The platform has gutted trust and safety teams and scaled back content moderation efforts, making it what researchers call a hotbed for misinformation.\"Despite the fact that Musk has an avowed goal of ridding his platform of bots, we've found that they persist on X, even coming from networks that are likely state-affiliated,\" said Jankowicz.\"This is behavior that is fairly easy to identify, and yet this multi-billion dollar corporation has not cracked down on these accounts that violate its platform manipulation and spam policies.\"","summary":"Hundreds of apparent pro-Russian bot accounts on X are pushing US election misinformation and amplifying false narratives about Democratic contender Kamala Harris, a research group said Thursday, calling them \"sleeper agents\" for having evaded detection for years.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/sleeper-agent-bots-x-fuel-us-election-misinformation-study-says-3746171","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4553090/researchers-analyzed-accounts-that-shared-posts-favoring-republican-candidate-donald-trump-while.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:45:22","author":"Anuj Chopra","authors":["Anuj Chopra"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":259117852,"title":"More Americans are saying they are Republican than Democrat. Will it impact the election?","text":"Republicans may not be facing the uphill battle they anticipated in the 2024 presidential election as new polling shows more Americans are calling themselves Republicans than Democrats.\n\nFor decades, Democrats have outnumbered Republicans when it comes to voters’ party identification, giving them an edge in national general elections. But polling from NBC News, Gallup and Pew Research Center show Republicans are catching up, or tied, with Democrats for the number of Americans who identify themselves with a party.\n\n“This is the under recognized game changer for 2024. Republicans competing on a level playing field,” Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies wrote on X in May. \n\nThe poll, conducted jointly with the Democratic polling firm Hart Research Associates, showed that among registered voters, 41 percent identify as Republicans while 40 percent identify as Democrats. That is a large deviation from similar polling conducted in 2020 which showed Democrats had a six-point advantage.\n\nSimilar results have come from other polls. Gallup found that in the first nine months of 2024, the number of people who identify as Republicans is equivalent the number of people who identify as Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, that same Gallup polling found Democrats held a four-point lead over Republicans.\n\nPew Research Center released results in April that showed 48 percent of registered voters are Republican or lean to the Republican Party while 49 percent are or lean Democratic. Four years ago, Democrats had a 5-point advantage over the GOP.\n\nThe trend indicates Republicans, and former president Donald Trump, have garnered more national support over the last four years than between 2008 and 2016.\n\nSome pollsters credit the change to the growing number of Latino voters supporting Trump. Traditionally, Latino voters lean toward Democratic candidates but the Trump campaign has successfully appealed to the demographic who they hope can hand them a win.\n\nRepublican pollster Patrick Ruffini told the Wall Street Journal that the change in party identification takes some pressure off Trump.\n\n“It’s a loose indicator that you have a number of people who are disappointed in the Democratic Party’s performance,” Ruffini said.\n\nWhile the numbers are good for the GOP, it does not necessarily mean they will win the presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris is still narrowly leading in most major national polls and similar trends emerged in the 2022 midterm election when Republicans incorrectly predicted a “red wave.”\n\nWhile the polling shows interesting developments in political ideology trends, the numbers are not strong enough to serve as a safety blanket for the GOP.","summary":"More voters are registered as Democrats but recent trends show a shift in self identification","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/2024-election-republicans-democrats-id-b2626829.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/28/13/SEI223444443.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XEmT52N6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:40:42","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":259116614,"title":"Democrat Flips Mayor's Seat in Area Trump Won by Over 10 Points","text":"Democrat Grier Hopkins clinched the Fairbanks North Star Borough mayoral seat in a razor-thin victory, flipping the post held by Republican Bruce Ward—who reached his term limit—in a region former President Donald Trump won by over 10 points in 2020.Municipal elections in the central Alaskan borough, which encompasses the cities of Fairbanks and North Pole, took place on October 1, and borough officials have been tallying absentee ballots during the last few days.

Voter turnout was around 25 percent.Hopkins told Newsweek in a statement Wednesday afternoon, \"The victory was close, and very hard fought but also amicable. Both myself and John Coghill ran mostly positive campaigns about how to grow our community, create a strong economy and Improve local quality of life. The differences were between how we'd get there, and I will prioritize stronger funding of our schools. That community first approach allowed for cross over partisan voters to support me, as opposed to partisan fights and culture war issues.\"Regarding both the previous and coming presidential election, Hopkins said, \"The FNSB [Fairbanks North Star Borough] voters like candidates who support Alaskan issues, and work together to solve problems. We are pragmatic people, and the majority of us are not registered for either party.\"Newsweek reached out to Coghill and Shields for comment via email on Wednesday.The Democratic victor is the son of former Mayor Luke Hopkins, who in 2016 lost the Alaska State Senate seat to Coghill. Ward served two terms in the role, having secured just over 50 percent of the vote in 2018, when he was first elected, and 82 percent in 2021.The Alaskan borough is in the traditionally red state, which favored Trump by 10 points in 2020, as the presidential nominee secured 52.8 percent of the vote to Biden's 42.8 percent.While the state reports election data based on House districts rather than boroughs, Fairbanks North Star Borough encompasses Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and a small portion of 6, as confirmed to Newsweek by the Alaska Division of Elections.In 2020, Trump carried those six districts with a 15-point lead, receiving 57.8 percent of the vote compared to Biden's 42.2 percent. When District 6 is excluded from the borough's count, Trump led by a smaller margin of 12.8 points, with 56.4 percent to Biden's 43.6 percent, but still led by more than at the state level.The only time a Democratic presidential candidate won Alaska was in 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson was elected. The Republican Party has carried the state by comfortable double-digit margins in recent cycles; however, Trump's margin did shrink in the state from 2016 to 2020. In his first election against Hillary Clinton, he carried the state by nearly 15 points.The state, rated \"Solid Republican\" in presidential races by Cook Political Report, has had a handful of Democratic governors, including the state's first governor, Bill Egan. Most recent polls for Alaska show Trump leading Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris by 5 to 10 percentage points.An Alaska Survey Research poll of 1,182 likely voters conducted from September 27 to September 29 found 52 percent of voters backing Trump and 43 percent supporting Harris. The poll has a margin of error of plus/minus 2.9 percentage points.","summary":"Democrat Grier Hopkins narrowly defeated Republican John Bruce Coghill Jr. for the Fairbanks North Star Borough mayor's post.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-flip-mayors-seat-alaska-narrow-margin-1966704","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2491593/trump-palin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:37:58","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.02},{"id":259116328,"title":"Trump predicts ‘explosion’ between Biden, Harris during Scranton rally","text":"Former President Donald Trump predicted to supporters in President Biden’s birth city of Scranton, Pa., Wednesday that the commander in chief will break with Vice President Kamala Harris before next month’s election.\n\n“He looks better now than I’ve ever seen him looking,” Trump said, referring to Biden’s appearance since dropping his re-election bid July 21.\n\nHowever, the 45th president, 78, also suggested that Biden was “angry” since he was forced to quit the race by a Democratic “coup.”\n\n“He’s angry, he’s angry at her,” Trump mused. “There’s going to be an explosion before the election with them.

attack would be \"lethal\" and \"surprising\", as a separate Israeli air strike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense centre in southern Lebanon, killing five members stationed there.\n\n\"Our attack will be lethal, precise and above all surprising,\" Mr Gallant said during a speech to Israeli troops on Wednesday, local time. \n\n\"They will not understand what happened and how it happened\". \n\nIran fired dozens of missiles at Israel last week in an escalation of the conflict between the two countries, and Israel has vowed to respond to the attack.\n\nOn the same day, an Israeli air strike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense center in the town of Dardghaya in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe strike killed five members stationed there, Civil Defense spokesperson Elie Khairallah told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Lebanese Health Ministry also confirmed the news in a statement, saying Israel has \"renewed its targeting of rescue and ambulance crews tonight, disregarding international laws, norms and humanitarian conventions\".\n\nThere was no immediate statement from the Israeli military.\n\nAmong the victims was Abdullah Al-Moussawi, head of the Tyre regional civil defence centre, Mr Khairallah said. \n\nThe health ministry said teams continued to search for survivors in the rubble.\n\nBefore Wednesday's strike, six civil defence members had been killed since last October, Mr Khairallah said.\n\nAs of last Thursday, the health ministry reported that more than 100 paramedics had been killed by Israeli air strikes since last October and 225 have been wounded.\n\nJust last week, Mr Al-Moussawi spoke with the Associated Press, saying the Israeli air strikes had made his team increasingly nervous, but that they were hopeful that the international protection guaranteed to medics would extend to them as well.\n\n\"We put international protection (tag) on our vehicles along with the (national) Civil Defense flag and we wear the yellow vests,\" he said.\n\nCentres in Lebanon shelter hundreds of thousands\n\nLebanon's crisis response unit announced on Wednesday that 22 people were killed and 80 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,141 killed and 10,099 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.\n\nThe report also recorded 70 air strikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley.\n\nSome 1,000 centres — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities and other institutions — are sheltering 185,400 people displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. \n\nHalf of those displaced are housed in facilities concentrated in Beirut and Mount Lebanon.\n\nAmong these shelters, 807 have reached full capacity. \n\nOverall, the total number of displaced individuals in Lebanon stands at an estimated 1.2 million.\n\nAdditionally, about 15,000 displaced individuals have received medical treatment and medication.\n\nIsraeli soldiers raise Israeli flag in southern Lebanon\n\nVideo verified by The Associated Press shows what appears to be a group of Israeli soldiers raising an Israeli flag in a village in southern Lebanon.\n\nIn the video, which appears to have been filmed in Maroun el-Ras, three soldiers are seen hoisting a flag atop a pile of debris. A soldier off camera speaks in Hebrew and refers to the nearby Israeli village of Avivim. It was not clear when the video was recorded.\n\nIsraeli troops have been operating in Maroun el-Ras, where they have taken up positions inside a public garden on the edge of the village.\n\nThe video follows other similar acts that took place throughout Israel's ground offensive in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military had no immediate comment.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu hold first phone call in seven weeks\n\nBiden and Netanyahu have broken nearly two months of silence with a phone call as Israel expands its ground incursion into Lebanon and considers how to respond to Iran. \n\nVice-President Kamala Harris also joined the 30-minute call, according to the White House.\n\n\"It was direct, it was productive,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who added that the leaders discussed a long list of issues on the call, including Israel's deliberations on how it will respond to Iran.\n\nMr Netanyahu's office, meantime, confirmed that the prime minister had recently spoken with former president Donald Trump.\n\nThe Biden-Netanyahu conversation comes at a moment of Mr Biden's growing frustration with the prime minister and as the growing conflict in the Middle East is adding a layer of complexity to the American election next month.","summary":"Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has warned an Israeli strike on Iran in response to its recent missile attack would be \"lethal\" and \"surprising\", as a separate Israeli air strike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense centre in southern Lebanon, killing five members stationed there. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-10/israeli-retaliation-against-iran-thousands-in-lebanon-displaced/104454018","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2bcff8d0a8981ca66f05b26ada38b7a6?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:31:02","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":259116474,"title":"Global denuclearization deal was close – Trump","text":"Washington had almost reached an agreement on nuclear weapons with Moscow and Beijing during his time in the White House, former US president and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said.\n\nTrump made the claim during a two-hour interview with comedian Andrew Schulz, posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.\n\n“We were close to a deal for getting rid of nuclear weapons. It would be so good,” Trump said. “I’m talking about Russia, ourselves and China. We would then bring everyone else into it.”\n\nNuclear weapons are “the biggest threat we have in the world today,” Trump argued. “It’s not global warming, where the oceans are rising 1/8 of an inch in the next 500 years.”\n\nNeither Russia nor China have yet commented on Trump’s claim about a denuclearization treaty in the works during his administration.\n\nTrump’s remarks came up during a discussion of Iran’s alleged nuclear program, in which he criticized President Joe Biden for being reluctant to confront Tehran. Biden has publicly urged Israel to refrain from striking Iranian nuclear and oil facilities.\n\nThe five nuclear-armed members of the UN Security Council had struck a deal with Tehran in 2015, under which Iran would not enrich uranium beyond a certain level, and therefore be unable to build atomic weapons. Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the arrangement in 2018. Though Biden promised to reinstate the deal, his diplomats failed to get any traction on the issue over the past four years.\n\nIn 2019, Trump also pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Treaty, accusing Russia of being in breach of it. That left the New START as the last remaining arms control deal between Russia and the US. Trump initially sought to get China to join the treaty, but Beijing declined, and it looked as if New START might expire at the start of Trump’s second term.\n\nThe Biden White House extended the treaty in February 2021, but it now looks likely it will expire in 2026. Russia suspended its participation in New START in February 2023, citing the illegal and illegitimate US sanctions preventing its reciprocal enforcement, as well as US support for Ukrainian attacks on Russian strategic air bases.\n\nTrump officially lost the 2020 election to Biden, but has questioned the vote’s legitimacy ever since.

[+] supporters during a campaign rally in Wisconsin. Harris has proposed expanding Medicare to include home health aide services in addition to vision and dental benefits.(Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Harris proposed an expansion of the Medicare program on Tuesday, Oct. 8th, to assist in covering the costs of home health aide care for seniors and disabled people. She also called for adding vision, hearing and dental benefits to Medicare. These are popular provisions among constituents, including Medicare beneficiaries and their families, and would help alleviate financial and other burdens, particularly for those struggling to find affordable in-home care for themselves or aging or disabled relatives.\n\nNevertheless, if elected president, Harris would likely encounter major hurdles in Congress, both with respect to approval of the expansion of the Medicare program and the main proposed funding route for the plan to include in-home care.\n\nHome health encompasses a wide range of healthcare services that a person can get in their home for an illness, injury, incapacitation or simply inability to fully take care of oneself. Harris’s “Medicare at Home” initiative would pay for health aides to assist seniors and disabled people who “are unable to independently perform activities of daily living like bathing, eating, and going to the bathroom and/or face serious cognitive impairment,” according to a Harris campaign press release. The benefit would be universal in that it would extend to all 67 million of the nation’s seniors and those with disabilities.\n\nThe New York Times describes the Medicare expansion plan as one that would help the so-called sandwich generation take care of their aging parents. These adults must take care of their children while at the same time assist their parents to ensure that they can stay at home and not be placed in a nursing or assisted living facility.\n\nHarris said the cost of the new benefit would be offset by a number of measures, including the expansion of the numbers of prescription drugs eligible for Medicare price negotiations, taxes on companies that shift jobs overseas and payments from Medicare recipients on a sliding scale according to household income.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nHurricane Milton Live Updates: ‘Life-Threatening Hurricane-Force Winds’ Expected In Florida Soon\n\nTrump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Harris Holds Onto Lead In 4 New Polls\n\nGmail Hackers Have Control Of 2FA, Email And Number? Here’s What To Do\n\nThere is a way for people to get the government to pay for long-term, comprehensive home health aide services through Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor. It covers home care for elderly and disabled Americans who need it. However, to become eligible, people must spend down their savings and often face long waiting periods.\n\nCurrent Situation In Medicare\n\nUnder the existing program rules, Medicare Part A (hospital insurance, such as inpatient stays) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance, such as physician-administered drug infusions) temporarily cover eligible home health services related to a specific care plan, following, say, a surgical procedure, injury or illness. The person being cared for must be “homebound” and require “part-time or intermittent skilled services.” Here, part-time or intermittent means skilled nursing care and home health aide services for up to eight hours a day and a maximum of 28 hours per week.\n\nMedicare doesn’t pay for 24-hour-a-day in-home care, home meal delivery and other services like shopping and cleaning that are unrelated to a specific care plan. Similarly, Medicare does not cover custodial or personal care that helps a person in their daily living activities, including bathing, dressing or using a bathroom, if these aren’t connected to a care plan.\n\nMedicare also does not insure for vision, hearing or dental services, though Medicare beneficiaries can sign up for private Medicare Advantage plans that may offer these as optional benefits in addition to certain home health aide services.\n\nCongressional Hurdles To Medicare Expansion\n\nIt’s unclear how much the additional benefits of home health aide, vision, hearing and dental benefits would cost. According to the Associated Press, the Harris campaign pointed to previous proposals for in-home healthcare specifically that had $40 billion price tags per year.\n\nBut the expansion of covered in-home services could increase Medicare spending by “tens of billions of dollars” more than the Harris campaign projects, according to a senior economist with the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nAnd Brookings estimated in 2019 that adding vision, hearing and dental benefits to Medicare would cost approximately $36 billion annually.\n\nThe costs associated with proposals that to add benefits for Medicare beneficiaries have proven to be sticking points in Congress in the recent past. For example, President Biden and Democratic lawmakers floated plans to cover vision, hearing and dental benefits, but these were rejected by Congress. Biden also tried to include long-term home health in the Inflation Reduction Act, to no avail. And this was when the Democrats had a majority in both the House and Senate. In addition, efforts more than 14 years ago to address Medicare coverage of long-term care at home never made it into the Affordable Care Act as they were not considered financially feasible, again at a time that Democrats held the presidency and a majority in both chambers in Congress.\n\nHarris says that a bulk of the costs of the home health aide benefits could be offset by the savings the federal government accrues from negotiating lower prices from an increasing number of prescription drugs in the Medicare program. But it’s not clear that these projected savings are as large as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have stated. And even if the cost offsets would materialize, there’s the question of whether Congress would approve an amendment to the IRA to expand the numbers of prescription drugs eligible to be selected for price negotiation. At present, the Democrats don’t control the House and only have a very slim majority in the Senate. It’s anyone’s guess as to what the make-up of Congress will look like after the November election.\n\nFollow me on Twitter. \n\nJoshua P.

In 2016, Hogan wrote in his father Larry Hogan Sr., and in 2020, he wrote in the late President Ronald Reagan. MARYLAND SENATE RACE: DEMOCRAT ALSOBROOKS LEADS REPUBLICAN HOGAN IN CLOSELY WATCHED CONTEST Hogan has said that as a senator, he would support legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into law. Roe was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. He has also indicated that he would not support confirmation of Supreme Court nominees who cannot earn bipartisan support. \"Today, I made a commitment to Maryland that, as Senator, I will only vote for nominees who can earn support from both sides of the aisle,\" the moderate Republican noted in a recent post on X. \"If there's one place that we should not be playing politics, it's appointments to the Supreme Court and the cabinet.

Ohio, the justices overturned the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader who uttered antisemitic and racist comments during an organizational meeting. Ohio could only outlaw speech, the court ruled, if it threatened imminent lawlessness.\n\nTwo decades later, in 1989, the court ruled that a Texas man could not be punished for burning an American flag.\n\n“If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in his majority opinion. \n\nEven misinformation and lies are protected from criminal prosecution by the First Amendment, the court ruled in 2012, when it invalidated a federal law making it a crime to falsely claim military honors. \n\n“Falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the First Amendment,” the justices concluded. \n\nSo don’t worry, Gov. Walz. Despite the stolen-valor accusations against you, the Supreme Court has your back.\n\nIt’s not the government’s job to shield the public from falsehoods, the court explained in that case, United States v. Alvarez. \n\n“Our constitution’s tradition stands against” the need for a “Ministry of Truth,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, giving a nod to George Orwell’s “1984.”\n\nAnd political correctness, too, must take a back seat to freedom of speech, the court ruled in 2017, when it struck down a US Trademarks Office regulation that blocked Simon Tam and his Asian-American band members from calling themselves “The Slants,” which the agency had rejected as “disparaging.”\n\nFew reading these decisions will like all of them. But that’s the point. \n\nFreedom of speech doesn’t benefit any one group: It’s an even-handed principle that keeps democracy alive. \n\nThe racist KKK member, the communist and the anti-American flag burner are protected so that all of us can be confident of the ability to express our views fearlessly.\n\nBut while the First Amendment exists to protect unpopular views, more than half of Americans, 53%, think it “goes too far,” according to a poll sponsored by the Foundation for Freedom of Individual Rights and Expression — with Democrats especially opposed.\n\nWalz and Harris, together with President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and other Democrats have all come out against free speech — particularly on social media platforms, the 21st century’s public square. \n\nWalz insists there’s no First Amendment protection for misinformation or hate speech — staggering, coming from a former social studies teacher.\n\nIn 2019, Harris called on Twitter to deplatform Trump, arguing online expression is a “privilege” and that censorship is necessary to protect democracy.\n\nIn office, she and President Biden erected a vast censorship operation that sent White House and agency employees to tell social media executives what “misinformation” and which individuals should be silenced.\n\nEven scientists who questioned the efficacy of masking and vaccines were canceled and posts about their research removed — posts which, in many cases, later proved to be correct.\n\nFacebook, YouTube and Google were pressured into doing the administration’s dirty work, an effort that continues today. \n\nTwo states and five individuals sued to stop what the federal district court called this “far-reaching and widespread censorship campaign.” \n\nBut in the case, Murthy v. Missouri, the Supreme Court refused to rule on the censorship issue due to “standing,” a legal technicality.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, disgusted at the court’s punt, warned that the Biden-Harris censorship scheme was “blatantly unconstitutional” — and that democracy cannot survive under a government that suppresses free speech.\n\nPay close attention to Alito’s admonition. \n\nThat is what’s at stake in November. \n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York.","summary":"Since the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court has consistently struck down government attempts to silence speech — even speech that’s divisive, untrue or hateful.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/opinion/free-speech-101-americans-must-re-learn-our-most-basic-right/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/BILL12212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:11:21","author":"Betsy McCaughey","authors":["Betsy McCaughey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.013},{"id":259115180,"title":"Trump gaining in polling to win the ‘Blue Wall’ states as Harris poll momentum slows","text":"A new poll of three crucial swing states shows the 2024 race deadlocked while Kamala Harris’s momentum grinds to a crawl.\n\nHarris trails Trump in two midwestern battlegrounds, Michigan and Wisconsin, dragged down by concerns about her ability to manage America’s role in global crises, according to a Quinnipiac poll released on Wednesday. In both states, she is behind by low single digits; 50% to 47% in Michigan, and 48% to 46% in Wisconsin.\n\nShe leads the former president in Pennsylvania, however, the state analysts have suggested she could lose by not picking its governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate. Quinnipiac’s survey has her ahead, 49% to 46%, in Pennsylvania.\n\nAll three states are part of the “Blue Wall” — states which, from 1992 to the Trump era, supported Democrats every cycle. Trump won all three in 2016.\n\nThe vice president’s greatest polling drag appears to be her numbers on the war in the Middle East, where voters in all three states have, by considerable margins, less confidence in her leadership abilities than Donald Trump’s. The greatest gulf is in Michigan, home to substantial Arab-American, Palestinian-American and Muslim communities; Harris trails her opponent by 10 points on the issue here, 53% to 43%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, her greatest issue strength is on abortion. Voters trust her by double-digit margins in all three states, according to Quinnipiac, over Trump on issues of reproductive health and freedom.\n\nThere’s another important factor for both candidates to consider here: signs that Harris’s ceiling could be higher than her numbers show so far. While Harris trails her Republican opponent in Michigan and Wisconsin, Democrats are leading in Wisconsin’s Senate race and tied in Michigan, meaning the vice president is underperforming her party’s senatorial nominee by one point.\n\nWith just weeks left in the race, the polling suggests it may be time for Harris to break further away from her former running mate, Joe Biden, on issues where he too was trailing former President Trump in polling. She has done that already on the economy, by announcing several plans (such as a proposal to expand small-business and first-time homebuyer tax credits) previously not part of Biden’s 2024 re-election platform.\n\nBut it also suggests that Donald Trump is in a clear position to win the 2024 election, despite trailing his opponent in fundraising every month since she took over the Democratic ticket in July, and a debate showdown largely recognized as a victory for Harris last month.\n\nAnother poll released on Wednesday had far better news for Harris, as well as Trump’s rivals within the GOP itself.\n\nIn a survey commissioned by a Democratic strategy outfit, The Bulwark reports that Donald Trump appears to be winning only a fraction of Republican voters who went for his main rival, Nikki Haley, in this year’s GOP presidential primary. Trump won the votes of 46% of those Republicans, according to the survey, while 36% backed Harris.","summary":"Vice president is weighed down by concerns about Gaza conflict, dampening Democratic enthusiasm","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-poll-swing-states-b2626810.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/06/15/TrumpHarris.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eGIwb6iA-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:08:11","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.049},{"id":259117094,"title":"A federal judge will hear more evidence on whether to reopen voter registration in Georgia - The Associated Press","text":"ATLANTA (AP) — At least for now, a federal judge won’t order the state of Georgia to reopen voter registration for November’s elections. \n\nU.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross ruled after a Wednesday hearing that three voting rights groups haven’t yet done enough to prove that damage and disruptions from Hurricane Helene unfairly deprived people of the opportunity to register last week. Monday was Georgia’s registration deadline. Instead, Ross set another hearing for Thursday to consider more evidence and legal arguments. \n\nState officials and the state Republican Party argue it would be a heavy burden on counties to order them to register additional voters as they prepare for early in-person voting to begin next Tuesday. \n\nThe lawsuit was filed by the Georgia conference of the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda and the New Georgia Project. All three groups say they had to cancel voter registration activities last week. Historically, there’s a spike in Georgia voter registrations just before the deadline, the plaintiffs said.\n\nGeorgia has 8.2 million registered voters, according to online records from Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office. But with Georgia’s presidential race having been decided by only 12,000 votes in 2020, a few thousand votes could make a difference in whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the state’s 16 electoral votes. At least 10 lawsuits related to election issues have been filed in Georgia in recent weeks.\n\nThe groups say the storm kept people with driver’s licenses from registering online because of widespread power and internet outages in the eastern half of the state and kept people from registering in person because at least 37 county election offices were closed for parts of last week. The lawsuit also notes that mail pickup and delivery was suspended in 27 counties, including the cities of Augusta, Savannah, Statesboro, Dublin and Vidalia.\n\nA federal judge in Florida denied a request to reopen voter registration in that state after hearing arguments Wednesday. The plaintiffs are considering whether to appeal. The lawsuit brought by the Florida chapters of the League of Women Voters and NAACP contends that thousands of people may have missed the registration deadline because they were recovering from Helene or preparing to evacuate from Milton. \n\nA court in South Carolina extended that state’s registration deadline after Helene, and courts in Georgia and Florida did extend registration deadlines after 2016’s Hurricane Matthew. In North Carolina, which was more heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene, the registration deadline isn’t until Friday. Voters there can also register and cast a ballot simultaneously during the state’s early in-person voting period, which runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 2.\n\nThe Georgia plaintiffs argued that the shutdown of voter registration violates their rights under the First Amendment and 14th Amendment, which guarantee equal protection and due process to all citizens. They also say the shutdown violates a provision of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act that requires states to accept voter registrations submitted or mailed up to 30 days before an election.\n\nAt least 40 advocacy groups asked Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger to extend the registration deadline in affected counties before the Georgia lawsuit was filed.","summary":"A federal judge will hear more evidence on whether to reopen voter registration in Georgia  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-voter-registration-election-hurricane-helene-8707fe9c27749f097f4e7318ab06fb1c","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/48a341b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3780+0+350/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fad%2F75%2Fb6f41c2b41190bc511498b0ab0c0%2F50b5367cef594bed8d2e75b5eadac158","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:06:00","author":"Jeff Amy","authors":["Jeff Amy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":259114676,"title":"Trump-Putin ties are back in the spotlight after new book describes calls","text":"WASHINGTON - \n\n\r\n A new book's assertion that former President Donald Trump may have had as many as seven private phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving the White House has refocused attention on their politically fraught relationship and on Trump's sustained dialogue with world leaders as he seeks a return to power.\n\n\r\n It's not surprising in and of itself that an ex-president would preserve ties with foreign counterparts. But the detail in journalist Bob Woodward's book “War” raised eyebrows in light of a special counsel investigation during Trump's presidency that examined potential ties between Russia and the Republican's 2016 campaign as well as Trump's more recent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion — statements that have hinted at a possible U.S. policy overhaul if he's elected.\n\n\r\n\r\n The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\r\n\n\r\n “I would caution any world leader about trusting Vladimir Putin with anything,” said Emily Harding, who led the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and is now a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\r\n Both the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favour of Trump, denied the reporting.\n\n\r\n Asked at a press briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration would have “serious concerns” if the reported calls were true.\n\n\r\n “We’re not aware of those calls. I certainly can’t confirm any of those calls from here,” she said. “But, if it is indeed true, are we (concerned)? Do we have serious concerns? Yes.”\n\n\r\n It's no secret that Trump has held multiple meetings over the last year with major world leaders: hosting Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sitting down in New York last April with Polish President Andrzej Duda and meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president's trip to the U.S. last month.\n\n\r\n The meetings offer Trump an opportunity to differentiate his foreign policy approach from that of President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to shore up connections if he reclaims the White House. During Netanyahu's visit in July, Trump boasted of a “great relationship,” drawing a tacit contrast with the more strained dynamic between the Israeli leader and Biden.\n\n\r\n While those meetings were known publicly, Woodward's book cites an unnamed aide as saying Trump and Putin had as many as seven private calls. That adds to long-running questions about their relationship and what Trump may be trying to achieve, said Robert Orttung, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University.\n\n\r\n As president, “We never really understood why he liked Putin so much and why he was trying to develop such a close relationship with someone who is clearly an adversary and against everything the United States stands for,” Orttung said.\n\n\r\n\r\n Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp\r\n\n\r\n Some claims about ties between Trump and allies and Russia have proved overheated or fizzled over time, but the subject continues to draw considerable public scrutiny, including after Trump left office.\n\n\r\n The FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller spent several years investigating whether Russia had colluded with the 2016 Trump campaign to tip the outcome of the election. Though investigators did not establish a criminal conspiracy, they did find the Trump campaign actively welcomed Russia's help during the election and that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency.\n\n\r\n In 2018, after meeting Putin in Helsinki, Trump memorably and publicly questioned his own intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia meddled in the election.\n\n\r\n “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said at the time. He added: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”\n\n\r\n More recently, Trump called Putin “pretty smart” for invading Ukraine and has praised Russia's military record in historical conflicts, saying last month: \"As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.”\n\n\r\n The book, which also says Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, does not describe the content of their conversations.\n\n\r\n Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung denied they occurred, calling the book by the famed Watergate journalist the “work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.” Trump complained at a campaign event on Wednesday that “I had to go through years of Russia, Russia, Russia, and they knew it was fake.”\n\n\r\n A Kremlin spokesman also denied the calls happened.\n\n\r\n The book's details revived discussion about the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that bars private American citizens from trying to intervene in “disputes or controversies” between the United States and foreign powers without government approval.\n\n\r\n\r\n America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective\r\n\n\r\n The statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction. Former presidents from Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton have held talks with international figures after leaving the White House.\n\n\r\n “Trump could be technically liable just as I think dozens of prominent figures have been technically liable,” said Daniel Rice, a University of Arkansas law professor and constitutional law expert.\n\n\r\n Among the possible reasons for the law's dormancy, Rice said, is a disinclination by prosecutors to “turn violators into martyrs\" or to be seen as targeting a sitting president's political adversaries.\n\n\r\n Trump himself was briefed by then-White House counsel Don McGahn about the Logan Act following a well-publicized episode involving his first national security adviser. In a phone call during the presidential transition period in 2016, Michael Flynn urged Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. to be “even-keeled” in response to Obama administration penalties imposed for election interference and assured him that “we can have a better conversation\" after Trump became president.\n\n\r\n Flynn was interviewed by the FBI about that conversation and pleaded guilty to lying to agents about it, though Trump pardoned Flynn in the final weeks of his presidency.\n\n\r\n Trump later called for former Secretary of State John Kerry to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act over his conversations with Iran after he left the Obama administration. Kerry was never charged.\n\n\r\n\n\r\n Associated Press writer Will Weissert in Washington contributed.","summary":"A new book's assertion that former U.S. president Donald Trump may have had as many as seven private phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving the White House has refocused attention on their politically fraught relationship and on Trump's sustained dialogue with world leaders as he seeks a return to power.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-putin-ties-are-back-in-the-spotlight-after-new-book-describes-calls-1.7068535","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/10/9/donald-trump-meets-vladimir-putin-1-7068557-1728510946670.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:05:19","author":"Eric Tucker,The Associated Press","authors":["Eric Tucker","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":259113542,"title":"China, US locked in lose-lose tech battle whoever wins White House, experts say","text":"The presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris comes at a time of rising geopolitical tensions on multiple fronts. In the first of an in-depth series, Jane Cai takes a look at what lies ahead for the hi-tech rivalry between China and the US.\nWashington and Beijing’s hi-tech rivalry is expected to continue and even intensify, regardless of who wins the US presidential election, according to analysts who say the tone for further strained US-China relations has already been set.\nFormer president Donald Trump’s boast that he took “billions and billions of dollars” from China through tariffs on a wide variety of Chinese imports, including hi-tech products, suggest that higher duties could be on the way if he wins the White House.\nMeanwhile, Vice-President Kamala Harris has promised to make sure “that America – not China – wins the competition for the 21st century and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership”.\nThe approaches of the candidates may differ but the tech competition between China and the US will continue to weigh heavily on the international economic and geopolitical landscape, analysts said.\n“Breakthroughs in science and technology will be central to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century and to efforts by the US and China to dominate it,” said Sourabh Gupta, a senior policy specialist with the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington.\n“To be clear, there is no ‘new cold war’ that is about to break out as yet in US-China relations [of] the sort of overarching zero-sum rivalry that played out between Washington and Moscow during the second half of the 20th century,” Gupta said.\n“However, there is a palpable cold war-style, zero-sum equation settling into their competition to dominate the high-technology and advanced manufacturing industries of tomorrow.”\nThe US has been tightening its grip on technology transfers with China for years, denying market access to Chinese tech products and cracking down on technology-related investments in both directions.\n\nTelecoms equipment giants Huawei and ZTE were banned from the US during the Trump administration because of alleged links to the Chinese government and military.\nSales of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to China by the US and its allies have also been banned on national security grounds.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasised the importance of technological self-reliance and the development of home-grown industries of the future, including AI and quantum computing, to keep China in the global tech race.\nAnalysts expect Harris to stick with President Joe Biden’s “small yard, high fence” approach to China if she wins in November. The strategy puts strict restrictions on a few military-related technologies while maintaining normal economic exchanges in other areas.\nBut the same semiconductors that are subject to export controls because of their use in advanced artificial intelligence models, weapons and surveillance systems are also used in autonomous vehicles, 5G-connected phones, and commercial applications of AI.\nThe Biden administration has also barred hundreds of Chinese companies from importing almost all US-origin products from the US and its allies and introduced inbound and outbound investment screening if tech firms are involved.\nHarris is also expected to raise the fencing over computing-related technologies, biotech and clean tech – areas singled out by the Biden administration as a “national security imperative” for the US to hold its leadership position.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed 25 laws in just one week of September, in a largely bipartisan push to limit China’s influence by restricting access to China-linked biotech companies, China-made drones and even Chinese electric vehicle components.\nWu Hailong, president of the semi-official China Public Diplomacy Association, warned that the “anti-China bills could potentially push the Sino-US relationship into a dangerous position once again”.\nThe latest bills follow the Chips and Science Act, enacted in August 2022, that set aside US$53 billion to fund American semiconductor production and research and was hailed by the White House for “protecting national security” as well as “bringing semiconductor supply chains home”.\nAccording to Pang Zhongying, chair professor in international political economy at Sichuan University in Chengdu, “there is already a complete set of rules and regulations to curb China’s technological development”.\n“If Harris is elected, policy continuity will be the main theme, though she may show her own preference later, if she has a second term,” he said.\nIf Trump is returned to the presidency, he is likely to tilt towards a “smaller government”, reduce industry subsidies and resort to trade tariffs again as a bargaining tool, Pang said.\nTrump has recently called for up to 20 per cent tariffs on all imports and 60 per cent on Chinese goods, prompting many experts to predict that a second Trump presidency would be more confrontational towards Beijing.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, the Trump administration imposed four rounds of tariffs on about two-thirds of US imports from China, after an investigation found China’s practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation were “unreasonable or discriminatory and burdened or restricted US commerce”.\n“The silver lining [for China] may be Trump’s attitude towards American allies. After all, not all companies in other countries are willing to abandon the massive market of China,” Pang said.\nThe Biden administration has been pressing US allies – including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan – to tighten restrictions on China’s access to semiconductor technology.\nHowever, Trump, an “America First” advocate, is dubious about alliances and has been a vocal critic of world organisations such as Nato.\nThere are also concerns in Europe that a victory for Trump in November could mean a decline in US aid to Ukraine.\n\nMei Xinyu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, said that while their approaches may vary, both candidates intend to press ahead with technology curbs on China.\nAccording to Mei, the confrontation is likely to reach a peak during the next US president’s four-year tenure.\n“During that period, China’s focus will be on technological development. It will spare no effort to innovate and industrialise innovation results as soon as possible by taking advantage of its economic scale.”\nBeijing has pumped nearly 690 billion yuan (US$97 billion) into the chip industry since 2014, in its bid to be able to mass produce its own advanced chips, and is also pursuing a bigger say in global AI governance.\nChina has also doubled down on its efforts to persuade the many leading Chinese scientists overseas to return home and train domestic talent in the emerging hi-tech industries.\nIn June, Xi wrote to world-renowned computer scientist and AI expert Andrew Yao Chi-Chih, the only Chinese winner of the AM Turing Award, to praise his decision to leave the US two decades ago to teach at Tsinghua University.\nXi urged Yao – who heads the university’s Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences and the new College of Artificial Intelligence – to continue helping China achieve self-reliance and become an educational, scientific and technological powerhouse.\n\nAccording to Richard Suttmeier, a University of Oregon researcher looking at science and technology in the context of US-China relations, “in many ways, the current situation is one of lose-lose for both countries”.\n“China’s commitment to high levels of self-reliance in science and technology development, in spite of numerous international ties, puts it somewhat at odds with global trends,” he said.\n“US efforts to build a network of cooperation in science and technology among democracies will have some national and international benefits in the shorter run, but as a strategy that attempts to isolate China’s emergence as a science and technology superpower, is likely to run into big problems over the longer run.”\nSix of the top 10 rising institutions in artificial intelligence between 2019 and 2023 were in China, but they remained relatively decoupled from US-led global collaboration networks, according to the latest Nature Index.\nThe AI index, compiled by part of the group that owns the British journal Nature, found that China’s global connectivity is lagging behind the US – the leading AI research nation – as well as Britain and Germany.\nAccording to Michael Frank, chief executive and founder of business intelligence platform Seldon Strategies, the US-China relationship has settled into a new equilibrium that will persist for a long time.\n“Tactics may change, but the US strategy of limiting technology transfer to China, and the Chinese strategy of achieving technological self-sufficiency, are fixed,” he said.\n“Many countries are wary of being forced to choose between the US and China. Even if the competitors don’t make those demands explicitly, global companies will have to make a decision between which ecosystem to prioritise.”","summary":"The rivalry to dominate in AI, quantum computing and other technologies of the future may even intensify after November’s election.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3281480/china-us-locked-lose-lose-tech-battle-whoever-wins-white-house-experts-say","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/09/154b346f-fe6a-49b9-847e-def51c581634_2e3c6115.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:00:09","author":"Jane Cai","authors":["Jane Cai"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.001},{"id":259114908,"title":"WATCH LIVE: Trump campaigns in Reading, Pennsylvania","text":"This will be Trump’s second rally in the state today, Oct. 9, after he held a rally in Scranton earlier in the day.\n\nPennsylvania is seen as a “must win” state for both Trump’s and Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaigns.

A Harris campaign aide said in a statement to NBC News that it is the same gun that she mentioned owning in 2019 during her previous run for president and that it “is in a secure location in her home in California.” Harris’ revelation unleashed a wave of criticism from Second Amendment groups and conservative media, which accused her of hypocrisy given her long-standing support for measures that would restrict people from purchasing certain types of weapons. They also questioned how she originally bought the handgun given California’s strict gun-purchasing requirements. The Harris campaign did not specify where and when she bought the Glock, which model she owns or which storage devices she uses. Harris said last month that the gun is for self-defense and that “if somebody breaks into my house, they’re getting shot.” Harris’ current residence is guarded by armed Secret Service agents. Under a 2001 California law, which is being challenged in court, handguns that are purchased or sold in the state must meet certain product safety standards, and the state maintains a roster of firearms that are approved for sale. Some older models of Glocks and other handguns that do not meet the standards have been grandfathered in. But the roster excludes Glock pistols released from 2010 onward, as they lack mandatory safety features such as magazine disconnects, which prevent guns from being fired if the magazines are removed. Glock did not respond to a request for comment. There is an exemption for certain law enforcement officials “for use in the discharge of their official duties,” as well as “for personal use,” according to the state Justice Department. Those exempt include members of the Justice Department and district attorneys’ offices. Harris has a long track record as a prosecutor, starting in 1990 with her work in Alameda County, California. She was elected district attorney of San Francisco in 2002 and oversaw many high-profile cases. The campaign did not say whether Harris bought the gun before the law or the limits on Glocks were enacted or whether she received an exemption to purchase her handgun, and the state Justice Department did not immediately comment. NBC News could not confirm Wednesday whether Harris would have qualified for an exemption in her previous positions as California’s attorney general or in local district attorney offices. In 2013, as attorney general, Harris cleared the way for a new provision of the handgun safety law to take effect. Gun-rights advocates denounced Harris for owning a firearm while she was arguing for policies that would restrict which weapons people would be allowed to buy. She previously supported mandatory buybacks of assault weapons. She has since recanted her position, but she continues to support a federal assault weapons ban. In 2008, she led a group of district attorneys who urged the U.S. Supreme Court not to strike down a broad ban on handguns in Washington, D.C., arguing that it would interfere with state and local governments’ authority to create their own firearm laws; the court ultimately overturned the law. “Out of one side of her mouth, she sees the social utility of firearms for her. But she doesn’t want anyone else to have access to the most effective tools to defend themselves or their families,” said C.D. Michel, a California attorney who is representing the gun-rights advocates suing California over its handgun safety law. “I think that she’s basically a hypocrite.” Kris Brown, a leading gun safety advocate, argued there was no contradiction between Harris’ gun ownership and her support for restricting ownership of certain types of weapons. “I think it’s fantastic that she talks about being a gun owner — she doesn’t try to hide it from the public,” said Brown, president of Brady, which advocates to prevent gun violence. “The general public understands there’s no daylight between believing in the Second Amendment and being a gun owner and believing in policies that save lives,” she added. Harris has maintained there is no contradiction between her belief in gun rights and her support for policies like assault weapons bans, universal background checks and red flag laws. “I think for far too long on the issue of gun violence some people have been pushing a really false choice to suggest you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away,” she said at a campaign event last month.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris revealed this week that she owns a Glock — a weapon that is restricted for purchase in California amid an ongoing court battle over the state’s gun laws.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-criticism-owning-glock-gun-rcna174534","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241007-60-Minutes-Kamala-Harris-interview-ac-857p-b389b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 21:58:54","author":"Suzy Khimm","authors":["Suzy Khimm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":259113874,"title":"New York’s 3rd Congressional District Candidates Clash Over Crime, Migration, Taxes in Debate","text":"NEW YORK—The two candidates in the closely watched congressional race in New York’s Third Congressional District, incumbent Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi and challenger Mike LiPetri, sparred over who is more attuned to the needs and interests of the district’s residents during a debate on Tuesday night.\n\nThe debate ran for just under one hour, with each candidate allowed 90 seconds to respond to a question submitted in advance from someone in the district, and a shorter time to rebut what his opponent said.\n\nThe two candidates argued over issues including policing, climate concerns, the illegal immigration crisis, taxing of tips, housing on Long Island, and how to preserve Nassau County’s unique character.\n\nSuozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in February and became the district’s congressman through a special election to fill the void after Rep. George Santos’s expulsion from Congress in a corruption scandal.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s debate, Suozzi suggested LiPetri was more concerned with proving his loyalty to former President Donald Trump than with accomplishing things for the communities that comprise the Third District.\n\nLiPetri, a former New York state assemblyman, suggested Suozzi has catered to ideologically driven interests within his party, from “defund the police” to the pro-Hamas and anti-Israel factions.\n\nThe Republican challenger criticized Suozzi’s record, noting that this year, the congressman voted against the bipartisan End the Border Catastrophe Act and the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which LiPetri said would have prevented illegal immigrants from voting in elections.\n\n“He raised our taxes by $200 million, backstabbed the police, and betrayed the Jewish community when he wanted to be an honorary member of the Squad,” LiPetri said of Suozzi.\n\nMeanwhile, Suozzi said it was time to heal the bipartisan divide.\n\n“The bottom line is that climate change is very, very real, we see it in all these storms happening more and more often. That’s why I’ve been endorsed by every major environmental group, because I’ve supported the projects necessary to deal with climate change,” Suozzi said.\n\nIn making his case, Suozzi highlighted his previous record as a Third District representative from 2017 to 2023, before attempting to run for governor after Andrew Cuomo’s resignation.\n\n“People talk about infrastructure for decades, but we finally got it done in 2021 and 2022. And brought in millions of dollars into this region to try and address coastal resiliency,” he said.\n\nLiPetri contrasted the approach of Suozzi, which he called a “top-down” strategy relying heavily on federal intervention, with what he characterized as his own locally rooted approach to climate and environmental issues.\n\nHe called for inspections and upgrading of lead pipe infrastructure in Nassau County and the prevention of saltwater intrusions and flooding.\n\n“[Suozzi] is coming with this top-down government control,” LiPetri said. “I’m going to be working with the mayors, working with the towns, talking about the issues, what they need, organic bottom-up solutions.”\n\nLiPetri suggested Suozzi was aligned with the fiscal policies of Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, who proposes to tax unrealized capital gains, a policy that LiPetri called “crazy.”\n\nSuozzi dismissed his opponent’s characterizations, saying that during his last term in Congress, he “led the effort” to restore tax deductions.\n\nAccording to Suozzi, he helped pass state and local tax deductions in the House no fewer than three times, but they failed to clear the Senate. This was partly a result of a lack of interest on the part of Republicans, he said.\n\nSuozzi also pushed back against LiPetri’s suggestion that he was an outsider who pushed development recklessly without regard for the idiosyncratic character of Nassau County as a prosperous suburban community.\n\n“We need to keep 99 percent of Long Island the same way it is now—single-family homes, parks, beaches, open spaces—but we need to focus on developing our downtown areas around our train stations,” he said.\n\nLiPetri introduced legislation to criminalize “water-dousing” attacks on police officers, while Suozzi voted in favor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which makes it easier to prosecute police officers for alleged misconduct. LePetri said the act “betrayed police officers” and made it much harder for them to do their jobs with the threat of civil litigation hanging over them.\n\n“It allows police officers to be personally sued for conduct in the line of duty. As your congressman, I want to make sure we’re doubling down on criminals,” LiPetri said.\n\nLiPetri added that he favored the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.\n\nSuozzi repeatedly highlighted the endorsement he had received from the Nassau County police organizations.\n\n“It’s not because of a deal, it’s because I’ve always stood with law enforcement,” he said.\n\nOn the related issue of illegal immigration and border policy, Suozzi said that while in Congress previously, he had opposed allowing asylum applications outside ports of entry. Thanks to an executive order on this issue, the number of applications went down, he said.\n\nSuozzi said he had worked on the immigration issue directly with conservative Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-Texas), a fact he suggested illustrated his bipartisan instincts.\n\nLiPetri pointed out that Suozzi voted against the SAVE Act, which Rep. Luttrell supported.\n\nIf elected, LiPetri promised he would help establish a fully funded biometric entry system at the border, reinstate a “stay-in-Mexico” policy for asylum seekers, and end the policy of “catch and release,” which he said Suozzi had helped codify.\n\nLiPetri also vowed to support mass deportations to ease the burden on social services and reduce the number of criminals on American streets.","summary":"The incumbent Democrat and his Republican challenger matched wits and tempers in a lively debate addressing issues of concern to Nassau County and the nation.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/new-yorks-3rd-congressional-district-candidates-clash-over-crime-migration-taxes-in-debate-5738249","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/09/id5738498-Tom-Suozzi-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 21:56:12","author":"Michael Washburn","authors":["Michael Washburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":259115276,"title":"FACT FOCUS: Online posts make unfounded claims about a helicopter delivering aid in North Carolina","text":"BY MELISSA GOLDIN\n\nA video of a helicopter attempting to land in a Burnsville, North Carolina, area used to store supplies for victims of Hurricane Helene has been viewed millions of times online, with many claiming that it shows an unidentified government aircraft sent to destroy the aid.\n\nThe allegations have been used to support wider misinformation narratives that have grown following the punishing Category 4 storm as federal, state and local governments work with a range of groups to address the sweeping devastation in the area.\n\nThe North Carolina National Guard on Tuesday issued a statement verifying it was one of their helicopters attempting to make a generator delivery to the site.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the facts.\n\nCLAIM: A video shows a U.S. government helicopter in Burnsville, North Carolina, deliberately wrecking supplies for Hurricane Helene victims.\n\nTHE FACTS: The North Carolina National Guard said in a statement issued on Tuesday that the video shows one of its helicopters attempting to make a generator delivery requested by a local civilian organization to power their supply distribution site.

The five-point margin is the closest the two candidates have been since Harris announced her presidential bid in July.At that time, a poll from July 21 to 23 showed Harris leading by six points with 44 percent support. However, throughout August and September, Harris saw larger gains. A September 1-2 poll showed her with 59 percent support to Trump's 30 percent, a 29-point lead, while a September 15-17 poll had her leading by 28 points.The October survey shows the narrowest gap yet, suggesting a shift in momentum toward Trump as both candidates intensify their campaigns. Hispanics are a crucial voting bloc in 2024, with about 36.2 million eligible to vote, making them the second-largest group of eligible voters, after white voters. Of these, 17.5 million are expected to vote, including significant populations in swing states like Arizona, Nevada and Florida.The survey also underscored the top issues driving decisions among Hispanic voters. The economy and immigration emerged as the most important concerns. According to the poll, 78 percent of Hispanic respondents considered jobs and the economy \"very important\" when deciding their vote, while 57 percent emphasized immigration​.Historically, Latinos have leaned Democratic, but recent shifts in voting patterns have raised concerns for the party. A UnidosUS poll shows that while Harris still leads Trump among Latino voters, her 59 percent support is slightly lower than the 61 percent Joe Biden secured in 2020.Among Hispanics, younger voters are especially important for this election, according to recent research. According to UnidosUS, 38 percent of the Hispanic electorate will be new since the 2016 Trump-Hillary Clinton race, with 1 in 5 casting a vote in a presidential election for the first time.Throughout the campaign, Trump and Harris have taken new approaches to connect with Hispanic voters, moving away from traditional Spanish-language outlets like Univision and Telemundo. Harris has focused on engaging with local media, while Trump has targeted young Hispanic men, earning endorsements from Puerto Rican reggaeton stars like Anuel and Nicky Jam.With 27 days until the election, neither Trump nor Harris has yet participated in a Spanish-only media event. Harris is scheduled to appear on Univision later this week, with Trump following next week after his initial appearance was delayed by weather.The latest Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris leading. Among registered voters, she holds a narrow edge with 47 percent support compared to Trump's 44 percent. The gap widens slightly among likely voters, with Harris at 49 percent and Trump at 45 percent.","summary":"The former president is gaining support among Hispanic voters, narrowing the gap in the latest Economist/YouGov poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-surges-close-gap-against-harris-key-voting-group-poll-1966720","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2491606/donald-trump-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 21:52:51","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":259114404,"title":"Biden Forced To Remind Everyone He Doesn’t Control The Weather","text":"For politicians who still ground their rhetoric, more or less, in the real world, there’s an argument to be made for they-go-low-we-go-high-ing your way out of acknowledging most of the far-right’s most vile, racist, extreme and dangerous conspiracy theories, including those propagated by Donald Trump himself.\n\nBut President Biden found himself in a tricky spot this week: choosing between ignoring the wildly false claims being spread about his administration’s response to two (one impending) catastrophic natural disasters or letting Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene continue saying incredibly stupid and untrue stuff to their audiences unchecked, right before the onslaught of one of the largest storms to ever make landfall in Florida, which is forcing millions to evacuate.\n\nDuring a briefing with Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday on the trajectory of Hurricane Milton, Biden announced that his administration was making an “unprecedented number of assets” available to prepare for Milton’s landfall, as well as dealing with the aftermath of the Category 4 storm and Hurricane Helene. But he also, he said, had to address the “onslaught of lies” that Trump has been spreading, baselessly claiming that people’s homes and/or property are being confiscated after evacuating to escape Helene and that people impacted by the storm are only receiving $750 in assistance. He’s also claimed that federal disaster relief funds meant for hurricane victims were being distributed to undocumented immigrants. Biden debunked that as well.\n\n“But now I want to be clear about something. Over the last few weeks, there’s been a reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies that are disturbing people,” Biden said. “It’s undermining confidence in the incredible rescue and recovery work that has already been taken and will continue to be taken. It’s harmful to those who need help the most. There is simply no place for this to happen.”\n\nBut he saved his most biting remarks for Greene, who has been spreading the lie that the federal government (??) geo-engineered (??) Hurricane Helene in order to seize control of lithium deposits (??) in a certain area of North Carolina, called Chimney Rock.\n\n“Now the claims are getting even more bizarre. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather. We’re controlling the weather,” Biden said. “It’s beyond ridiculous. It’s got to stop. Moments like this, there are no red or blue states.”\n\nPlenty of Republicans have even tried to do the course correcting themselves, to get out ahead of their party’s presidential candidate and his friend’s unhinged claims that read like something pulled out of a YouTube video comments section. Even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis went out of his way on Wednesday to encourage people to be more discerning about what they read on the internet, at least with regards to the government’s response to the storms. Per Politico:\n\n“We live in an era where if you put out crap online you can get a lot of people to share it and you can monetize that. That’s just the way it is,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Wednesday in response to a question from POLITICO about misinformation. “But if you are hearing something that’s just outrageous — just know in the state of Florida none of that stuff would ever fly.”\n\n“Be careful about the nonsense that gets circulated and just know that the more titillating it is, the more likely it is that somebody is making money off it and they don’t really give a damn about the well-being and safety of the people that are actually in the eye of the storm,” added DeSantis.\n\nAnd Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-NC), whose district was ravaged by Helene last week, went as far as to put out a statement addressed to his constituents encouraging them to not believe everything they read on Facebook or Twitter, as he specifically debunked myths that have been spread by Trump and Greene: “While it is true, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to Hurricane Helene has had its shortfalls, I’m here to dispel the outrageous rumors that have been circulated online:”\n\n“1.

Yes, Azeroth—the planet from World of Warcraft.\nThis will be the first time the Harris campaign will stream live gameplay on its Twitch account. The event, which will take place at 6:30 pm ET, will include a live feed of Walz’s Arizona speech with Preheat, a Twitch creator, playing the game and providing commentary. Preheat is expected to highlight their connection to the campaign and encourage viewers to make a plan to vote.\nThe Harris campaign launched its Twitch account in August where it streamed the vice president’s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. Joining Twitch was part of the campaign’s strategy to reach young, disaffected voters, a campaign spokesperson said at the time.\n“Our job as the campaign is to break through a historically personalized media landscape, taking the VP and her vision for the future directly to the hardest-to-reach voters and those who will decide this election,” Seth Schuster, a Harris spokesperson, told WIRED of the decision in August.\nAhead of the rally on Wednesday, Preheat was playing World of Warcraft and instructing viewers on how to defeat one of the more recent raid bosses from The War Within expansion. He has over 50,000 followers on Twitch, and the Harris campaign described him as a volunteer. When asked by WIRED for comment about why they were going to be livestreaming with the campaign, Preheat said they were volunteering for a number of reasons and cited several of the Harris campaign's platforms.\nThe Harris campaign’s goal in combining the rally with World of Warcraft gameplay is to increase the Harris’ and Walz’s visibility to young men who make up a majority of Twitch’s user base, a Harris spokesperson told WIRED. Over the past few weeks, the campaign has intentionally been trying to reach young men by advertising during major sporting events and on gaming sites like IGN.\nThe Joe Biden and Donald Trump campaigns launched Twitch accounts in 2020. Trump’s account was suspended following the January 6 attack on the Capitol but was reinstated this past summer. The Biden campaign played around with formats and once streamed a feed from the back of a train as he was traveling on the campaign trail, set to relaxing music.","summary":"This is the latest chapter of the Kamala Harris campaign’s effort to reach young male voters.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/tim-walz-rally-world-of-warcraft-twitch/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/6706efbc5aed7aade1ac824a/16:9/w_2496,h_1404,c_limit/tim-walz-pol-2166104778.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 21:51:25","author":"Makena Kelly","authors":["Makena Kelly"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":259114658,"title":"Democrats reportedly anxious about tight race: 'People are nervous... having flashbacks to 2016'","text":"Democrats are worried about the state of the 2024 presidential race and fear the election could be a repeat of 2016, according to a new report. Sources close to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign reportedly told CNN that Democrats were panicked because polls have largely remained stagnant with less than four weeks to go until the election. \"People are nervous. They know the polls are tight,\" one source told CNN. \"A lot of us are having these flashbacks to 2016 too. We know when it can go the wrong way, and it can still feel fresh.\" On the liberal network on Wednesday, CNN reporter Priscilla Alvarez discussed her conversations with Democratic insiders close to the Harris campaign who are worried that the race remains deadlocked, despite the campaign's efforts to reach more voters. MICHAEL MOORE MOCKS DEMOCRATS PANICKED BY TIGHT 2024 RACE: ‘SHOCKING TO ME’ THEY BELIEVE TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN \"This has been a campaign that was described by multiple Democrats, allies, aides to the vice president as a good vibes campaign. But what’s also creeping in now is that anxiety,\" Alvarez explained. \"The reason for that is because these polls are not really moving. Despite multiple battleground blitzes, despite the opportunities she has had across media outlets, there is still not a lot of movement from voters who are moving more towards her versus former President Donald Trump.\" The Harris campaign is trying to address pitfalls from Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign in its outreach to red, rural districts that Clinton lost in that election, like Cambria County, Pennsylvania, Alvarez explained. \"The vice president has already visited twice. And so that is the type of strategy that they’re trying to deploy to try to make up that ground where they saw Hillary Clinton wasn’t able to in 2016. Then, too, there’s the mobilizing. Talking to Democrats, they’re always pretty boastful about their ground game and they continue to be so, but that needs to turn into votes. So certainly some anxiety and nerves setting in as Election Day gets closer and those polls just remain deadlocked,\" she continued. Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. NBC'S KRISTEN WELKER REVEALS ‘PANICKED’ DEMOCRATS TEXTED HER DURING DEBATE WORRIED BY ‘LIKABLE’ VANCE Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, a former staffer for Harris, also commented on anxiety swirling around the vice president's campaign in comments to The Hill on Wednesday. \"Everything is deadlocked and the composition of the electorate is unknowable, and there are so many things that are unprecedented,\" Simmons, who formerly served as Harris' communications director, said. \"We can’t look back with any level of security because we haven’t had an African American woman on the ticket. We haven’t had a former president running again. We haven’t had a campaign with two assassination attempts. We haven’t switched out a candidate two months before Election Day before,\" he added. \"So it’s just hard to know,\" Simmons continued. \"If you’re not nervous, you’re not paying attention.\" Political analyst Mark Halperin characterized the Harris campaign as an \"experiment\" that's encountering issues, during his livestream show on Wednesday. \"In the conversations I'm having with Trump people and Democrats with data, they are extremely bullish on Trump's chances in the last 48 hours. Extremely bullish,\" Halperin said. \"Can you win a short campaign with an untested candidate? And what I’m telling you is happening in private polling is she’s got a problem now,\" he said. According to the latest Fox News poll from September, Harris tops Trump by two points nationally, which is a three-point shift in her direction since August.

But spending is out of control, now accounting for “one in four of every dollar” Americans produce. Interest payments alone now exceed the defense budget.\n\nAnd Kamala Harris would raise taxes further to fund yet more spending.
