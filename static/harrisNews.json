Woodson Sr. has long been a critic of the mainstream media for pushing the narrative that America is inherently racist, but he’s particularly offended by The New York Times and MSNBC’s Al Sharpton. Woodson, 88, penned an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal last week, urging the nation to \"disregard race in how we judge one another\" before it leads to \"national ruin.\" He believes the media has been \"demeaning the values of the country in the name of promoting social justice.\" Woodson has been an outspoken critic of The New York Times’ controversial 1619 Project, which aimed to \"reframe\" America’s history through the lens of slavery. The 1619 Project won a Pulitzer Prize but has been criticized for historical inaccuracies, and Woodson is furious that it has been integrated and insinuated into the curriculum around the country. \"It is embedding in America that America should be defined by its birth defect of slavery,\" Woodson told Fox News Digital. HOW MAINSTREAM MEDIA BECAME 'PART OF THE RACE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY' HARMING BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS Because of Nikole Hannah-Jones' 1619 Project, along with other coverage, Woodson said the Times has been among the most egregious mainstream news organizations when it comes to belittling the values of the country. \"The New York Times has been the leading culprit in condemning the country, burning the flags, and celebrating those who demean these values. It is, in fact, those same values of the founders that enabled Blacks to survive slavery in Jim Crow,\" Woodson said. AL SHARPTON HITS BACK AT TRUMP ACCUSATION ABOUT PAID ENDORSEMENT OF KAMALA HARRIS A New York Times spokesperson provided Fox News Digital with the following comment: \"This 1619 Project was a piece of deep and original reporting that brought to light new and underexplored truths, and it's only natural that principled and rigorous reporting like this would spark reflection and discussion. The series deepened many readers' understanding of the nation's past, the lingering effects of slavery and its centrality to America’s story and the significant contributions of Black Americans to this country.\" The statement continued: \"Readers have benefited immensely from the groundbreaking journalism of Nikole Hannah-Jones and the full team of writers and editors who brought us this transformative work. The New York Times is proud to continue pursuing vital journalism like this.\" With regard to the comment about flag burning, the Times spokesperson added: \"In fact, the central essay of the 1619 Project, the one that won a Pulitzer Prize, made a case for why Black Americans should embrace the flag, and the illustrated book that came out last year featured a gallery of patriotic images of people with the flag.\" Woodson also has a bone to pick with Sharpton, an MSNBC weekend host who often leads divisive rallies and put his network in an awkward situation ahead of the 2024 presidential election. MSNBC admitted it was \"unaware\" that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign paid $500,000 to Sharpton’s National Action Network nonprofit ahead of a friendly interview with the Democratic nominee. Harris sat down for a softball interview on Oct. 20 with MSNBC’s Sharpton, an open supporter of Harris and the Democratic Party. Following Harris’ loss to President Donald Trump, FEC filings revealed the Harris campaign gave two $250,000 donations to Sharpton’s nonprofit organization in September and October – but the MSNBC host did not inform viewers of the contributions or the conflict of interest before or after the interview.

accepting [donations] from a political candidate and then interviewing them on their network,\" he continued. \"Al Sharpton has been a special exception.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP MSNBC did

Red states or blue ones?","text":"Is artificial intelligence coming for your job? It may depend on who you voted for in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIf you voted for Donald Trump, your job is likely safe.\n\nIf you voted for Kamala Harris, you have reason to be concerned.\n\nQuietly last month, Microsoft released a study of the jobs most and least likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence. The study results track closely to the socioeconomics of the 2024 presidential election and the political realignment sweeping the nation.\n\nThe jobs most likely to be displaced by artificial intelligence fit the profile of the college-educated elite who are backing the Democratic Party. These jobs include writers and authors, reporters, historians, and political scientists.\n\nThese are roles rooted in so-called knowledge work, which is the gathering and interpreting of information, producing written content, and communicating ideas. These are the tasks artificial intelligence currently does best.\n\nThe jobs least likely to be displaced are the blue-collar workers who are building the new Republican majority. These jobs include highway maintenance workers, cement masons, painters, and truck drivers. All roles with a high physical component and minimal overlap with AI’s current capabilities.\n\nNationwide, about 8.5 million jobs are at the highest risk of being replaced by AI. Based on an analysis of Microsoft and state data, in Pennsylvania, that represents a little under 300,000 jobs. Conversely, about 5.5 million jobs nationwide, and roughly 240,000 in Pennsylvania, are in categories least likely to be affected.\n\nThe Microsoft study’s methodology is worth noting. Researchers analyzed 200,000 anonymized conversations between Americans and Bing Copilot, classifying the “user goals” and the “AI actions” according to work activities defined by the U.S. Department of Labor’s O/NET database.\n\nBy measuring how frequently AI assisted with or performed these activities, how successfully it did so, and how broad the potential impact was, they created an “AI applicability score” for each occupation.\n\nThese roles share a heavy reliance on information gathering, writing, editing, and communicating, which are areas where AI already demonstrates high task completion rates and broad applicability.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, the study’s findings mirror the cultural and economic realignment of the last decade. The Democratic coalition has grown more white-collar, more urban, and more dependent on credentialed professions. The Republican base has grown more working-class, more rural or exurban, and concentrated in the skilled trades.\n\nIn short, the jobs that AI is poised to displace are concentrated in the Democratic coalition, while the jobs still untouched by AI are clustered in the Republican one.\n\nThe implication? AI disruption may accelerate the realignment – replacing jobs in industries that overwhelmingly vote blue while leaving red-leaning jobs largely untouched.\n\nBut the study also warns against simple “automation doom” narratives. Many of the most at-risk occupations are not necessarily destined for elimination; they may instead be transformed. AI can assist rather than replace, potentially boosting productivity and changing job descriptions rather than eliminating them entirely.\n\nStill, the scale of potential change is enormous. The biggest concentration is in customer service (2.85 million nationally) and sales representatives (1.14 million nationally), which are fields where AI can already answer questions, present information, and resolve issues with impressive fluency.\n\nAI’s trajectory may mirror past innovations, such as ATMs, which reduced the need for tellers but also enabled banks to expand and redeploy staff. The Microsoft study suggests we may see similar patterns with AI.\n\nYet the cultural dimension is new: automation risk is not spread evenly across the political spectrum. It clearly clusters along partisan lines.\n\nPennsylvania, poised to become the “AI capital of the United States,” will be both the factory floor and the test lab for this disruption – producing the tools that may displace thousands of its own white-collar workers while expanding opportunity for skilled trades.\n\nFor policymakers, the challenge is twofold: they should provide soft landings for those being displaced while ensuring our educational system is producing enough workers with the necessary blue-collar skills to usher in the economy of the future.\n\nDuring the era of globalization, policymakers demonstrated they either did not care or could not help the millions of displaced industrial workers who anchored the American middle class.\n\nThis is an opportunity for GOP policymakers to rise to the occasion to bring even more Americans into its Big Tent by providing solutions for these soon-to-be displaced workers, largely concentrated in the suburbs.\n\nThe study ends on a note of humility as AI’s impact is a moving target. Capabilities will evolve, jobs will adapt, and new occupations will emerge. While truck drivers are on the “safe” list today, self-driving trucks are not far away.\n\nWant to know if AI is coming for your job? Pull up a county-by-county map of the 2024 election. You might find your answer in red and blue.","summary":"Whether your job is at risk 'may depend on who you voted for in the 2024 presidential election'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/08/which-will-be-more-affected-ai-red-states/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/deep-state-elites.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 17:47:25","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.246},{"id":351652216,"title":"DEEP STATE STATE OF MIND: DC Subway Sandwich Attack on Border Officer Reveals Entrenched Bureaucrats’ Mentality","text":"If you ever wondered what kind of person could work as a “deep state” actor, taking a paycheck from the taxpayer while opposing the people’s elected president from within the bureaucracy, look no further than Sean Charles Dunn.\n\nThis 37-year-old worked as an international affairs specialist at the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, yet he allegedly struck a Customs and Border Protection agent with a Subway sandwich on Sunday after shouting, “Fascists!”\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday that Dunn was out of a job, and that he faces felony charges.\n\n“This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,” she noted. “You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.”\n\nIt seems rather odd that the same people who are shouting from the rooftops that federal bureaucrats are noble servants of the public—so how dare President Donald Trump fire them!—also encourage lawless resistance to the will of the people, who elected Trump to close the border, deport the illegal aliens, and bring law and order back to cities like Washington, D.C.\n\nLest Americans forget, Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to “rebuild our cities—including our capital in Washington, D.C.—making them safe, clean, and beautiful again.”\n\nMake DC Great Again\n\nYet when the American people vote to make D.C. great again, the Left screams to high heaven about creeping “fascism.”\n\nIt’s not fascism to actually arrest criminals. It’s not fascism to deport illegal aliens. It’s not fascism to restore peace to American cities.\n\nSo many on the Left live in such a bubble that they have no concept of how fed up Americans are with the rampant looting, the illegals driving mopeds without license plates, the teens skipping subway turnstiles, and the homeless vagrants crowding the sidewalks.\n\nI live in the D.C. area, and in recent years, my best friend was robbed at gunpoint in the nation’s capital. My female co-workers were scared to drive past a certain intersection because homeless men would cat-call them. At that intersection, one homeless man threw another into the street right in front of my car, and I had to jam on my breaks to avoid slamming into him. \n\nStores like CVS have everyday items like cold medicine locked behind glass doors because the crime is so bad. \n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way, and Americans voted for change in November. \n\nThe Left’s Echo Chamber\n\nYet the Left’s echo chamber finds any reason to demonize Trump, and it can be hard to escape that narrative, even if you want to. The legacy media strains to find any outrage when it comes to deporting illegal aliens—never mind the millions who poured across the border under the previous administration. \n\nThe negative media coverage gets a tremendous boost from the organized Left. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union find any excuse to prevent Trump from deporting illegal aliens, suing to block his policies and turning every law enforcement action into a sob story. \n\nThe Center for American Progress, which fed 60 staff into the Biden administration, now hypocritically calls for “securing the border” despite its own record encouraging Biden to treat immigration “as an asset to be managed rather than a crime to be enforced against.” It demonizes Trump’s “chaos and cruelty” without giving an ounce of credit to the man who has actually secured the border.\n\nAdd in the groups that organize protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in cities like Los Angeles, and you’ve got real trouble on your hands.\n\nThese activist groups are more entrenched than you may realize. The nonprofits that sued the Trump administration in its first month received at least $1.7 billion in taxpayer funds under Biden.\n\nExpect More Deep State Resistance\n\nSean Charles Dunn had likely been hearing a stream of anti-Trump news on immigration, and after Trump deployed federal law enforcement to Washington, D.C., it seems Dunn just snapped. \n\nIt isn’t just Dunn. An April RMG Research poll found that 75% of D.C.-based federal employees who voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in November said they won’t follow a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy.\n\nThese deep state bureaucrats think they know better than the American people and the leaders voters elect, and they’re listening to “experts” that rile them up.\n\nTrump has given these bureaucrats an off-ramp. He offered deferred resignation—agreeing to pay them through the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30) if they resigned early this year. It seems Dunn should have taken the offer.\n\nUnfortunately, the mindset of seeing border patrol agents as “fascist” won’t end with Dunn, and many of former President Joe Biden’s political appointees have “burrowed in” to the bureaucracy and remain under Trump.\n\nAs horrifying as this story is, I expect it won’t be the last time a bureaucrat faces charges for brazenly assaulting an officer. Bondi’s response sends the right message: It cannot be tolerated.","summary":"If you ever wondered what kind of person could work as a &#8220;deep state&#8221; actor, taking a paycheck from the taxpayer while opposing the people&#8217;s...

In my Jan. 26 article, “Nebraska went big for Trump—and that may kill its economy,” I warned that Nebraska’s reliance on federal programs and its immigrant labor force made it uniquely vulnerable under Trump’s policies.\n\nTurns out, I was right. A quarter later, Nebraska’s gross domestic product has shrunken more than 6% in early 2025, tying it with equally Trumpy Iowa for the worst drop in the nation. That statistic hit the headlines over a month ago, but what’s new is that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins just had to face Nebraskans living through the fallout.\n\nFarmers’ grievances were exactly what you’d expect: Their farms were short-staffed thanks to immigration raids, tariffs raised costs and shrank export markets, and pricing controls made it harder to sell crops. \n\nThe state’s all-Republican congressional delegation had a familiar solution: more federal dollars to bail out the same pull-themselves-up-by-their-bootstraps crowd that spent years railing against “socialism.” As Sen. Deb Fischer explained, “There’s a lot of risk involved in agriculture. … You can’t control the weather. … That’s why these safety nets are so important.”\n\nRemember when “safety nets” were supposed to be a scourge?\n\nRep. Don Bacon, who will retire soon and give Democrats a prime pickup opportunity in the House, had his own fix: Expand government mandates for biofuels. \n\n“It’s the only way you’re going to move enough corn and soybeans,” he said. “Otherwise you’re going to have a depression.” \n\nIf there were a viable market case for ethanol without mandates, it would already exist.\n\nInstead, Trump’s policies may be steering Nebraska straight into a depression. Farm bankruptcies are spiking—259 filings in just the first quarter, surpassing all of last year, according to Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. He says the financial pressures farmers face now mirror those from 2018 and 2019.\n\nAnd who was president in 2018 and 2019? Exactly.\n\nImagine voting for economic devastation—and getting exactly that.\n\nBut in the middle of this wreckage lies a remarkable opening for Dan Osborn, a populist independent whose insurgent campaign nearly toppled a Republican Senate seat last year, even as Trump carried the state by more than 20 percentage points. Osborn overperformed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by 13 points in deep-red Nebraska, losing by just under 7 points. \n\nOsborn’s platform—support for small-business tax relief, union rights, legalized marijuana, protecting Social Security, strengthening public schools, securing the border, and guaranteeing the right to repair—has focused relentlessly on economic livelihood while sidestepping divisive social issues. (Yeah, yeah, the border stuff is part of the reason Nebraska is struggling, but you seemingly can’t win the state without it, at least not yet.)\n\nNow he’s running again—this time against Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, one of the richest people in Congress. It’s the populist versus the privileged, the mechanic versus the moneyed elite.\n\nMaking breadbasket populism breathe again is no small thing. But if it can take root in Nebraska (and Iowa), it could radiate outward in future cycles. Let these states be the proving ground for a new prairie populism that can build a Senate majority on economic common ground.\n\nWhile Trump’s policies hammer Nebraska’s farms, Osborn’s rise offers something rare: a beacon of populist hope in a state teetering under economic collapse.","summary":"Every day brings fresh horrors from the Trump administration, and nothing comforts like the knowledge that Donald Trump’s supporters are paying the price.

Now, he's in the top three in every poll,\" strategist Mike Madrid, a political consultant and co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump political action committee, told Newsweek.\"Democrats are looking for a fighter. It's not about ideology anymore. You can be centrist or progressive — what matters is that you stand up and hit back. The more aggressive Newsom gets, the more support he builds.\"A June Emerson College survey showed Newsom rising to 7 percent in the 2028 Democratic primary — up from 3 percent in March. A mid-July Echelon Insights poll placed him at 10 to 11 percent, just behind Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. A UC Irvine poll in California showed his approval ratings rebounding as Trump's declined.\"Newsom, by standing up to Trump on redistricting, has landed himself in the spotlight in the Democrat presidential primary,\" said Republican strategist Carter Wrenn. \"That's not decisive, but it does give him a boost.\"Online and On OffenseWhile Democrats have struggled to match the GOP's meme machine, Newsom's team is adopting his own tactics: trolling, parody, and cultural references designed to go viral and shift the narrative in Democrats' favor.That strategy was on display when Fox News asked for comment after Newsom said Texas Governor Greg Abbott \"rolled over for Trump.\" Abbott uses a wheelchair, and the question drew a sharp, unapologetic response.\"No. But how woke of you to ask! I'm sorry Greg's feelings were hurt. Poor guy — we hope he recovers,\" said Izzy Gardon, Newsom's deputy communications director, in a statement that circulated widely online.The comment sparked outrage from conservatives but drew praise from liberal influencers. \"Still laughing at this statement from Newsom's team to Fox,\" posted the popular left-wing account MeidasTouch. \"He is absolutely ruthless & giving Republicans every ounce of their own medicine,\" wrote Democratic strategist Victor Shi.Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way, told Newsweek the approach taps into something deeper: \"His online taunting of the president is well-crafted and funny, and it's become a source of real catharsis for Democrats who seethe all day at Trump's outrages,\" Bennett said.\"But more than that, Newsom is one of the few Democrats who's figured out how to gain actual leverage to counterattack — not just posture, but act.\"Meme Wars Go Both WaysTrump's own digital tactics are well known. His White House social media team regularly posts AI-edited images — Trump as a lightsaber-wielding Jedi, or in papal robes with the caption \"Pope Trump.\" His team has used memes to frame hardline policies, like a stylized video showing shackled immigrants being deported, as part of what analysts call a \"shock-and-spectacle\" communications model.\"Trump doesn't just provoke — he floods the zone with images and slogans until his narrative becomes the only one in the room,\" Alex Patton, a former GOP strategist, told Newsweek.But for Madrid, Newsom's approach has the potential to resonate with Democratic voters because this moment isn't about pushing a policy agenda — it's about breaking through in the online attention wars. He noted that Democrats across the spectrum, from Arizona's Ruben Gallego, a centrist, to New York's Zohran Mamdani, a socialist, have thrived by taking their own aggressive stances.\"Newsom is disrupting that model, one meme at a time. He's showing Democrats they don't have to play defense on social media — they can troll back and shape the conversation before it gets away.\"Still, some observers warn that viral appeal doesn't always translate into broad support.\"His aggressive social media speaks to and energizes a small group of people who spend a lot of time online,\" said Democratic strategist Doug Gordon. \"But social media is not real life, and most voters will never see it. What Democratic primary voters really want are leaders who can effectively push back against the authoritarian moves we are seeing from the Trump Administration.\"Gordon added that the redistricting plan will be Newsom's real test. \"If he can muscle it through before 2026, that will certainly help him if he chooses to run in 2028.\"","summary":"California Governor Gavin Newsom is punching back at Donald Trump — in memes and capital letters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-breaks-through-trolling-trump-his-own-meme-game-2114281","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2703581/gavin-newsom-meme.jpg?w=1600&h=900&l=50&t=54&q=88&f=73ad0c0e727ff20d5fae15ca4730eb17","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 10:00:02","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.332},{"id":351595572,"title":"Walters: Governor, lawmakers short on options to reduce state’s soaring electricity bills","text":"If and when Gavin Newsom launches a campaign for president, economic and social conditions in the California he’s governed for two terms will be in the spotlight.\n\nWhile Newsom brags incessantly about the state and its achievements, its chronic problems, such as a high level of homelessness, are obvious to anyone. Political media and his rivals will focus on them with laser-like intensity.\n\nGiven the dynamics of last year’s presidential contest, in which worries about rising costs of living played a role in Californian Kamala Harris’s loss to Donald Trump, California’s very high costs for housing and other fundamental living needs, would be fodder for attacks on Newsom in 2028.\n\nNewsom has been trying to insulate himself, as much as possible, from such criticism. For example, he’s signed legislation aimed at increasing housing production and ordered his administration to crackdown on cities that impede construction.\n\nLast October, just a few days before Harris lost, Newsom ordered California’s Public Utilities Commission, Air Resources Board and state Energy Commission to generate ideas on how high costs of energy, particularly electricity, could be mitigated.\n\n“We’re taking action to address rising electricity costs and save consumers money on their bills,” Newsom said at the time. “California is proving that we can address affordability concerns as we continue our world-leading efforts to combat the climate crisis.”\n\nCalifornia’s residential and commercial electricity rates are the highest in the nation’s lower 48 states, according to a monthly compilation by the California Center for Jobs & the Economy, an adjunct to the California Business Roundtable. Californians’ actual power bills are the ninth-highest due to the state’s relatively mild climate, the report found.\n\nPower bills hit low-income families especially hard, especially those living in inland communities, where summer temperatures easily pass 100 degrees, requiring extensive use of air conditioning. This week, a report from the Public Policy Institute of California confirmed that observation.\n\n“Rising household electricity costs in California over the past decade have largely outpaced rising incomes for low- and middle-income families,” wrote PPIC authors Tess Thorman, Patricia Malagon and Paulette Cha. “Just before the pandemic, income was beginning to catch up with costs for low-income households, but the high cost burden of electricity bills jumped between 2019 and 2021 — for everyone.\n\n“Geography also plays an important role, highlighted in the California Public Utilities Commission’s efforts to monitor the affordability of utility bills. Electricity is least affordable to households in hotter zones — specifically in parts of the Inland Empire, San Joaquin Valley, and the state’s northern region.”\n\nThe CPUC and the energy commission responded to Newsom’s order in February but didn’t offer much in the way of effective steps to reduce utility bills. The CPUC noted that there are existing programs to help low-income families cope with power bills, financed mostly from utilities’ overall revenues, and suggested that they could be increased with non-ratepayer money, such as budget appropriations.\n\nIt also decried the fact that homeowners who install solar panels on their roofs tend to have high incomes but don’t contribute much to support the electrical grid — an issue that’s kicked around the Capitol for years. This year, legislation that would have hit solar panel owners in the wallet, Assembly Bill 942, was watered down to little more than a token after a fierce lobbying battle.\n\nThe energy commission’s report on power costs was even thinner gruel, mostly patting itself on the back for adopting standards for appliances and other power-using devices that reduced their demands.\n\nThe bottom line is that Californians’ power costs are very high, could go even higher as utilities are pressed to reduce the danger of power lines causing wildfires, and there’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it, since they face chronic budget deficits.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"California power costs are very high, and there’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it amid chronic budget deficits.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/16/walters-governor-lawmakers-short-on-options-to-reduce-states-soaring-electricity-bills/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SJM-Z-OPED-WALTERS-0817.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 09:45:34","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":351577808,"title":"Trump’s New Pick for a Key Economic Role Really Does Not Inspire Confidence","text":"Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nHello! And welcome back to the Surge, the world’s premier seven-item newsletter about people whose jobs have some sort of connection to the city of Washington and/or the District of Columbia. I’m Ben Mathis-Lilley, still filling in for Jim Newell; Jim has taken the summer off to join one of those trendy goofball baseball teams, for whom he serves as a situational right-handed relief pitcher who falls into a pile of horse manure at least once a game. And you think your dry-cleaning bills are bad!\n\nThis week, a man named “Big Balls” triggered a military invasion, the government explained somewhat unpersuasively why it has decided not to cure cancer, and Chuck Schumer racked up another big-time Chuck Schumer dub. (Chuck Schumer stays winning!) But first, let’s talk about the random guy from C-list right-wing media who looks like a member of Korn and has been assigned to ruin the world economy.\n\nE.J. Antoni\n\nThe monthly unemployment data announcement will now be referred to as “funemployment happy time” and it will be hosted by an animatronic Joseph Goebbels.\n\nDonald Trump had a problem: The bill for the enormous tariffs he has unilaterally imposed on scores of foreign countries was starting to come due in the form of higher prices for consumers and rising unemployment. And after thinking on it for a few minutes, the irrepressible Mr. Trump landed on a solution: He would fire the person in charge of economic data (i.e., the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and replace her with someone who was willing to say every month that things are going great regardless of what the numbers show. That person, the president announced this week, should be E.J. Antoni, a 37-year-old who only earned his Ph.D. five years ago and has no professional credentials to speak of but does appear frequently on MAGA media king Steve Bannon’s podcast to praise the president. (It’s neither here nor there, but he also has the angular widow’s peak and goatee of a ’90s rap-rock bassist.)\n\nAntoni’s most notable recent economic proposal, it turns out, was to suspend the issuance of monthly employment reports, something that even Trump-friendly conservative economists like Stephen Moore identified as a bad idea that would make it difficult for businesses and banks to do a little something called “planning for the future.” Meanwhile, photos surfaced of Antoni giving previous interviews in front of a big painting of a Nazi battleship. (“The markets” did not ultimately fare that well under the National Socialists, for the record, with the Allied air forces’ destruction of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange putting a point on things in 1944.) His position requires Senate confirmation, which is usually pretty easy to obtain these days. Buckle up!\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nA high-stakes game of trying to distract the American president with a swinging pocket watch.\n\nLike any good diplomat, President Trump changes his opinion on who he wants to win the Ukraine–Russia war based on which country’s head of state he perceives as a greater threat to his ego at any given moment. At this moment, Vladimir Putin and Trump are on the outs because Trump, who wants to get credit for negotiating a peace settlement, has gradually realized that Putin has been playing him for a chump to kill time while he attempts to conquer as much of Ukraine as possible. Thus, ahead of Friday’s summit with the Russian leader in Alaska, Trump was telling whoever would listen that he wanted both sides in the conflict to agree to an immediate ceasefire that would not require the ceding of any Ukrainian territory, and he was backing up that position with threats to impose further sanctions on Russia that other foreign leaders, at least, seemed to be taking seriously. Trump is famous, though, for agreeing fully with the last person he talked to; Putin once mesmerized him so thoroughly at a one-on-one meeting that Trump took Russia’s side against the United States itself at the ensuing press conference. As of the time we had to wrap this newsletter, Trump had greeted Putin by clapping for him as he disembarked his airplane, so make of that portent what you will.\n\nThe Franz Ferdinand of our time.\n\nRemember Edward “Big Balls” Coristine? He’s a very young Trump administration staffer, initially brought on by Elon Musk’s DOGE operation, who appeared to follow several racist and super-duper antisemitic Twitter/X accounts and was previously active in an online hacker community known for harassment, extortion, and doxing. (He has not been accused of any crime.) Over a week ago, Coristine was injured in what he says was an altercation resulting from an alleged 3 a.m. carjacking attempt, an incident that President Trump is now citing as one of the main reasons for ordering the deployment of the National Guard and hundreds of federal law enforcement officers to the nation’s capital. This, the White House says, will eliminate street crime and also, somehow, homelessness. We’ll see! (It won’t.) (Also, crime in Washington recently hit a 30-year-low and is not particularly concentrated in the public spaces that Trump claims are a problem.)\n\nChuck Schumer\n\nLet’s turn up! Let’s go!\n\nThe news for Democrats these days is usually not a lot of fun. It’s hard to be in the minority in Congress when the majority enforces total loyalty to the president and the Supreme Court is basically allowed to take bribes from the president’s top donors. But the good news this week for the donkeys was twofold. One, they proved they still know how to throw a hell of a top-dollar fundraising party, assembling their most well-heeled supporters at a luxury hotel in California wine country for a discussion of how to communicate with blue-collar working-class voters. (I am not making that part up; they really did hold their seminar on how to talk to regular people at a luxury wine resort.) Two, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer secured a commitment from former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, someone who really does have a history of winning working-class votes, to run for the chamber again in 2026. Brown lost a reelection race in 2024 to Sen. Bernie Moreno, but this time he’ll be competing for the state’s other seat, which J.D. Vance vacated to take the vice presidency. It’s currently held by a relatively low-profile state party figure named Jon Husted; two years ago, Brown finished 2.5 percentage points ahead of Kamala Harris, so the hope is that in a better environment for Democrats, he’ll be able to make the flip. If he can do that, and former Gov. Roy Cooper—whose entry into North Carolina’s Senate contest was another recruiting “win” for Dems—can hold on to his own early lead, it would go a long way toward helping secure control of the chamber.\n\nJay Bhattacharya\n\nI believe this is what is known in the scientific community as “some real circular-logic-ass bullshit.”\n\nLast week, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of research into so-called mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use RNA genetic-coding molecules to trigger the human body to manufacture specific types of proteins found in viruses like COVID-19; the body then generates antibodies against those proteins, which helps make for a more effective immune response if and when it encounters the actual virus in question. In his announcement of the policy, HHS secretary and vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote that mRNA immunology is not “safe” or “effective,” which was not a claim that any actual medical specialists agreed with. (The approach, researchers say, even has the potential to protect against diseases like HIV and cancer.) In response, National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, who is a doctor, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post published Tuesday in which he called mRNA vaccines an “elegant” and “promising” technology, described the COVID mRNA vaccine as the triumphant fruit of a “very successful” development process, and admitted that it has not caused “mass harm.” The termination of funding for mRNA development, he explained, is actually only necessary because the approach has not earned “public trust”—something for which he blames the Biden administration rather than, you know, the years that both he and his boss have spent telling people that vaccines are dangerous and don’t work. There’s no shame with some of these people.\n\nRedistricting ad absurdum.\n\nThere is a big fight over “redistricting” going on in politics right now, and frankly, the Surge finds it a bit tedious and dispiriting. First Texas decided to redraw its districts to make them more Republican, then California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would try to retaliate by making his state’s districts more Democratic, and now a bunch of other states might get involved too. It’s all very obviously not how the Constitution says things are supposed to work, but since it would require mutual deescalation and compromise to get resolved, it’s just going to continue getting worse and worse forever. One thing the Surge did get a kick out of, though, was the very colorful and soon-to-be-very-divorced Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to insert himself into the situation. (Paxton, whose Wikipedia page features a “legal issues” section of considerable length, is trying to earn Trump’s endorsement in a primary challenge against GOP Texas Sen. John Cornyn.) Having noticed that high-profile former Rep. Beto O’Rourke was raising money for Democratic Texas legislators who’ve fled the state in a procedural effort to forestall the Republican-friendly gerrymander, Paxton found a friendly judge to enjoin O’Rourke’s efforts. Now he’s claiming, on the basis of an expansive interpretation of some of O’Rourke’s subsequent comments, that O’Rourke is violating the injunction and needs to be put in jail indefinitely. Sure, why not? Let’s put Beto O’Rourke in jail for being a Democrat. Let’s steal the Declaration of Independence. Let’s start a subsistence farm in rural Canada and never check the news again!\n\nLaura Loomer\n\nThe memory-erasing thing from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, did they ever make that in real life?\n\nLaura Loomer is a self-described white nationalist and online personality who once had her accounts deactivated by both Uber and Lyft for complaining that they allow Muslims to work as rideshare drivers. She is also, by virtue of having maintained staunch support for Donald Trump even after Jan. 6, one of the most influential people in the United States. As an unofficial adviser to the president, she has carte blanche to order the firing of anyone in the executive branch who she deems insufficiently loyal to him. But that’s not why she’s in the Surge this week! She’s in the Surge this week because she sued Bill Maher for suggesting that she might be sleeping with Trump, leading to the release of a deposition transcript that is truly one of the craziest and most foul things we’ve ever read. It involves, among other things, the phrases “show his dick to someone’s daughter,” “all the semen she’s swallowed,” “gave President Trump the best blowjob of his life,” “McCarthy’s penis must be made out of gold,” “she had roast beef in her pants,” and, most chillingly, “friends with Kid Rock.” Whatever you do, do not click on that deposition and search for the word “infected.” You’ll regret it!","summary":"The monthly jobs report will now be replaced with \"funemployment happy time.\"","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/08/trump-economy-putin-big-balls-washington-national-guard-texas-redistricting.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/ee04815d-a6b6-4ebc-b84c-2f78d567c748.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 09:45:00","author":"Ben Mathis-Lilley","authors":["Ben Mathis-Lilley"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":351562962,"title":"Donald Trump's Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts With Gen Z","text":"President Donald Trump's approval rating has rebounded with Gen Z voters, according to a new poll.Trump's approval rating among the youngest voters remains underwater, but the latest YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between August 9-11, shows Trump's net approval rating at -28 (33 percent approve, 61 percent disapprove), a 10-point jump from last month when it was -38 (18 percent approved and 66 percent disapproved).But his net approval rating remains far lower than it was in January, when it stood at +5 points.Why It MattersIn the 2024 election, Trump made inroads with young voters, narrowing the Democrats' traditional lead among Gen Z—a group that has typically leaned left in recent cycles. According to AP VoteCast, voters ages 18 to 29 supported then Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by just 51 percent to 47 percent. In 2020, Joe Biden carried the same age group by a much wider margin, winning 61 percent to Trump's 36 percent.What To KnowTrump's standing with Gen Z voters has improved over the past month, with notable gains on the economy, immigration, and inflation, alongside modest increases in trust and confidence in his leadership, according to the polling.The August YouGov/Economist poll surveyed 1,635 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent. The July poll surveyed 1,680 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent.On the economy, approval rose from 30 percent in July to 36 percent in August, while disapproval fell from 64 percent to 54 percent. Meanwhile, approval of his handling of inflation jumped from 23 percent to 31 percent, with disapproval dropping from 72 percent to 60 percent.Inflation rose to 2.7 percent year-on-year in June, the highest reading since February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).Gen Z's view of economic trends also improved. In July, 12 percent said the economy was getting better, 27 percent said it was the same, and 58 percent saw it getting worse. By August, \"better\" climbed to 18 percent, \"same\" dipped slightly to 25 percent, and \"worse\" fell to 51 percent.But Trump's approval rating on the economy is still substantially lower than it was in January, when his net approval among Gen Z stood at +18 points.Job growth slowed sharply in July, with just 73,000 new jobs added, far lower than expected. After last month's jobs report was published, Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. In a post, Trump accused McEntarfer—without offering evidence—of rigging the numbers to harm his administration. But that move by Trump was not popular among Gen Z voters, with only 13 percent saying the decision was justified—50 percent said they were not sure.Despite that, the latest poll shows small but measurable gains in perceptions of Trump's character and leadership. In August, 22 percent described him as honest, up from 20 percent in July, while the share saying he is not honest fell from 67 percent to 57 percent.But overall, Trump's honesty rating has fallen to its lowest point since he reentered the White House, with just 31 percent of Americans viewing Trump as trustworthy as he has recently faced mounting criticism for his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.Billionaire Elon Musk has urged Trump to \"just release the files as promised,\" while author Michael Wolff has speculated that Trump may be seeking major distractions to shift attention away from the Epstein fallout. Victims and advocacy groups remain adamant that all records be made public, arguing that the current handling of the case \"smacks of a cover-up.\"Public discontent is also reflected in the polls. On the Jeffrey Epstein case, only 13 percent of Gen Z voters approve of Trump's handling, while 69 percent disapprove. And 44 percent believe he knew \"a lot\" of Epstein's crimes before investigations began—and 32 percent think he knew \"some.\" Trump has said that he had no knowledge of, or involvement, in Epstein's crimes.What Happens NextThe Republican-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the DOJ for its files on Epstein, with a deadline of August 19 to hand them over, suggesting the issue isn't going away for the president anytime soon.And Trump's new nominee to run the BLS hinted at suspending the monthly release of jobs data. August's numbers are due to be published in the first week of September.","summary":"Trump's standing with Gen Z voters has improved over the past month.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls-gen-z-2113481","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2702402/trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=de005b9d8a74db53dc3ae6e2d5d47b46","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 09:00:01","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":351624160,"title":"Maher: Dems Like AOC, Mamdani, Warren Are Afraid to Come on My Show","text":"On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that he would like to have Rep.

Even late-breaking investigations and speculation surrounding the suicide of President Trump's late friend Jeffrey Epstein have had to compete with a ferocious partisan war within some of the states over redistricting.\n\nConsider Texas, where Republicans in the state Legislature are attempting, at Trump's urging, to redraw congressional districts in order to flip five more districts to Republican majorities. Democratic legislators have fled the state to deny the Legislature a quorum, in hopes of preventing Republicans from carrying out their plan.\n\nSome have taken refuge in Illinois, leading Texas Republicans to call for their arrest by the FBI. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has vowed to protect them.\n\n\"Donald Trump is trying to steal five seats from the people – frankly, of the country, not just the people of Texas – and disenfranchise people,\" Pritzker said on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" \"We're talking about violating the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution.\"\n\nPritzker also declined to turn away from the possibility of a mid-decade congressional remap in his own state. He told Colbert: \"It's possible. I've said everything is on the table. We've gotta fight fire with fire.\"\n\nAre we starting to see the hardball attitude that many frustrated Democrats have been urging their national party to adopt?\n\nStill smarting from the debacle of Joe Biden's 2024 candidacy and the subsequent defeat of the Kamala Harris/Tim Walz ticket, Dems appear increasingly ready to face a real threat to their ability to regain power in 2026 and beyond.\n\nFor their part, Republicans are not trying to hide their determination to gerrymander their way out of a midterm backlash in November 2026. Vice President Vance visited Indiana to urge lawmakers to redraw their congressional map.\n\nI find it to be no small irony that these battle lines are forming on the 60th anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Some of us are old enough to remember the feeling that a new page in American history had been turned when that law was enacted. We believed that it would finally end the denial and dilution of Black voting power.\n\nThat dream, once won, now must be defended once again. Frankly, it's been a never-ending chore. The last time House Democrats held the majority, they introduced a sweeping package of good-government reforms, including a centerpiece legislation to end partisan gerrymandering.\n\n\"The people should choose their politicians,\" then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in 2021 before the House passed the For the People Act, which would later die in the Senate. \"Politicians should not be choosing their voters.\"\n\nOf course, choosing their voters is precisely what Trump and Republican legislatures intend to do. Trump's team has pushed Republicans to redraw maps \"wherever redistricting is an option.\"\n\nDemocrats can't afford to respond with anything less. Indeed, some Democrats, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, are switching from their past lofty positions in favor of bipartisan redistricting commissions to embracing the idea of fighting fire with fire.\n\nPelosi, who remains a member of the U.S. House, said that while Democrats favor nationwide independent commissions to draw congressional district maps, they \"cannot and will not unilaterally disarm.\"\n\nRecent polling trends show eroding support for Trump's actions and policies, which can be aptly summed up as \"reverse Robin Hood\" with a police-state sideshow. This is especially the case among independents but is noticeable even among Republicans.\n\nA big opportunity is opening for challengers who can show voters sanity, humanity and the backbone to stand up to the schoolyard bully in the Oval Office. And Democrats have shown before that they can rise from the slough of despond to win an electoral mandate.\n\nThis normally silly season has turned sinister, and the stakes to Democrats are existential. Their first step in winning back voters is showing they're willing to fight.\n\nTribune Content Agency","summary":"Gee, what's happened to the \"silly season\" of U.S. politics?That's what many of us in the daily journalism trade used to call the periods, usually in late summer or near holidays, when news media put an unusually intense focus on…","url":"https://buffalonews.com/article_e4c2c9d8-f84d-5300-a3cd-993395456ad9.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/custom/image/661b9d20-c537-11ea-a16f-1fed0e01c517.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 07:18:09","author":"Blox Content Management","authors":["Blox Content Management"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":351647476,"title":"‘I’m the one to beat’: is Taylor Swift’s Showgirl era set to take her to even greater heights?","text":"Taylor Swift’s podcast interview with her American football player boyfriend, Travis Kelce, this week yielded plenty of tidbits for fans. Across two hours of loose chat on New Heights, the show Kelce helms with his brother Jason – also a football player – Swift revealed she was obsessed with sourdough and lurked on baking blogs. The couple spent the summer with her family, caring for her 73-year-old father, Scott, after he had a quintuple heart bypass. She gave Kelce a lesson on Hamlet and taught him how to avoid internalising speculation about their two-year relationship. You could call them the tentpoles of the 35-year-old pop star’s brand: literary passions and professional self-awareness.\n\nOne surprising revelation came near the end. Until the record-breaking 149-date Eras tour that Swift mounted from 2023-24, she said she had “never allowed myself to say: ‘You’ve arrived. You’ve made it.’” Being the only artist to win the Grammy for album of the year four times hadn’t done it; not the records broken, the acclaimed shifts from country to mainstream pop to indie. Nor her staggeringly successful campaign to re-record her first six albums to devalue their master recordings, sold by her first record label to an industry nemesis, and then on to a private equity company. “But the Eras tour,” she said, “I was like, this is nothing like what I’ve experienced before. It was so much better than anything else.”\n\nEras leapfrogged becoming the first billion-dollar tour to become the first $2bn tour. That would be plenty of cause for celebration and a good long rest. So would, as Swift announced in May, finally owning the rights to those first six albums, having successfully negotiated to buy the asset outright. (It ended her re-recording project: her 2006 debut is done and waiting, and she barely started 2017’s Reputation.) Her legacy isn’t just culturally assured, but materially secure. But Swift evidently isn’t ready to let that feeling of having “made it” go. She appeared on New Heights to announce her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, arriving just 18 months after its predecessor and 10 months after Eras concluded: she is apparently congenitally incapable of rest, with a lot to process.\n\nThe public will – correctly – have long assumed that Swift has well and truly made it like no one ever has. But the record’s promised contents, intentions and release strategy are set to make Swift – and Kelce alongside her – hysterically famous at a new level, capitalising on and shifting industry norms in a way that may leave her detractors researching bunkers in which to hide from it all.\n\nSwift’s new album does not arrive until 3 October, but this week’s edition of the industry newsletter Record of the Day led with a tongue-in-cheek congratulations to “everyone at EMI and Taylor Swift on her latest No 1 album The Life of a Showgirl”. Supernova success is a foregone conclusion: last year’s introspective The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) was the first album to pass a billion streams in its first week, reaching 1.76bn.\n\nSwift is beloved on an unfathomable scale. She is one of the last monocultural pop stars. You suspect she could have toured Eras for five years and still sold out every night. Her devout Swifties, casual pop fans and curious rubberneckers will likely propel Showgirl past TTPD’s record, such is the critical mass behind her, no matter what it sounds like. Her reign, says Annie Zaleski, the author of Taylor Swift: The Stories Behind the Songs, is unprecedented because “she’s so consistent and continuing to evolve”.\n\nBut on the podcast, Swift sounded surprisingly aware of the limitations of TTPD – too wordy, too long, too downbeat – and keen to course-correct. That project, she said, had been about “catharsis”, “mess” and “rawness” following an apparently humiliating fling with the 1975’s Matty Healy. TTPD comprised 16 songs; and on release day, Swift dropped a previously unannounced 15-track sister album, The Anthology. For Showgirl, she said she craved “focus and discipline”: just 12 songs going behind the scenes of her Eras life, with “melodies that were so infectious you’re almost angry”. She made a surprising admission about her recent quality control: “Keeping the bar really high is something I’ve been wanting to do for a very long time.”\n\nSwift recorded Showgirl with the Swedish co-producers Max Martin and Shellback in Stockholm around Eras’ spring 2024 European run. The second of her three dates in the Swedish capital was the 89th date of the Eras tour: she named her fifth album, partly produced by the Swedes, 1989 after her birth year. Given the endless number games she plays, sowing numerology clues for fans setting up her future movements, you can assume the scheduling was no accident.\n\nMartin and Shellback co-produced Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017), homes to her biggest pure-pop smashes, among them Style, 22, and Blank Space. Her first subsequent album without them, 2019’s playful Lover, was regarded as ending that imperial period. Since then, Swift’s music has grown more muted and experimental, often in collaboration with the producers Jack Antonoff and the National’s Aaron Dessner, as if she were trying to carve out a sustainable future for a 30-something songwriter: 2020’s folksy Folklore and Evermore, the dusky pop of 2022’s Midnights, TTPD. They spawned no comparable radio hits; her biggest in recent years is Lover’s Cruel Summer, never officially released as a single but adopted as a fan favourite.\n\nSwift now seems to be framing those records as a phase – her art school years. The Showgirl era seems to be an attempt to recapture the kind of musical ubiquity where little kids yell your lyrics at birthday parties, as they did with 2014’s Shake It Off and now do with songs such as Chappell Roan’s Hot to Go! “My business is making music and taking care of my fans and I have ways of monitoring what they want from me and how best to entertain them, which is my job,” she told the Kelces. Eras was divided into segments reflecting each of her albums (except her 2006 debut): imagine it as a 149-night focus group.\n\nSwift’s monitoring also cannot have failed to note that her brand of hermetically sealed, grown-up pop has been ceding ground to Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli xcx, who have seized culture’s centre with less inhibited and far rowdier hits than the exacting Swift has ever made. Or perhaps ever could: one insurmountable difference is that Roan and xcx are unlikely to ever monitor fan desire or cater to it. And Martin, despite being second only to John Lennon and Paul McCartney for having the most US No 1 singles, has waned as a hitmaker. “I don’t think she can get ahead of those artists because she’s such a millennial pop star,” said a publicist for comparably superstar acts who asked to remain nameless. “She can’t create trends like those younger artists because they have a lot less to lose.”\n\nThere is a sense that Swift is catching up: that she’s clocked criticisms, read the room. She released 19 physical variants for TTPD, and was accused of exploiting fans and damaging the environment with excess vinyl production, a practice Billie Eilish has called “wasteful”. Showgirl appears to have a fairly industry-standard four. She is also competing with herself: if there is a tour, says the music business expert Eamonn Forde, it will have to take a significantly different form to Eras – residency-style, perhaps Vegas or in a bespoke venue, as recently done by Adele – to avoid unfavourable comparisons to the biggest tour of all time.\n\nSwift drew mass media coverage for her appearances at Kelce’s games with the Kansas City Chiefs, prompting some aggrieved football fans to boo whenever she appeared on the jumbotron. In a trailer for her episode of New Heights, traditionally a sports show, Swift joked: “I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it’s more of me.” Unluckily for them, the brand-building between Kelce and Swift looks set to make their association unavoidable.\n\nNew Heights is part of their lore: after Kelce tried and failed to land a meeting with Swift after an Eras show, he told listeners he wanted to meet her. Intrigued, she took him up on it. The synchronicity began. It can be no mistake that Kelce’s cover of GQ magazine landed the same week as Swift’s podcast. Meanwhile, Swift rarely gives interviews: New Heights offers a mutually beneficial space where the couple wield full control, albeit with a soft touch: giving cute disclosures, such as his love of wild otters or her running to tell him about getting her masters back when he was gaming with the boys. The moment capitalised on the prevailing trend for A-listers to reserve their media engagements for fairly fannish video podcasts, making traditional journalists fear for their jobs as they dutifully write up any news lines.\n\nPremiering Wednesday night in the US, the episode livestream crashed; within 24 hours it had 13m YouTube views, not including other podcast platform stats. The value to advertisers is huge, especially in anticipation of future Swift revelations. And Kelce, a comparatively old player at 35, is rumoured to be retiring after the coming season – his 13th year, Swift’s lucky number – so will be power-brokering his post-game career. He admitted to GQ he had literally taken his eye off the ball, with underwhelming stats in his past two seasons, because he was chasing other opportunities. “It’s his Steven Bartlett, Diary of a CEO move,” said the publicist. “It’s future-proofing their lives. He can’t be a football player for ever; she can’t be a pop star for ever. It makes them a unit – look at how it worked for the Beckhams.”\n\nAfter a backlash around 2015-16 resulting from her beef with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Swift managed to convincingly reboot her brand: a dedicated, literary songwriter who fights for artists’ rights. To onlookers outside the NFL, Kelce’s is ripe for shaping from two years of dating Swift. The couple are clearly conscious of this: Kelce told GQ he had “become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to people”, something you may imagine constitutes pillow talk in a business-minded household. “No man has ever said those words,” said the publicist.\n\nKelce’s image is openhearted romantic. Notably, he is Swift’s first significant boyfriend to seem undaunted by her celebrity – her previous six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn took place almost entirely in private. A sweet aspect of the New Heights episode was two beefy jocks being so excited by and supportive of a girly pop star. Swift joked of his public entreaty to date her that “this is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager”. The couple riffed on memes questioning Kelce’s intelligence – “it’s so hot when she says big words,” he said when Swift called Folklore “esoteric” – which is in itself very smart: positioning Kelce as lovable and non-threatening.\n\nSwift said she immediately warmed to him for not being “judgmental”, describing him as “a vibe booster in everyone’s life … like a human exclamation point”. The implication is that he could pep up your sentences if you let him into your heart. Kelce’s post-football business is being everyone’s boyfriend, not just Swift’s. His pesky family ties to Maga Trumpists won’t hurt him in the US; if Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the last election, were to be questioned about this, “her argument can be that she’s the leftwing voice in these rooms”, the publicist said.\n\nWin-win. Although Swift seemed keen to establish some distance from the voluble TTPD era, a song from The Anthology about her and Kelce’s relationship seems to outline her present mindset. “I’m making a comeback to where I belong,” she sings on The Alchemy. “Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I’m the one to beat … These blokes warm the benches / We’ve been on a winning streak.”\n\nThat streak is assured: next year marks the 20th anniversary of Swift’s self-titled debut, and she will inevitably release the re-recording to mark the occasion. Showgirl’s successor will be her 13th album, a significant moment in her lore. There are rumours of a behind-the-scenes Eras documentary to complement the record-breaking concert movie, extending the moment’s IP. Any new tour will once again recalibrate the live industry. Before Swift drops a note of music, or Kelce touches grass, they’re the coming season’s reigning champions.","summary":"Just-announced album already looks like it will make singer and partner Travis Kelce hysterically famous at a new level – and that may be precisely their plan\n\nTaylor Swift’s podcast interview with her American football player boyfriend, Travis Kelce, this week yielded plenty of tidbits for fans.

She speculated that they were 'probably' being conducted to glean citizens' 'immigration status.' \n\nPsaki - after losing roughly half of Rachel Maddow's audience during her first month in the coveted 9pm timeslot - relished in reports that some of the bystanders 'ran into a CVS to quickly make signs warning others that ICE was ahead [while] directing drivers to turn left to avoid the checkpoint. \n\n'You can see one of the signs there they’re holding,' she said. \n\n'That was DC last night,' she eventually concluded. 'The people of DC - which doesn’t surprise me. I’ve lived here a long time - pushing back in practical ways against what Trump is trying to do to the city.' \n\nPsaki is one of a number of liberals who have taken issue with Trump's bid to make the capital more safe.\n\nThey cite statistics showing that crimes have fallen since 2023. But DC has more murders per capita than Bogota in Colombia or Mexico City.\n\nIt is also plagued by far more homicides than New York City, with other liberals conceding that the capital has a serious lawlessness problem that does need tackled. \n\nAt least some DC residents have embraced Trump's forced takeover of Washington, DC's, police force with open arms, including a local black woman who uses the TikTok handle @bigdawglexi.\n\nShe took to the platform to celebrate feeling safer since the first troops started arriving Tuesday morning.\n\n 'Finally able to chill at a red light with my windows down,' she said in a self-filmed video that went viral Friday. '(I'm) not worried about if one of them young n***s is coming… Riding through the city, feeling more safe than I ever felt.' \n\nSome of Psaki's own MSNBC stablemates are at least partly-supportive of the crime crackdown. Morning Joe star Joe Scarborough, who also lives in the city, said lawlessness was out of control. \n\nFormer MSNBC star Chris Matthews, CNN's Anderson Cooper and Mike Nellis, a former Kamala Harris advisor, have all issues similar warnings since.\n\nThey all claim Trump is goading Democrats into 'a trap' with his takeover of the DC, police force by daring members of the party to defend an unacceptable status quo of crime.\n\nThe government in January said violent crime in DC was at a '30-year-low' in 2024, and early statistics from the Metropolitan Police Department suggest similar results can be expected for 2025.\n\nBut such statistics can be misleading, all three said - especially when taken as truth without a hint of personal experience.","summary":"Jen Psaki joined the liberal herd in condemning Trump's DC crime crackdown on her show The Briefing Room.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15004683/jen-psaki-washington-dc-protesters-trump-protests.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/15/22/101266527-0-image-m-4_1755291863694.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/13/7311100655852239682/1024x576_MP4_7311100655852239682.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-16 01:22:29","author":"Alex Hammer,Editor","authors":["Alex Hammer","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":351482270,"title":"Laura Loomer and the limits of posting everything","text":"For all the power she wields with the White House’s affairs, Laura Loomer does not have the traditional tools that her rivals in the MAGA influencer industrial complex have — the highest follower count, the most political power, the most internet platforms, etc. But the fact remains that she’s the influencer responsible for getting Donald Trump to fire over a dozen members of his administration (and counting) for the hazily-defined crime of being disloyal to MAGA. This is something that none of her peers, individually, have been able to do. But to understand how she operates, look no further than Loomer’s latest attempted power play, which, as always, involves a fair amount of self-humiliation (and some disgusting slander).\nEarlier this week, she leaked a private deposition that she’d given in a lawsuit wherein she explained, in her own words, why she’s published some of the most outre takes and allegations against her “enemies” on social media. The deposition was given as part of her defamation suit against HBO host Bill Maher, who claimed on a February 2025 show that Loomer was having a sexual affair with president Donald Trump. But you might have missed that context, since the social media chatter and headlines gravitated toward the sections of the deposition where Loomer was grilled about her most audacious posts: she claimed, among other things, that Sen. Lindsay Graham was secretly gay, that former Vice President Kamala Harris was a “DEI skank”, and her bitter MAGA rival Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) divorced her husband because of the “Arby’s in her pants” and was a “political prostitute [who was] sucking McCarthy’s dick all day.” \nUnsurprisingly, Loomer defended herself and her statements, both in the deposition (“I’m saying she literally—it’s so ridiculous. I’m saying she literally put Arby’s in her pants”) and in public, after the deposition was reported on by Will Sommer at The Bulwark. “I was asked about Lindsey during my deposition so I had to tell the truth. I was under oath,” Loomer tweeted — along with a screenshot of the section where she explained why she believed Graham was gay. \n[Image: Image: @LauraLoomer on X. https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-15-at-6.01.11%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all]\nHBO’s lawyers immediately argued that Loomer was violating several laws by making the private deposition public, and the document was immediately re-sealed. Loomer, on the other hand, claimed that she was simply trying to showcase that her testimony “went so well that the leftist law firm [representing HBO] wanted to SEAL my deposition.” Whether it went well is somewhat debatable, given the potential legal implications for Loomer violating a court order, as well as the incontrovertibility of Loomer saying some absolutely wild things in a legal deposition, and defending them.\nLoomer described the stunt as another example of “Loomering,” the term that she uses to describe her internet bullying campaigns. At first glance, it’s a tactic honed from her time working as a secret-camera sting operator at Project Veritas, which famously recorded members of the media and academics saying things that could be spun as anti-conservative and amoral. Loomer’s stepped up her game, however, putting herself in front of the camera (and eventually the public eye) to make her point. \nThe fact that she constantly embarrasses herself only enhances the efficacy of “Loomering”: first, shame and embarrassment does not matter in the long term, so long as people are paying attention online. (She said as much the next day: “I wake up everyday to another hit piece. It’s because I am effective and it threatens a lot of people.”) Second: the internet is forever, and even if a judge orders a deposition to be resealed, gawkers will save copies, screenshot the juicy bits, and publish them for posterity. Loomer might have been recorded reading her own tweets out loud and forced to explain the gross bits, but she has also gotten several White House administration officials fired. \nWhile it remains to be seen whether her influence extends beyond Trump’s daily capriciousness, Loomer’s unnerving gift for being an internet bully remains effective as long as she has allies in the administration, who leak her the insider info she publicly uses to humiliate others. (As she said to HBO’s lawyers, her friends in the White House told her that Graham was gay.) And as long as the storm she creates can grab Trump’s attention, he will most likely keep picking up her calls.","summary":"For all the power she wields with the White House's affairs, Laura Loomer does not have the traditional tools that her rivals in the MAGA influencer industrial complex have - the highest follower count, the most political power, the most internet platforms, etc. But the fact remains that she's the influencer responsible for getting Donald [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.theverge.com/politics/760269/laura-loomer-deposition","image":"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2172052612.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:36:49","author":"Tina Nguyen","authors":["Tina Nguyen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":351475784,"title":"Tuvalu considers pulling out of Pacific leaders’ summit amid China-linked power struggle","text":"Tuvalu’s prime minister Feletei Teo said his country may pull out of the region’s top political meeting next month, after host nation Solomon Islands moved to block all external partners – including China, US and Taiwan – from attending.\n\nThe Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting will be held in Honiara in September. On 7 August, Solomon Islands prime minister Jeremiah Manele told parliament that no dialogue partners would be invited to the annual gathering.\n\nCountries outside the Pacific, known as “dialogue partners,” have attended the forum since 1989, to work with Pacific leaders and contribute to discussions around development and regional security. While not an official partner, Taiwan has attended the meetings as a “development partner” for more than three decades.\n\nThe decision by Honiara, a close ally of Beijing, has fuelled speculation the move was aimed at keeping Taiwan out of the meeting. It has raised questions over China’s growing sway in Pacific diplomacy and whether regional unity can hold.\n\nTuvalu, along with the Marshall Islands and Palau, are the only Pacific countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, in what Beijing views as an affront to its One China principle.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Teo said he would wait to see how other Pacific leaders respond before deciding whether or not to attend the forum next month, expressing “disappointment” at the last-minute exclusion of external countries.\n\n“The region does not need these kinds of distractions,” Teo said. “We have far more important issues to focus on, rather than letting ourselves be pressured from outside.”\n\nTeo said he had written to Manele outlining concerns around the inconvenient timing of the decision, and his “difficulties supporting the justification” behind the move.\n\n“We’ll … see what the rest of the leaders’ response is to the proposal by the Solomons, and then we’ll make our decision,” he said.\n\n“I’ll wait for the final decision on this arrangement, and then reconsider my participation,” he said.\n\nThe annual forum is the main mechanism through which leaders define region-wide policy agendas.\n\nTeo added he “won’t be surprised” if China was behind the decision to block partners from the forum, saying the unusual move broke with decades of precedent in the region.\n\n“There is no denying that China is trying to extend its footprint in the Pacific, and so is the US,” Teo said.\n\n“My own personal view is that we do need their development assistance, but we do not need the competition and conflict overshadowing our development agenda in the Pacific.”\n\nThe Guardian contacted China’s embassy in Honiara for comment.\n\nA US state department spokesperson said Washington was “disappointed” by the move to exclude partners, and reaffirmed support for the attendance of all partners, including Taiwan, at the forum.\n\n“All [forum] partners, and that includes Taiwan, should be invited to participate … regardless of where it is hosted – just as countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan invite all dialogue partners, including China,” the spokesperson said.\n\nTaiwan said it “urges that that existing arrangements be maintained”, adding that its participation at the Pacific meetings would “further strengthen cooperation”.\n\nNot all of Taiwan’s Pacific allies have opposed the decision to exlude foreign attenders to the forum.\n\nPalau, which will host the forum in 2026, says it “respects and acknowledges” Solomon Islands’ decision to block all foreign attendees, with the office of the president saying it allows members “to focus on the critical intra-regional issues at this year’s forum”.\n\nSolomon Islands switched diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China in 2019 and three years later, the countries signed a controversial security pact . Honiara has also received significant Chinese funding, including a recent $US1m donation to buy 27 cars to transport delegates during the forum.\n\nDr Sarina Theys, senior lecturer in diplomacy and international affairs at the University of the South Pacific, said Solomon Islands’ decision may be an attempt to avoid openly choosing between China and Taiwan.\n\n“The only way to do that is then to just not invite anyone,” Theys said.\n\nNiuone Eliuta, first secretary at the Tuvalu High Commission in New Zealand, said he had “no doubt China is behind this decision” to block external partners from the upcoming forum.\n\n“This day and age China is very much influencing what’s going on in the Pacific,” Eliuta said, adding that excluding donor partners could mean countries miss out on vital support such as climate funding.\n\n“This is a temporary fix, moving development dialogue partners out of the Solomon Islands,” Eliuta said. “I just hope no countries break away from PIF.”\n\nConcerns over Beijing’s influence on the Forum are not new.

On 7 August, Solomon Islands prime minister Jeremiah Manele told parliament that no dialogue partners would be invited to the annual gathering.\n\nCountries outside the Pacific, known as “dialogue partners,” have attended the forum since 1989, to work with Pacific leaders and contribute to discussions around development and regional security. While not an official partner, Taiwan has attended the meetings as a “development partner” for more than three decades.\n\nThe decision by Honiara, a close ally of Beijing, has fuelled speculation the move was aimed at keeping Taiwan out of the meeting. It has raised questions over China’s growing sway in Pacific diplomacy and whether regional unity can hold.\n\nRelated: Caught in the contest between China and the west, the Cook Islands asks where its future lies\n\nTuvalu, along with the Marshall Islands and Palau, are the only Pacific countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, in what Beijing views as an affront to its One China principle.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Teo said he would wait to see how other Pacific leaders respond before deciding whether or not to attend the forum next month, expressing “disappointment” at the last-minute exclusion of external countries.\n\n“The region does not need these kinds of distractions,” Teo said. “We have far more important issues to focus on, rather than letting ourselves be pressured from outside.”\n\nTeo said he had written to Manele outlining concerns around the inconvenient timing of the decision, and his “difficulties supporting the justification” behind the move.\n\n“We’ll … see what the rest of the leaders’ response is to the proposal by the Solomons, and then we’ll make our decision,” he said.\n\n“I’ll wait for the final decision on this arrangement, and then reconsider my participation,” he said.\n\nThe annual forum is the main mechanism through which leaders define region-wide policy agendas.\n\nTeo added he “won’t be surprised” if China was behind the decision to block partners from the forum, saying the unusual move broke with decades of precedent in the region.\n\n“There is no denying that China is trying to extend its footprint in the Pacific, and so is the US,” Teo said.\n\n“My own personal view is that we do need their development assistance, but we do not need the competition and conflict overshadowing our development agenda in the Pacific.”\n\nThe Guardian contacted China’s embassy in Honiara for comment.\n\nA US state department spokesperson said Washington was “disappointed” by the move to exclude partners, and reaffirmed support for the attendance of all partners, including Taiwan, at the forum.\n\nRelated: Trump administration asks tiny Pacific nation of Palau to accept migrants deported from US\n\n“All [forum] partners, and that includes Taiwan, should be invited to participate … regardless of where it is hosted – just as countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan invite all dialogue partners, including China,” the spokesperson said.\n\nTaiwan said it “urges that that existing arrangements be maintained”, adding that its participation at the Pacific meetings would “further strengthen cooperation”.\n\nNot all of Taiwan’s Pacific allies have opposed the decision to exlude foreign attenders to the forum.\n\nPalau, which will host the forum in 2026, says it “respects and acknowledges” Solomon Islands’ decision to block all foreign attendees, with the office of the president saying it allows members “to focus on the critical intra-regional issues at this year’s forum”.\n\nSolomon Islands switched diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China in 2019 and three years later, the countries signed a controversial security pact . Honiara has also received significant Chinese funding, including a recent $US1m donation to buy 27 cars to transport delegates during the forum.\n\nDr Sarina Theys, senior lecturer in diplomacy and international affairs at the University of the South Pacific, said Solomon Islands’ decision may be an attempt to avoid openly choosing between China and Taiwan.\n\n“The only way to do that is then to just not invite anyone,” Theys said.\n\nNiuone Eliuta, first secretary at the Tuvalu High Commission in New Zealand, said he had “no doubt China is behind this decision” to block external partners from the upcoming forum.\n\n“This day and age China is very much influencing what’s going on in the Pacific,” Eliuta said, adding that excluding donor partners could mean countries miss out on vital support such as climate funding.\n\n“This is a temporary fix, moving development dialogue partners out of the Solomon Islands,” Eliuta said. “I just hope no countries break away from PIF.”\n\nConcerns over Beijing’s influence on the Forum are not new. At last year’s meeting in Tonga, segments of the Pacific leader’s communique that referenced Taiwan were altered, a decision many believe to be an outcome of China’s influence. In 2022, two Chinese defence attaches were ejected from the Forum’s meeting in Suva while caught listening to a visual address given by US vice-president Kamala Harris.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/tuvalu-considers-pulling-pacific-leaders-233045486.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5dTdJkkW9rDkhERIOKR15Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xOTIwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/c1944e5a32f21596f0b52dd1ec5cecaf","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:30:45","author":"Prianka Srinivasan","authors":["Prianka Srinivasan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":351478538,"title":"Republican candidate for governor Steve Hilton visits San Jose homeless camp, bashes Democrats","text":"A leading Republican in the California governor’s race made a recent campaign stop at a sprawling San Jose homeless camp to film a social media video bashing Democrats for allowing “third-world slum conditions” to persist across the state.\n\nIn the video posted this week to X, Steve Hilton, a former Fox News host who recently polled second in a crowded field of candidates behind Democrat Katie Porter, strode through the encampment at Columbus Park near the San Jose airport in a pair of jeans and white sneakers, motioning toward the tents, lived-in RVs and trash scattered across the park and what was once a functioning baseball field.\n\n“This is Gavin Newsom’s California,” Hilton said, using expletives to describe the smell of the camp. “This is Democrat-run California.”\n\nUnder Newsom’s watch, the state’s homeless population has swelled 24% to an estimated 187,000 people, despite his administration spending at least $27 billion to combat homelessness since he took office in 2019. Even so, homelessness experts and service providers say the unprecedented spending likely prevented the crisis from getting even worse.\n\nDan Schnur, a political science professor with UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California, said the video could be an attempt to appeal to deep-pocketed Silicon Valley donors, who are increasingly turning to conservative candidates.\n\n“The campaign may have decided that there is an opportunity for support in the tech community, so they talked about the problem in San Jose rather than Los Angeles or San Francisco,” Schnur said. “On the other hand, they may have just been in the area with an hour to kill.”\n\nSchnur added that with former Vice President Kamala Harris and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis officially out of the 2026 governor’s race, there isn’t a candidate with “a natural advantage in Silicon Valley.” Porter, who formerly represented Orange County in Congress, has deeper ties to Southern California.\n\nThe Hilton campaign said the candidate was spending time with his family and unavailable to discuss the video.\n\n“We decided to shoot our video at Columbus Park, home to one of the largest encampments in the area,” campaign spokesperson Hector Barajas said in a statement. “Residents have been asking their local and state representatives the same questions: What about us? What about our community?”\n\nWhile Hilton was quick to slam Newsom and California Democrats more broadly, he refrained from calling out San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, a moderate Democrat, by name.\n\nLike Hilton, Mahan has been critical of the state’s homelessness response and has pursued more forceful approaches to solving the crisis. Earlier this year, San Jose adopted a controversial ordinance that Mahan proposed to cite or arrest homeless people who repeatedly refuse shelter beds.\n\nMahan’s office did not provide a comment in response to questions about criticisms leveled in the video.\n\nNewsom’s office also did not provide a response and directed questions to local officials.\n\nStarting next week, San Jose plans to clear the Columbus Park encampment, which has been the site of multiple recent fires and a fatal stabbing last year. Despite the danger, families with small children have been known to stay at the camp.\n\nAfter clearing the encampment, the city plans to spend $19.5 million on revitalizing the park, including adding soccer fields, horseshoe pits and pickleball courts.\n\nCity officials say they are working to provide shelter beds for the more than 250 people estimated to be living at the park. But even as local officials open new shelters and an outdoor “safe-sleeping” site in the city’s northside neighborhood, it’s unclear how many camp residents will ultimately be moved off the street.\n\nIn the video, Hilton took particular aim at a policy known as “housing first,” which calls for accepting homeless people into permanent housing without preconditions such as getting sober, agreeing to mental health treatment or finding employment. The idea behind the policy — backed by research and embraced by state officials and, until recently, federal officials — is that homeless people are best able to take advantage of services only after they have safe and stable housing.\n\nHilton contends Democrats’ backing of the strategy is preventing homeless people from getting treatment and leading to wasteful spending on affordable housing projects, which can cost as much as $1 million a door in expensive parts of the state like the Bay Area. Mahan, for his part, has made similar arguments to justify shifting city funds from permanent housing to homeless shelters.\n\n“They make it illegal to solve the problem,” Hilton said.\n\nIn an executive order last month, President Donald Trump directed federal officials to end support for housing first programs that “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment.” Trump also demanded that state and local officials move more homeless people with mental health and drug issues into involuntary care or risk losing federal funding.\n\nAt the state level, some California Democrats have pushed legislation to amend the state’s housing first policy to allow more funding for abstinence-only treatment centers and sober living homes. But those bills have so far failed to make it through the Legislature.","summary":"\"This is Gavin Newsom's California,\" Hilton said in a campaign video.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/15/steve-hilton-governor-san-jose-homeless/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SJM-L-ABUNDANCE-04XX-4.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:00:59","author":"Ethan Varian","authors":["Ethan Varian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":351470394,"title":"Gov.

Tim Walz is facing criticism for appointing two Democratic donors to the University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents this week, including one who gave nearly $20,000 to his campaigns for governor and Congress.\n\nWalz’s appointment of Samuel Heins, a retired U.S. ambassador to Norway, has drawn particular concern from Republicans as well as some regent finalists who weren’t selected for a spot on the U’s governing board.\n\nHeins, a longtime lawyer, human rights advocate and alum of the U’s Law School, has given Democrats hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years. He donated $11,000 to Walz’s gubernatorial campaigns, $8,400 to his past congressional campaigns and $25,000 to the Kamala Harris campaign after Walz joined the national ticket.\n\n“Samuel Heins is obviously a Democrat major donor,” said state Rep. Marion Rarick, the GOP co-chair of the Minnesota House higher education committee. “The optics are terrible. It looks like a pay-to-play.”\n\nAnother one of Walz’s four regent picks, Ellen Luger, donated at least $3,450 to his gubernatorial campaigns, state campaign finance data shows. Luger is a former minister counselor for agriculture at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, with experience negotiating international agricultural policy. She also previously served as a trustee at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, and is married to former U.S. Attorney of Minnesota Andrew Luger.\n\nWalz’s appointments to the board come at a critical time for Minnesota’s flagship university, which cut some academic programs and hiked undergraduate resident tuition by 6.5% earlier this summer. The U’s 12 regents serve unpaid, six-year terms and are tasked with approving major policies such as tuition increases and a multibillion-dollar annual budget.\n\nA spokesperson for Walz said in a statement Friday that the governor “appointed a highly-qualified, well-respected slate of statewide leaders to the Board of Regents.”\n\n“He has full confidence in their ability to tackle the challenges facing the University of Minnesota with integrity and dedication,” the spokesperson said.","summary":"One of Walz’s regent picks, Samuel Heins, donated $11,000 to his gubernatorial campaigns and $8,400 to his past congressional campaigns.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/gov-tim-walz-criticized-for-appointing-prominent-democratic-donor-to-us-board-of-regents/601455968","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/2DDVNCK5TFGOHEEQ4CDDRVPVTY.JPG?&w=1200&ar=1.91:1&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:00:00","author":"Coast Guard","authors":["Coast Guard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.094},{"id":351462256,"title":"RFK Jr. claims 'the swamp' is trying to drive a 'wedge' between him and Trump and announces he's NOT running for president in 2028","text":"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Friday blasted 'the swamp' for trying to drive a wedge between him and President Donald Trump and announced that he was not running for president in 2028. \n\nKennedy took to X to dispel rumors he was eyeing another presidential bid under the nose of Trump, who appointed him HHS head after Kennedy endorsed the Republican and ended his independent 2024 bid last August. \n\nOn Wednesday, Trump's most controversial outside adviser Laura Loomer told Politico Playbook that she wanted a top Kennedy aide ousted, over concerns the adviser was helping the HHS secretary quietly mount a White House run. \n\n'The swamp is in full panic mode,' Kennedy said on X. 'D.C. lobby shops are laboring fiercely to drive a wedge between President Trump and me, hoping to thwart our team from dismantling the status quo and advancing POTUS' Make America Healthy Again agenda.' \n\n'They're pushing the flat-out lie that I'm running for president in 2028,' Kennedy continued. 'Let me be clear: I am running for president in 2028.' \n\nHe added that 'my loyalty is to President Trump and the mission we've started.' \n\nKennedy then addressed Loomer's call for his principal deputy chief of staff and senior counselor, Stefanie Spear, to be fired. \n\nSpear served as his 2024 campaign press secretary, one of Kennedy's most visible campaign officials. \n\n'Their attacks on my staff, especially Stefanie Spear - a fierce, loyal warrior for MAHA who proudly serves in the Trump Administration and works every day to advance President Trump's vision for a healthier, stronger America - are proof we're over the target,' Kennedy said. \n\nOther conservatives in the MAGA movement took issue with Spear just weeks into the administration. \n\nIn February Axios quoted a number of unnamed sources from conservative organizations who had problems with some of Spear's previous social media posts - which expressed support for Democratic causes.\n\nKennedy started his presidential campaign as a Democrat - the party of his famous family - but switched his affiliation to independent in October 2023 when it was clear he wouldn't be able to beat incumbent President Joe Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary. \n\nA year ago, Kennedy joined forces with the Republican Trump - combining the MAGA movement with MAHA - Make America Healthy Again. \n\nThat coalition aided Trump in winning the election against Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris in November. \n\nLast month, Axios reported that a call that included hundreds of MAHA supporters, including controversial comedian Russell Brand, appeared to be setting the table for Kennedy to launch another presidential bid. \n\nThat move could ruffle feathers with Trump, who is constitutionally barred from serving a third term, but has already indicated that he wants to play kingmaker in the next presidential election. \n\nThe involvement of Tony Lyons on the call, who had run Kennedy's MAHA PAC, signaled to some attendees that a 2028 bid was in the making. \n\nLyons has protested that interpretation and did so again on Friday. \n\n'The story that Secretary Kennedy was running for president was a made up story. There's no truth to it whatsoever,' he told the Daily Mail. 'Secretary Kennedy never gave any indication that he was planning to run for president.' \n\nLyons said that Kennedy was 'disrupting an entrenched and deeply corrupt system that has allowed a small group of companies to make incredible profits from products that make Americans sick.' \n\n'Those companies are spending millions to attack Secretary Kennedy, Stefanie Spear and the rest of his incredible team,' Lyons continued. 'This is a desperate attempt to protect a revenue stream that is dependent on poisoning the American public.' \n\nKennedy, a prominent vaccine sceptic, was more vague in his post on who was to blame for spreading the 2028 rumors and tarnishing Spear in media reports. \n\n'The president has made himself the answer to my 20-year prayer that God would put me in a position to end the chronic disease epidemic - and that's exactly what my team and I will do until the day he leaves office,' Kennedy said.","summary":"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Will voters buy it?","text":"On Thursday, Gavin Newsom announced that he would ask the California legislature to vote to put an initiative to redraw the state’s congressional districts on the ballot in November.\n\nThis, of course, came in response to Texas Republicans, acting on behalf of Donald Trump, attempting to redraw their maps to give additional seats to the GOP in the House of Representatives. All the while, Newsom has roundly mocked Trump and, on social media, mimicked the president’s all-caps style of posting. \n\nNewsom is clearly eyeing a run for president. But he’s also offering something unique: between his bombastic tone and his ability to grab headlines, he’s offering Democrats their own version of Trumpism.\n\nWhen Trump first ran for president and then later stepped into the Oval Office, Republicans regularly would say, “At least he fights.” That refrain allowed them to accept Trump calling Mexicans rapists, impugning prisoners of war and his bragging about grabbing women without their consent. \n\n“The guy's a generational talent,” Mike Madrid, a Hispanic political consultant from California who worked for Republicans, told The Independent. “Most people rely on their own skillset. He's able to adjust, see the political terrain and fight on that terrain and win.”\n\nAnd Madrid saw Newsom’s skill up close in person when he worked on the campaign for Newsom’s 2018 opponent, former Los Angeles Democratic mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. That was the case in 2004, when Newsom presided over same-sex marriages during his time as mayor of San Francisco. In 2008, he famously said, “This door's wide open now. It's going to happen, whether you like it or not.”\n\n“He is best in times of tension and conflict,” Madrid said. \n\nIt’s a major change of fortune for Newsom. After Trump’s victory in 2024, he faced severe criticism for his handling of the wildfires in Southern California. \n\nWhen he launched his podcast at the beginning of 2025, he took heat from other Democrats when he agreed with conservative activist Charlie Kirk about transgender athletes in women’s sports. To this day, many Democrats and LGBT+ activists remain salty.\n\nBut many Democrats still find themselves pleased with his actions against Trump. In June, he sued the Trump administration for sending the National Guard into Los Angeles to quell protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. \n\nNow, he’s taking Trump on directly, and it seems to have appeal. \n\nEarlier this year, Shannon Watts, a Democratic activist who raised $11 million last year for Kamala Harris, had largely refrained from giving money to Democrats in disappointment at the party’s inability to stand up to Trump. \n\nBut this week, she contributed to Newsom’s campaign. \n\n“I have been waiting for Democrats to meet the moment and to show some fight and to stand up to this administration that is so clearly wanting to be authoritarian,” she told The Independent. \n\n“And this is less of me saying with my money, oh, this is the person that I think will be president. It's more of a vote of a thank you so much for doing what is expected of elected officials and politicians in this moment.” \n\nNewsom still has his weaknesses, of course. He famously faced a recall in 2021 after facing backlash for dining indoors at the French Laundry restaurant without a mask during the pandemic. And his policies of banning homeless encampments have also angered progressives. This is to say nothing of the fact that if he runs, he will have the “Liberal San Francisco mayor” label that might put off swing voters. \n\nBut Watts said her contribution was not an endorsement of him as the Democratic nominee in 2028.\n\n“I had people in my thread say when I tweeted that I was donating, ‘You know, he's not the one,’” Watts said. “That's not the point. This is not about in 2025 who is going to be the Democratic nominee. This is about who is leading the pack in fighting in ways that are new and different, inventive and effective.” \n\nPolling consistently shows that Democratic voters increasingly do not like their leaders and see them as rolling over for Trump. That has, in turn, led to Democrats yearning for someone to fill the gap, Lakshya Jain, a co-founder of the politics website Split Ticket, told The Independent. \n\n“There's not really any way for Democrats to fight against Trump right now,” he said. “Because what letters do they have? They don't control any branch of government. They don't control the Supreme Court, but what is true is they do control the state of California, and the state of California has nine Republicans and a lot of blue turf that's kind of wasted on certain incumbents.” \n\nThat allows Newsom to step out in front and say he is the first one to stand against Texas’s actions. Specifically, the Texas Democrats who decamped to blue states said they would return to Texas because California would respond in kind if Texas passed their new maps. \n\n2028 is a long way off and plenty could change. Other candidates might be able to prove Newsom is a paper tiger. But then again, plenty of Republicans waited for Trump to implode and he laid waste to them. \n\nOn Friday, as Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Newsom’s office fired off another Trumpian all-caps tweet. \n\n“MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT DONALD J. WOULD CONSIDER “GIVING AWAY” THE FREE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HIS ‘BEST FRIEND’ VLADIMIR PUTIN — ALL BECAUSE I, GAVIN C.

They added, however, that Cibrowski may simply end up as a hatchet man for incoming bosses — before he ends up a casualty himself.\n\nAs previously reported by The Post, Cibrowski has also gotten static from “CBS Mornings” executive producer Shawna Thomas — a close ally of network star Gayle King — and her job could be on the line, too, insiders told The Post.\n\nCBS News declined to comment.\n\nAs reported by The Post, Jeff Shell, the new president of the merged Skydance-Paramount, said last week that he was interviewing news executives for Cibrowski’s job. That comes after rumors that Skydance CEO David Ellison is in talks with journalist Bari Weiss, as well as former CBS News president David Rhodes, to join the network. \n\nAt the “Evening News,” insiders said DuBois looked poised to land the sole anchor spot. A former WCBS New York local anchor, sources said Dubois has appeared better-suited for the job than Dickerson, who is better known for his political reporting chops.\n\nThe co-hosts have “lacked chemistry” and seemed out of their depth covering international news such as the death of Pope Francis. But one high-level exec blamed poor ratings on a leadership vacuum.\n\n“There’s a lack of support, a lack of focus and differing perspectives on what the show should be,” the person said, adding that the “insecurity and lack of confidence shows up on the screen.”\n\nA key issue has been the April exit of longtime “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — who on his way out aired gripes about the show’s editorial independence as Paramount faced a lawsuit from President Trump over the show’s editing of an interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nBefore his exit, Owens had been tapped by then-CBS News President Wendy McMahon to revamp the “Evening News”. He assigned Campanile to emphasize longer, “60 Minutes”-style features. The strategy flopped amid the rapid-fire news cycles of the early Trump administration.\n\nNevertheless, Campanile — who insiders said is expected to be replaced by “Evening News” senior producer Kim Harvey — has continued to crank out the features despite Cibrowski’s demands for more straight news, sources said.\n\n“Now, the show and the team feel rudderless. If you’re going to do something different, you need to do it with confidence and assurance and this team has none of that,” the source said. “They are alone. They feel it and the viewers feel it.”\n\nThe source pointed to “an idiotic” July 31 piece on the rise in popularity of astrology – a segment that took up a precious 3 minutes – on a newsy day filled with headlines on President Trump’s trade tariffs and deadly flash floods in Texas.\n\n“That was Guy’s arrogance,” a CBS insider said of the astrology report. “The only people who think the show is journalistically great is Guy and the senior producers.”\n\nFeathers likewise got ruffled by an “insulting gift” that Owens and Campanile had given Cibrowski upon his spring arrival — a “Bible of Broadcasting” that was a primer on CBS storytelling and what makes it unique versus the competition. \n\nCibrowski — who spent 30 years at top-ranked ABC News where he oversaw shows including “Good Morning America,” “World News Tonight,” “Nightline” and “20/20” — found the gift “ridiculous,” a third source said.\n\nInside the halls of Tiffany Network, the “Evening News” has been ripped for “how unwatchable it is,” a CBS source said.

This is a modest decline from two months ago, when 41% approved.\n\nAnd perceptions of some of Trump’s personal traits are more negative than they were following his election victory (or in 2024 preelection polling). For instance, 37% of Americans today say “cares about the needs of ordinary people” describes Trump well. That share is 8 points lower than it was shortly after the November election, and 5 points lower than it was in late-summer preelection polling.\n\nTrump’s job approval\n\nMuch of the change in Trump’s approval rating over the last few months has come among his own 2024 voters and people who did not vote in 2024.\n\nTrump’s 2024 voters continue to overwhelmingly approve of his job performance – 85% do so today. However, this reflects a decline from 88% in June and 95% at the beginning of his term.\n\nTrump’s rating has slipped more among his younger voters than among older adults who cast their ballot for him.\n\nA few weeks into his presidency, Trump’s job approval rating among those who voted for him varied little by age. Nine-in-ten or more Trump voters under 35 approved of his job performance, as did similar shares of those in older age groups.\n\nToday, Trump’s rating remains overwhelmingly high among his voters ages 50 and older. But it has slipped considerably more among his youngest voters: 69% of Trump voters under 35 now approve of his job performance, down 23 points from the start of this term.\n\nTrump has also lost ground among adults who did not cast a ballot in 2024. Around a third (32%) approve of his performance today, down from 36% in June and 45% at the beginning of his term.\n\nNearly all of those who voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 disapprove of Trump’s job performance. Just 2% currently approve, essentially unchanged over the last few months (though slightly lower than the 5% who approved at the very beginning of his term).\n\nAmong demographic groups\n\nToday, 38% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, including 27% who approve very strongly. Six-in-ten disapprove, with nearly half (47%) saying they strongly disapprove.\n\nTrump’s approval is more negative than positive among most demographic groups.\n\nWhite Americans are modestly more likely to disapprove of the president than approve: 47% approve of Trump’s performance, while 52% disapprove. Clear majorities of Black (83%), Hispanic (70%) and Asian (66%) Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the job.\n\nOlder adults continue to hold more positive views of Trump’s job performance than younger adults (44% of those ages 50 and older approve, compared with 33% of adults under 50).\n\nAnd while 41% of Americans without a bachelor’s degree approve of Trump’s performance, a smaller share of those with a bachelor’s degree (34%) say the same.\n\nTrump’s personal traits\n\nMost Americans (68%) say the phrase “stands up for what he believes in” describes Trump very or fairly well.\n\nSmaller shares say the same about the phrases “mentally sharp” (48%), “keeps his promises” (43%), “cares about the needs of ordinary people” (37%), “honest” (36%) or “a good role model” (29%).\n\nThe share who sees Trump as someone who stands up for his beliefs and the share who sees him as honest are essentially the same as where they stood throughout the 2024 campaign. But Trump’s ratings on other measures are more negative today than they were throughout the campaign and shortly after his November victory.\n\nFor instance, 48% today say “mentally sharp” describes Trump well. Throughout the 2024 campaign and shortly after the November election, more than half of Americans held this view.\n\nViews by party\n\nAs in the past, there are wide partisan gaps on evaluations of the president’s traits. Republicans overwhelmingly say most of these traits apply to Trump, while few Democrats say the same.\n\nThe partisan gaps are particularly wide(60 points or more) on the following traits:\n\nMentally sharp (85% of Republicans say this describes Trump at least somewhat well, while just 14% of Democrats agree)\n\nKeeps his promises (76% vs. 13%)\n\nCares about the needs of ordinary people (72% vs. 5%)\n\nHonest (69% vs. 7%)\n\nThere are narrower – though still wide – partisan gaps on two other characteristics. Republicans are 43 points more likely than Democrats to say Trump stands up for what he believes in. This gap is narrower than others because Democrats are far more likely to say this characteristic applies to Trump than they are to say this about any of the other traits.\n\nConversely, the relatively narrow 51-point gap on views of Trump as “a good role model” is attributable to the slim majority of Republicans who say this applies to Trump (56% vs. 5% of Democrats).","summary":"Trump&#39;s job approval and views of his personal traits - Pew Research Center","url":"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/08/14/trumps-job-approval-and-views-of-his-personal-traits/","image":"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/PP_25.08.11_TrumpEconFP_feature.jpg?w=1200&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 21:34:23","author":"Reem Nadeem","authors":["Reem Nadeem"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":351678886,"title":"Virginia Gubernatorial Candidates Jockey for Edge in Fall Debate","text":"Former Democrat Rep.

The survey shows 14 percent remain undecided.For Republicans, Vice President JD Vance leads the pack with 45 percent of the vote, followed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz with 9 percent, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Marco Rubio with 6 percent apiece and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy with 5 percent. The poll shows 17 percent are undecided.The survey was conducted on August 11 and August 12 among 1,000 actively registered voters in Texas. The margin of error for the survey is 3 percent.Texas registered voters also say the economy is the top issue, followed by immigration, threats to democracy, health care, crime and education.In a previous poll surveying North Carolina registered voters, Buttigieg led the Democrats, followed by Harris and Newsom. Vance led Republicans, followed by DeSantis and then Rubio.What People Are SayingD. Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky, told Newsweek: \"The Emerson poll results differ from recent numbers we've seen from other polling organizations. (That's not only true on the Democratic side: Having Paxton behind Cornyn, after a big lead in some previous polls, has been remarkable as well.) While the Emerson results could represent significant shifts in how voters are leaning within both major parties, election watchers should take a wait-and-see approach on these new numbers, until they're reinforced by later polling.\"Voss added: \"Buttigieg performed better than usual nationally in Emerson's June poll as well, compared to other poll results. It's possible Emerson's methodology somehow picks up Buttigieg's support base more strongly than other polling. Still, even if the numbers are somehow inflated, it's a solid showing for a former mayor and former Cabinet member. Buttigieg doesn't have the advantages of a former vice president or a California governor, when it comes to attracting publicity. For him to be holding his own in national polling is a strongly positive sign.\"In a previous comment to Newsweek, Columbia University Professor Robert Y. Shapiro said: \"The Democratic primary polling is much too early and all we are seeing is name recognition for past presidential candidates and ones in the news lately in a visible way. On the Republican side, DeSantis and Rubio are damaged goods as past losers in the past Republican primaries in 2016 and 2024. Vance is on the rise by virtue of being Vice President and visible when he echoes or advocates more strongly Trump's MAGA positions and what Trump—and he—have done. He has not been defeated in any past major election so untarnished in that respect.\"Trump, while answering questions during a news conference on the 2028 Olympics, when directly asked if Vance is the successor to MAGA: \"Well, I think most likely in all fairness, he's the vice president. I think Marco [Rubio] is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form. I also think we have incredible people, some of the people on the stage right here, so it's too early obviously to talk about it but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point.\"What Happens NextAdditional polling will continue, especially as midterm election campaigns ramp up.Update 8/15/25, 5:34 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from D.

His knowledge of voter registration patterns – down to the precinct and county levels – is encyclopedic.\n\nKeshel believes that voter registration patterns have deeper and more reliable meaning than polling. In 2024, he applied his knowledge of these patterns to the presidential race. He correctly called every one of the swing states. He also predicted that New Hampshire would be close because of the drift in registration toward Republicans. President Donald J. Trump almost carried the state losing it to Vice President Kamala Harris by 2.8 percent of the vote.\n\nBecause Keshel was so accurate – and is continuing to monitor voter registration patterns – I became intrigued with his work and insights. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: GOP Revs Up Election Integrity Efforts With Midterms Fast Approaching) \n\nIn early June, Keshel reported in his newsletter, Captain K’s Corner, that Republicans had made gains in 11 blue states, 11 red states, and in all seven battleground states which had updated voter registration data.\n\nHe summarized that “out of these 29 states which have updated data (Connecticut failed the test), Democrats haven’t gained in a single state. Their party is going extinct.”\n\nThe numbers were decisive and indicated an historic shift, “1,059,683 net registrations have swung in favor of the GOP in just 7 months,” Keshel wrote.\n\nNow, despite all the Democrats’ efforts to lie about the One Big Beautiful Bill, coverage of the Epstein scandal, anxiety about tariffs, and all the other issues that drive the Democrats to hysteria, Keshel reported this month that the registration trend toward Republicans has continued.\n\nThe rise of the Big Government Socialist-radical values wing of the Democratic Party – and their constant negativity and hysteria – have driven people away from their party.\n\nKeshel reported the shift in all but one state that registers by party. Utah was the exception. Since it already has a 39 percent GOP advantage, it was natural that a few more Republicans got removed than Democrats when it cleaned its voting rolls.\n\nConsider the results of these key states from the 2024 election to August.\n\nFlorida went from 7.8 percent GOP advantage to 9.7 percent. Duval County (Jacksonville) dropped from 1.9 percent to 1.5 percent Democrat advantage. Keshel pointed out that Duval is a remarkably accurate proxy for Georgia (which doesn’t keep registration by party). He said this trend bodes well for Georgia becoming more solidly Republican.\n\nIowa went from being plus-10.3 percent to being plus-10.9 percent Republican. Keshel considers Iowa a proxy for Wisconsin and Minnesota (which don’t register by party) and suggested both will get redder.\n\nPennsylvania dropped from 3.1 percent to 2 percent Democrat advantage. He noted Pennsylvania and Michigan have voted similarly since 1952.\n\nNew Hampshire’s Republican advantage grew from 4.3 percent to 5.1 percent.\n\nThe Democrat advantage in Nevada dropped from 0.5 percent to 0.2 percent. Interestingly, Keshel suggested when the rural counties finish cleaning up their voter rolls, the state may have a Republican majority in registration.\n\nNorth Carolina fell from 1.3 percent to 0.2 percent Democrat advantage.\n\nFinally, Arizona’s GOP lean rose from 6.8 percent to 7.4 percent. Keshel suggests the Copper State may soon tilt and become the next GOP stronghold.\n\nAs an example of the scale of change that is underway, consider South Texas. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried South Texas in a landslide by a 19-point margin. In 2020, the shift to President Trump among Hispanics had begun, and Joe Biden only won by 2.6 percent. By 2024, voters were disgusted with the Democrats’ open borders and anti-law enforcement agenda. Trump carried South Texas by 13.3 percent.\n\nThere are two big factors reshaping American politics and government – more deeply than any time since President Franklin D Roosevelt created the New Deal 95 years ago.\n\nFirst, President Trump is committed to real change. He wants to create better jobs, more affordability, and better take-home pay. He is committed to building a safe border and safe neighborhoods. He is committed to running a less expensive, more effective government. He has made a powerful commitment to the 250th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. This has a clear emphasis on classic American values of freedom, prosperity, and patriotism. President Trump is dedicated to a powerful national security system that is focused on bringing conflicts to an end and creating peace. This is all turning out to be deeply popular with the American people.\n\nSecond, the wave of Big Government Socialism with radical values (which first appeared when socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders won 43 percent of the vote in the 2016 Democratic primaries) has continued to drive voters away from the Democratic Party. According to America’s New Majority Project polling, Big Government Socialism is supported by about 18 percent of the American people. Similarly, radical social values have about 20 percent support among the American people.\n\nIf President Trump keeps getting things done – and the Democrats continue to be hostile Big Government Socialists – the pro-Republican registration pattern will prevail.\n\nFor more commentary from Newt Gingrich, visit our website or Substack.

Derrick Van Orden in a rematch contest, will participate in an “intimate” town hall event with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as part of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour on Aug. 23. Cooke’s decision to embrace the 83 year-old democratic socialist comes after she previously cast herself as a moderate during previous runs for the seat. (RELATED: Hakeem Jeffries Can’t Stop Ducking And Dodging When Pressed On Mamdani’s Socialism)\n\nCooke, a former Democratic political strategist, is seeking the Democratic nomination in a purple district that President Donald Trump has carried during three consecutive presidential elections. Van Orden narrowly defeated Cooke by roughly three percentage points last November though the Democrat managed to outperform former Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly 10,000 votes.\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the contest as one of eight GOP-held seats that are “toss-ups” heading into the midterms. Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District, which Van Orden has represented since 2023, boasts a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+3 — meaning it voted an average of three points more Republican than the national average over the last two presidential elections.\n\nTrump carried the district by over seven percentage points in 2024.\n\nDespite the moderate leanings of the Trump-won seat she is running in, the former Democratic campaign staffer has embraced Sanders’ and his socialist platform during her third run for the seat.\n\nSanders endorsed Cooke’s campaign in June, calling the Democratic candidate a potential “ally” and “partner” to raise the minimum wage and expand Medicare if she were elected to the House.\n\n“Rebecca and I share a common goal – bulding [sic] opportunities for the working class,” Sanders wrote in a statement endorsing Cooke. “I believe as my partner in Congress she will do just that.”\n\n“I am a Blue Dog and a New Dem, but I’m also very progressive where it counts,” Cooke told NBC News following the news of Sanders’ June endorsement, referring to two Democratic groups promoting moderate and center-left views.\n\nThe pinned post on the Cooke campaign’s Instagram page is a photo of the candidate and Sanders.\n\nSanders has also endorsed Michigan Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — who have both come under criticism for their views on Israel.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), House Republicans’ campaign arm, blasted Cooke for aligning herself with Sanders and suggested voters would reject her at the ballot box for a third time.\n\n“Three-time certified loser and Bernie-backed Democrat political operative Rebecca Cooke isn’t fooling anyone,” NRCC spokesman Zach Bannon said in a statement. “Wisconsin families deserve a representative who’ll stand up to the socialist fringe, not one who’s busy booking their next speaking slot.”\n\nThe Blue Dog PAC, the campaign arm of the Blue Dog Coalition in the House of Representatives working to elect moderate Democrats, is also supporting Cooke’s third run — despite the candidate receiving Sanders’ endorsement. Cooke was the first candidate the group endorsed during the 2026 cycle.\n\nIn addition to being the Democratic nominee for the 3rd district in 2024, Cooke also ran for the same seat in 2022, losing in the Democratic primary by eight points.\n\nSpokespersons for Cooke and Van Orden did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment before publication.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Gavin Newsom revealed the joke President Donald Trump told him in June as Los Angeles descended into chaos amid mass protests to ICE raids.\n\nSix-months after assuming office, Trump ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to increase its deportation efforts in Los Angeles.\n\nAs a result, mass protests broke out across the city with demonstrators overwhelming local police and blocking major city highways.\n\nIn response, Trump, against Newsom's wishes, federalized California's National Guard while doubling-down on ICE immigration raids in Southern California.\n\nA day before the president marshalled the state's National Guard, Newsom and Trump spoke on the phone on a late Friday night.\n\nThe California governor revealed in a Thursday interview with MeidasTouch that Trump joked about his 'Newscum' nickname, bragged about his own MAGA merchandise, and discussed the 2024 election debate with Kamala Harris.\n\n'A day before he was to federalize the National Guard here in Los Angeles, he called me. We talked on a Friday night late at night and all he wanted to brag about the 'Newscum' thing. He said, 'It's pretty funny, isn't it?' He goes, 'Pretty original.' I said, 'Well, it's not original,' Newsom said.\n\nNewsom continues, 'He goes, 'Hey, what about my hats? What do you think? It's pretty good brand, right? MAGA, you know, it's pretty good. I've sold hundreds of thousands.'\n\nThe governor reportedly responded, 'I mean, I'm like, are you serious? Are we seriously having this conversation when you're supposed to be reading me the Riot Act about keeping people safe in Los Angeles? You never once talked about the National Guard.'\n\nNewsom called Trump 'unhinged' and claimed that the president 'is getting weaker' because of the effect his tariffs are having on the U.S. economy.\n\n'You cannot make this stuff up,' Newsom added. The president then went on to talk about his debate with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nAccording to Newsom, Trump did not mention during the late-night phone call that he was planning on sending in the National Guard to quell the LA protests.\n\nNewsom's recent comments come after the governor launched a new redistricting push in California following efforts by Texas and other GOP-dominated states.\n\nTexas Democrats recently fled the state Capital to New York and Illinois to block a quorum being called by state Republicans. \n\nGreg Abbott and Texas Republicans are trying to push through a mid-decade redistricting legislation that would benefit the GOP.\n\nNewsom sent a letter to Trump earlier this week promising to eliminate Republican seats in California in order to offset GOP gains in Texas and other red states.\n\nTrump did not respond to Newsom's letter, or the governor's insults over social media. \n\nWhen asked for comment by the Daily Mail, the White House pointed to prior comments made White House communications director Steven Cheung without addressing the veracity of Trump's joke.\n\n'What a Coward and Beta Cuck,' Cheung wrote on X. '@GavinNewsom is too chicken shit to take questions from the press after gives an incoherent speech. He'll never be ready for prime time.","summary":"A day before the president marshalled the state's National Guard, Newsom and Trump spoke on the phone on a late Friday night.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15004317/Gavin-Newsom-reveals-Trumps-private-joke-phone-launching-ICE-raids-Los-Angeles.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/15/17/101261505-0-image-a-8_1755276396554.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 18:31:12","author":"Editor,Phillip Nieto","authors":["Editor","Phillip Nieto"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":351431288,"title":"Hillary Clinton Hops On the MAGA Train? Former First Lady Confesses She Would Happily Nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize if Prez Saves Ukraine","text":"Hillary Clinton is in President Trump's corner, at least when it comes to the Nobel Peace Prize, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe former first lady confessed she would be more than happy to nominate her rival for the prestigious award on one condition: he ends the war in Ukraine and stops Russian President Vladimir Putin's onslaught.How Trump Can Earn Clinton's Nomination\"Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, could really stand up to Putin, something we haven't seen, but maybe this is the opportunity, if President Trump were the architect of that, I'd nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize,\" the 77-year-old told podcast host Jessica Tarlov on Raging Moderates.\n\nShe added: \"Because my goal here is to not allow capitulation to Putin.\"\n\nOn Friday, August 15, Trump is set to meet with Putin in hopes of putting an end to the brutal conflict in Ukraine; however, on the flight to Alaska, the meeting's location, he admitted the two planned on discussing land exchange, but said it was up to Ukraine. \n\n\"I've got to let Ukraine make that decision,\" he told reporters. \"And I think they'll make a proper decision. But I'm not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I'm here to get them at a table.\"Clinton and Trump have been feuding for years, with both making it clear they do not like one another, especially during the 2016 election, where she called his supporters a \"basket of deplorables.\"\n\nClinton also suggested the former reality star was besties with dictators, including Putin. And earlier this year, she ripped Trump's administration after his victory over Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Instead of a strong America using all our strengths to lead the world and confront our adversaries, Mr. Trump's America will be increasingly blind and blundering, feeble and friendless,\" she told the New York Times.\n\nTrump has always been open about his obsession with the award, especially after another one of his rivals, Barack Obama, won it in 2009.Does The Prez 'Deserve' The Award?During his Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February, Trump was asked about his odds of winning the coveted award.\n\n\"They will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize. It’s too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me,\" he complained at the time.\n\nThe year before, during a rally in Las Vegas, Trump once again cried over the award and told the crowd: \"They gave Obama the Nobel Prize. He didn’t even know why the hell he got it, right? He still doesn’t. \n\n\"He got elected, and they announced he’s getting the Nobel Prize. I got elected in a much bigger, better, crazier election, but they gave him the Nobel Prize.\"Trump is not alone in his thoughts either, as a member of his loyal MAGA base even nominated the president in March 2025.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Bonsall gushed over Trump's accomplishments despite only being a few weeks into his second term at the time.\n\n\"Not since Ronald Reagan has an American president better represented the national resolve of peace through strength or the fundamental case for a world without war,\" Issa drooled at the time.\n\nHe added: \"Remarkably, it was the 2024 election of Donald Trump, more than 10 weeks before his swearing in, that tangibly kickstarted the cause of peace in numerous regions of the world, and we are already seeing the benefits...\"Only four presidents, along with Obama, have been given the award: Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Jimmy Carter.","summary":"Hillary Clinton admitted she would have no problem nominating Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is he saves Ukraine from Putin.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/hillary-clinton-maga-trump-nobel-peace-prize-ukraine-putin/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/jBffd5b9L/0x0/clinton-trump-nobel-peace-prize-1755279208979.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 18:30:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":351422904,"title":"Fresh proof the federal workforce is still stuck on #Resisting Trump","text":"For dispelling the myth of a super-competent, nonpartisan federal workforce, let us all thank Sean Charles Dunn.\n\nDunn reportedly worked as an international-affairs specialist in the Justice Department’s criminal division — until Thursday, when he allegedly had a public meltdown at federal agents, finishing up by throwing his Subway sandwich at one of them.\n\nVideo shows him cussing out his fellow law-enforcement professionals, proudly denouncing them as “fascists” before his closing food offensive. \n\nHe apparently objected to President Donald Trump’s intervention to fight DC crime.\n\nThe escapade won Dunn a felony charge that could bring a year behind bars — and, once higher-ups learned what he’d done, cost him his job.\n\nGood: It would be audacious enough if some civilian lunatic did something like that, but a federal employee — who works for the president, and at the nation’s top law-enforcement agency, no less?\n\nNo wonder Trump has sought to “drain the swamp.”\n\nSure, many federal workers are hard-working and carry out their jobs without bias.\n\nBut the rot runs deep: Studies have found support for Dems over GOPers running as high as 2-1 among the federal workforce, and far higher at certain agencies.\n\nPlus, Uncle Sam’s employees gave a whopping 84% of their donations last year to Kamala Harris, Government Executive found; 42% admitted plans to “resist” Trump, including 73% of Democratic managers, per the Napolitan Institute.\n\nSuch #Resistance clearly hobbled Trump during his first term, weighing him down with probes, impeachments, insider leaks, and all manner of “creative noncompliance” with his policies.\n\nIt’s outrageous.

His appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience in Oct. 2024 saw 800,000 people tune in within the first hour, according to CNN data analyst Harry Enten.\n\nJoe Rogan Experience / Via youtube.com\n\nCNN host Kate Bolduan also noted Wednesday the episode is “already on track to become one of the most watched podcasts of all time.”\n\nThestewartofny / Getty Images\n\nTrump will likely be pretty peeved about Swift mopping him up. The president expressed hostility towards the “Blank Space” singer after she publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the build-up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBig Event Media / Getty Images\n\n“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” he wrote in all caps on his Truth Social platform at the time.\n\nA real post from Trump’s Truth Social account: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” pic.twitter.com/nUJGu4Xavu— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) September 15, 2024\n\n@Phil_Lewis_/X/@realDonaldTrump/TruthSocial / Viax.com\n\nIn May, the president proved he was no Swiftie yet again when he published another post on Truth Social that read: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’”\n\n@realDonaldTrump/TruthSocial / Via truthsocial.com\n\nWe suppose that at least 1.3 million people think otherwise.\n\nBrooke Sutton / Getty Images\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.\n\nWe see you lurking 👀\nJoin a Taylor Swift conversation instead.\nSee the Discussions","summary":"It's doubtful the president is likely to shake it off....\n\nView Entire Post &rsaquo;","url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/elysewanshel1/taylor-swift-breaks-record-held-by-donald-trump","image":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2025-08/15/17/thumb/KF7s9qcD_.jpg?crop=1245:830;3,0&resize=1250:830&resize=1200:*","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 18:10:34","author":"Elyse Wanshel,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about","authors":["Elyse Wanshel","https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.482},{"id":351447522,"title":"Kamala Harris's Stepdaughter Vents: 'Everything Does Feel Horrible,' I'm Suffering from 'Climate Anxiety'","text":"Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris, said she feels “disgust” by what she is seeing in the world, letting her followers on TikTok know that she is experiencing “a lot of climate anxiety” as well.\n\nEmhoff shared an update on her life Thursday, months after her stepmother handily lost the presidential election against President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile she said she is doing good overall, Emhoff said she has been taking time to process and adapt to life without Secret Service. However, she said she feels “disgust” by what she is seeing in the world.\n\n“I feel disgust at what’s going on in the world around genocides, the loss of rights, the loss of health care, the just general fear that everyone has surrounding affordability, their lives, their livelihood, like everything,” she said. “It’s just it feels so big.”\n\nParticularly, Emhoff said she is very anxious about the state of the climate.\n\n“I think everything with the environment is really fucking getting to me. … I experienced a lot of climate anxiety, like a lot of us do,” she said, making it clear that it is “not funny.”\n\n“It’s one of those things that’s not funny, but you just like nervous laugh about it because it’s scary. It is. It’s all of these things are happening,” she said, telling her followers that “engaging in small politics is really important” and urging people to stay “loud.” She used New York City’s socialist mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, as a point of reference, asserting that his run has given people “hope” that they can get into politics “like that.”\n\n“And it’s really cool. So keep doing that. Keep making your voices loud. I think we’re just entering a time of craziness,” she continued, making it clear that she disagrees with Trump’s crackdown on crime in D.C., calling it “insane.”\n\n“I don’t think that we should normalize any of this. And being loud is — and I’m not saying anything new. People are saying this. Like, yes, I’m echoing what everyone is saying. Like, keep being loud, don’t let things be forgotten,” she continued.\n\n@smellaemhoffLittle check in :)♬ original sound – Ella Emhoff\n\nNotably, Emhoff said in June that she felt “trauma” voting in New York City’s mayoral primary, because it was the same polling station where she voted for her stepmom, who lost to Trump.\n\nHer update coincides with that of Hope Walz, the daughter of failed vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz — Harris’s running mate. She recently went on a rant about book recommendations, using Trump’s crackdown on crime and homelessness in D.C. as her point of inspiration.\n\n“Ok so on the topic of BookTok, as well as Trump’s bitch baby, wussy, scaredy cat behavior in D.C., it got me thinking of a book I read in college,” Hope Walz began, adding:\n\nI think it was when I was at the University of Minnesota. It was “Locking Up Our Own” by James Forman Jr., and it talks about what led to, arguably, you should also read “The New Jim Crow” and then go into this one, along with, like, a million in between. … You kind of get it. But like modern mass incarceration, of like black men, and it talks about D.C. and the war on drugs, and how all of that led up to what we’re now seeing.\n\nBoth of their remarks follow Trump’s action on Monday invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control, and activating the National Guard to combat crime in D.C.\n\nOn the topic of D.C. crime, former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund recently explained that it is essential to look at the bigger picture.\n\n“To see these gangs of youth kind of taking it [the Navy Yard] over, it doesn’t surprise me that they’re now going to pull these federal resources together and form… [a] task force,” he said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily.\n\nWATCH — Trump Invites Media on D.C. Police Ride-Alongs to See Crime Firsthand:\n\n“We did this in the early ’90s, when I was with D.C. police, we were able to drive down homicide rates. When Chief Lanier was chief, think about 2010 to 2014, we had a homicide rate that was maybe right around 100, 170 a year. Now 2023, you got 274 homicides. So you had a significant increase,” he said.\n\n“So when people talk about, ‘Oh, there’s big drop,’ there’s a drop from 2023 to 2024, but it’s still significant — double what we had in around 2010,” the former police chief said, emphasizing that the D.C. homicide rate is “five to six times that of any other major city in the United States.”","summary":"Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris, said she feels “disgust” by what she is seeing in the world, letting her followers on TikTok know that she is experiencing “a lot of climate anxiety” as well.\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris&#8217;s Stepdaughter Vents: &#8216;Everything Does Feel Horrible,&#8217; I&#8217;m Suffering from &#8216;Climate Anxiety&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/08/15/kamala-harris-stepdaughter-vents-everything-does-feel-horrible-im-suffering-from-climate-anxiety/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/08/AP24305059329519-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 17:40:48","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.174},{"id":351428176,"title":"Brittany Mahomes sends Taylor Swift a message over viral quote from Travis Kelce podcast appearance","text":"Taylor Swift and Brittany Mahomes' at times rocky friendship appears stronger than ever after the singer's New Heights podcast appearance this week.\n\nThis time last year, the brand new besties appeared to suddenly be at odds after Mahomes endorsed Donald Trump in the upcoming election while Swift, who has a long-running feud with Trump, backed Kamala Harris.\n\nBut earlier this week, as excitement reached fever pitch about Swift joining Travis and Jason Kelce on New Heights, Patrick Mahomes revealed the singer facetimed his wife after finishing recording the show.\n\nAnd her appearance clearly went down well with Brittany, who shared on Instagram what has become a viral quote from Swift when she said on the show: 'Think of your energy as if it's expensive, as if it's a luxury item. \n\n'Not everyone can afford it. Not everyone has invested in you in order to be able for you have the capital to care about this.'\n\nMahomes reposted the clip on Friday morning and wrote, with three applauding emojis: 'That. Is.

I was watching playoff games the entire day. She went to labor after one game,' Patrick Mahomes recalled in a clip of 'The Kingdom' which aired on the latest episode of 'Good Morning America.' \n\n'Baby was here before the next game, so I didn't even miss a playoff game.

On the flip side, Black Americans, who largely voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, are sitting back like “I told you so!” Now, The Root is taking a look at all the stories of Latinx folks who regret their decision… You may want to pop some popcorn for this!\n\nTrump Couple Allegedly Racially Profiled by Border Patrol \n\nGeorge and Esmeralda Doilez are U.S. citizens, who were on their way to a dentist appointment when they were pulled over by masked Boarder Patrol agents. We didn’t think we had anything to worry about,” Doilez told NBC San Diego. After a brief exchange, which was caught on video, officials ended up searching their car and accusing them of being undocumented. Interestingly, the Doilez couple voted for Trump in 2020 and in 2024. Now, Doilez regrets his vote. “He [Trump] lied to us about going after the worst of the worst,” he said. “He lied on those and he stole our vote.” Esmeralda added, “We can’t let them take our rights. Then we’re nothing.”\n\nTrump Supporter Detained by ICE\n\nThis man thought just because he is a U.S. citizen he wouldn’t have to worry about being profiled by ICE… *spoiler alert* He thought wrong. He and two other men were stopped, and even after he told agents he was a citizen, they didn’t believe him. Eventually, the man was let go, but he said he has no clue what happened to his two friends. “I vote for Trump last election because I thought it was gonna… just go against criminals, not every Hispanic,” he said. “They will assume we are all illegals.”\n\nMAGA Couple’s Son Gets Deported\n\nDébora Rey and her husband Martín Verdi voted for Trump in 2024, but now, they have to visit their son at a detention facility in Georgia after he was detained by ICE. The couple told the Atlanta Journal Constitution they liked Trump’s “get tough on undocumented immigrants” stance, but they didn’t think the president would go after their son, who holds a Green card.\n\nViral TikTok of Trump Supporter\n\n@cynsationall5 on TikTok is getting dragged after she came to the app to tell her followers that her own father has been deported… but here’s the kicker: she voted for Trump back in November. “Blindfolds were ripped off my eyes,” she said. “No one deserves to go through something like this behind bars,” she said while crying. As you can expect, no one had sympathy for her. \n\nBoxer Ryan Garcia Speaks After LA Raids\n\nMexican boxer Ryan Garcia made headlines last year when he shouted “Donald Trump 2024!” Months after endorsing the 47th president, it seems Garcia is having some regrets. He took to X shortly after ICE raids in Los Angeles, where he lives, to condemn the targeted attacks. “I may have voted for Trump, but I can’t stay silent about what’s happening with ICE in LA,” he wrote on X. “Ripping them away from their homes is not just policy, it’s pain. We can have borders without losing our humanity.”\n\nMAGA Cuban Rapper to Be Deported\n\nClearly, it doesn’t matter how many songs you sing for the president or if Secretary of State Marco Rubio likes your music… Cuban rapper El Funky was an avid Trump supporter leading up to his election, according to POLITICO. Now, he faces deportation after he was detained by ICE just last month. And surprise, surprise, Rubio– who once gave Funky a shoutout– is more than silent. \n\nMAGA Voter Crying Online\n\nThis Trump voter took to TikTok to share her fears about the 47th president. “This is so crazy that we voted for Trump. We trusted the words he promised us Latinos,” she said while crying. Now, after Trump promised mass deportations, she said she doesn’t know what to do. “I hate that I voted for him. Now, I’m so scared for my family.”\n\nVenezuelans Feel ‘Betrayed’ by Trump\n\nTrump recently rescinded the Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants, and in response, Venezuelans who voted for him feel like the president simply took advantage of them. Adelys Ferro, the director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told NPR he feels “beyond betrayed” by the administration. “They used us,” he said.\n\nPro-Trump Mother Left to Take Care of Kids Alone \n\nCuban mother and Trump voter, Liyian Páez, was devasted when her husband, Alían Méndez Aguilar, 28, was sent back to Cuba in April. She said she feels “betrayed” by Trump. Now, she’s left to take care of their two children, one of which is paraplegic. She also said in an interview with Univision she’s struggling to maintain her job and the household without her husband’s income.\n\nMAGA Voter on Medicaid in Danger\n\n View this post on Instagram \n\nIrma Arredondo was a Democrat since she became a U.S. citizen, but in the last election, she voted for Trump because of his pro-life stance. Now, the 64-year-old woman said Trump is “stabbing us in the back,” after his proposed cuts to Medicaid will directly impact her, her daughter with cerebral palsy and her sister with Turner’s Syndrome. Arredondo also has Type 1 Diabetes, and her entire household is on Medicaid. Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” act promises to cut Medicaid drastically. \n\n‘They Took My Wife’\n\nAn unidentified man expressed his regrets after his wife was one of three detained by ICE and deported.

María Elvira Salazar, a Trump supporter, said she’s “heartbroken” over the White House’s deportation mandate. “Arrests in immigration courts, including people with I-220A and pending asylum cases, the termination of the CHNV program, which has left thousands exposed to deportation, and other similar measures, all jeopardize our duty to due process that every democracy must guarantee,” she said. \n\nTrump Rally Goer Feels Regrets\n\nShe stood on stage during a Trump rally screaming “We Love Youuu!” Months later, this unidentified woman says she feels “beyond betrayed,” echoing sentiments from within the Latinx community. “They used us,” she continued. \n\n‘Latinas for Trump’ Co-Founder Cries Tears \n\nFla. Sen. Ileana Garcia had a message for the president after she– a longtime Republican and co-founder of “Latinas for Trump”– started feeling the weight of her vote. “As the state senator who represents her district and the daughter of Cuban refugees, who are now just as American, if not more so than Stephen Miller, I am deeply disappointed by these actions. And I will not stand down,” she said. \n\nLatinos for a Trump Economy\n\nA 61-year-old retired Dominican American told Alternet, “We voted for Trump and Trump betrayed us.” The man named Jose continued, “The truth is people voted for one thing: the economy. A good economy. And these tariffs are hiking everything up. … And he’s kicking out hard workers and not touching the people who don’t work, he’s leaving them. How does that make sense?”\n\nTrump-Sign-Holding Cuban Detained by ICE\n\nIn April, Héctor Luis Valdés Cocho was pictured holding up a Trump 2024 sign. Just months later, he was reportedly detained by ICE. It’s unclear what his current detention status is or exactly why he was arrested in the first place. But according to Snopes.com, which was able to verify his identity, Cocho is a journalist and Cuban activist who was forced into exile back in 2022.","summary":"From a woman on Medicaid to families being ripped apart after voting for Trump, the Latinx community is split as some voters are regretting their choice.\n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/even-more-latinx-trump-supporters-now-regretting-their-2000046005","image":"https://assets-server.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17141312/GettyImages-1284475995-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 17:07:47","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.451},{"id":351402346,"title":"Real reason The Late Show With Stephen Colbert was cancelled","text":"Stephen Colbert announced last month that CBS will be cancelling his late night talk show in May 2026, after 10 years on air. While Stephen and many celebrities shared their dismay over this news, fans were never given the real reason The Late Show was axed.\n\nDuring a taping on July 17, Stephen told a live audience: \"It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS…I'm not being replaced. This is all just going away.\"\n\nThe same day, Paramount Global and CBS released a joint statement saying that the decision was \"purely…financial against a challenging backdrop in late night\" and it was \"not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.\"\n\nAnd while Stephen remained cordial with CBS and even thanked them during his announcement, many of his colleagues, politicians, and fans of the show questioned the timing of the decision.\n\nThe cancellation announcement came just days after Stephen called out his parent company for their $16 million settlement with the White House over a 60 Minutes interview with the then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended,\" Stephen said in his opening monologue. He continued: \"Now I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It's a big, fat bribe.\"\n\nA few days after the announcement, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved an $8 billion deal, which merged Paramount Global with Skydance Media and placed government conditions on the network's news division.\n\nThe agreement will roll back Paramount's DEI efforts and make \"significant changes\" to the content CBS puts out.\n\nFCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat who voted against the merger, called the conditions laid out in the deal a \"never-before-seen form of government control over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment.\"\n\nAll of these incidents felt too suspicious for many Late Show fans. Senator Adam Schiff wrote to social media after the cancellation announcement: \"If Paramount and CBS ended The Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.\"\n\nBut, executives at Paramount insist the decision was not political. During a press conference after the decision, the network's Global CEO, George Cheeks, said The Late Show \"wasn't sustainable to continue,\" but that they are \"huge fans of Colbert\" and they \"love the show.\"\n\nThe Late Show originated in 1993 with the legendary host David Letterman.

Not everyone can afford it.\"Kelce's sense of humor about online content has helped Swift get to this point of relative nonchalance, she said.

The panel’s guests included Dan Krauss who served as the director of “Bodyguard of Lies,” and Craig Whitlock, the author of “The Afghanistan Papers,” which served as the inspiration for the documentary. “Bodyguard of Lies” retells the story of the systemic deception that was given to the American public. \n\n “The thing that’s most haunting about this conflict is you don’t get the sense that they’re going to learn the next time around and we’re doomed to repeat history,” Krauss said. “I would like to feel like this film and Craig’s reporting will make a difference.”\n\n Documentary Roundtable \n\n The Documentary Roundtable, hosted by Variety’s chief correspondent Daniel D’addario, included panelists such as R.J. Cutler (“Martha”), Bao Nguyen (“The Greatest Night in Pop,” “The Stringer”), Elegance Bratton (“Move Ya Body: The Birth of House”), Mary Robertson (“The Fall of Diddy”), Jennifer Tiexiera (“Rebecca,” “Speak’) and Dan Krauss (“Bodyguard of Lies”). The panel centered around the importance of truth seeking in documentary filmmaking.\n\n “We imagine before we start making it, but there’s no script. We have no idea what’s gonna happen. We also talk about the fact that we rely on surprises to make the films that we love the most,” Cutler said during the panel. When asked about what advice the documentary filmmakers would give to aspiring filmmakers, Tiexiera revealed what she learned from making her documentary. “It’s such a learning process, but in addition to that, I have to assume that I can’t do it all alone, and none of us really can. We’re not social workers [or] therapists — we’re filmmakers.”\n\n Conversation With Jake Tapper \n\n Jake Tapper sat down with Variety co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh to discuss CNN’s coverage of President Trump, noting that it’s not always easy to discern what the president truly means. “There is what Trump says publicly. There is what Trump posts on Truth Social. And then there is what Trump and his administration do. And those are three different things,” Tapper said. “I personally think what he does is the most important and what he posts on social media in the middle of the night is the least important.”\n\n The CNN anchor also criticized Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News over a “60 Minutes” segment, which was ultimately settled by Paramount Global with a $16 million payment to Trump. “I will say this proudly under the Paramount+ banner — that lawsuit was bullshit against ’60 Minutes,'” Tapper said. He added that “editing is done all the time” in television news and insisted there was “no bias” in how “60 Minutes” edited its interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n Political Groundbreakers Roundtable \n\n This year’s Political Groundbreakers Roundtable, hosted by Variety’s Brian Steinberg, highlighted the work of Yamiche Alcindor, Zeke Miller, Alex Thompson, Antonia Hylton and Annmarie Hordern, and featured a discussion on political reporting across media. \n\n As the digital media landscape changes in how viewers receive political updates, Hylton explained how to get the audience’s attention to become more informed about what is going on throughout America in this political climate. “We’re not just going to speed through this and quickly show you a graphic or whatever it is. We’re going to take some time to talk about it,” Hylton said. “I think people really start to feel that they better understand the connections between all the stuff that they’re inundated with every week when you give them a moment to do that.”\n\n Conversation With Ronny Chieng \n\n During a conversation with Variety’s Tatiana Siegel, “The Daily Show” senior correspondent Ronny Chieng explained how to blend satire in order to entertain and to inform audiences about the current state of the world. \n\n “We make sure it’s based on reality,” Chieng said. “We see what’s in the news and we pride ourselves on fact checking our jokes.” \n\n With a large platform, Chieng expressed the importance of knowing what the audience wants to hear. “Adding the responsibility is kind of the job of outside of the watchers and audience members and observers inside the show. Comedy’s just making fun of everybody, making fun of institutions. Just go for it. And people get upset. Some people don’t get upset. That’s not for us to figure out.”\n\n Conversation With “Have I Got News For You” \n\n Roy Wood Jr. and Amber Ruffin discussed the evolution of “Have I Got News For You” in a keynote conversation hosted by Asawin “Swin” Suebsaeng, senior political reporter of Rolling Stone. “Comedically you’re either reporting on what you feel or what you saw. I think we’re able to try, find a balance of that,” Wood said. “It’s very difficult, especially as we start transitioning to whatever entertainment’s gonna be in the next couple of years and figuring out how do you have a platform that criticizes people without bringing on the people that you’re criticizing, but without validating the people and the bullshit that they stand for and figuring out that we are balanced.”\n\n Conversation With “Room to Move” \n\n The documentary “Room to Move” follows choreographer and performer Jenn Freeman as she prepares her first solo, evening length work, “Is It Thursday Yet?,” while also receiving a later-in-life diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. “When all of this happens, it kind of crumbles and shatters the facade of what you thought was real and who you thought you were,” Freeman said. “I was inside of that, like, everything was falling down, it felt like, and I felt far away from dance at that moment in time, which is the thing that throughout my life has really grounded me and showed me who I am.”\n\n Fireside Chat With “Deaf President Now!” \n\n Moderated by Variety film reporter Rebecca Rubin, the Fireside Chat with “Deaf President Now!” featured Nyle DiMarco, who served as the film’s co-director and producer. “When I was growing up, I remember seeing so many deaf characters and any sort of reflection in the media of the deaf experience was just inauthentic,” DiMarco said of the beginning of the documentary’s production. “As a director, you have to swallow a big pill, which is that everything you do must be in service to a beautiful film. You have to sort of find these gems that you can polish and highlight their shine. I’m very, very relieved that the deaf community has given us such a warm reception and have been so excited.”\n\n The State of the Documentary Industry \n\n During a panel about the current state of documentary development, production and distribution, Variety‘s Brent Lang spoke with Dan O’Meara, EVP of nonfiction, Neon; Sylvia Bugg, chief programming executive and GM of general audience programming, PBS; Carrie Lozano, president and CEO, IT VS; Cara Cusumano, festival director and SVP programming, Tribeca; and Karol Martesko-Fenster, CEO and president, Abramorama. \n\n The group brought up why public media is crucial for documentaries, with Lozano saying, “This is why public media matters so much: because we’re not driven by money. We don’t have a profit motive. We’re mission-driven. And for those of us who’ve been making films — say, 25 years ago — today is much like it was 25 years ago. It’s always been hard because, at its core, so many of these films — they’re not really about profit. They’re not commercial in nature. And so, that moment where the nonprofit realities of these films met the commercial possibilities — I always felt like it was a bubble. It just didn’t seem like it could last. But public media is a place where, actually, you do get the largest audience for these types of films, and they’re accessible to people throughout the country.”\n\n Masters of True Crime and Investigative Storytelling \n\n A panel moderated by Rolling Stone’s Brenna Ehrlich focused on the true crime documentary works of Ben McKenzie (“Everyone Is Lying to You for Money”), Julia Willoughby Nason (“American Murder: Gabby Petito”), Joe Berlinger (“Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders,” “Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey”), Lisa Cortés (“Murder Has Two Faces”) and Shannon Evangelista (“The Curious Case of Natalia Grace”). The group discussed such topics as why they’re drawn to making true crime documentaries, how they choose which stories to tell, and the importance of handling those stories in a responsible manner. \n\n “This is somebody’s worst moment in their life that you wouldn’t wish on anybody,” Berlinger said. “So we need to be respectful.” \n\n (Pictured: Ronny Chieng)","summary":"At the 2025 Variety &#38; Rolling Stone Truth Seekers Summit presented by Paramount+, keynote conversations and panel discussions with documentary filmmakers, journalists and cultural trendsetters explored the art and nuances of documentary, investigative and political storytelling across multiple platforms.&#160; The summit took place on Aug. 14 in New York, where conversations hosted by Variety and [&#8230;]","url":"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/truth-seekers-summit-2025-takeaways-jake-tapper-ronny-chieng-1236490029/","image":"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2230123611.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 16:00:00","author":"Leia Mendoza","authors":["Leia Mendoza"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.446},{"id":351411676,"title":"Joe Concha challenges moderate Democrats to stand up to party","text":"“If you are [House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY)], you’re [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)], whoever’s not part of the far, far left in the party, and those numbers are dwindling in terms of who’s in the so-called ‘middle,’ will you stand up for your party?” Concha said. \n\nHe noted that only a few Democrats, such as Sen.

And that’s what the judge has done, explaining why, again, in a lengthy footnote.\n\n“[W]hen a court determines that a party is not entitled to one of these immunities as a matter of law, and the party claiming the immunity appeals, it is entitled to a stay pending the outcome of the appeal, provided that the claim of immunity is not frivolous,” the judge wrote. “Defendant argues that, because this immunity is akin to absolute and qualified immunity—i.e., that it is an ‘immunity from suit,’—he is entitled to a stay while he litigates his entitlement to that immunity on appeal.”\n\nBeetlestone determined that because “the text of the Anti-SLAPP statute itself suggests that the ‘essence’ of its immunity is indeed ‘a right not to stand trial'” and not merely an “immunity from liability,” Trump won the day.\n\n“These provisions collectively work to insulate immunity-claimants from the burdens of trial until such time as their entitlement to the immunity is conclusively decided,” the judge wrote, granting the stay pending appeal.\n\nAntron Brown, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Korey Wise and Yusef Salaam filed their defamation suit in October, saying that Trump — during a 2024 debate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris — had “falsely stated that Plaintiffs killed an individual and pled guilty to the crime.”\n\nIn 1989, the then-teenagers were wrongfully accused of raping Trisha Meili as she jogged in Central Park in New York City. The five were also accused of attacking two men that same night.\n\n“While in police custody, Plaintiffs were each separately subjected to hours of coercive interrogation, under duress, with no attorney present and often without a parent or guardian present,” the lawsuit recounted. “Plaintiffs all initially denied having any knowledge of the Central Park assaults. However, after hours of interrogation, four of the Plaintiffs agreed to provide written and videotaped statements in which they falsely admitted to having been present during the assaults.”\n\nThe Central Park Five faced trials, maintained their innocence, were convicted by juries in 1990 and were sent to prison, only to be exonerated decades later after the real attacker, Matias Reyes, admitted to the crime against Meili and DNA “conclusively” proved that Reyes was the “true perpetrator,” court documents said.\n\nNotably, the five did not plead guilty and were not accused of killing anyone — yet, during a nationally televised presidential debate with Harris in Pennsylvania last September, Trump said: “They admitted – they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.”\n\nThe remarks were a response to Harris’ statement that, throughout his life and career, Trump has “attempted to use race to divide the American people,” and that an example of this was the “full-page ad” he placed in the New York Times and elsewhere in 1989 “calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent — the Central Park Five — took out a full-page ad calling for their execution.”\n\nIn the ad at issue, Trump advocated for bringing back the death penalty and alluded to the Central Park Five case:\n\nMany New York families — White, Black, Hispanic and Asian — have had to give up the pleasure of a leisurely stroll in the Park at dusk, the Saturday visit to the playground with their families, the bike ride at dawn, or just sitting on their stoops — given them up as hostages to a world ruled by the law of the streets as roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods, dispensing their own vicious brand of twisted hatred on whomever they encounter. At what point did we cross the line from the fine and noble pursuit of genuine civil liberties to the reckless and dangerously permissive atmosphere which allows criminals of every age to beat and rape a helpless woman then laugh at her family’s anguish?\n\nThe ensuing lawsuit alleged that Trump engaged in “malicious, intentional and reckless conduct” and should be on the hook for punitive damages to “punish Defendant Trump for his conduct and deter him and others similarly situated from like acts in the future.”\n\nIn June, Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania’s anti-SLAPP statute “does not apply here, in federal court,” and that the defamation case could move forward as a result, but Trump’s lawyers with the Dhillon Law Group have since succeeded in arguing that their “not frivolous” immunity claim made a stay necessary and proper while the appeal is pending.\n\n“Without a stay, the damage will already be done as President Trump would have been subjected to the hardships involved in litigation for a matter for which he was immune from suit,” Trump’s motion said previously. “In this scenario, President Trump would have wholly lost the principal benefit of the immunity UPEPA was enacted to confer, and to which he was legally entitled. This constitutes irreparable harm.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris pictured during a segment of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge Halts Central Park 5&#8217;s Lawsuit Against Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-halts-central-park-5s-lawsuit-against-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Judge-slams-brakes-on-Central-Park-5s-lawsuit-against-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 15:44:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":351385768,"title":"Donald Trump's Popularity With Hispanics Plummets: Survey","text":"Donald Trump is facing a sharp decline in support among Hispanic voters, according to new polling.The latest Cygnal survey, conducted August 7–9 among 1,500 likely general election voters, shows Trump's favorability with Hispanics has dropped significantly over the summer. In April, 44 percent viewed him favorably and 51 percent unfavorably. By August, those numbers had shifted to 33 percent favorable and 65 percent unfavorable.Why It MattersSince at least the 1960s, Hispanic voters in the U.S. have generally supported Democratic candidates. For example, according to Pew Research Center, about 71 percent of Hispanic voters supported Barack Obama in 2012, and 66 percent backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, 63 percent chose Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.In 2024, however, Trump made significant gains. His support among Hispanic voters rose to 43 percent—an 8-point increase from 2020 and the highest level for a Republican presidential candidate since such data has been tracked. Meanwhile, 55 percent supported Kamala Harris, narrowing the Democratic advantage.Yet recent polling suggests Trump's momentum is fading.What To KnowTrump's standing with Hispanic voters has weakened over the summer, as new polling suggests economic pessimism is chipping away at one of his most promising demographic gains of 2024.In April, a Cygnal poll found Hispanics were among Trump's most optimistic supporters. Forty-four percent of Hispanics viewed him favorably — compared with just 21 percent of Black voters — and a majority of Hispanic men (54 percent) approved of his job performance.They were also the most positive group on the direction of the country, registering a 17-point net swing toward optimism since March. At the same time, congressional Republicans were improving their image with Hispanics, even as they lost ground among young and college-educated women.But that optimism has faded. In Cygnal's August poll, Trump's net image slipped slightly, with the decline driven in part by what the pollster described as \"softness\" among Hispanic voters. Twenty-six percent of Hispanics rated the U.S. economy as \"terrible\" — more than double the share of White voters (11 percent) and just behind Black voters (27 percent).And Hispanics were no longer the most optimistic about the country's direction, replaced by older men.The shift comes against a backdrop of mounting economic pressures.Inflation also rose to 2.7 percent in June. That is despite Trump's previous promise to end inflation on day one of his second term. \"Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods,\" he said during a rally in Bozeman, Montana, in August 2024.And job growth slowed sharply in July, with just 73,000 new jobs added—down from 147,000 the previous month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.And Hispanics could be hit especially hard by those pressures.Despite contributing more than 30 percent of U.S. GDP growth since 2019 and commanding an estimated $2.4 trillion in buying power, Hispanic households earn far less than the national average — about $65,500 in median income compared with $93,900 for White households, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. They also face higher rates of income instability, with 17 percent reporting hardship from fluctuating earnings, Federal Reserve data shows.Meanwhile, Hispanics are overrepresented in blue-collar, service, and construction jobs that are sensitive to inflation, high interest rates, and policy shifts.In 2025, immigration enforcement fears and rising costs for essentials have been linked to a pullback in Hispanic consumer spending, according to reports from the Financial Times.Throughout his second term, Trump has aggressively expanded immigration enforcement—launching mass deportation operations, increasing raids in sanctuary citiesand reviving thousands of old deportation cases.His administration has also dramatically scaled up detention capacity, allocating $45 billion to expand ICE facilities and construct large-scale temporary camps, including a facility in Florida nicknamed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"Pew Research polling from March showed that Hispanics are more worried than other U.S. adults about deportations, with 42 percent of Hispanic adults saying they worry that they or someone close to them could be deported.","summary":"Donald Trump's standing with Hispanic voters has weakened over the summer.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls-hispanics-2114093","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2703343/trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=306841ff6ef472108c34ee4afc3d4410","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 15:41:19","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":351361498,"title":"'Not welcome here': Staten Island activist arrested after confronting NYC mayoral candidate","text":"Activist Scott Lo Baido was arrested outside New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's anti-Trump event on Staten Island on Wednesday. A viral social media video revealed that Lo Baido told Mamdani, \"This is my f---ing island, you are not welcome here,\" as he was physically held back while approaching the candidate after the event at Istanbul Bay Authentic Mediterranean Restaurant on Staten Island. Lo Baido shouted profanities at Mamdani, telling the candidate that he hates Jews, cops and America. The protester, who shouted into a megaphone during the opening remarks of Mamdani's event, was later arrested by the New York Police Department (NYPD). In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Friday morning, Lo Baido confirmed his arrest and said, \"I suggest that somebody in every single borough every time this man shows his face to do what I did the other day.\" ‘GET OUT OF TOWN!’: STATEN ISLAND CROWD CONFRONTS ZOHRAN MAMDANI AT ANTI-TRUMP RALLY Lo Baido told his followers on X that he received three summonses upon arrest for sound without permit, disorderly conduct and foul language. \"Go back to where you came from. We don't want you on Staten Island,\" a protester wearing a \"Trump girl\" T-shirt and holding an American flag shouted at the 33-year-old self-described socialist as he exited the backdoor of the restaurant. MAMDANI TAKES AIM AT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN FIERY STATEN ISLAND SPEECH: 'WE ARE FIGHTING TO KEEP NYC A SANCTUARY CITY' Inside the event, as Mamdani kicked off his third anti-Trump event of the week, protesters outside the restaurant drowned out the introductory speeches with their cowbells, sirens and megaphones. Despite the heat in the crowded restaurant and his detractors outside, Mamdani maintained a smile throughout the event and told reporters, \"It saddens me to hear language of being told to go back to where I came from, and yet, it is not surprising because it is so much of what characterizes President Trump's politics.\" Mamdani was hosting his third \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" event of the week on Wednesday, reaffirming his commitment to protecting New Yorkers from Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration if he's elected mayor of New York City this November. \"I will not let it dissuade me from continuing to come to Staten Island, from continuing to speak to New Yorkers, no matter where they live, no matter what politics they have,\" Mamdani said in response to the protesters. \"Because I know that just as there are Republicans who feel that way, there are others who are sincere in their questions.\" Several protesters outside the restaurant told Fox News Digital that they planned to vote for Curtis Sliwa, CEO of the Guardian Angels, this November. \"He's the only one that could save our city,\" Ed, a Staten Islander carrying a large American flag, said. Ed told Fox News Digital that he wanted to give Mamdani \"a little surprise party\" and let the socialist candidate know that his values do not represent those of Staten Island. \"This is Trump country,\" said Manny, another protester and Wall Street retiree who said Mamdani's policies are \"anti-Wall Street.\" Trump won Staten Island by 30 points in the 2024 presidential election, according to The New York Times' data. Meanwhile, in neighboring Brooklyn, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the borough by 44 points. Tommy Banks, a native Staten Islander, said his message to Mamdani on Wednesday was simple. \"Get out of town.\" \"He wants to make everything free. He can't afford that. He's a socialist. He don't live that. We're not socialist,\" Banks said. Banks agreed with the other protesters outside the restaurant, telling Fox News Digital that \"nobody else\" could be mayor but Sliwa. \"He's a true New Yorker. He's been fighting for New York all his life. Give him a chance to get in there,\" Banks said. Another protester, Liz, shouted, \"Mamdani's a commie!\" as the Democratic nominee departed in his SUV. Liz said she doesn't like Mamdani because \"he's not a Democrat, he's a communist.\" She said Mamdani is trying to tempt New Yorkers with campaign promises like free childcare, free bus fare and government-run grocery stores, but Liz said it would be a \"disaster\" if he became mayor. When Mamdani declared victory in the Democratic primary, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, called Mamdani a \"snake-oil salesman\" who would \"say and do anything to get elected.\" Trump has often criticized Mamdani and his policies, calling him a \"100% communist lunatic.\" Staten Islanders who spoke to Fox News Digital outside Mamdani's anti-Trump event on Wednesday seemed to agree with those sentiments, calling him a \"commie\" and criticizing his policies, which include freezing the rent, raising corporate taxes and increasing the minimum wage. However, Shahana Masum, who sported a \"Zohran for Staten Island\" sticker on her purse and attended the event, told Fox News Digital that Mamdani is the person who is representing \"me and my community.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Masum said she has also been told to go back to her country. To that, she said, \"You didn't go back to your country, and I came here with dignity and with my visa, so don't tell me to leave.\" Fox News’ Bryan Llenas and Marly Carroll contributed to this report.","summary":"Protesters disrupted Zohran Mamdani&apos;s Staten Island campaign event with megaphones and profanities, leading to activist Scott Lo Baido&apos;s arrest by the NYPD.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/not-welcome-here-staten-island-activist-arrested-after-confronting-nyc-mayoral-candidate","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/zohran-mamdani-nyc-july-30-2025.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376953030112","publish_date":"2025-08-15 14:21:38","author":"Deirdre Heavey","authors":["Deirdre Heavey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":351363398,"title":"Mutiny at JD Vance's dinner date: Woke staff at Cotswolds gastro-pub threatened to walk out if US vice president attended - prompting a hasty venue switch","text":"US vice president JD Vance is understood to have been forced to cancel a dinner reservation at a trendy Cotswolds gastro-pub after woke staff threatened to walk out if he showed up.\n\nVance's family holiday with his wife, Usha Chilukuri, 39, and their three children, has sparked controversy this week with locals claiming their lives were 'made hell' by multiple car police convoys and buzzing helicopters.\n\nEven Jeremy Clarkson complained about the US politician's weeklong stay in the village of Dean near Charlbury in Oxford, saying the over-the-top security had affected filming for his show.\n\nNow it has emerged that the fashionable Bull pub – which last month did entertain former US presidential Democrat candidate Kamala Harris – had to cancel a reservation Vance made because staff refused to serve him.\n\nThe suggestion that woke staff had refused to wait on the right-wing Republican swept local communities earlier this week - before last night being run by gossip site Popbitch last night and today being picked up by publications around the world, including Yahoo News and The Daily Beast.\n\nThe pub has doggedly declined to comment in response to media queries to confirm or deny that they had cancelled the VP's planned dinner.\n\nRichard Fairhurst, who runs the local Charlbury community blog, told The Daily Mail today: 'It's very widely believed locally [that staff refused to serve Vance] but The Bull are keeping schtum.'\n\nAnother local, Clare Shakya, told us today: 'I am told by a reliable source that Bull staff did indeed object to JD Vance's visit. And their regulars have been backing them for it.'\n\nThe showbiz blog Popbitch stated: 'The mutinous staff all said they wouldn't come to work if they had to serve Vance and his wife. Facing staff grumbles and a barrage of negative press attention The Bull refused his patronage.'\n\nThe pub does offer private dining for up to 28 guests in the 'secret garden room', and Vance is thought to have earmarked this so he could get away from protestors angry at his stay in the Cotswolds.\n\nThere are links between the country manor where Mr Vance has been staying all week and the Bull pub.\n\nThe Bull is owned by the Bull Charlbury limited, a company who has three directors, one of whom is James Selwyn Gummer.\n\nHis father, Tory peer Peter Selwyn Gummer, aka Lord Chadlington, of Dean, until recently owned Dean Manor - the very country house where Mr Vance has been staying all week.\n\nLord Chadlington recently sold Dean Manor to Pippa and Johnny Hornby, also friends of David and Samantha Cameron, who rented the manor to Mr Vance.\n\nFollowing news of Vance's rejection from The Bull, the pub's Facebook page was flooded with comments by people both welcoming and condemning the decision.\n\nOne said:' Thank you for standing up against fascism, corruption and evil.'\n\nAnother added:' Your staff have excellent values and stood up to a bully an abominable excuse for a human being! We will visit and eat with you asap. Best wishes and treasure your staff.'\n\nHowever, one American replied: 'Glad we broke away from you [sic] worthless country. You are only relevant now because of the United States – you'd all be speaking German if it weren't for us.\n\n'Our country became everything you Brits wanted to be; it took us far less time to do it.'\n\nMeanwhile, it emerged today that the suggestion of The Bull as a dinner venue may have originally been made to Vance by former Chancellor George Osborne\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Osborne had organised much of the VP's Cotswolds itinerary after his old boss, David Cameron, who lives nearby, was contacted for advice on where to go - and he delegated the job.\n\n'George did it all,' one source informed the FT. Another source added: 'David came up with a few ideas, but George did the rest.'\n\nMr Vance and Mr Osborne are friends, with the latter revealing the cross-Atlantic bond on his Political Currency podcast last year.\n\n'He's actually a friend of mine,' said Mr Osborne. 'He was an admirer of the Cameron government and what it had done.'\n\nWhen Vance arrived at his rented farmhouse in the hamlet of Dean, he was greeted with signs telling him to 'go home' and 'you are not welcome', and after staying for a week, he has now left for Scotland, but locals say he is expected back.\n\nThe Bull was named pub of the year by the National Pub and Bar Awards.\n\nThe pub, which dates back to the 16th Century, gets top reviews on and in The Good Food Guide and the staff are described as 'clued up, as well as boundlessly helpful'...unless, it seems, you happen to be the US Vice President.\n\nRenowned for its locally sourced meats and trademark £26 Bull Pie, the pub also offers lip-smacking £98 sirloin steaks, while bar snacks include £120 sweetcorn fritters and £6 pork pies.\n\nA bottle of Blanc de Noirs French champagne costs £100, while a more patriotic Sussex Nutty Vintage Brut is £70, and as you are asking, the most expensive drink on offer is a 1997 Vintage port at £20 a glass or £195 for the bottle.\n\nThe Michelin Guide gives The Bull a 'bib gourmand', saying the venue is of 'good quality with good value food' adding that 'dining here is a hearty, satisfying experience'.\n\nThe Bull would only say:' We have nothing to say.","summary":"Vance's family holiday with his wife, Usha Chilukuri, 39. and their three children, has sparked

democracy” — the latest theme of the left — can be defined in many different ways.\n\nHow about attempting to destroy constitutional, ancient, and hallowed institutions simply to suit short-term political gains?\n\nSo, who in 2020, and now once again, has boasted about packing the 156-year-old, nine-justice Supreme Court?\n\nWho talks frequently about destroying the 187-year-old Senate filibuster — though only when they hold a Senate majority?\n\nWho wants to bring in an insolvent left-wing Puerto Rico and redefine the 235-year-old District of Columbia — by altering the Constitution — as two new states solely to obtain four additional liberal senators?\n\nWho is trying to destroy the constitutionally mandated 235-year Electoral College by circumventing it with the surrogate “The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact?”\n\nDoes destroying democracy also entail weaponizing federal bureaucracies, turning them into rogue partisan arms of a president?\n\nSo who ordered the CIA to concoct bogus charges of “collusion” to sabotage Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, the 2016-2017 transition, and the first 22 months of Trump’s first term?\n\nWho prompted a cabal of “51 former intelligence officials” to lie to the American people on the eve of the last debate of the 2020 election that the FBI-authenticated Hunter Biden laptop was instead the work of a “Russian intelligence operation?”\n\nWho ordered the FBI to connive and partner with social media conglomerates to censor accurate news deemed unhelpful to the 2020 Biden campaign?\n\nWho pulled off the greatest presidential coup in history by using surrogates in the shadows to run the cognitively debilitated Biden presidency, then by fiat canceled his reelection effort, and finally anointed as his replacement the new nominee Kamala Harris, who had never won a single primary delegate?\n\nWho ordered FBI SWAT teams to invade the home of a former president because of a classification dispute over 102 files out of some 13,000 stored there?\n\nWho tried to remove an ex-president and leader of his party from at least 25 state ballots to deprive millions of Americans of the opportunity to vote for or against him?\n\nWho coordinated four local, state, and federal prosecutors to destroy a former and future president by charging him with fantasy crimes that were never before, and will never again be, lodged against anyone else?\n\nWho appointed a federal prosecutor to go after the ex-president, who arranged for a high-ranking Justice Department official to step down to join a New York prosecutor’s efforts to destroy an ex-president, and who met in the White House with a Georgia county prosecutor seeking to destroy an ex-president — all on the same day — a mere 72 hours after Trump announced his 2024 reelection bid?\n\nWho but the current Democrats ever impeached a president twice?\n\nHas any party ever tried an ex-president in the Senate when he was out of office and a mere private citizen?\n\nWhen have there ever been two near-miss assassination attempts on a major party presidential candidate during a single presidential campaign?\n\nWho destroyed the southern border and broke federal law to allow in, without criminal or health background audits, some 10-12 million illegal aliens?\n\nWho created 600 “sanctuary jurisdictions” for the sole purpose of nullifying federal immigration law, in the eerie spirit of the renegade old Confederacy?\n\nWho allowed tens of thousands of rioters, arsonists, and violent protestors over four months in 2020 to destroy over $2 billion in property, kill some 35 people, injure 1,500 police officers, and torch a federal courthouse, a police precinct, and a historic church — all with de facto legal impunity? (RELATED: Police Say Arsonist Attacked Governor’s Residence, Set Mansion On Fire While Family Slept Inside)\n\nHow do the purported destroyers of democracy find themselves winning 60-70 percent approval on most of the key issues of our times, while the supposed saviors of democracy are on the losing side of popular opinion?\n\nHow does a president “destroy democracy” by his party winning the White House by both the popular and Electoral College vote, winning majorities in both the Senate and House by popular votes, and enjoying a 6-3 edge in the Supreme Court through judges appointed by popularly elected presidents?\n\nSo what is behind these absurd charges?\n\nThree catalysts: one, the new anguished elitist Democratic Party alienated the middle classes through its Jacobin agenda and therefore lost the Congress, the presidency, and the Supreme Court, and now has no federal political power.\n\nTwo, the Democratic Party is polling at record lows and yet remains hellbent on alienating the traditional sources of its power — minorities, youth, and Independents.\n\nThree, Democrats cannot find any issues that the people support, nor any leaders to convince the people to embrace them.\n\nSo it is no surprise that the panicked Democrats bark at the shadows — given that they know their revolutionary, neo-socialist agenda is destroying them. And yet, like all addicts, they choose destruction over abandoning their self-destructive fixations.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.

And would that possibly entail getting rid of Gayle King, the program’s most recognizable face?\n\nWell, with Ellison and his senior leadership looking to slice off $2 billion in costs from the new company, and the 70-year-old King making at least $10 million annually on a contract that ends in May, it seems more and more like a possibility, if not a probability.\n\n“There’s always speculation about her inflated salary and entourage,” a network insider said of King. “She’s undoubtedly expensive and not necessarily on the right side of the new political agenda.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to representatives for Paramount, Gayle King and CBS News for comment.\n\nBased on data from Nielsen Research, the CBS morning show is averaging 1.813 million daily total viewers year to date, through August 12. This marks a 10 percent drop compared to the same period in 2024, and places them well behind NBC’s TODAY (2.405 million) and ABC’s Good Morning America (2.498 million).\n\nThe year-over-year plummet is even worse for the show in the key advertising demographic of viewers aged 25 to 54, where CBS Mornings viewership has sunk to 315,000 daily viewers for the year. This is down 19 percent compared to last year and far behind GMA (426,000) and TODAY (543,000). \n\nThe drop also accounts for the one-day bump that the show received from King’s much-hyped trip – alongside Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez – aboard Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spacecraft for a brief trip above Earth’s atmosphere. That April broadcast brought in 3.9 million viewers, rocketing past ABC and NBC while marking the show’s best performance in four years. \n\nThe viewership for the CBS show, which also features co-hosts Nate Burleson and Tony Dokoupil alongside King, has sunk to such a level that it is nearly getting passed by a cable news morning program. With Fox News seeing a ratings surge this year following Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Fox & Friends is up 24 percent in total viewership (1.602 million) and 17 percent in the key demographic (17 percent) year to date. \n\n“There is serious concern about the ratings slide at [CBS] Mornings,” one network source told The Independent. “In particular, they’ve seen major drops in women.”\n\nBased on an AI-generated study reviewed by The Independent, the network shared with staffers last month that CBS Mornings was perceived as having more “distressing” and “controversial” content than its broadcast rivals, while also having the least “happy” and “celebratory” programming.\n\n“There has been a marked shift in the last few weeks to fluffier stories,” the network source added, noting that Thursday morning included a lengthy segment about Taylor Swift’s new album announcement on boyfriend Travis Kelce’s podcast.\n\nAnother staffer said that the network “wants to do more light stuff” and “less dark/hard news” during the morning. Notably, last fall, CBS Mornings came under fire – and Dokoupil was reprimanded by then-news chief Wendy McMahon – following an interview in which the anchor compared celebrated author Ta-Nehisi Coates to an “extremist” over his position on Gaza. Meanwhile, former Paramount chair Shari Redstone – a well-known supporter of pro-Israeli causes – backed Dokoupil’s pointed questioning of Coates.\n\nWhile CBS has generally been an also-ran in the broadcast morning show wars, the Paramount-Skydance merger and much of the fallout surrounding it have sparked increasing public speculation that King could soon find herself on the chopping block and the program finding itself overhauled.\n\nDays before Skydance officially took over Paramount, the New York Post breathlessly reported that King’s future at the network was “murky” because the ratings for her “woke” morning show had tanked, all while the soon-to-be new owners vowed to the Trump administration to “scrap left-wing bias.”\n\n“The ‘CBS Mornings’ co-host, one of the fading Tiffany Network’s few remaining stars, is part of a culture that has ‘dug in’ against attempts by higher-ups to move away from polarizing coverage, according to sources with knowledge of the situation,” the Post noted, adding that the show’s executive producer Shawna Thomas “set a programming ‘agenda’ that has alienated traditional morning show viewers.”\n\nThat followed a previous New York Post story from May that noted that King’s 13-year career at the network “could finally be coming to an end” after she signed a one-year extension to her contract. \n\nOne network insider, however, told The Independent that the Post article seemed to “come out of nowhere since Gayle is the biggest star.” \n\nIt didn’t take long for the media-obsessed Trump to seize on the story, sharing it on his Truth Social site while taking a personal shot at King. “Gayle King’s career is over. She should have stayed with her belief in TRUMP. She never had the courage to do so. No talent, no ratings, no strength!!!” Trump blared.\n\nOf course, the Post story and Trump’s amplification of it don’t come in a bubble. Following Trump’s election, Paramount’s former chief shareholder Redstone – who desperately needed the merger to be approved so she could clear roughly $2 billion – pushed for the company to settle Trump’s “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nThe negotiations to settle the suit, which led to accusations of “bribery” due to the pending merger needing the administration’s approval, resulted in several senior news leaders resigning in protest. Following the $16 million payoff to Trump, the old Paramount then announced that it was canceling Trump critic Stephen Colbert’s late-night show, prompting critics – some within the network itself – to allege the move was politically motivated.\n\nMeanwhile, in the days before the administration finally approved the merger, Skydance promised the Federal Communications Commission that it would install an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias” at CBS News and eliminate all diversity policies at the company. \n\nFurthermore, Trump has claimed that on top of the pre-merger settlement from Paramount, he’d reached a secret side deal with Ellison – whose father is Oracle founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison – for $20 million of pro-Trump PSAs to be aired on CBS once the Skydance deal was finalized. (Ellison has repeatedly sidestepped questions about Trump’s claim.)\n\nSince last week’s merger completion, though, Ellison and his senior executives have gone out of their way to say they don’t want to “politicize anything” surrounding the company or place their thumbs on the scales of CBS News. “He said all the right things and more,” one CBS News staffer told The Independent after Ellison visited the newsroom right after the merger closed.\n\nInstead, it would seem their north star is the same as most major media companies these days – maximize profits while reducing costs. This has seen Ellison make wildly ambitious moves early on, even as Paramount’s new executive leadership has warned there will be “painful” layoffs coming down the pike soon.\n\nDays after Skydance closed on the deal, Paramount announced that it had secured the rights to air UFC events with a massive seven-year, $7.7 billion agreement. This came on the heels of Paramount agreeing to pay the creators of South Park $1.5 billion to continue airing the raunchy hit show’s content for five more years.\n\nWith Ellison also hyping that the studio will be committed to big-budget movies in the near future, such as another Star Trek film and Top Gun 3, it seems increasingly likely that Paramount’s new tech-friendly leadership is going to look towards its linear networks to bear the brunt of the cuts. Especially since Paramount President Jeff Shell recently explained that, unlike other media conglomerates, they won’t be spinning off their cable assets.\n\n“We have less of our economics of the company on cable because they decline so much,” Shell said this week at a media event, suggesting that Paramount will be utilizing brands such as BET, MTV and Comedy Central to be “building blocks” of the company’s streaming strategy.\n\nThat all harks back to CBS Mornings and how the recent ratings drop could potentially lead to significant changes that could include saying goodbye to King.\n\n“We do not want to be a company that has layoffs every quarter,” Shell said this week. “So, it’s going to be painful. It’s always hard, but we don’t want to be a company that every quarter is laying people off… So, it is important for us to get done what we’re doing in one big thing and then be done with it.”\n\nNetwork sources also noted that most people on the program, as well as CBS Evening News, are now waiting for Tom Cibrowski – the ABC News veteran who was brought in as president and executive editor of CBS News this past spring – to make changes to both shows now that the Paramount merger has been finalized.\n\nWhile the morning show has always been profitable for the network, those ad revenues have been decreasing this year due to the falling ratings – though sources tell The Independent that CBS Mornings is still turning a profit. Still, King’s reported $10+ million annual salary would be an easy ledger item to cross off if the network decided not to renew her.\n\nIn fact, amid the shrinking advertising dollars for broadcast and cable television as streaming has boomed, networks have increasingly parted ways with high-profile veteran broadcasters rather than continue to pay their exorbitant salaries. TODAY’s Hoda Kotb, who was making $20 million a year, decided to step down last year after NBC asked her to take a pay cut.\n\n“NBC executives loved Hoda and knew her value to the brand, but also made clear to her agents that such stratospheric contracts were no longer justifiable given the industry’s inexorable decline,” due in part to the steep ratings decline affecting ‘Today’ and competitors like ‘Good Morning America,’” Puck reported at the time.\n\nOn top of that, Paramount is also crossing off not just Colbert’s $15 million salary after The Late Show signs off for good in May, but also the program’s roughly 200 employees and high production costs. Though the program remained the top-rated broadcast late-night show, the overall drop in broadcast viewers and dwindling ad revenues for late-night television resulted in the show losing $40 million a year.\n\n“Late-night has a huge problem right now,” Shell said this week. “The problem is that 80 percent of the viewership and growing is on YouTube.”\n\nIn the end, though, sources at the network stressed that while King may also be viewed by many within the organization as being increasingly “out of touch with the average viewer” due to her close friendship with Oprah Winfrey and luxurious lifestyle, there still isn’t any definitive answer on her fate at this time.\n\n“It’s just speculation at this point,” a CBS staffer noted.","summary":"Exclusive: ‘There’s always speculation about her inflated salary and entourage,’ one network insider told Justin Baragona about Gayle King. ‘She’s undoubtedly expensive and not necessarily on the right side of the new political agenda.’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/with-cbs-mornings-ratings-continuing-to-shrink-could-gayle-king-be-in-trouble-b2808399.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/02/23/67th_Annual_Grammy_Awards_-_Arrivals_70386.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xVhuH5yU-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-15 14:02:06","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":351476700,"title":"Body for body, gun for gun: How the US Secret Service planned for the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska","text":"The call to Beau Disbrow was unlike any the Anchorage realtor had ever received. His short-term rentals typically house tourists bound for glaciers, or business travellers passing through. This time, the request came from the US Secret Service.“Most of my short-term rentals were booked, but I did manage to put some of them into one home,” he said.It was not the last inquiry connected to the highly anticipated summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin set for Friday. Soon after the Secret Service call, the Russian consulate in New York phoned Disbrow with the same request. With no vacancies left, he referred the officials to a friend with furnished homes sitting empty.When Trump announced the Alaska meeting a week ago, the lone agent assigned to the Secret Service’s post in the Last Frontier began preparing to host hundreds of reinforcements in the days ahead. The agency’s mission was unusually complex: to protect both the American and Russian presidents at the same site, each surrounded by a heavily armed security detail..HurdlesFour people familiar with the planning said the operation became an all-out sprint, compressed into a single week. Because the meeting is on American soil, the Secret Service can move weapons, communications equipment and medical gear without foreign restrictions. But the geography presents its own hurdles..Trump and Putin will meet at Alaska military base long used to counter Russia.Anchorage has limited hotel rooms and a small rental-car market, so vehicles and other assets are being flown in or driven from other parts of the state. Motorcade SUVs are arriving from the lower 48 on cargo planes.The summit will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska’s largest military installation. A Cold War listening post less than 1,600km from Russia, the base offers controlled airspace, fortified gates and instant access to military units - and, as an active base, is closed to the public.“We’re in the height of tourist season, so hotels are tight, cars are tight,” Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy said on Bloomberg Television on Thursday. “Having this on the base alleviates a lot of issues.” While Anchorage has played host to the Pope and to former President Ronald Reagan in years past, the summit is “one of the biggest things to happen” in the city, said Dunleavy, a Republican..State Department protocolState Department protocol is shaping much of the plan. In a bilateral meeting, officials said, reciprocity rules mean every courtesy extended to one leader must be matched for the other. Russian security will control Putin’s immediate movements while the Secret Service maintains an outer ring. .Trump-Putin meeting: Did Alaska belong to Russia?.Neither side will open the other’s doors or ride in the other’s vehicles. If 10 US agents are posted outside a meeting room, 10 Russian agents will stand on the other side. Everything is matched body for body, gun for gun, one person said.That symmetry will extend from the arrival motorcade to the placement of translators in the room. Both sides will bring their own language teams. Even the number and size of hold rooms - secure waiting areas for each leader - are being negotiated. The Secret Service is still waiting for Russia to formally approve the full security plan, the people said.“The safety of the President is our highest priority,” the Secret Service said in a statement. “In order to maintain operational security, the Secret Service does not discuss the specific means and methods used to conduct our protective operations.” The Alaska deployment lands with the agency also protecting Vice-President JD Vance in the United Kingdom, preparing for the United Nations General Assembly in New York next month and providing protection for former presidents Barack Obama, Joe Biden and George W. Bush and for former Vice-President Kamala Harris. Twenty agents and officers have also been assigned this week to support Trump’s federal takeover of the DC police department..Agents in AnchorageNow, hundreds of agents have descended on Anchorage. Downtown hotels are full. Rental car lots have been cleared for convoys. Agents in suits and earpieces are posted at intersections while others, in plain clothes, blend into coffee shops and parking garages. Alaska state troopers and local police are folded into motorcade routes that have been mapped down to the turn lane. Every movement of both leaders’ vehicles is being choreographed to keep them apart while ensuring each is fully protected.Trump has described the “feel-out” meeting as an effort toward ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, suggesting a territorial swap could be part of a deal. Putin has sought to strengthen his rapport with Trump ahead of their summit, praising the US leader’s efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine and dangling the promise of economic cooperation as well as a new arms control treaty.","summary":"","url":"https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/body-for-body-gun-for-gun-how-the-us-secret-service-planned-for-the-trump-putin-summit-in-alaska-1.500234616","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2025-08-14/3cias1ma/newsml_afp_com_20250814T175700Z_doc_69kh69f.jpeg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 14:00:48","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ae","sentiment":0.089},{"id":351358096,"title":"Joe Biden vs. Kamala Harris? Expert predicts explosive clash after her new book drops","text":"Global Desk\n\nA political storm may be building in the Democratic Party, with one presidential expert cautioning of an “explosive clash” between President Joe Biden and his former vice president, Kamala Harris. The prediction comes amid anticipation grows surrounding Harris’s forthcoming memoir, 107 Days, which is expected to chronicle her 2024 presidential run and her complicated relationship with Biden’s closest confidants.From Partnership to Potential RivalryFor years, Biden and Harris showed unity standing together through a challenging presidency highlighted by pandemic recovery, foreign crises, and deeply divided political climate at home. Yet political watchers suggest that bonds may now be fraying. According to insider reports, Harris’s book could include candid assessments of Biden’s leadership pattern, decision-making, and campaign direction, painting a less-than-flattering picture of the president.Presidential historian Leon Wagener issued caution: “If Harris names names and Biden’s team feels cornered, this could escalate quickly into all-out political warfare.” Such remarks hint that Biden’s allies are signalling to respond forcefully if the memoir ignites public criticism.The Stakes for Both SidesBiden’s allies are reportedly protective of his legacy, mainly following his withdrawal from the 2024 race after the wake of a lackluster debate performance. For them, any suggestion that the president faltered in his roles could tarnish his historical image.Harris, meanwhile, faces her own political crossroads. Though she retains influence within the party, her national approval ratings have been uneven, and questions about her readiness for higher office have persisted. A revealing memoir could help her reclaim control of her public narrative but it could also widen the existing rifts within the party.Live EventsAll Eyes on 107 DaysWith the release of Harris’s book launch nears, curiosity about its contents is intensifying. Will it be an honest, behind-the-scenes account focused on transparency? Or will it be a political manifesto, setting the stage for her next scenario in public life? The tone and substance of its pages determine whether the weeks ahead bring only a brief flare-up or ignite a drawn-out feud within the party.What is undeniable is that: the alliance between Biden and Harris once held up as a model of Democratic solidarity is on the brink of one of its most toughest trials yet.FAQs:Q1.
