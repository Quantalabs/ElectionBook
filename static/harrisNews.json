Federal agents, he said, are “sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”\n\nThe Minnesota Star Tribune identified the woman as 37-year old Renee Nicole Good. Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the outlet that her daughter was “loving, forgiving and affectionate” and that she was “probably terrified” during the encounter.\n\nThe incident, coming on the heels of the Trump administration's expanded immigration operations in blue states and cities, immediately became politicized. After watching video of the encounter, President Donald Trump claimed the woman who was shot “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” He also said it was “hard to believe” that the ICE agent is alive and added that he is recovering at a hospital.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Wednesday evening news conference that the woman was \"blocking\" officers who were attempting to dislodge their vehicle from the snow.\n\n \"ICE agents repeatedly ordered her to get out of the car and to stop obstructing law enforcement. But she refused to obey their commands,\" Noem said. \"She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.\"\n\nNoem said the ICE officer, \"fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public,\" fired shots defensively.\n\nNoem said the officer had been released from the hospital and was with family. \"Any loss of life is a tragedy…all of us agree in this situation, it was preventable,\" she said.\n\nThe incident, coming on the heels of the Trump administration's expanded immigration operations in blue states and cities, immediately became politicized. \n\nDemocrats, however — including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, with whom Noem said she spoke — questioned Trump and Noem's accounting of the events. Walz warned in his own press conference that Trump \"would make this about me\" and that the shooting was \"so, so preventable\" and \"so unnecessary.\"\n\nWalz called on Minnesotans to remain calm and said he is prepared to activate the National Guard if needed. Police Chief Brian O’Hara told Minneapolis his officers last month to intervene if they see ICE agents using excessive force against residents or risk losing their jobs.\n\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said officers were “conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism.”\n\nMcLaughlin said the officer feared for his life and “the safety of the public.”\n\n“He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,” she said. “The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.”\n\nAnd Stephen Miller, a senior presidential aide and architect of Trump's mass deportation strategy, called video he posted of the incident \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nLocal Minneapolis officials, however, feel differently.\n\nAccording to Frey's office, Minneapolis police officers responded to the reports of shots fired \"just after 9:30 a.m., and found a woman with life-threatening gunshot wounds. Minneapolis firefighters removed the woman from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond.\" She was transported to a local hospital, where she eventually died.\n\nFrey accused the Trump administration of trying to “spin this as an action of self-defense.”\n\n“Having seen the video … myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bullshit,” the mayor said. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., was similarly skeptical.\n\n\"There is no evidence that has been presented to justify this killing. [DHS] Secretary Kristi Noem is a stone-cold liar and has zero credibility. The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law for acting with depraved indifference to human life,\" Jeffries said.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris called the incident \"shocking,\" and said the video \"makes it clear that the Trump administration's explanation of this shooting is pure gaslighting.\"\n\nO’Hara said the woman was not the target of the law enforcement investigation, was unarmed and was shot in the head.\n\nBystander video verified by MS NOW clearly contradicts key parts of Trump’s description. It shows the car partially blocking a two-lane street in a snowy residential neighborhood.\n\nThe footage, which begins moments before the shooting, shows a handful of people milling about, filming the agents as they walk around and toward the vehicle. Whistles — a tactic used by “ICE observers” to warn people that agents are in the area — can be heard.\n\nOne of the officers puts his hand on the driver’s door handle and loudly repeats, “Get out of the car!”\n\nThe car briefly moves in reverse, then starts to drive off when three gunshots ring out, and the car crashes into a parked vehicle. The officer who fired his gun was standing in the street in the direction the car was facing.\n\nThe agent holding the door handle stumbles but stays on his feet as the car drives off. None of the other officers comes in contact with the car, and none appears significantly injured, if at all.\n\nSeveral people at the scene are heard yelling expletives right after the shots were fired.\n\nResidents who spoke to MS NOW at the scene said they saw what appeared to be blood on the deployed airbag on the driver’s side.\n\nShortly after the shooting, residents gathered around federal agents in vehicles, shouting at them and calling the location a crime scene.\n\nThe Trump administration launched a massive immigration enforcement operation in the Minneapolis area this week, deploying approximately 2,000 federal agents to the state.\n\nFederal law enforcement officials have been sent to other Democratic-led cities over the past year, sparking fierce criticism from local lawmakers.\n\nIn October, a federal agent shot a woman five times during an immigration crackdown in Chicago in what the administration similarly characterized as a defensive act. Federal prosecutors brought assault charges against her, but moved to dismiss them after the agent’s text messages bragging about the shooting were presented in court.\n\nAt the news conference, Frey addressed the federal immigration enforcement agency directly.\n\n“I have a message for ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here,” he said. \n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/federal-law-enforcement-agents-involved-in-shooting-in-minneapolis","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767813543/260107-minneapolis-ICE-zz-01/260107-minneapolis-ICE-zz-01.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 23:45:00","author":"Alex Tabet","authors":["Alex Tabet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":391683372,"title":"Analysis: The rapid rise and fall of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz","text":"MINNEAPOLIS — For a fleeting moment, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was on top of the political world.\n\nIt was the summer of 2024, and Walz had become the unlikely Democratic vice presidential nominee alongside Kamala Harris after signing a sweeping progressive agenda into law in Minnesota.\n\nThen, his political career unraveled almost as quickly as it took off. Walz suffered a bruising national defeat, lost his close friend and colleague in a political assassination and found himself under white-hot scrutiny for a sprawling fraud crisis in the state’s welfare programs.\n\nOn Monday, almost a year and a half after Harris asked him to be her running mate, Walz stood before a crowd of reporters at the Minnesota Capitol to announce he was dropping his bid for a third term. His wife, First Lady Gwen Walz, looked on as he read brief prepared remarks and then left abruptly without taking questions.\n\n“I’m confident that I’ll find ways to contribute to the state that I love long after next January,” Walz said in his remarks. “I want Minnesotans to know how grateful I am for the opportunity to serve this state, for the privilege that I have been given to serve in this office.”\n\nWalz’s exit from the governor’s race — and possibly from politics entirely — marked a stunning reversal of fortune and came as he faced unrelenting attacks from his greatest political foe, President Donald Trump, on the issue of fraud.\n\nThe governor’s move to end his re-election campaign amid scrutiny will almost certainly leave a mark on his legacy.\n\n“His legacy is something that, perhaps more than some elected officials, may be dependent on sort of doubling down on righting the ship here in the last year,” said former Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor chair Mike Erlandson, who encouraged Walz to take strong action on fraud in his final year.\n\nMinnesota is facing of one of the largest social services fraud scandals in its history. Federal prosecutors have documented hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of fraud in state autism services, housing and meals programs, among others. The total scope of the theft could reach into the billions when all is uncovered, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nCritics of the Walz administration have long said the governor and his cabinet were too slow to act on stopping fraud. Some of Walz’s aides brushed off political concerns about fraud in recent years, saying the issue didn’t come up in polling.\n\n“All along, he should have been holding his commissioners accountable,” said Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican who’s running for governor. “There is not a single person that I know that has been fired.”\n\nThe governor’s decision is likely to be seen as a political victory for Trump, who has led a Republican campaign to cast Walz as inept and corrupt.\n\nWalz blasted Trump and his GOP allies on Monday for “seeking to take advantage of a crisis.”\n\nWalz and Trump traded caustic comments during and after the 2024 election. The governor said Trump was a buffoon, a felon, a fascist and an incompetent businessman. He at one point called for Democrats to “be a little meaner” in standing up to Trump, and said Trump was using federal immigration agents as a “modern-day Gestapo.”\n\nTrump has called Walz a loser, “a very stupid, low IQ man,” and reposted lies that Walz was responsible for the assassination of Melissa and Mark Hortman. On Monday, Trump said on social media that Walz was corrupt, dishonest and has “destroyed the State of Minnesota.”\n\nAt times, Republicans as well as some Democrats questioned whether Walz’s focus was drifting too far toward national politics.\n\nBut after the assassination of the Hortmans in June, Walz was knocked off course. He began wavering over whether to seek a third term in the office before ultimately deciding to run for re-election.\n\nPat Garofalo, a former Republican state representative, said it became clear after Walz announced his re-election campaign that Minnesotans weren’t thrilled by the idea of a third-term governor “no matter who they are.” A poll conducted by the Minnesota Star Tribune in June found that about half of Minnesotans said Walz shouldn’t seek a third term.\n\n“His number-one legislative ally was murdered in the summer,” Garofalo said. “And he had to make this aggressive decision, timeline decision, with the State Fair coming up at a time when he was still grieving. And like at a human level, it’s like none of us make our best decisions while we’re grieving.”\n\nWalz forged ahead anyway, despite skepticism within his own party. Nearly a dozen Democrats who spoke to the Minnesota Star Tribune in recent weeks said they thought Walz should not seek re-election, including several who compared his run for a third term to President Joe Biden’s doomed 2024 campaign.\n\nA group of Democratic-Farmer-Labor state senators had been requesting a meeting with Walz in the past couple of weeks to voice their concerns to him directly and start a private discussion about the path forward, according to multiple people familiar with the effort.\n\nJeff Blodgett, who has run DFL campaigns and worked in Minnesota politics for more than 30 years, said he didn’t see parallels with Biden, who he said had betrayed a pledge to be a one-term president. But he did praise Walz for making a comparatively quick decision.\n\nBiden’s extended public clash with his own party in the face of sagging popularity soured the president’s standing with some Democrats. Walz’s decision to drop out was a “selfless act,” Blodgett said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Abou Amara said there was “really no end in sight” to the criticism Walz is facing for fraud. Federal prosecutors will almost certainly charge more fraudsters as more schemes are uncovered, which will keep the topic in the headlines.\n\n“He stepped aside with enough time for the party to resolve what it’s going to do next. I think that’s a learning lesson from the 2024 presidential campaign,” Amara said.\n\nMinnesota House DFL Leader Zack Stephenson said Walz’s decision to drop out of the race is “another proof point of where the governor is putting the well-being of Minnesota ahead of politics.” Stephenson said Walz followed that same principle in the 2023 legislative session, when he signed a parade of progressive policies into law that codified abortion rights and created new programs providing paid family and medical leave and free school meals, among other things.\n\nIt was that progressive blitz — and some well-timed television appearances that included jabbing at Republicans as “weird” — that raised Walz’s national profile.\n\n“He’s got that famous quote about how you don’t accrue political capital just to stock it up. You have it to use it to improve people’s lives,” Stephenson said. “And I think he did that.”","summary":"MINNEAPOLIS — For a fleeting moment, Minnesota Gov.

CBS News leased a private 14-seat jet for the tour, but the plan was delayed once the U.S. military action in Venezuela became a major story early Saturday morning.\n\nInstead, Dokoupil took the chair Saturday night and broadcast live from San Francisco before returning to New York for his official premiere on Monday. The tour is still on and will commence Tuesday from Miami.\n\nDokoupil’s new role will be the first major test for Weiss, who came to the division with no previous experience in television or with running a massive journalism operation. Choosing on-air talent who help drive ratings for the network is considered the most critical task for a TV news executive.\n\nDokoupil, 45, follows the duo of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, who co-anchored “CBS Evening News” for a year. The program tried to bring more in-depth pieces to the typically fast-paced network evening news format. But it lost viewers and put CBS further behind “ABC World News Tonight With David Muir” and “NBC Nightly News With Tom Llamas.”\n\nDokoupil’s first official broadcast returned to a style that resembled previous iterations of “CBS Evening News,” with a tight shot of the anchor sitting at a desk in a newsroom.\n\nOver the past year, Dickerson and DuBois were seated at a long desk and often interacted with correspondents shown on a large screen. The program no longer includes an in-studio meteorologist to present national weather.\n\nDokoupil’s arrival marks the fifth anchor change at the “CBS Evening News” since 2017. NBC has made one change since then, while Muir has been in his role at ABC since 2014.\n\nCBS News promoted Dokoupil’s launch with a whimsical social media video that showed the journalist presenting a piece of paper with his name written on it to commuters at Grand Central Terminal in New York. Asked to pronounce “Dokoupil,” few of the commuters came close even though he had been co-host of “CBS Mornings” for several years.\n\nThe promo seemed like an odd choice given how the network evening news anchor has traditionally been a position requiring gravitas and comforting familiarity for its habit-driven audience.\n\nDokoupil also issued a video message last Thursday suggesting organizations such as CBS News are no longer reliable sources of information for much of the public.\n\n“A lot has changed since the first person sat in this chair,” he said. “But for me, the biggest difference is people do not trust us like they used to. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media.”\n\n“The point is, on too many stories the press has missed the story,” he added. “Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you.”\n\nThe anchor went further on his Instagram account, where he cited Walter Cronkite, who sat at the desk during the division’s glory years of the 1960s and ’70s. “I can promise we’ll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or anyone else of his era,” he said.\n\nDokoupil’s claim prompted a response from Michael Socolow, a journalism professor at the University of Maine and the son of Sandy Socolow, who produced Cronkite’s broadcast.\n\nSocolow noted how Cronkite believed the public should be skeptical of what it saw on TV news and take in other sources and points of view.\n\nIn an interview with The Times, Socolow said Cronkite was never comfortable with his designation as “the most trusted man in America.” CBS News touted that point, which was based on a single public opinion poll.\n\n“Cronkite thought it wouldn’t be in the public interest to be too trustful of any specific media source,” Socolow said. “And he made that clear in public speeches and TV interviews for decades.”\n\nSocolow posted a clip of a 1972 interview with Cronkite as an example.\n\n“I don’t think they ought to believe me, or they ought to believe Brinkley, or they ought to believe anybody who’s on the air, or they ought to get all their news from one television station,” Cronkite said.\n\nThe latest change at “CBS Evening News” also follows one of the most tumultuous periods in the long history of CBS News. The organization was shaken by the Dec. 20 decision by Weiss to pull a “60 Minutes” piece on the harsh El Salvador mega-prison the U.S. government is using to hold undocumented migrants.\n\nWeiss believed the story needed more reporting, including an on-camera response from Trump White House officials. The White House, Department of Homeland Security and the State Department had all declined comment to “60 Minutes.”\n\nBut the decision to yank the announced segment the day before it was scheduled to air led “60 Minutes” correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi to claim in an email to colleagues that the decision was political. Alfonsi had worked on the story for months and had it vetted by the division’s standards and practices department.\n\n“Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,” Alfonsi wrote in the email. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”\n\nAlfonsi’s reporting did show up on Canada’s Global TV service, which had been given a feed of the program before the change was made, an embarrassing operational error by CBS News. The segment was shared widely on social media.\n\nEvery move by Weiss has received heightened scrutiny since she was given editorial control over CBS News in October. She joined the network after parent company Paramount acquired the Free Press, a digital news and opinion platform she co-founded. The site made its name by calling out perceived liberal bias by legacy media organizations and so-called woke policies.\n\nMedia industry critics have used the “60 Minutes” controversy to suggest Weiss was installed to placate President Donald Trump as Paramount pursues the acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which would require government regulatory approval. A person close to Weiss who was not authorized to comment publicly said Paramount had no say on the Alfonsi piece.\n\nParamount already paid $16 million to Trump to settle a defamation suit against “60 Minutes.” Trump claimed the program deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris, calling it election interference. CBS News did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.","summary":"Tony Dokoupil took his place at the anchor desk of the \"CBS Evening News\" on Monday as the troubled news division undergoes reinvention under its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.

Jacob Soboroff – MS NOW: After deciding to remain at MSNBC, becoming MS NOW, he strove to deliver decidedly leftist-anti-Trump content on the regular. Jacob began the year with a visit to Stephen Colbert and insisted that a toughened border policy does not stem immigration; yet, as he said that deterrence at the border does not work, the number of illegals had already begun crashing, leading to negative net migration. When the California wildfires erupted, Jacob was on the scene, giving Gov. Gavin Newsom the chance to spin better PR for himself. NBC News had to settle a major defamation suit based on Soboroff’s errant reporting of a doctor alleged to have performed unneeded hysterectomies on immigrants. It was entirely based on a sole witness later proven to be unreliable, so the network paid out the penalty. Soboroff was a regular sympathizer of illegals and a critic of ICE in a string of slanted reports.\n\nHe shamed himself with an excitable interview at a No Kings rally – by shoving his microphone into the snout of an inflatable pink unicorn protester.\n\n“We’re here peacefully protesting, looking as ridiculous as we can, just so maybe we appeal to the president because he’s a ridiculous leader that is normalizing abuse of power. And we cannot stand and act like nothing is happening.” 🦄 pic.twitter.com/NB2yM6cbRN— Jacob Soboroff (@jacobsoboroff) October 19, 2025\n\n9. Jeffrey Goldberg – The Atlantic: The Editor in Chief for the outlet splashed the biggest controversy this year with his report about being inadvertently added to a Defense Department messaging discussion on airstrikes on the Houthis. While certainly a major foul-up by the officials (leading to the dismissal of Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor), the supposed downfall of Secretary Pete Hegseth did not occur. This is because, despite Goldberg’s claims of being privy to sensitive intel, he never delivered on the promise to reveal such. Jeff had the first reveal of the Kamala Harris election book, which was not a significant scoop, largely due to his publisher being tight friends with the former VP. He told Jake Tapper the press could not report on Joe Biden’s mental slide without firm sourcing, although Alex Thompson wrote about how White House officials confirmed they had lied about his condition, and the press played along.\n\n8. Rachel Maddow – MS NOW: The highly paid queen at this outlet stepped back from her nightly news show at Trump’s 100-day mark in order to only work Monday nights. She had a dramatic meltdown over birthright citizenship. In her trademarked fact-free style, she complained that Trump ordered a fleet of Teslas and accused him of corruption with Elon Musk, despite the reality that the order had been placed under Biden’s term. Rachel actually complained that the president was highlighting a pediatric cancer patient during his State of the Union address. \n\nMaddow roundly mocked a Florida sheriff for his allegedly militant crackdown on No Kings protesters when he promised to arrest those blocking roadways, and she then showed the protests were properly controlled. She concocted a fever-dream conspiracy that Trump targeted drug boats so he could freely deport all Venezuelans. The openly gay hostess allowed Kamala Harris to explain that she did not choose Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because, “as a black candidate with a gay running mate, it would be a real risk.”\n\nAfter President Trump featured the young cancer patient D.J. Daniel during the State of the Union, Rachel was raging about the touching moment and had to turn it bitterly political.\n\nWhen will Democrats be brave enough to point out @MSNBC is actually hurting them? Trump celebrates DJ Daniel, a 13yo who beat brain cancer, and not only do Democrats not cheer, but Rachael Maddow rages. These people are out of touch and in a bubble. pic.twitter.com/byLRsOHa4X— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) March 5, 2025\n\n7. Scott McFarlane – CBS News: The network’s stentorian correspondent was largely despondent much of the year. The January 6 obsessive was upset that the DOJ took down its Jan. 6 web page. Scott was perturbed by GOP behavior during the SOTU, but had zero comment on the crude shouting from Democrats. In a report, he was critical of calling drug cartels terrorist groups, after showing a memorial to the 100,000 fentanyl victims. Expectantly, he slams having troops in D.C. but admits they are not actually conducting arrests, and then ignores the arrests of murderers of a congressional intern. Scott seemed bothered by the dire move of a Florida radio station promoting “Trump Country.” Claimed no evidence that Charlie Kirk’s shooter was investigated as a trans individual, based on the opinion of a mayor, when no quote saying that came from the Bureau and the FBI was actually looking into transgenderism as an issue. \n\nIn an amazing example of “Main Character Syndrome,” MacFarlane claimed he had PTSD and nearly died when Trump was almost assassinated. He explains that the crowd, for whatever reason, was allegedly about to turn on reporters on the scene, but when the president raised his fist, that quelled the threat, and his life was spared. All of this was supposed to have played out in a matter of seconds.\n\nCBS's Scott MacFarlane claims that after Trump was shot \"I got diagnosed with PTSD within 48 hours. I got put on trauma leave, not because, I think, of the shooting, but because, you could, you saw it in the eyes, the reaction of the people. They were coming for us. If he didn't… pic.twitter.com/MfrQxN9mvh— Alex Christy (@alexchristy17) July 17, 2025\n\n6. Nicolle Wallace – MS NOW: The precious pundit with a vocal fry and an afternoon show was in all of her anti-Trump glory this past year. Her derangement was at high levels, as seen with her coverage of the State of the Union Address when she referenced the president highlighting the young cancer patient who wants to be a cop, and somehow she turned that into a rant about January 6. After a laundry list of leftist violence, she insisted that only conservatives commit political violence. Nicky blamed Trump supporters for the house fire of a district judge, well after authorities determined there was no foul play. The woman who called the hard videos of Joe Biden’s decline “fake” now says she can “see” that President Trump has mental issues. She admitted to being “gutted” at seeing Venezuelan gang members being deported.\n\nIn a desperate attempt at gaslighting, Nicky actually denied that any Democrats have ever called Trump Hitler. Seriously, she said that. Okay then, roll the tape!\n\nNicolle Wallace: No one calls Trump Hitler*.....*Except every day on my show pic.twitter.com/QjI6KklYsU— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 27, 2025\n\n5. Kaitlan Collins – CNN: Can you say she was promoted when she returned to her previous post? The primetime hostess, whose ratings have been uniformly dismal, was also reinstated as the network’s White House correspondent and was routinely shown to be out of her depth. Says that Trump ignoring rogue judges is a constitutional crisis, not the lone judges who overstep their authority to override the White House policies. Kaitlan was called out and belittled at the Tulsi Gabbard WH presser. During a visit with Seth Meyers, she complained that Trump makes her work so much. In a comically inept segment, Collins claimed Trump was ducking the media due to the economy, when he had not only been fully available all week but then, just moments after her claim, Trump gave a 90-minute press conference.\n\nKaitlan fumbled trying to corner Doug Collins on the Signal scandal when he was not involved, she also tried and failed to trap JD Vance with a question on January 6, and disputed claims by the White House that there was a ceasefire when she was next interrupted to be corrected that it was actually in place. Lamely, she told Sen. Ted Cruz that we do not know the motive of Charlie Kirk’s shooter. Kaitlan was defied by her own network as she tried to sell the canard that illegals cannot get healthcare, but Jake Tapper had previously shown that was the case. She actually expressed dismay that Trump did not care about being called “racist.”\n\nShamefully, Kaitlan had to delete a post when she was caught promoting a website for Luigi Mangione with fundraising options made available for the admitted murderer.\n\n1: She deleted the post. (If there was nothing wrong then why did she delete it?)2: Here is a screenshot. I have marked out the website that she shared... the fundraising link that she is now claiming she did not share.3: The cover-up is always worse than the crime pic.twitter.com/xjE7TSn50R— L A R R Y (@LarryOConnor) February 16, 2025\n\n4. Lawrence O’Donnell – MS NOW: While rarely moving the political needle, Larry is a primetime fixture, and his frequently imbalanced lectures and rants are often so perplexing that you have to wonder if any of the network brass even pays attention to him.\n\nHe was critical of the White House press corps when, after the first press briefing with Karoline Leavitt, he saw them acting polite and professional. Not long after Trump took office, Larry needed to take a week off because the president delivered too much news for him to cover. As the network was constricting and struggling for viewers, he actually held out for a better contract.\n\nEver the conspiracist, O’Donnell suggested JD Vance released the Trump birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein so he could bring down Trump and become president. After a SCOTUS ruling, it was sanely stated that now President Trump could deport “any person…any time…anywhere….” In a sign of seeing his distant second place in the ratings threatened, O’Donnell had a meltdown on air over Scott Jennings appearing on CNN during the same hour.\n\nIn an absolute gem of journalism excellence, Lawrence “proved” there was no need at all for troops to be sent into Washington, D.C., based on a fictional scene from an 80-year-old black-and-white movie.\n\nBehold, as @Lawrence O’Donnell proves there is no crime in D.C. as he offers up for evidence…how no National Guard troops appear in the scene at Union Station in a Jimmy Stewart movie from 1939.And with that, Donald Trump is therefore DEBUNKED, we assume… pic.twitter.com/ntDUbvudak— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) August 22, 2025\n\n3. Jen Psaki – MS NOW: Where to begin with the hyper-partisan former press secretary hack? How about her take on the Signal scandal? Or the time she accidentally admitted on a podcast how MSNBC only reports negatively about Trump?\n\nSomehow, Psaki never saw the side of Biden’s decline when working in the White House. She says Trump made no international deals, despite numerous deals having been brokered, and an hour later, Trump announced a new deal with Britain. Jennifer complained that Trump was off for Memorial Day, when she previously defended Joe Biden for taking off for the very same holiday. Psaki was tabbed to fill the Tuesday-Friday schedule vacated by Rachel Maddow, and she promptly lost half of Maddow’s audience after taking over the time slot.\n\nIn a condescending and anti-feminist discussion on Jennifer Welch’s podcast, Jennifer implied that Usha Vance is a hostage in her marriage in need of being rescued.\n\nJen Psaki Says JD Vance is ‘Scarier’ Than Trump“He's smarter in some ways, and he's young and ambitious.” 😱 pic.twitter.com/WHsfJlCr3U— Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) October 21, 2025\n\n2. Margaret Brennan – CBS News: The Sunday hostess of Face the Nation was so routinely schooled by her Republican guests that she has earned her Master's Degree in Narrative Rendering. Margaret seems to prepare for each episode with arranged talking points lined up, and has no need to do more, which leads her to being consistently unraveled by the presentation of basic facts.\n\nShe suggests poorer states cannot take care of themselves in a disaster, and also claimed no DEI spending took place at USAID, then, when shown proof, said the amount was negligible. She opposed deportations because they could rob us of the next Einstein. Margaret denied that Mahmoud Kahlil was a Hamas sympathizer.\n\nBrennan was completely flummoxed by the reasoning behind “penguin tariffs” and argued with Sen. Rand Paul on defunding \"Sesame Street,\" though it is no longer owned by PBS. Maggie was shamed by Sen. Tom Cotton over the riots and his New York Times column, and lost to Secretary Marco Rubio on Iranian enrichment, and then Rubio, on another visit, again had to enlighten her, this time about why European leaders came to the White House over peace talks.\n\nIn yet another talk with Marco Rubio, Ms. Brennan actually said free speech was weaponized by the Nazis.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio defends @JDVance's \"historic\" speech last week in Munich, leaves ABC's Margaret Brennan speechless after she tries to claim that free speech was \"weaponized\" by the Nazis. Incredible exchange: 👇 pic.twitter.com/GYLZfopVwP— Scott Morefield (@SKMorefield) February 16, 2025\n\n1. Jake Tapper – CNN: The once respected journalist at the network has devolved into a meandering mess of a media figure. \n\nThe biggest factor was the release of the book “Original Sin,” where he and co-author Alex Thompson revealed all of the media cover-ups involving the condition of former President Joe Biden. The main issue, obviously, was Tapper’s participation in that gambit.\n\nFor the book tour, Tapper hired a crisis communications firm to run his PR campaign. This is for good reason, as he has a conflict with his own past coverage. In his book, Jake praised two Wall Street Journal reporters – Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes – for their report about Biden’s flagging condition, and he even cast scorn on the journalists who had criticized them at the time their coverage was published. Only issue – he was among those criticizing them at the time. Here is his segment, not with the reporters but with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, as both men questioned the veracity of their reporting.\n\nHere was @JakeTapper making snide commentary that the initial @WSJ report on Joe Biden's Condition was from a Murdoch-owned outlet, they only quoted Republicans, and then he did not speak to the reporters, but had Chris Coons spinning for the party.1/2https://t.co/zLC6G7sGIv— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) May 15, 2025\n\nThen, to conclude his book run, Jake sat for an interview with George Clooney, the actor who helped provoke Biden’s removal from the party ticket.\n\nLook at the adverse effects of the election on stardom.The George Clooney @CNN shows in their promo versus the Clooney who appeared with Tapper. pic.twitter.com/2SYm8FObhJ— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) April 17, 2025\n\nApart from book-related issues, it was still a tough 2025 for Tapper. When he appeared in the CNN defamation lawsuit, he testified that he did not know about his ratings, when there are examples of him crowing about his show’s numbers. He next went on to say we are entering an era of misinformation, days after the defamation trial. Then, regarding the CBS/60Minutes defamation suit, he “proved” there was no wrongdoing by asking them if they had done anything wrong.\n\nHe could not help but dredge up January 6 on Biden’s final day in office. Jake slammed Trump for his rude State of the Union address, well after Democrats had been raging during his speech. He had to be taught about the details of immigrants being eligible to be deported for supporting terrorists.\n\nDuring the redistricting news cycle, Tapper excused Illinois' gerrymandering and then said GOP states are the worst offenders. In a visit with Seth Meyers, he says he never saw a government silence people like they are now, just as Google publicly admitted its censoring efforts on YouTube. Similarly, he showed he was ignorant when a grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey when blaming Trump. Obliviously, the man who once platformed white supremacist Richard Spencer on his program was critical of Trump for not properly condemning Tucker Carlson over his Nick Fuentes interview.\n\nJake clearly lied about Trump wanting to kill Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, then later bizarrely announced the recently arrested J6 bomber was a “white man.” As the Minnesota fraud story swelled, Jake allowed Rep. Ilhan Omar to spin about the scandal.\n\nPerhaps the most emblematic evidence of the tough year for the CNN veteran was shown in stark fashion, in a matter of weeks. There was a rapid evolution in how his book went from being a celebrated piece of journalism to an indictment of the news industry, then ultimately a hit on his very own credibility. With “Original Sin” out for about one month, Jake saw his ratings plunge by 25 percent, hitting a decade low. To pardon the metaphor, that is a sign of the people deciding to turn the page.\n\nJake Tapper's CNN show lost 25% of their audience since releasing his book.The Lead with Jake Tapper hit a nearly decade-low in ratings in May, averaging 525,000 viewers from April 28 to May 25. pic.twitter.com/G5nnxGRM1A— Breanna Morello (@BreannaMorello) May 29, 2025\n\nEditor's Note: Get access to Brad Slager's \"Riffed From the Headlines,\" a daily VIP feature where he looks to bring accountability to the mainstream media.

Like, I would never run and I don't want anything to do with politics. \n\n'I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing and I think if both sides met in the middle everyone would be so much more happier and I think there's radical left, there's radical right and there's a lot of people who get too extreme.\n\nKai Trump explains why she has no interest in politics\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 1:00\n\nVideo Quality\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-Opaque\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n50%75%100%125%150%175%200%300%400%\n\nNoneRaisedDepressedUniformDropshadow\n\nDefaultMonospace SerifProportional SerifMonospace Sans-SerifProportional Sans-SerifCasualScriptSmall Caps\n\nKai Trump made her first podcast appearance when she was interviewed on Impaulsive\n\nThe teenager risked the wrath of her grandfather, Donald Trump, with her comment on politics\n\n'And that's where social media really ties into it because social media kind of makes your Instagram or your feed be one way or the other and there's not a lot of things on social media if you're very much in the middle. \n\n'I think that kind of makes some people crazy and some people buy into it too much.

It is what it is, they ran against each other.'\n\nFinally, the budding golfer ended by offering an insight into Trump's presidential future, as podcast host Paul pressed her on the possibility of her grandfather standing for a third term. \n\nThe teenager admitted that he has no plans to run again but left the door open by admitting 'a lot could happen until 2028'. \n\nThe president has made a splash in the political sphere over the US's military action in Venezuela and the removal of the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\nTrump announced early Saturday morning that the US had taken Maduro and his wife Cilia on drug and weapon charges after 'successfully' carrying out a military strike in the capital of Caracas. \n\nMaduro landed late Saturday afternoon at a small airport in New York City's northern suburbs following the middle-of-the-night operation that extracted him and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in a military base in the capital, Caracas - an act that Maduro's government called 'imperialist.' \n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges at his defiant appearance in a New York court Monday, two days after being snatched by US forces in the stunning operation on his home in Caracas.\n\nMaduro and his wife are pictured in handcuffs as they landed at a Manhattan helipad and then transported in an armored car for Monday's arraignment in federal court\n\nThe 18-year-old insisted that she had no 'bad blood' with Trump's former rival Kamala Harris\n\nMaduro, 63, told a federal judge in Manhattan: 'I'm innocent. I'm not guilty.'\n\nHis wife, who appeared at her arraignment with two bandages on her face, also pleaded not guilty to conspiring to send cocaine into the US and other gun and drug-related charges.\n\nThe couple face up to life in prison - and potentially the death sentence - if they are convicted of the several charges that US authorities have cited as justification for their lightning raid on Saturday. \n\nWhile Kai isn't eyeing a career in the Oval Office, she is zeroing in her sights on the fairways. \n\nShe may not have inherited her grandfather's penchant for 'dangerous' politics but she has developed his talent for golf. \n\nLater this year, she will be joining the University of Miami as a part of the 2026 signing class to play collegiate golf. She committed to the school back in August. \n\nIn November, she made her debut on the LPGA Tour - the world's top women's golf tour - alongside the likes of World No 2 Nelly Korda at The ANNIKA in Belleair, Florida. \n\nTrump is pictured on stage after speaking to House Republican lawmakers on Tuesday \n\nThe aspiring golfer is pictured with the president at the Ryder Cup in September 2025\n\nKai Trump shares sweet golf outing with her grandpa, Donald Trump\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:44\n\nVideo Quality\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-Opaque\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n50%75%100%125%150%175%200%300%400%\n\nNoneRaisedDepressedUniformDropshadow\n\nDefaultMonospace SerifProportional SerifMonospace Sans-SerifProportional Sans-SerifCasualScriptSmall Caps\n\nAnd Kai, who has also made her mark as an influencer and social media star, has a well of expertise to tap into.

'And she had just laughed about it.' \n\nSwisher further detailed how Harris then proceeded to 'yell' at her in front of an audience. \n\n'And then she went into this sort of high-handed kind of thing where she was like yelling at me for even asking the question. I was just like I'm gonna kill you, I literally can't believe you just did that, which was interesting,' she said, adding that the interaction 'was a real insight.' \n\nAfter Swisher mentioned what RFK Jr. had said, Harris, who sat across from the journalist on stage, in front of multiple copies of her book 107 Days, looked right at her and said: 'People will die for what they're doing, I can't laugh about that, I'm sorry.' \n\nHarris then told Swisher: 'Kara, it's personal for me, it's personal for me. \n\n'And I can't laugh at it because like so many of you who have known people who suffer because of unknown diseases, or cancers, for which there are no cures, or there is the beginning of, but more work that needs to be done for the cure - what they are doing to push misinformation and lies at the highest level of government, it's criminal!' \n\nSwisher sat there silently, allowing Harris to have her moment, as she added: 'And people will die because of what they're doing, and I can't laugh about that, I'm sorry. It's f***ed up.'\n\n'It's f***ed up,' Swisher replied before moving onto the next talking point. \n\nAfter bringing up the anecdote about Harris, Chotiner chimed in: 'I sometimes get the sense that she doesn't realize her political career is over.' \n\n'Idk... It was so funny, I was just like where's the person backstage who just had a very insightful comment about this? It was really interesting,' Swisher said. \n\n'Perhaps telling about her electoral performance,' Chotiner stated. \n\n'Yeah, I was like, be the person backstage because that's the person who gave a great answer, actually,' she responded. \n\nAfter RFK Jr. came out with that claim, HHS later told the Daily Mail that he was talking about infants specifically, and not all children. \n\nHe was also only suggesting that administering Tylenol to an infant after a circumcision could raise their risk of being diagnosed with autism, and not the circumcision itself.","summary":"Kara Swisher, a veteran journalist known for her liberal views, shared the breathtaking moment she witnessed Kamala Harris drop her mask.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15443105/kara-swisher-kamala-harris-behavior-story-liberal-media.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/07/20/105315009-0-image-m-13_1767817218166.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 21:19:05","author":"Editor,Emma Richter","authors":["Editor","Emma Richter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":391645756,"title":"Trump wants to ban large investors from buying single-family homes in bid to bring down prices: ‘People live in homes, not corporations’","text":"President Donald Trump said he plans to ban large institutional investors from buying additional single-family homes in an effort to make homeownership more attainable for Americans. \n\n“For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, later adding, “that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people.” \n\n“It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump added. \n\nTrump said he would discuss the subject and other proposals related to affordability in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks. \n\nLarge institutional investors, such as Blackstone, have bought up thousands of family homes since the financial crisis of 2008 led to increased foreclosures. These investors often buy and rent out homes, which critics say has reduced housing supply and dramatically inflated rent across the country. \n\nFollowing the president’s social media post, shares of Blackstone fell by as much as 9 percent, CNN report\n\nThe asset management giant has built one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the country in recent years, according to CNBC. \n\nHowever, the firm has rejected the notion that its investments have stoked inflation and diminished the housing supply. Blackstone told CNBC in July that it owns less than one percent of the 46 million rental homes in the country. \n\nWhile it was unclear how Trump could limit institutional investors’ purchases of single-family homes through executive action, several states, including New York, have taken legal steps to slow investors from scooping up homes. \n\nNews of Trump’s plans to stop large institutional investors from buying up homes comes as he faces mounting pressure to deliver on his campaign promise to lower the high cost of living, particularly ahead of the November midterm elections. \n\nLast month, Trump said the 2026 midterms would revolve around “pricing,” despite repeatedly describing affordability as a “hoax” spread by the Democratic party. \n\nBetween 2020 and the end of 2025, house prices climbed nearly 55 percent nationwide, CNN reports.\n\nIn November, inflation fell to 2.7 percent year-over-year, the smallest increase recorded since July, according to a December consumer price index report from the Labor Department. Meanwhile, data published by the government last month showed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, the fastest it has in two years. \n\nDespite positive hints, recent polls show that Americans – including many of Trump’s own MAGA base – are feeling pinched by the current economic climate. \n\nA Politico survey from November found that 46 percent of respondents believe the current cost of living is the worst they can remember. That number includes 37 percent of Trump 2024 voters and 53 percent of voters who cast their ballots for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nNearly half of respondents also reported struggling to afford essentials, including groceries, healthcare and housing.","summary":"Shares of Blackstone fell as much as 9 percent after Trump’s post","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ban-investors-family-homes-b2896408.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/8/53/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-GOP-cicv9y12.jpeg?crop=4096.3,2730.9,x379.7,y38&trim=37,4,216,379&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 21:09:18","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":391719538,"title":"DHS' Attempt to Justify ICE Shooting in Minnesota Quickly Shot Down: 'Demonstrably False'","text":"After an incident that was captured on video in Minneapolis, MN, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot a woman dead, outraged citizens and politicians are calling the Department of Homeland Security's statement on the shooting \"demonstrably false\" and \"propaganda.\"The video circulating on social media shows a woman in a dark red Honda SUV being approached by ICE officers as she is told to get out of her vehicle.

It all started with Trump’s big claims of his peak-perfection health. He went on to challenge Gavin Newsom, Tim Walz, and Kamala Harris to see if they could ace the cognitive tests that the President claims to champion with soaring scores.\n\nGavin Newsom shared a clip of Trump challenging Newsom and others for a cognitive test, and he wrote on X, “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” The California Governor accepted Trump’s challenge on national TV right away and added, “Donald Trump, if you’re so confident, let’s do it. Name your time and place.”\n\nPerson. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.@realDonaldTrump, if you’re so confident, let’s do it. Name your time and place. https://t.co/SNHHzKdwiu\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) January 6, 2026\n\nTrump, who has, time and again, boasted about his perfect health, said that he is the only President to have undergone these tests. He said during a speech, “We should give everybody these competency tests …I think every president and vice president should be forced to take cognitive exams.”\n\nHe added during his speech, “Do you think Walz could pass a cognitive test as an example? “Do you think Kamala could? I don’t think Gavin could. He’s got a good line of c–p, but other than that, he couldn’t pass.”\n\nWe should give everybody cognitive tests.\nI am the only President that went for cognitives. Every President and Vice President should be forced to take exams.\nMental tests, like are they intelligent? pic.twitter.com/S9Gb91kQKe\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) January 6, 2026\n\nSo, it wasn’t just Gavin Newsom who decided to accept Donald Trump’s challenge. Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel also took the same cognitive test as Trump at Walter Reed Medical Center. “In the interest of fairness, and also to get a sense of what he keeps babbling about, we got in touch with a doctor who gives this test regularly, these cognitive exams. And I asked her to administer one to me,” Jimmy Kimmel said post taking the test.\n\nHe added, “This is the official exam administered by a medical professional. I did not see the questions ahead of time. And I’m willing to release the full unedited version if necessary. With that said, let’s find out just how difficult this big, beautiful test is. And how my brain stacks up against our stable genius President’s.”\n\nTurns out, Jimmy Kimmel also received a perfect score. Jimmy Kimmel also dedicated his Best Host win at the Critics Choice Awards to Trump with a dash of sarcasm, of course.\n\nTrump, keeping up with his series of many posts, bragging about his perfect health, both cognitive and physical, on January 2 this year, shared a Truth Social post, in which he wrote, “The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in “PERFECT HEALTH,” and that I “ACED” for the third straight time, my cognitive examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take.”\n\nA mention of Donald Trump’s health would be incomplete without the many swipes Gavin Newsom has taken on the same of late. He once said that Trump needs to be “stabilized.” In a rather strongly worded X post, Gavin Newsom said this about Trump’s health: “He seems, dare I say, in decline cognitively. And dare I say, forgive me, perhaps unfair, physically, and these are just rantings of someone that needs an intervention, needs some help, needs to be stabilized, dare I say.”","summary":"Gavin Newsom accepted Trump’s challenge on national TV right away","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/challenge-accepted-gavin-newsom-ready-for-trumps-cognitive-test-name-your-time-and-place","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsom_Trump_Cognitive_Test_Faceoff_1200.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 19:29:53","author":"Pranita Chaubey","authors":["Pranita Chaubey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":391705038,"title":"The most hypocritical reactions to Trump’s masterstroke Maduro ouster","text":"In this case, former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, an alleged narco-terrorist and illegitimate president with an outstanding criminal grand jury indictment coming up on six years old, was rightly snatched by U.S. Delta Force commandos out of his high-security compound in Caracas. Two days later, he was being arraigned in a New York district court for alleged crimes, including narco-terrorism and cocaine importation conspiracy.\n\nEstimates may vary, but as many as 100,000 Americans are killed each year from illegal drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, entering the country from countries such as Venezuela. Context: If multiplying that number from the past 10 years alone, we’re talking more American deaths than those lost in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, 9/11, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.\n\nBut the Left is not happy with Trump’s masterstroke here and has been patently hypocritical in the process. Here’s Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) leading the charge on the hypocrisy front.\n\nMurphy, 2019: “If Trump cared about consistency, he would make the realist case for intervention in Venezuela (getting rid of Maduro is good for the United States) rather than trying to pretend his Administration all of the sudden cares about toppling anti-democratic regimes.”\n\nMurphy, 2026, post-Maduro arrest: “The invasion of Venezuela has nothing to do with American security. Venezuela is not a security threat to the U.S.”\n\nMurphy made the latter completely contradictory comment to CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday. And for whatever reason, Bash declined to bring up Murphy’s 2019 comments to ask him a simple question: “What changed between then and now?”\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), not long before the 2024 presidential election: “This is a deeply concerning development for Venezuelans and for the entire region, since instability abroad impacts us here at home, too.”\n\nKaine, 2026: “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro … is a sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nIn this case, a journalist did her job after Fox News White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich asked Kaine the following: “If Democrats cared so much about process, why didn’t they do anything to bring Maduro to justice when they were in charge, given that the guy has been under indictment since 2020?”\n\nGood question. Kaine eventually responded after some Kamala Harris-esque word salad to say that “the Constitution does not give the president the right to initiate military action.”\n\nActually, it totally does, per legal scholars such as Fox’s Jonathan Turley: “Presidents are allowed to use military forces without such a declaration,” Turley wrote on X. Former President Barack Obama “not only killed an American citizen not charged with any crime but attacked Libya’s capital and attacked its military to cause a regime change without consulting with Congress.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who never disappoints in these situations, also has a wonderful compare and contrast example for the ages.\n\nSchumer, 2020: “The president brags about his Venezuela policy. Give us a break. He hasn’t brought an end to the Maduro regime. The Maduro regime is more powerful today and more entrenched today than it was when the president began.”\n\nSchumer, 2026: “This is reckless. And the American people are just, this morning, in fear of what’s going to happen here.”\n\nThere are no words.\n\nHow about Sen. Elizabeth Warren‘s (D-MA) words back when she was running for president in 2019?\n\nWarren, 2019: “Maduro is a dictator and a crook who has wrecked his country’s economy, dismantled its democratic institutions, and profited while his people suffer. The United States should lead the international community in addressing Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis and supporting regional efforts to negotiate a political transition.”\n\nWarren, 2026: “What does it mean that the U.S. will ‘run’ Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world? The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump’s dangerous military adventurism overseas that won’t make the American people safer.”\n\nYes, the same person who was the staunchest advocate for the Inflation Reduction Act has the hubris to talk about lower costs for the public. And what exactly happened to addressing Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis? Or was that the kind of empty rhetoric we’ve come to expect from our so-called leaders?\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio laid this out perfectly in a press conference held after Maduro’s capture.\n\n“I think people need to understand that this is not a president that just talks and does letters and press conferences,” Rubio told reporters on Sunday. “And if he says he’s serious about something, he means it. And this is something that was a direct threat to the national interest of the United States.”\n\nPrecisely. Just ask the Iranians or the Houthis if Trump is an all-talk-and-no-action kind of guy.\n\n“The democratic world must stand up for the rule of law in Venezuela and oppose Maduro’s assault on the electoral process and free speech. The right-wing attack on democratic institutions anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere.” \n\n“Trump is not only violating our Constitution, but he is shredding the rules-based international order created after World War II, whose essential building block is the political sovereignty and territorial integrity of each nation.” \n\nSo, when Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) called on the “democratic world” to “stand up for the rule of law,” did that not include actually enforcing the law, as Trump did in bringing in the man that then-President Joe Biden, or whoever was running the country, had placed a $25 million bounty on? As for the “international order” Raskin speaks of, military extractions like this one have occurred numerous times since World War II, no matter who was in charge of the executive branch.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush did seek congressional authorization before invading Panama to capture narco-terrorist Manuel Noriega in 1989.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton did not seek congressional authorization before launching U.S. air assaults that lasted nearly three months in Yugoslavia to stop ethnic cleansing. \n\nObama did not seek congressional approval before killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, nor did he seek the same approval when droning and killing an American citizen abroad, along with more than 100 innocent civilians.\n\nTrump did not seek congressional authority before taking out Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, who the U.S. military said was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members during the Iraq War.\n\nNow, is it important for Congress to provide oversight if a president seeks to go to war? Of course. But what happened in Venezuela was not a war. There were zero casualties on the U.S. side. Our military, much like the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, had a mission, accomplished that mission, and got the hell out. Venezuela has seen no uprising since. Instead, there have been celebrations at home and here in the U.S. by those who escaped the horrors of the Maduro regime.\n\nBut Democrats keep swinging at every bad pitch. In this case, even the mayor of our nation’s largest city called Trump to voice his disdain over the capture of his fellow socialist Maduro.\n\n“I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law, and a desire to see that be consistent each and every day,” New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Saturday.\n\nYeah, about that “international law” thing … it basically doesn’t exist. Because a law isn’t a law if it cannot be clearly defined or if there is no actual enforcement behind it.\n\nAs for Trump’s public standing on this, according to a Washington Post poll released this week, 50% of Americans support a drug trafficking trial of Maduro, while just 14% oppose and 36% are somehow “unsure.”\n\nTrump takes action. He removes a murderous dictator from power who was a national security threat to the health and safety of Americans.\n\nHARVARD PRESIDENT ADMITS FACULTY ACTIVISM CHILLS SPEECH ON CAMPUS\n\nAll Democrats not named John Fetterman oppose. They vow to fight Trump on this, even with several threatening to impeach him over the Venezuela mission if they take power again in Congress.\n\nAll sizzle, no steak. The Cleveland Browns of political parties. And the public appears to be finally seeing them for who they are, all while an election year is underway.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

I try my best not to let it bother me. Especially the past year, since he's become President, I've had to learn that, yes, they're following me, but also to focus in pretending that they're not there. \n\n'Obviously, they are there. But if you can try to not really focus on that and enjoy your time with your friends, your family or whatever it is - it makes it easier. \n\n'Because for the first few months, it was tough. It was not easy having someone following you all the time. But once I was like: \"Their only job is to protect me. I'm going to focus on my stuff and have them do their job\". It made it so much easier.'\n\nElsewhere on the podcast, the 18-year-old seemingly extended an olive branch to Trump's former rival Kamala Harris and said there is no 'bad blood' between them.\n\nWhen asked by WWE star Paul about her opinions on Harris, she said: 'To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely. Like, I would never run and I don't want anything to do with politics. \n\n'I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing and I think if both sides met in the middle everyone would be so much more happier and I think there's radical left, there's radical right and there's a lot of people who get too extreme.\n\n'And that's where social media really ties into it because social media kind of makes your Instagram or your feed be one way or the other and there's not a lot of things on social media if you're very much in the middle. \n\n'I think that kind of makes some people crazy and some people buy into it too much. I think that's like the best way to say it. There's no bad blood. I'm very much in the middle. It is what it is, they ran against each other.'\n\nFinally, the budding golfer ended by offering an insight into Trump's presidential future, as podcast host Paul pressed her on the possibility of her grandfather standing for a third term. \n\nThe teenager admitted that he has no plans to run again but left the door open by admitting 'a lot could happen until 2028'. \n\nShe said: 'He's not running for a third term. Sadly not. But who knows? A lot could happen until 2028'.\n\nHer appearance on the podcast came just days after she kick-started 2026 in major style, spending time with Rory McIlroy on the driving range.\n\nThe 18-year-old posted footage of the Masters champion ripping a drive on the range before sharing a picture of herself alongside only the sixth man to complete golf's Grand Slam.\n\n'Best way to start the year,' Kai wrote alongside the picture.\n\nMcIlroy, of course, isn't the only golfer whose expertise the teenager is able to tap into. Her mother, Vanessa, is dating Tiger Woods - their relationship was exclusively revealed by the Daily Mail back in March.\n\nKai has a big 2026 ahead of her. She will be joining the University of Miami as a part of the 2026 signing class to play collegiate golf.

Here's what American Experiment wrote about Ellison at the time:\n\nKeith Ellison, Minnesota’s Attorney General, can clearly be heard pledging his support to individuals who would soon become his family’s campaign donors and later Feeding Our Future criminal defendants.His recorded statements flatly contradict his contemporaneous public statements and raise uncomfortable questions about the intersection between political fundraising and constituent services.American Experiment has exclusively obtained the complete 54-minute, 44-second audio file of a private December 2021 meeting between state Attorney General (AG) Keith Ellison and key figures in the Feeding Our Future scandal.As I wrote last week, the audio file was named as Exhibit 710 on the evidence list presented to the court by Aimee Bock’s defense attorney, Kenneth Udoibok. The recording was not offered into evidence during the six-week trial that concluded last month, with Bock’s conviction on all seven counts she faced. A timeline of relevant events can be found here.\n\nNow Fox News has picked up the story, and Ellison is not happy about it.\n\n\"Putting our dollars in the right place.\"Audio of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison meeting in 2021 with Somali community members who were later convicted in a $250M fraud scheme resurfaced Wednesday. Ellison denies wrongdoing, saying he was unaware of their crimes at…— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 7, 2026\n\nHere's more:\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is facing new scrutiny over a 2021 audio recording of him meeting with members of the Somali community who would soon be convicted of defrauding millions of dollars in taxpayer money.In the recording, now obtained by Fox News, the would-be fraudsters can be heard asking Ellison to help them secure more funding, before the conversation then turns to campaign donations.\"The only way that we can protect what we have is by inserting ourselves into the political arena. Putting our votes where it needs to be. But most importantly, putting our dollars in the right place. And supporting candidates that will fight to protect our interests,\" one of the Somalian community members says in the recording.\"That's right,\" Ellison responds.\n\nAs Townhall reported in December, here were some of the more salient points of the nearly hour-long audio recording:\n\nAt 8:59, Ellison says he is \"in the middle of the battle with the agencies now.\"At 9:07, Ellison says, \"[Governor Tim] Walz agrees with me that this piddly, stupid stuff running small people out of business is terrible.\"At 9:50, Ellison \"agrees with the proposition that there is state agency discrimination against East African businesses.\"At 44:26, Ellison tells the audience, \"Of course, I'm here to help.\"At 45:00, Ellison says, \"Let's go fight these people.\"\n\nFox News confirms that Ellison did receive campaign donations from Somali fraudsters, but returned the money after they were convicted in the scandal.\n\nThe recording was leaked by Kenneth Udoibok, the attorney for Aimee Bock, who was convicted as part of the $250 million \"Feeding Our Future\" fraud scam last year. Some described Bock as the \"ringleader\" of the scam.\n\nUdoibok said that both Governor Tim Walz and AG Ellison need to be held accountable, telling Fox News, \"I would like to see someone, someone in the state, I don't care what if it is the governor, I don't care what the attorney general, someone take responsibility.\"\n\nUdoibok continued, \"Mr. Ellison, your department that your agency represents have some culpability. As much as I like Mr. Walz, he didn't take responsibility on behalf of his agency. The buck stops with him, and in the worst-case scenario, he ought to have fired the commissioner. He ought to fire the director of the food program, somebody.\"\n\nIn an April 2025 op-ed for the Minnesota Star Tribune, Ellison denied any wrongdoing. \"I took a meeting in good faith with people I didn’t know and some turned out to have done bad things.

The poll, conducted by the Speaking with American Men (SAM) project and shared with Puck, also found that his general favorability rating is at just 36 percent. \n\nJohn Della Volpe, who surveyed 42,111 men ages 16-29 for the poll, told Puck that Trump’s first year in office eroded trust in his ability to govern.\n\n“The big picture is that Trump was getting the benefit of the doubt in the first 100 days of his term,” Della Volpe told Puck. “Now, they are reflecting on those policies several months later and seeing no significant improvement. And they’re saying that their situation is no better. In many cases, it’s worse.”\n\nThe SAM study also found that 78 percent of men think that avoiding “unnecessary wars and conflicts” should be a top priority for the president. It also found that men trust Democrats to win wars more than Republicans by a 5 percent majority. \n\nWeeks after the survey was conducted from October 28 to November 26, Trump sent U.S. troops to capture deposed Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro in the early hours of Saturday morning.\n\nMore recently, Trump has already started threatening to seize Greenland using military force, despite it being associated with a key U.S. ally, Denmark.\n\nAdam Pennings, the executive director of Republican-affiliated group Run GenZ, told The Hill that “a lot of young people” feel frustrated after Trump announced plans to influence Venezuelan politics, after campaigning on an America First message. \n\n“Why are we not focusing on the people in Pennsylvania?” Pennings said. “Why are we not focusing on the people in Ohio or California or wherever, right? \n\n“Why are we even looking at Venezuela?” \n\nWith day-to-day costs continuing to rise, despite Trump claiming his tariff policy was making the country richer, pollsters say the number of young men supporting Trump could dwindle even further. \n\n“If you’re 29 and you’re paying out the nose for health care, and you can’t own your own home and groceries are killing you, you don’t really care about the conversations about tariffs. That’s not where you’re living. You’re living at, ‘Hey, I need the price of eggs to drop,’” Brett Loyd, a Republican pollster, told The Hill. \n\nIn the 2024 election, Trump made unprecedented gains with young voters for a Republican candidate. While previously siding with President Joe Biden by 25 points in 2020, young voters cast their ballot for Kamala Harris by a slim 4-point majority in 2024, according to a Tufts University poll.\n\nThe grim polling for Republicans comes after the Democratic Party enjoyed the beginnings of a blue wave in 2025, which saw Zohran Mamdani win the New York City mayoralty and two candidates sweep gubernatorial races. \n\nHowever, Democratic strategists have said that the party cannot rely on those huge victories or a growing sense of frustration towards Trump’s administration.\n\nKaivan Shroff, a member of Gen-Z group Dream for America, told The Hill that “short-term feelings about the economy” may be only a temporary pull for voters to abandon Trump.\n\n“At the same time, is that a long-term strategy for 2028 and beyond? No,” Shroff said. “Trump failing is not enough.”","summary":"The poll found that voters wanted Trump to avoid ‘unnecessary wars’ weeks before he abducted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-poll-venezuela-greenland-young-men-b2896250.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/8/53/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-GOP-cicv9y12.jpeg?crop=4096.3,2730.9,x379.7,y38&trim=37,4,216,379&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Fx3sPBXg-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-07 17:05:54","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":391647690,"title":"Warner Bros. Discovery Just Emphatically Rejected Paramount. Will David Ellison Take No for an Answer?","text":"“Paramount’s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,” said Samuel A. Di Piazza Jr., chair of the WBD board of directors, in a press release. “Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount’s offer would impose on our shareholders.”\nIn December of 2025, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos announced that it had entered a definitive agreement to buy Warner Bros. for a $82.7 billion at $27.75 per WBD share. Netflix’s offer included valuable Warner Bros. assets like its film and television studios, including HBO and streaming service HBO Max, and did not include WBD’s Global Networks division—which, per the deal, would be spun off into a separate publicly traded company called Discovery Global made up of its many cable brands, like CNN and TNT Sports.\nDays after the announcement, Paramount Skydance announced that it was mounting a hostile takeover bid. In his offer, Ellison—son of billionaire Oracle cofounder and Donald Trump ally Larry Ellison—offered to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, including its cable assets, in an all-cash bid for a $30 per WBD share, for a whopping total of $108 billion. Though Paramount Skydance’s market capitalization is only around $13 billion, the company had said it would fork over the hefty price tag via backing from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, as well as from Affinity Partners—a private equity firm led by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. Last month, Affinity Partners dropped out of the bid—days before Larry Ellison, worth approximately $240 billion, personally guaranteed that he would contribute $40 billion in equity to the deal. Daddy to the rescue.\nBut the powers that be at Warner Bros. have said, again, that they aren’t interested in Ellison’s offer. “PSKY’s offer is inferior given significant costs, risks, and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger,” reads a letter to WBD shareholders included in Wednesday’s press release. “The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger.”\nPerhaps the Paramount Skydance merger didn’t go through because no one at WBD wants to play in the sandbox with the Ellisons. Larry Ellison is one of Trump’s most powerful allies, a fact that probably rankled some feathers on the Warner Bros. Discovery board. Robert Gibbs, the board’s chief communications and public affairs officer, served as a trusted adviser to President Barack Obama, working as his communications director, first White House Press secretary, and eventually a senior adviser. Gibbs was likely less than thrilled about the prospect of the company being bought by one of Trump’s most notorious allies. Sarandos, meanwhile, is a longtime Democratic donor—though he too met with Trump before Netflix bid for WBD.\nIn any case, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav is probably in great spirits right now. Just a few days ago, Zaslav was getting dragged at the Critics Choice Awards by host Chelsea Handler for the way he’s run his beloved media conglomerate: “Sinners is the story of brothers who start this really fun place for entertainment, and then vampires show up, suck the life out of everybody, and burn it all to the ground,” Handler said during the ceremony. “Fun fact: The original name of the main vampire was David Zaslav.”\nNow, though, Zaslav may get the last laugh. WBD has reaffirmed support for a Netflix merger that would see him stand to gain $567 million if it comes to pass, according to regulatory filings, potentially launching Zaslav into billionaire status.\nSarandos and his co-CEO Greg Peters also seem to be feeling pretty chummy at the moment. On Wednesday, Netflix released a statement supporting Warner Bros.’s decision to stay in bed with the mega-streamer. “The WBD Board remains fully supportive of and continues to recommend Netflix’s merger agreement, recognizing it as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators, and the broader entertainment industry,” the statement reads. “Netflix and Warner Bros. will bring together highly complementary strengths and a shared passion for storytelling. By joining forces, we will offer audiences even more of the series and films they love—at home and in theaters—expand opportunities for creators, and help foster a dynamic, competitive, and thriving entertainment industry.”\nAfter WBD’s resounding rejection, David Ellison is now at a crossroads. He can either leave the negotiating table and admit defeat, or return with a better—and more expensive—offer than $30 per WBD share. There is one silver lining for Ellison and Paramount Skydance though. Comcast recently spun out its own cable business into a new company called Versant, which includes cable networks CNBC, MS NOW, and more. Versant’s shares have since fallen over 20%, which would suggest that Ellison’s promise to purchase WBD’s cable assets would put more money in shareholder pockets than spinning them out into their own company. (Some of that drop could be attributed to forced selling by index funds that often occurs during such corporate spinoffs.) But in a recent appearance on CNBC, Di Piazza said it would be a mistake to compare Warner Bros. Discovery’s cable networks to Versant. “Discovery Global is different; it has a lot more scale,” he said.\nPresident Trump looms over any deal WBD makes, as federal regulators will have to sign off on any merger. This past summer, David Ellison’s Skydance merged with Paramount and its media companies, including CBS and CBS News, with the approval of the Trump administration—which came after CBS News agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s future presidential library over a defamation lawsuit regarding the editing of a 60 Minutes interview featuring then vice president Kamala Harris. Trump has previously said that a Netflix-WBD merger “could be a problem” and has made it clear that he intends to play a role in the decision. Given the way Trump has dealt with “problems” lately (see: Nicolás Maduro), there’s no telling what might unfold.\nParamount, Netflix, and WBD did not immediately respond to Vanity Fair’s request for comment.","summary":"In a press release, Warner Bros.

I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t tough,” she told Paul. “It was a big adjustment having them come in, and then having to adjust my schedule and just kind of go about my day. It’s weird when you’re just like hanging out with your friends, a group of girls, and you have like a tall guy standing like three feet behind you.

It’s a little weird,” she said. “But I try my best not to let it bother me, and I think I’ve learned, especially in the last year now...

She told Paul that there is no “bad blood” between her and the Democrat, who is widely believed to be planning another bid for the White House in 2028.\n\n“To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely,” Kai said when Paul asked her opinion on Harris. “Like, I would never run and I don't want anything to do with politics.\n\n“I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing, and I think if both sides met in the middle, everyone would be so much more happier, and I think there's radical left, there's radical right, and there's a lot of people who get too extreme.”\n\nShe added that she was “very much in the middle” and said Harris’s frosty relationship with her grandfather “is what it is.”","summary":"The president’s granddaughter recently made her first podcast appearance speaking to Logan Paul","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kai-trump-dating-secret-service-b2896202.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/15/06/GettyImages-2246397592.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1c4wPAYi-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-07 16:03:21","author":"Brittany Miller","authors":["Brittany Miller"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":391713142,"title":"CNN's Scott Jennings: The Conservative Movement's Identity Crisis","text":"This week, guest host Billy Binion is joined by Scott Jennings, a political analyst best known for his viral debates on CNN, where he is often the lone conservative voice.

Thanks for having me in.\n\nSo you've been very critical of the mainstream media, and you're also on one of the most visible mainstream media networks. So I'm wondering, what is your objective at CNN? And do you think that you get a fair hearing on those panels?\n\nWell, my objective is to participate in debate. I think debate is good. I think the country was founded on debates—and some muskets—but also debates. And I think to the extent that we can foster more debates in our political culture, it's gonna be a good thing for America.\n\nCNN used to, years ago, sort of pioneer this. You know, this was the network of Crossfire. And then we got away from it, and there's really not that much debating content out there on the air. And so last year, they decided to do this debating show. And I thought, \"This is a great idea.\" And it's worked. I think it was supposed to be a temporary thing. And then it was so popular, they left it on the air, and it's still going here over a year later.\n\nSo my purpose is to participate in debates. My purpose is to give half, or more than half, or sometimes 90 percent of the country, like, somebody who can argue and articulate on their behalf. And I just—I'm here to pop bubbles, you know? I think it's bad when we get stuck in our ideological bubbles. I meet a lot of people in this line of work who—I might be the only Republican they know. That's a bad thing, ok? This is not a good thing for America. And so that's my purpose.\n\nDo I get a fair hearing? I mean, I think I make it more than fair out there for my point of view. I mean, certainly, there are more people out there who would disagree with me than agree at the table. And none of the hosts agree with me, of course. But no one's ever censored me. No one's ever told me, \"You can't articulate that view.\" No one has ever put a script in front of me and said, you have to do this. So to the extent that I get to do what I do and say what I wanna say, it happens every time. \n\nTo that point, why do you think that the makeup is always you being outnumbered? Do you think it would be better if it were just 50–50? What do you think about that?\n\nWell, I don't know. I'm not a television producer. I mean, I think it actually is sort of interesting when you have one person, you know, fighting a mob, you know? I mean, just for television. I mean, to me it's kind of interesting. And certainly people who are of my political persuasion like it that way. They think it's kinda neat that one guy can disarm, you know, four or five people at the same time.\n\nAt the same time, I think you could probably do quite well, you know, putting an even-handed thing out there. But for what CNN is trying to do and what they have done, I don't have any criticisms at all because they're the only network that actually has stepped its foot back into the idea that debates are a good thing to platform.\n\nI go all over the country. I hear two things: I love you and I love the debates. I don't care for you, but I love the debates. The commonality is the debates. And so CNN and our CEO, Mark Thompson, realized this and they decided to put some debates on the air. And most of the time, I think it works pretty well.\n\nCould you make a go of it with a totally evenly split show? Probably. But that's not what they've chosen to do. And that's…for me right now, that's perfectly fine. I do think there could be other evolutions of this and other iterations of it, but that—that's above my pay grade.\n\nHow do you think the legacy media is doing covering Trump this time around? Do you think it's better or do you think it's worse, the same?\n\nNot great. I mean—no, look. I think… Trump broke a lot of people—he broke a lot of institutions and he warped a lot of things. One of them is institutional media, which has decided that it needs to defeat Trump, that it needs to subdue Trump, that it needs to finally get Trump. That's different than covering Trump. And it's been that way for 10 years.\n\nAnd so do I think there are people out there covering him fairly? Yeah, I do. Do I think that there are people out there who are grinding axes and basically executing on a political agenda? Absolutely. And I think—look, I mean, don't take my word for it. Look at the Gallup poll. You know, they take this confidence-in-institutions survey every year. Trust in the mainstream media is lower than it's ever been. There's a reason for that.\n\nAnd so I think there is a way to cover Trump where you can tell the truth, and where you can be critical, and where you can shine lights. And I think there's also a way to do it where you can appear to just be grinding an ax to fit a narrative. And I think a lot of times the ax grinding and the narrative building is what you get, right?\n\nThe show versus tell quandary.\n\nYeah. And I also think, you know, a lot of mainstream media is very insular. And they don't really consider the viewpoints of people outside of their little bubble. And that's not good either.\n\nSo look, you know, I think—I believe you asked me, why am I at CNN? I believe in a free press and a trusted free press at that. I also believe in popping ideological bubbles. And I also believe that conservatives need to be represented in news organizations.\n\nSo there's a lot of reasons for someone like me to do this. But one of the ways that they could reform themselves is to take a little bit of an introspective look at: How are we covering not just Trump but all conservatives, all Republicans? How do we cover that movement or that political persuasion versus our preference?\n\nAnd if they were able to do that, I think, and do it, you know, with a really critical eye, they might find some shortcomings in what they've done. And it would help explain why people don't trust them, or why they have fled to independent journalism or independent news sources. And it might be a little bit of a roadmap back.\n\nThat is a perfect segue to something I wanted to ask you. In your book, Common Sense, you talk a lot about how the influence of the mainstream media has receded over the last few years. How have you experienced that shift? And what do you think the future of media is?\n\nWell, I've experienced it for the last 25 years in politics. You know, I'm in media now, but really, for the last quarter century, I have been a political operative. I've worked on presidential campaigns, Senate campaigns, all kinds of Republican politics stuff. I've been in public relations, and now I'm with CNN and Salem Radio.\n\nSo I've seen this from all angles. And for most of my career, what the mainstream media said in a presidential campaign mattered a lot. You know, the narratives that they would strike, the storylines, the vectors—what they said mattered a lot. It mattered, frankly, more than TV ads, or the paid advertising.\n\nThat just wasn't true in 2024. I mean, you think about what you heard in October of '24 about the narratives that were closing out the campaign—you know, all the Puerto Ricans are mad and Harris is going to win Pennsylvania because of it, or there's a poll in Iowa, or…You kept hearing these things. What they wanted people to believe the vector or the momentum of the campaign was was something altogether different than what was actually happening in the country. That was borne out on election night.\n\nAnd so what I learned in 2024 is that, probably in my career, this was the least influential the mainstream media has been in a presidential campaign cycle. Not to say that there isn't influence, and not to say that the mainstream doesn't have an impact. But in terms of overall influence, if you look at the way Trump ran around them and did all sorts of things in alternative formats, that obviously was extremely helpful to him.\n\nAnd if you looked at the ways Harris kind of ran towards the mainstream media—I mean, all she was really capable of doing was standard-issue mainstream media stuff. And even at that, she didn't do it very well. But she was not really capable of the unscripted, outside-of-the-mainstream.\n\nRight, the criticism of her was that she was inauthentic.\n\nExactly. And you have to have some of that in order to participate in the new media stuff. Trump obviously did it, and his people understood it. And they kind of ran circles around it. And so they just didn't live or die by the narratives of the mainstream media. They created their own communications ecosystem outside of that. It obviously worked.\n\nAnd so that's why I argued in the book that it seems to me that in 2024—and I said this on election night—this was kind of the death of the political information distribution complex, which has heretofore controlled the narratives in our politics. But I don't think that's true now.\n\nWe're seeing this White House prioritize some of these independent creators, smaller right-leaning outlets, which I think is interesting and good in a lot of ways. I will also say, though, some of the people who have gotten the opportunity to be in the briefing room who otherwise wouldn't have been have gotten some criticism for using the chance to kind of lob more softball questions. You know, like there was one guy who asked about, like, \"Will Big Balls get the Medal of Honor?\" or that kind of thing.\n\nI very much agree with you that the mainstream media has squandered a lot of credibility by being very deferential to one side—and very obviously so. And so I'm wondering what you think the right's role is in rectifying that.\n\nWell, I agree with you that it's good for the White House briefing room to be reformed. I think it's good that they brought in other people.\n\nLook, a lot of these people—and I'm new to this—but a lot of these people I'm learning have millions upon millions of followers. And they get lots of views. And in some cases, they have more views than certain mainstream outlets.\n\nTotally, yeah.\n\nI mean—and so in terms of audience, if I'm the White House—and the, you know, the White House that I worked for, we came just before the advent of social media. Bush 43 was kind of the last old-world White House before 24/7. You know, I think Politico came out in 2007 and then social media comes shortly thereafter.\n\nAnd so that was basically the dawn of Twitter. Right.\n\nExactly. And so we existed before. But if you had told me back in those days, well, you have all these different channels where you can talk to hundreds of thousands or millions of people without having to get, you know, hammered by The Washington Post or whatever, I would have taken it in a heartbeat.\n\nSo it's smart for the White House to do this. It's also good, because there's a lot of people that get news and information that way. So that's a good thing.\n\nYou know, the right's responsibility here, I think, is to produce honest, true content and understand that we're in a moment where the marketplace is desirous of new political content. They want it presented in authentic ways. They have questions they'd like to get answered.\n\nAnd so my only advice would be: Do something creative. Do something authentic. Do something that's pleasing to the viewer. I mean, after all, it is a business. But do something with your time if you're given a seat in there. Ask a good question. Think of something that no one else has asked.\n\nI try to do this on the shows that I'm on: What is nobody else saying? What is the question that no one else wants to ask that would lead to a line of conversation that might be new and unique to your deal?\n\nThat will enhance your position in all this. I don't want to single out or be critical of anybody who's gotten a seat in there, because I think it's good what they're doing. But if I were giving any of them advice, it would be: What's the thing nobody else is willing to ask in here that actually might be illuminating to the overall conversation? That's a good way to do it.\n\nSo right now, CNN is in the spotlight with this merger. What do you make of Trump's role in the media merger and, you know, purporting to have a voice in CNN's future?\n\nYeah, he has lots of opinions about lots of things in the media business, and that's not gonna stop—\n\nHe's a showman after all. \n\nI think it is hard. He's a television producer…\n\nRight, exactly.\n\nI mean, in some of the interactions I've had with him and observing him over the years, I think he—and look, he had one of the most successful television shows out there. He knows a little about the TV business. And so I'm not surprised that he has opinions about it.\n\nAnd of course the federal government does have some regulatory oversight here in terms of how this goes. So I don't really know how to answer that, other than to say: not surprised Trump has an opinion. And it's a little bit above my pay grade. You know, when you're talking about this amount of money, it's way above Scott Jennings' pay grade. But I don't know who's going to own it. I don't know what it's going to look like. But do I think Donald Trump is going to continue to voice an opinion about what he sees on CNN? One hundred percent.\n\nI assume he will not answer this, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Do you have a preference?\n\nI do not. I have no answer for that question, other than to tell you that I'm quite happy with my deal and quite happy with my role. And as I said earlier, for all the criticisms of the right of CNN—some warranted—it was CNN and Mark Thompson who brought back the debating format that ultimately put conservatives in a position at CNN to articulate our viewpoint.\n\nAnd look, I think that show and what we've been able to do there has actually made CNN safe again, you know, for some conservatives to watch it and to come back on it. I've noticed since we put that show on the air, there are now more Republican elected officials who are willing to come on and do interviews and do things.\n\nYou've been there since 2017. Did you feel like they were skeptical before of coming on?\n\nYes. Oh, I think we went through a period where a lot of Republicans did not want to come on. They didn't feel like they were going to get a fair hearing. And I think we were having trouble booking Republicans at one time. I mean, there's always, you know, a person here or there. But now it feels to me—and I don't have any metrics to back this up—it just feels to me now like there are more Republicans willing to engage with CNN.\n\nI attribute some of that to what we've been doing with the debates, because it shows that CNN actually does have a commitment to allowing people with authentic conservative views to voice those views and not feel like they're just going to be shouted down or run out of the room or, you know, maligned for eight minutes or however long they're on there.\n\nSo I'll just say, however this goes, whatever happens, it is CNN right now that's giving the American people debates. And I don't think anybody else is doing that.\n\nFor the listeners who are very online, they may know that sometimes there is like a gossip cycle when, you know, when you are pictured with someone like Kaitlan Collins or something like that. Before we move on to, you know, politics in general, can you just talk about the relationships off the camera? Why you think that animates people so?\n\nYeah. Well, first of all, the people who work at CNN—we're very collegial internally. We have a community. In fact, it's one of the best parts of the job, actually, is the people who've been there together for a number of years. We spend a lot of time together, and in some cases we even travel a lot together.\n\nMy two best friends at the network are Van Jones and David Axelrod—interestingly.\n\nStaunch Dems. \n\nAnd I love them both and have really benefited, I think, from knowing them and conversing…\n\nDavid Axelrod was an Obama guy, right? \n\nHe was Obama's chief strategist.\n\nRight, right, right.\n\nAnd Van Jones, you know, is one of the most prominent left-wing commentators, Obama White House staffer, and has been aligned with a lot of left-wing causes and organizations.\n\nBut I think they're both—look, the best debaters and commentators have experience, are thoughtful, they listen. I mean, you can always tell the difference between the good and the bad out there. The people who can only sort of say what they wrote down in advance versus the ones who listen and can engage in the debate.\n\nVan and Axe are debaters, and they listen and then they can react. Those are the best kinds.\n\nBut off the air, those are my buddies. And with the anchors—I mean, I have great relationships with the people that I'm on the air with. I mean, I think we have some interesting and sometimes heated exchanges, but I respect what they do. I think they respect what I do. And the community of CNN has actually been quite a pleasant thing to be involved in.\n\nI want to talk about the changing GOP. Something that's always kind of fascinated me. And I would like to preface this by saying I do not mean this as a gotcha. You know, in preparing for this interview, I saw that in the 2016 election, you weren't necessarily Trump's biggest fan. \n\nNine years ago, correct.\n\nAnd you were worried that he might have some authoritarian tendencies. For the record, I mean it when I say I don't want this to be a gotcha, because there are a lot of Republicans who share that—our vice president being one of them—who has kind of had this evolution over time. And I'm wondering for you what that journey was like, if there was like an aha moment, if there was something that really changed your mind, or if it was gradual. How did that happen for you?\n\nWell, in 2016, like a lot of Republicans, I didn't really know Donald Trump other than just Donald Trump the entertainer, the businessman, whatever he was. And I wasn't trained in his style of politics. I never thought of him as a Republican political actor. I didn't know him. And he comes along, and I guess the best way to describe it is, I just was completely and totally unfamiliar with him or with an election cycle where someone from outside the party would come and take control of the party.\n\nSo in 2016—my unfamiliarity with him and, you know, questions about him—I did have a lot of questions about him. I did vote for him. Voted for him three times, actually. And probably just fast forwarding to 2024, felt closer to him in '24 than I ever felt. And I'll get to why that is in a moment.\n\nBut back in the early days, I, along with millions of Republicans, were somewhat skeptical and didn't really know what to make of it.\n\nI'll tell you one thing: Had he not won the election—you know, I wonder what would have happened to the Supreme Court, for instance. And that was one of my motivating things about my vote for him. I actually think it's one of the reasons he won the election. Mitch McConnell holding open that Supreme Court seat—I think this is one thing that a lot of Republicans looked at and said, you know, \"I don't know a lot about Trump…\"\n\nI remember that news cycle. It was very controversial. \n\n\"I don't know a lot about Trump, and I'm not a little sure about it, but I sure as heck don't want Hillary Clinton filling this.\" And so, I mean, that changed everything. And so that was persuasive to me at the time.\n\nSo, you know, Trump—there's not a politician alive that I agree with 100 percent of the time. Not even the ones that I like very much. And certainly Trump has done things over the years that I, you know, wish he hadn't done that, or I would have done it differently. The same was true for George W. Bush. The same is true for Mitch McConnell.\n\nBut I'll tell you this: If he does 95 percent of what I want, and the left does 0 percent of what I want, it's an easy choice for me every time.\n\nYou mentioned McConnell, who was one of your mentors, correct?\n\nI would not have gone to college, I don't think, if it hadn't been for Mitch McConnell. \n\nWhy is that?\n\nWell ok, I'm a poor kid from west Kentucky. I'm the son of a garbage man and a factory worker. I didn't have much.\n\nAnd I got a scholarship to go to the University of Louisville at the McConnell Center for Political Leadership. They give a scholarship to 10 kids a year. I got one of them, and it's a full ride to the University of Louisville. Now, this changed my life. It changed the trajectory of my life.\n\nAnd so—he doesn't pick the kids, and he raises the money for the scholarship. But had that not existed for me, I don't know what would have happened to me. And later on, I did work on his political operations and political campaigns over the years. He's been a mentor.\n\nWhat was the most important lesson you learned from him in politics? And do you think that there was a failure of that version of the Republican Party that left open this opening for Trump? Or is that a misunderstanding of why Trump is now kind of the leader of the Republican Party?\n\nWhat did I learn from Mitch McConnell?\n\nNumber one: focus. I think in campaigns, it's easy to chase every tail out there. You know, it's like—lots of things happen. What actually matters, and what do you have to focus on? So don't chase your tail. Focus is important.\n\nNumber two, in terms of just tactically—you know, McConnell's kind of famous for: If you throw a pebble at me, I'll throw a boulder at you. And in some ways, he and Trump are actually quite similar in that. Now, they're different attitudinally…different disposition. McConnell's not a showman, Trump is. But in some ways, I perceive similarities in their desire to thoroughly destroy their political enemies in the heat of a campaign.\n\nI recognize that trait in both of them. But really, it's focus and a willingness to do what you have to do to win. McConnell never lost a race, even in a state that, when he started, was extremely Democratic. There's a reason for that. And so I really, you know, as a political operative, learned a lot from Mitch McConnell on that.\n\nDo I think he led to the rise of Donald Trump? No. I think that—\n\nI didn't mean him specifically. I more so just mean that kind of older version of the Republican Party. There was something that was missing.\n\nOh, well, I think that a lot of people voted for Trump and liked Trump because of the way he handles our perceived enemies—whether it's the media or whether it is the Democrats. I think there was a perception, certainly in 2016, that in coming out of the 2012 election—which I also worked in—that the party had just, you know, basically rolled over to the left, rolled over to the Clintons, rolled to the media, whatever.\n\nAnd you talk about in your book kind of like how when you were an operative, compassionate conservatism was the response to a lot of these things, right? Like you just need to be nicer.\n\nWell, yes. But, you know, as a tactical matter, I think there was a belief among Republicans that we just sort of turned the other cheek all the time to people who were never going to do the same for us or give us the benefit of the doubt. Why should we do that for them?\n\nAnd look at 2012. I mean, most Republicans would tell you that Mitt Romney was eminently qualified, eminently moral, had good ideas—and what did they do to him? They called him a murderer. They assailed him for having the controversial idea that he might appoint more women to the government.\n\nThese are the things that made Mitt Romney history's greatest monster. And we just did not effectively understand what we were dealing with. And Trump comes along and says, \"No, no. I get it. I am going to fight these people to the end.\" And it was that fighting spirit that people believed the 2012 operation lacked, the '08 operation lacked, that even back in the Bush years—you know, why do you allow yourself to be consumed by these entities that exist only to consume and destroy Republican presidencies and Republican presidential candidates?\n\nSo I think what Trump provided was, \"Hey, whatever happens, whatever we do, I promise you I will not be consumed by these people who have eaten up everybody else we've nominated for years.\"\n\nIn your book, you talk a lot about the Republican Party being the party that takes a stand against big government. And I think particularly emblematic of that in the book is—you talk about Elon Musk's kind of fracture with Donald Trump over the One Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\nAnd, you know, Elon Musk, of course, being the tech entrepreneur who was very close to Trump with the Department of Government Efficiency, leading that agency for a time before he left a few months into the administration. Elon Musk famously said that a bill can be big and it can be beautiful but it might not be able to be both.\n\nWhat do you make of that? The criticism, I guess, of the One Big, Beautiful Bill was that over 10 years it was going to raise the national debt by somewhere between $2.4 and $3 trillion. Is that compatible with a party that wants to spend responsibly?\n\nWell, the White House disputes that. I mean, the White House's disputing of that is: Look, we're locking in permanent tax rates. We're deregulating energy. We're creating, effectively, an engine for more economic growth, which will create more tax revenue, which will not explode the deficit. I mean, that is their counterpoint to your argument.\n\nBut Elon—I interviewed him for the book on Trump's 101st day in office. And I could tell he was a little bit out of shape with Washington generally at the time. I don't think he believes he found anyone in Washington who shared his urgency for all the things—particularly fiscal—that he thought were going to lead to the downfall of the country. And he obviously did not agree with this bill.\n\nI do think maybe he had some misunderstandings about the vehicle of reconciliation and what the purpose of this bill was versus other things that he might want to do that I don't actually think are mutually exclusive. I think you can do the Big, Beautiful Bill, and I think you can also meaningfully tackle our fiscal situation. But they weren't going to happen in the same vehicle.\n\nAnd so, you know—anyway, I guess it's water under the bridge now, because they're back together. But I think, just to focus on the book for a moment, my impression of Elon is that he believes one of the things that is going to lead to the downfall of America is this debt that we have, and that it will lead to the devaluing of our currency, and that this will put us into a fiscal spiral when combined with mass migration, when combined with low birth rates.\n\nYou can see these huge forces rapidly leading to the decline of America. That's what he believes. But a lot of it is wrapped up in the idea that we have this debt, we're not dealing with it, no one here cares about it all that much, and I'm kind of frustrated with Washington over it.\n\nRight. I edit an economist for Reason, named Veronique de Rugy, who's a very talented economist at the Mercatus Center, she wrote something along the lines of—and I would wonder if you'd agree with this, being a former political operative—\"The House agrees to spend one dollar, the Senate agrees for two dollars, and then we end up spending three dollars?\"\n\nYou know, the idea being that somehow spending is just—I mean, what is the solution to that?\n\nWell, the one issue that we've never sort of dealt with is, three-quarters of federal spending is non-discretionary. It's basically on autopilot. And then you have a quarter of it that's discretionary. So you can adjust that and change that, but if all you're ever dealing with is the quarter that's discretionary, and you don't ever touch the non-discretionary piece, you can see how you'll never meaningfully get your arms around it.\n\nUltimately, if you really wanted to tackle this, it's going to require some pretty massive structural changes in entitlements and other things that are effectively just on autopilot right now. That, coupled with some kind of long-term period of growth, would—in a conservative's mind—make a difference in this. We just haven't really grappled with the idea that roughly three-quarters of the federal budget is just on autopilot, and tinkering with the 25 percent is never really going to catch up on it.\n\nTotally. And there seems to be misunderstanding that you can get away with not reforming things like Social Security and Medicare and that kind of thing. I mean, it feels like a political death wish to even suggest it. You know, Rand Paul is—I feel like—the only person who's like, \"Hello?\" Thomas Massie, that kind of strain of the Republican Party.\n\nInterestingly, by the way, just to cut in for a moment. When I asked Elon, for the book, \"Did you meet anyone in Washington that you actually think gets it?\" He only gave me one name, and it was Rand Paul.\n\nInteresting. What do you think of that?\n\nWell, they're both more libertarian, right? I mean, they come from that wing of the conservative thinking. If Elon—I didn't really ask him what he considers his political ideology to be. I assume he would describe himself as more libertarian than anything. But that was the one person that he named.\n\nAnd then again, they tend to think about our fiscal situation in more drastic terms than the average, you know, other Republican. Or at least more drastic terms in what they're willing to say about it. Plus, you have Trump on top of all that, who's made a long-term campaign promise: I will not cut Social Security and Medicare. That's not something I'm interested in doing. He got ahead of that early on and has really never wavered from it.\n\nThere was one quote from Elon Musk in the book that I wanted to see if you—I wasn't sure what he meant. He said something to the effect of: \"Not all Democrats are criminals, but all criminals are Democrats.\" What do you think he meant by that?\n\nWell, he believes that Democrats and the Democratic Party have gone all in on protecting illegal alien populations on the one hand. And on the other hand, they have dedicated themselves to criminal justice reform that seems to be only aimed at allowing violent criminals to roam the streets and let them out of jail, and so on and so forth.\n\nSo he's looking at these two issues saying, \"What is it about the Democratic Party that they're coddling illegal populations and coddling violent criminals? And this seems to be where all their energy is.\"\n\nFrankly, I think he's onto something here, as a political matter. I think it's one of the things that's holding down Democrats' ability to rise up above where they currently sit. I mean, the image of the Democratic Party is quite low, and it has been low now coming out of the 2024 election.\n\nTo me, those two issues I mentioned are a big reason why people look at them and say, \"Well, you don't really seem to spend any time on just the average law-abiding American citizen, but you spend a lot of time on illegal aliens, and you spend a lot of time letting people out of jail. What are you doing for me, the person who follows the laws, pays his or her taxes, and just is trying to make it in this world?\"\n\nI think it's one of the biggest anchors around their party right now.\n\nI want to talk a little bit about free speech. In your book, you say that Trump's respect for free speech is something that connects him to some of your former bosses. You said that's something that will help preserve Western civilization, which is a big theme in your book.\n\nI think Trump has gotten some criticism for not being super friendly towards free speech. A few examples being, this woman from the Tufts entering deportation proceedings over an op-ed that she co-authored, the Jimmy Kimmel thing, where the FCC had, you know, I guess there was a—and there was schism in the conservative movement over this too, right? Whether that was jawboning or not.\n\nSimilar to the Biden administration trying to pressure social media companies to censor certain types of content. And then you have people like Stephen Miller saying things like, you know, calling someone a fascist—which is often an inappropriate thing to call someone—but that that is an incitement to violence, which is not compatible with, in my view, a reading of the First Amendment.\n\nBecause the First Amendment is also supposed to protect, you know, kind of detestable speech. If it was just popular speech, you wouldn't have it. How do you think that the actions comport with the First Amendment?\n\nSo let me just start with the Millers, because I know them a little. Stephen and his wife, Katie, have to live on a military base because they can't live in a house like you or me, because they're under constant security threat. So I'm a little defensive of them on this.\n\nI will say that's terrible. Unacceptable.\n\nAnd I sit at a table a lot of nights where I hear people throw around words like \"fascist\" and \"Nazi\" and \"white supremacist,\" and so on and so forth. That's the go-to insult to people who they just politically don't like. And they often ascribe it to Stephen Miller and Katie Miller. And I think it's wrong.\n\nAnd so I think their perspective is quite different than mine and yours, which is, you know: Gosh, is it an incitement to violence? I don't know. I'm the one living on a military base because I can't raise my children out in the open. So that's number one.\n\nAnd look, I think if you look at some of the violent attacks that have emanated from the left—I mean, they tend to use the language that you just used. Either etching it on the bullets or, you know, in describing their worldview: \"I'm going to get the fascist.\" You know? I mean, there does seem to be a connection between that language and the violent attacks on that front.\n\nI think you could pick out any individual moment and say, \"Oh, what about this? What about that?\" Generally, my argument is: Trump is friendlier to speech and friendlier to the First Amendment and friendlier to the press than virtually any other president in my lifetime.\n\nLook at the number of questions this man takes on a daily basis. Look at how open his Cabinet secretaries and his staff are. They're in constant, open dialogue with the press all the time. I mean, I actually regard this as a good thing. It's a transparent thing.\n\nThe people asking the questions may not like all the answers, but compare that situation that we have today to the Biden years. When you can't talk to the president. And when you are talking to him, it's not—I mean, he's reading notes off of cards that his staff has handed him about who he's talking to and what he needs to say to that person.\n\nIt was embarrassing. And then I'll tell you one other thing. I talked to that character Chris Whipple the other night, who—\n\nVanity Fair.\n\nYeah, who interviewed Susie Wiles now to great fanfare. And he was saying, \"Well, you know, honestly, she's transparent, she's candid, she's blunt.\" And then he was comparing it to his time trying to interview the Biden people.\n\nAnd he said to me, he said, you try to interview them and it's like, \"Well, I'll do it, but it's gotta be on background, you can't use my name, and you have to send me all the quotes in advance for approval\"—the opposite of transparency.\n\nAnd so when I think about the way this government operates and how transparent it is to the average American—love it or hate it—it's very transparent to you. I think you can make a really fair argument that his commitment to free speech and the First Amendment is really high.\n\nCan you pick out anecdotal moments where you could make an argument that they didn't adhere to that? Absolutely.\n\nTed Cruz, for instance, took them on over the Jimmy Kimmel thing. Now, I think Brendan Carr had a point on the Jimmy Kimmel thing. And all the late-night shows, you know, they get away with portraying themselves as, you know, the \"get-the-news\" carveout or whatever. And so that means they can have on 275 Democrats and never have on a single Republican. And it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nAnd what Jimmy Kimmel did in that monologue everybody was mad about was also blatantly false and kind of ridiculous.\n\nIs Jimmy Kimmel still on the air? Yes. Did anything materially bad happen to Jimmy Kimmel? No. And so, do I think it's ok for the administration to have a point of view about people who may be abusing their position in that way? Sure.\n\nSo, you know, without quibbling over every single moment, I would say that, looking comparatively at Biden and also looking comparatively at Obama—their transparency to and treatment of the press and the media in general—far more open, open kimono, than what you got out of the last two Democrats.\n\nWhat do you make of some of the lawsuits, like the lawsuit against 60 Minutes, for instance? I would be interested to hear your thoughts on that. For listeners who don't know, he had sued 60 Minutes for allegedly deceptively editing an interview with Kamala Harris. That was his view.\n\nWell, I think his view is that some mainstream media does things to help his opponents instead of presenting information fairly to the public. And so, you know, he filed a lawsuit over it. You know, my view is, if they were so sure they hadn't done that, why not fight it out?\n\nCould part of that, though, like—you know, there is some, I think, anxiety in the business community over whether or not he will approve some of these business deals and that kind of thing. Could that be part of it?\n\nI mean, look, I don't know. I'm not those people. All I know is that I don't know that 60 Minutes necessarily has the cleanest track record over time when it comes to how they present information to the public.\n\nAnd look, Trump has also, as a tactical matter, said, \"I have priorities, and sometimes I'm going to use the courts to enforce those priorities.\" He's done the same thing with universities when it comes to what they're allowing on their campuses as it relates to antisemitism and violence around antisemitism.\n\nAnd so, you know, look, I think if you felt real clean about this and you felt great about what you did, you wouldn't have had any worries at all stepping into a courtroom or into a deposition. Maybe they felt otherwise.\n\nYou mentioned the Vanity Fair profile, briefly. I would be Interested to hear your general thoughts on it.\n\nYeah, I first of all, I think Wiles…\n\nHis chief of staff.\n\nSusie—is, I mean, incredibly blunt, transparent, and candid. And sometimes I think the chief of staff, or top sort of consigliere for a president, can say things that presidents can't say. Maybe there's a message in that. I don't think she does anything by accident. And I think everything she does is intentional and meant to ultimately serve the president's interests as she sees it fit, trying to execute his agenda and deliver messages. I don't think any of these things happen by accident.\n\nLook, I'll go back to my answer previous. Do I think it's a good thing that this administration is pretty darn transparent and has opinions and views, and they're not afraid to air those views? Quite interesting. I actually think it is good. \n\nThat was my take, for the record.\n\nI don't know what the problem is. I mean, I think in Washington, it's so unusual for administrations to be transparent instead of, say, opaque and sycophantic like you had during Biden, that it freaked everyone out. But out in the country, it was like, wait a minute, she just answered questions honestly? Ok, what's the problem with that?\n\nI mean, to me, the biggest problem with the deal was the photographer.\n\nI was gonna say, the photos were ridiculous.\n\nIt was terrible. \n\nIt was mean-girl behavior.\n\nExactly. And so, you know, we talked earlier about the press. What's the state of the press right now? That's the state of the press. So you get the White House chief of staff and these senior staffers to participate with you, and what do you do? You mean girl them with these photographs.\n\nI mean, doesn't that just prove to the average conservative that there's no reason to engage with the mainstream media? I mean, here the Trump people show up and say, \"Ok, we'll do it, we'll participate.\" And you reward that behavior and that attitude with, you know, putting like a super close-up picture of Karoline Leavitt in there. I mean, it was ridiculous—\n\nWhere you can see every pore.\n\nI mean, look, so the next Republican administration, whoever that is—J.D. Vance or whatever—and Vanity Fair is gonna come calling, what would you say if you were their press people? Look what they did to Trump. They're gonna do it to you too.\n\nAnd so I think there's a lesson in this for the mainstream media, which is, do you want engagement with Republicans or do you not? Because that kind of behavior tells me, perhaps you don't.\n\nAnother interesting part of your book was the idea that Trump essentially would workshop policy at crowds. You had talked about your experience with polling and how it's very unreliable—and not very, but it can be unreliable—and how he would kind of workshop ideas, like measure the applause. Which is interesting to me.\n\nThere has been some polling that has come out recently, that Americans—though they voted for Trump in large part on his immigration policy—are uncomfortable with some of the deportations and the kind of, you know, very muscular approach to them. I think the last poll that came out was from Pew Research, and its 53 percent of Americans are not so sure about it anymore, which has been steadily growing. Does that mean that he should change course?\n\nWell, first of all, I think Americans are being lied to, frankly, about what they're doing with immigration. I think there is a propaganda campaign going on out there to mislead people. I sit in these debates sometimes, and I hear flippant things said like, \"Well, you know, they're detaining and deporting Americans every day,\" which is just simply not true. Absolutely not true.\n\nAnd I think certain situations are portrayed to make it look like ICE agents are doing things untoward, when, if you looked at the situation in context or you looked at all the details, you would say, \"Oh, that—that's actually what a reasonable person would have done.\"\n\nThe one the other day about, \"Oh, they raided a daycare center.\" Well, no. They were chasing an illegal alien who then pulled into the daycare center and ran inside. And then—you know—or, \"They're zip-tying children,\" which didn't happen. But they do sometimes separate children from dangerous situations, where they're—I don't know—in a building with a bunch of MS-13 people.\n\nSo I think the way this is being portrayed is having an impact on the polling. That's number one.\n\nNumber two, I think if, after 10 years, you're unsure about what Donald Trump's intentions are on immigration, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, this is the number one motivating and animating issue for this man since he started his running for president back in 2015.\n\nHe has signaled forever that he intends to deport illegal immigrant populations, that he intends to close the border, and that he intends to enforce existing laws. We haven't passed any new laws on immigration since Trump became the president—zero laws. We are simply enforcing the ones that are on the books.\n\nAnd I—my personal view is it's still his best issue. It is still the expectation of the people who voted for him that he would do this. And again, I think he's up against quite a propaganda machine right now to portray what ICE is doing as something untoward or illegal or un-American, when in fact all he's really told them to do is simply enforce the existing laws.\n\nSure. The poll referencing it was essentially drawing a distinction between, you know, deporting the violent criminal and deporting the gardener who's been here and been otherwise law-abiding. Do you see those as distinct, or do you think, \"Oh, you're in this country illegally, you gotta go?\"\n\nWell, look, I think they're two different kinds of people. And I think they are deporting violent people. Again, I think part of the propaganda of this is to say, \"Oh, they're ignoring the violent criminals and they're only deporting—\" \n\nYes, they have definitely deported some violent criminals. One hundred percent, they have.\n\nBut do I think there are two different types of people? Yes.\n\nI think the question for them—and I'll put myself in position as defending their position, which is: How permissive do you want to be? Because a permissive attitude on any part of it then emboldens people to come here.\n\nAnd I think they would argue that the permissive nature of our immigration enforcement is what led people to come here by the millions in the first place. And so when you start to loosen up on it and say, \"Well, you might be ok if you came here,\" or \"Well, this kind of person might be OK if they broke our laws\"—then all of a sudden, you get back to a permissive situation where people start showing up saying, \"Well, maybe I'll fit into one of the permissive categories.\"\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable for them to assume that any permissive attitude would immediately reopen the floodgates.\n\nSo, look, I give them a lot of latitude here because they inherited a complete and total mess. The border was open. Millions of people came here.\n\nAlso, look how hard it is to get rid of people. I mean, Kilmer Abrego Garcia somehow is still in the United States. The man's seen 20 judges, has an existing deportation order, and all sorts of bad evidence—and somehow is—the so-called \"Maryland man\" is somehow still here in the United States.\n\nAll these people came here. It's very difficult to get them out.\n\nI think for a Republican voter, for someone who thinks he's basically right about immigration, I give them some latitude.\n\nI'll just say one other thing. I know he hears about this issue from people in agriculture and also people who are in trades that depend on immigrant labor. And so his base is not unified on exactly what to do.\n\nHis administration isn't either.\n\nYes. He's got different voices in his ear—internally and externally—about what to do and how to do it. And there have even been stories in the first year where it sounded like there were internal deliberations, specifically when it comes to agriculture, about: Ok, well, what do we do about this particular sector?\n\nSo even, I think, in his own mind, he's probably hearing from people who are saying, like, \"Well, we like basically what you're doing on immigration, but you're going to have to carve out X so that we can continue to do this kind of business.\"\n\nI know he's hearing about that. I don't know that they've really settled on that internally about how to deal with it. But this is a situation where Trump has a pretty large coalition. And on this issue, I think there's a lot of agreement that it was broken. There's a lot of agreement that he needed to do something about it.\n\nAnd there's some disagreement about, Ok, what to do about it as a prescription here. Because there are some interests inside of his coalition that probably tend towards more permissive than \"deport them all.\"\n\nI will add with the Kilmer Abrego Garcia case—and that was initially because he was deported to a country that he was not supposed to be deported to, correct? El Salvador—he had withholding of deportation from the country, which has made this process longer than it otherwise would have been. I just—I feel the need to…\n\nAnd why was he—and why was—why did he get a withholding? Because he claimed it was unsafe for him to go there. OK.\n\nI mean, look, I don't want to make the whole interview about this particular case, but to the average person, this is ridiculous.\n\nThe guy came here in, like, 2011 or 2012, lived in the country illegally for 13 years, at some point got a deportation order, still was somehow living in the United States because they argued he couldn't go back to where he came from.\n\nAnd since that moment, his lawyers, I guess, successfully have argued he's not able to go anywhere else either.\n\nThat's how hard it is to get rid of one illegal alien who is clearly, you know, not an upstanding—well, citizen's not the right word. He's clearly not an upstanding person, if you believe the evidence that's come out against him in a lot of different fronts. And yet still in the United States.\n\nSo, look, I see why Trump gets latitude from people on immigration. Because they look at that case and they say,\" I don't get it. If you came here illegally and you lived here illegally, and yet you did get due process because a judge saw your case and gave you a deportation—even if the Trump people messed up by sending him back to one country—why isn't he being sent somewhere else?\"\n\nAnd then, at the same time, they look at a United States senator like Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who spends his time flying down there to meet with this guy. I mean, he's an illegal alien living in Maryland. This is not your constituent, ok? Like, this is not who you are elected to represent, and yet that's—you've made this your cause of the year.\n\nI think it's confusing to most Americans.\n\nI do think if there's one thing we can agree on in this issue area, it is that the immigration system is incredibly red-tapey and it's bogged down by an enormous amount of cases and not enough judges. I think that is something that would be—Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, whatever—would be interested in addressing that.\n\nWell, look—also, it's not just one judge or one part of it. In Wisconsin the other day, you had a state judge in Wisconsin who was convicted of helping an illegal immigrant—an illegal alien—in her courtroom evade ICE. And this happened back in April. And all the liberal legal intelligentsia came out and said, \"Oh, this will never make it to a jury. This is an outrageous abuse of power.\"\n\nShe was convicted of obstruction. She may go to jail for five years. So you have elected judges in certain places who think it's their job to help illegal aliens somehow evade federal law enforcement.\n\nSo it's more than just red tape. It's more than just bureaucracy. It's malign actors in the system who are supposed to be upholding the laws who are helping illegal aliens evade the laws.\n\nAgain, just put yourself in the shoes of an average American citizen. You're looking at this thinking, \"If I broke laws like this, would a judge help me evade law enforcement?\" I doubt it.\n\nI would like to think that most judges are doing their best.\n\nI know you'd like to think that. And I would like to think that as well. Unfortunately, we keep getting examples of judges who believe it's their job to upend Trump's stated policy as opposed to uphold the law.\n\nThis is where I have a problem. Even if you are a judge who's very liberal and you hate Donald Trump and you hate everything he did…\n\nYou're supposed to be applying the laws as written.\n\nYes. And it seems to me that a number of judges and a number of parts of the bureaucracy have said, \"Well, I'm going to put my political interests ahead of my duties to the law.\" That's wrong.\n\nAnd it would be wrong if a conservative judge were applying their views to a Democratic president. I mean, the thing is, you're either a nation of laws or you're not. And in this case, we have parts of our judiciary that have decided, \"I'm applying politics. I'm not applying the law.\"\n\nAnd it's happening even at the Supreme Court. When you look at the decisions and the renderings of a Ketanji Brown Jackson—I mean, she clearly believes she was put there to be a political actor, not apply the law. And she's pretty open about that. That destroys confidence in the rule of law and in our overall judicial system.\n\nAs an aside, I will say that Congress could do its job and change the laws that people are unhappy with.\n\nThey could. Well, on immigration, you're 100 percent right. If you don't like that we deport people, you can change the laws.\n\nThat's always my argument is that the Congress is supposed to be the one making that call.\n\nTrump has passed no immigration laws. He is enforcing laws that have existed and that he inherited. And somehow people are mad at him.\n\nI interviewed Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, earlier this year for my radio show. He's been with the agency for a long time. He told me during Biden, they were instructed not to enforce the laws. Trump simply said, \"Just enforce the laws.\"\n\nWouldn't most people think it was reasonable to enforce the laws as they're written? And if you're mad about it, ask Congress to change them. I couldn't agree with you more. But right now, the laws are what they are. They should be enforced. \n\nCongress should do something. On trade, I want to talk about trade. Your book is called A Revolution of Common Sense. I think some would argue that the tariff regime has not necessarily been commonsensical. Like on Liberation Day, when tariffs and that sort of thing—the tariff regime has changed a lot. It's oscillated a bunch. And that has created, I think, some instability in the private sector. You know, and also we've seen manufacturing lose jobs for seven months in a row when it was supposed to help manufacturing.\n\nHow do you reconcile that with common sense? Is that common sense?\n\nSo the tariff—I write about this extensively in the book. I'm of two minds on it. One, as a Republican political operative for the last 25 years from the pre-Trump era, I was not trained to believe that tariffs or taxation was a good economic model. We believed in the Ronald Reagan theory on this. This was the way the party had existed for decades before I came along—and certainly after I came along. And I write about that in the book.\n\nOn the other hand, as someone who grew up in rural western Kentucky with parents who were in and out of factories and who dealt with layoffs and dealt with sort of the hollowing out of our manufacturing economy, I understand the impulse to try to do something about that, and the impulse of some voters to look at the situation and say, \"Well, they told us that if we engaged in all this free trade, it would inure to our benefit. But all we've ever seen is job losses and outsourcing and so on and so forth.\"\n\nI also understand that. I personally lived it.\n\nSo—and I also think that it's true that when it comes to Republican orthodoxy, this is the area where Trump has changed it the most. I mean, I can't think of another area where…\n\n…it's kind of 1950s protectionist Democrat vibes.\n\nWell, 1990s protectionist Democrat.\n\nI mean, look, a lot of the Clinton—my dad's one of them; I write about him in the book—a lot of the biggest Clinton guys, the union Clinton guys, are now the biggest Trump guys. \n\nWe inherited all those people and some of their economic theories.\n\nThat's the biggest change to the Republican platform—is Trump's belief in tariffs. I think in his heart of hearts, if he could reorganize everything, there'd be no IRS, there'd be no income tax. We'd just be a tariff-based nation. We would do everything based on tariffs. That's what he believes. He's, by the way, never going to change.\n\nWell, he's believed that since, like, the '70s.\n\nIt's his longest-held belief. It's his most deeply held belief. And even though he's negotiated around the edges, he would also tell you it's not just an economic theory.\n\nFor him, he would say that most of the peace agreements that he's negotiated this year have been based on the use of—or threat of the use—tariffs. He would say it's a tool of diplomacy, and it's a tool just of the projection of American power to be able to level and levy tariffs.\n\nBy the way, I don't know what the Supreme Court is going to do on this. The arguments did not go well for the administration. They haven't rendered a decision yet. We'll see what happens. But I'll tell you this: If they throw it out, he'll be very unhappy. Like, it won't be pretty. If I were John Roberts, I wouldn't check my Twitter that day.\n\nSo for me and a lot of Republicans, reconciling this has been interesting. Because on the one hand, it's not traditional conservative economic theory. On the other hand, a lot of our constituents actually believe somebody's got to do something about the hollowing out of middle America.\n\nAnd so it's probably one of the things I've had to think about the hardest, in terms of: How am I going to debate this? How am I gonna argue it?\n\nIt is one of your longer sections in the book.\n\nYeah. Well, and I think for a lot of Republicans, it's the thing they've had to sort of learn about the most and come to grips with the most with Trump. He has basically done most of what you would expect a Republican to do: cut taxes, reduce regulations, put conservatives on the judiciary. I mean, these are all things you would expect a Republican to do.\n\nOn tariffs, that's the one thing you wouldn't expect a Republican to do. And so to absorb that and to learn about it—I get the theories behind it. He would sit here and argue to you that we're bringing in all this revenue, and it's going to help us do a lot of different things. And so we're going to have to see how it works out.\n\nI will say one more thing about it, and that is, what they're doing overall with the economy is not a quick-fix thing. I think people—you know, I used to have a boss years ago in politics who said, \"Instant coffee ruined the world.\" People wanted an instant fix to a very, very deep hole. What they're trying to do is completely reorganize our economy and reorganize the way we do business with the rest of the world. This will take a very long time to fully flesh itself out.\n\nAnd that may not comport with what voters want in November, or what they decide they want in November of 2028. But I think what they're doing was not designed to work in 30 days. It was designed to work over years. And they would say, \"Look, of course it's designed to work over years because it took years to dig this hole—for America's manufacturing economy. It took years to dig this hole in forgotten America. And it's going to take us years to dig out of it.\n\nBut this is the way out.\"\n\nAgain, the great question in politics is—whether you're right or wrong is almost irrelevant. It's whether the voters are patient enough with your solutions. And in this case, what they have put forward is a long-term restructuring of our economy that again may not ultimately comport with the patience level of American voters.\n\nRelatedly, there's a quote that sticks out to me from Trump that he's said a few times about how, \"You don't need many dolls, you just need two dolls. Every kid, you don't need 20 dolls,\" or whatever. To me, that is somewhat of a tacit admission that in order for this to work, you kind of have to go with less.\n\nWhat do you make of that? And is that a viable political platform when everyone's talking about the importance of abundance?\n\nYeah. If I were advising him, I would tell him I don't think that's the correct communications vector on this. I actually think he has good arguments for what he's doing. That is not the best one, is my view.\n\nI want to very briefly talk about DOGE. You're talking to a libertarian magazine, so this was a…\n\nGreat idea for you. \n\nMade us hopeful. Why do you think it kind of didn't work out as promised? In the book, I think the number you reference is it saved about $160 billion, which is, as you know, not even a drop in the taxpayer bucket. Why did it not live up to its promise?\n\nAnd this morning I read that they're now saying it's over $200 billion. I haven't looked to see what the latest savings are, but that's the latest from the administration.\n\nHere's what I think. I think that the public relations of DOGE—and I say this in the book—was probably the worst it could have been. If they had really wanted to maximize the impact of DOGE, some of it would have been PR and political, meaning: We have to immediately involve the Congress in this, we have to immediately involve the public in this, and we have to do it on a rolling basis.\n\nI think the impulse behind DOGE was exactly correct, because people inherently know the government spends too much money and on a bunch of crap that no reasonable person with common sense would spend.\n\nYou outline several kinds of crazy projects.\n\nWell, Trump did it in March when he spoke to Congress. You know, that was one of the most effective parts of his speech: \"We spent this here and this here. Nobody knows what that is. Nobody knows where that is.\" That was brilliant.\n\nSo I think—but I think they missed an opportunity to ingrain this in the political culture in Washington in a way that they could have. I think there were Republicans on the Hill who wanted to be part of that. And they set up a DOGE caucus or whatever. But if it had been me, I would have been doing a weekly—you know, every Thursday afternoon we're going up to the Hill and giving them our latest stuff. That would have sort of forced it to become part of the ongoing culture of what Republicans would do when they're in charge. They didn't really do that.\n\nNumber two, again—I'll go back to what we talked about earlier. I think they were only dealing with the discretionary pieces of the government. DOGE did not get into the non-discretionary part of the government. And if you were going to DOGE the non-discretionary part, it would necessitate political buy-in from the Hill.\n\nLook, I still think it was a good project. I think the impulse is correct. I think that the American people want it. I think getting rid of some of the things they did was great. I think more could be done.\n\nBut to get to the non-discretionary pieces of the budget would require more political buy-in from just a project that was set up within the executive branch. And, you know, we'll see what the next administration wants to do with it, if it's a Republican administration. I think they need to keep going.\n\nI mean, I think when you hear these things that we spend money on, people go crazy. It's like, \"Ok, I'll tolerate a lot of things, but—you know, transgender operas in Peru or whatever—like, why? What am I doing here?\" You know? It's a good argument. It's a great political argument. And it creates within the public the assumption that, well, if they're doing that, what else are they doing?\n\nThe other thing about DOGE that never got the PR that it deserved is they actually did have, I think, a tremendous impact on some IT systems and some of the ways we were doing technology in certain cabinets. A cabinet secretary, Lee Zeldin, told me for the book, those DOGE guys were able to streamline a bunch of systems within EPA that allowed them to get to a bunch of constituent service issues that had been backlogged forever. And they were able to work through it because of a streamlining of the system. That's a good thing.\n\nSo they never got the credit and the PR that they deserved for that.\n\nSo overall, I'm still pro-DOGE. I'm still somebody who thinks we spend too much. We spend 54 percent more money right now than we did just pre-COVID. I don't feel like my government's 54 percent better than it was, and I bet you don't either. Most Americans would not agree that the government is 54 percent better than it was just pre-COVID.\n\nSo there's more to do here. But again, to really fix this, we're going to have to DOGE the non-discretionary stuff. And that's going to be hard. It's going to be a hard political conversation to be had.\n\nAnd that is why it's hard to d","summary":"Scott Jennings discusses life as a conservative at CNN, Trump’s record a year into his second term, and how figures like Candace Owens damage the right.","url":"https://reason.com/podcast/2026/01/07/cnns-scott-jennings-the-conservative-movements-identity-crisis/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2026/01/Artboard-1-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 16:00:39","author":"Billy Binion","authors":["Billy Binion"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.073},{"id":391645212,"title":"The Blue Road to Hell","text":"By Norman Solomon\n\nAuthor Bio: Norman Solomon is the national director of RootsAction.org and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy. He is the author of War Made Invisible: How America Hides the Human Toll of Its Military Machine (The New Press, 2024).\n\nIMAGE: Matt Wuerker\n\nTen years after Donald Trump first ran for president, he stands at the helm of Titanic America. How did this happen?\n\nNo factors were more pivotal than the outlooks and actions of the Democratic Party leadership. Scrutinizing them now is vital not only for clarity about the past. It also makes possible a clear focus on ways to prevent further catastrophe.\n\nHere’s actual history that corporate Democrats pretend didn’t happen:\n\n2016: Hillary Clinton offers more of the status quo. Her allies in the Democratic Party pull out all the stops so she can win the party’s presidential nomination. With a big assist from the Democratic National Committee, she prevails over the strong primary challenge from Bernie Sanders—but her campaign trail goes downhill from there. After rallying behind Sanders’s genuine progressive populism, many young people don’t trust the pseudo-populism of Clinton’s campaign. She has earned a millennial problem, and it prevents her from becoming president.\n\n2017: Democratic Party leaders can hardly blame themselves or their nominee for the virtually unbelievable circumstance of the Trump presidency. A critical focus on Clinton’s coziness with Wall Street won’t do. Neither will critiquing her thinly veiled contempt for the progressive wing of the party. But blaming Trump’s victory on Russia becomes an obsessive theme.\n\n2018: The Democratic leadership is mapping out a battle plan for the midterm elections in November. At the same time, a key priority is to thwart the inside threat posed by progressive forces. Establishment Democrats are keeping a watchful eye and political guns trained on Bernie Sanders.\n\n2019: Democrats take control of the House, and a large cast of political characters is off and running for the party’s presidential nomination. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren are at the left edge, while more than a dozen others jostle for media attention. For elites determined to retain undemocratic power, seeing either Sanders or Warren in the Oval Office would be the worst possible outcome.\n\n2020: Early in the year, the economic populism of the Sanders campaign continues to catch fire, while many forces team up to function as fire extinguishers. The Democratic Party establishment acts to smother the grassroots blaze. After Joe Biden’s fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary puts his campaign on life-support, rescue comes eighteen days later from South Carolina, where Biden wins a landslide primary victory—and then several corporate-friendly contenders quickly drop out of the race and effusively endorse him. When Biden clinches the nomination, progressives largely close ranks behind him to defeat Trump. Biden squeaks through.\n\n2021: President Biden’s first year includes backing and signing legislation with real benefits for tens of millions of Americans. But his resolve dissipates. Before the end of the year, he abandons Build Back Better legislation that would have been transformational. Notably, Biden withdraws all U.S. troops from Afghanistan in late summer—but overall he opts to fuel militarism, with ever-higher Pentagon spending instead of devoting adequate resources to meet human needs and protect nature. The president goes full speed ahead with “modernization” plans for nuclear weapons that already have a pre-overrun price tag of $1.7 trillion.\n\n2022: Biden relapses into his customary “moderate” political mode, while his capacity to speak coherently weakens. Party discipline, internalized by Democrats in Congress, precludes independent-minded leadership as they begin to proclaim that Biden should run for re-election. Conformity of groupthink and fear of retribution from the White House keep people quiet.\n\n2023: A real-life Shakespearean tragedy unfolds as Biden throws down a gauntlet to run for re-election even while his mental frailty becomes more evident. Enablers ignore the party’s base, with polls continuing to show that most Democrats don’t want him to be the next nominee (including 94 percent of Democrats under 30). A common canard—pushed by Biden’s coterie of sycophants—contends that because he defeated Trump once, he’s the best person to do it again; the claim ignores the fact that Trump 2020 represented an unpopular status quo, and Biden 2024 would represent an even more unpopular status quo, as “right track / wrong track” polling makes crystal clear. Soon after Hamas attacks Israel on October 7 and the Israeli military starts its siege of Gaza, Biden begins to further alienate many of his party’s usual voters by massively boosting U.S. military aid as the slaughter of Palestinian civilians escalates.\n\n2024: Among top Democrats, denial about Biden’s evident cognitive infirmity grows along with the infirmity itself. Even after Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, the political reflex of dissembling prevents him from bowing out for another 28 days. That leaves 107 days for the newly installed nominee Kamala Harris to pick up the pieces before Election Day. At first it seems that she might find ways to depart from coming across as Biden’s yes-woman, but there is no such departure. Nothing epitomizes the Harris campaign’s moral collapse more than her insistence on echoing the Biden line about Gaza while the U.S. continues to arm Israel’s military as it methodically kills Palestinian civilians. In the process, Harris chooses to ignore both human decency and polls showing that far more voters would be likely to cast their ballots for her if she were to come out against sending more armaments to Israel. Electoral disaster ensues.\n\nLast month, two events showed the huge contradiction between the potential for true progressive change and the dire reality of feckless Democratic Party leaders. When socialist Zohran Mamdani won election as mayor of New York after running as a Democrat, he said: “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump; it’s how we stop the next one.” A week later, eight members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus surrendered to Trump, betraying efforts to defend Obamacare and a healthcare status quo that still leaves tens of millions uninsured or underinsured. The capitulation meant that the nation’s healthcare crisis would get even worse.\n\nCraven and conformist Democratic Party leadership—coloring inside corporate lines while enmeshed with rich backers—hardly offers a plausible way to defeat the Trump forces, much less advance a humane political agenda. Saving the country from autocracy requires recognizing and overcoming the chokehold that Democratic leaders have on the party.\n\nThe timeline above is drawn from my new book about the 10-year political descent into the current inferno, The Blue Road to Trump Hell, which is free as an e-book or PDF at BlueRoad.info.","summary":"By Norman Solomon Author Bio:&#160;Norman Solomon is the national director of&#160;RootsAction.org&#160;and executive director of the&#160;Institute for Public Accuracy.

Discovery, which announced late last year that it had entered into an $83 billion deal with Netflix for its studios and the HBO Max streaming platform. That prompted Paramount CEO David Ellison to mount a hostile takeover bid. Paramount has since made eight offers to Warner Bros., all of which have been rejected by the board out of concern over the risk presented by debt, financial backing and large fees if the deal were to collapse. \n\nIn a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board said that Paramount’s revised $30-per-share offer is still too risky because it relies on an “extraordinary amount of debt financing,” adding that the leveraged buyout threatens shareholders with “considerable value destruction.”\n\nTo try to assuage board concern about the financial backing of its offer, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who is the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, offered on Dec. 22 to back the deal with $40 billion in personal equity financing, leaving the remaining $54 billion to be financed with debt.\n\nThat did little to convince the Warner Bros. board, which said Wednesday that Paramount had “repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal” despite “clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions.” \n\n“Your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY’s ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer,” the board said in the letter. \n\nThe board urged shareholders not to tender their shares into Paramount’s offer, instead recommending they accept Netflix’s competing offer of $23.25 per share, which it said would deliver significant growth value. \n\n“The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger,” the board said, adding that the deal would maximize benefits while minimizing risks.\n\nUnder the Netflix merger, shareholders would retain stock in Discovery Global, the name for the new publicly traded company that would house Warner Bros. Discovery’s global entertainment and news platforms, which is slated for a spinoff in 2026. That, coupled with the shares of Netflix common stock the deal guarantees, presents considerable growth opportunities, the board said. \n\nThe terms of Paramount’s offer have been controversial since it launched its hostile bid. Paramount had planned to finance its offer with help from the royal families of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, but said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Middle Eastern financiers would give up voting rights and governance power if the deal goes through. \n\nThat raised questions among lawmakers of foreign interference. Despite that, David Ellison, whose father is a close ally of the Trump administration, argued that his company could secure federal regulatory approval for the merger faster than Netflix could. \n\nThe Netflix merger would need to pass regulatory scrutiny from federal antitrust bodies, but it would not saddle Warner Bros. with high breakup fees if the deal is blocked.\n\nThe consolidation of major media companies has raised bipartisan concern from lawmakers. The Trump administration greenlit the Ellison family’s acquisition of Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, last year after the network agreed to shell out $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. \n\nTrump involved himself in the competing Warner Bros. bids last year, when he said it was “imperative” that CNN be sold, arguing that its current ownership should not be in charge of the company.

Current Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mounted a re-election bid last year, but he later announced on Monday that he was dropping out of the race. His reversal comes amid the massive fraud scandal unfolding in the state linked to the Somali community. MINNESOTA REPUBLICANS SAY TIM WALZ NOT OFF THE HOOK AFTER DROPPING RE-ELECTION BID \"In September, I announced that I would run for a historic third term as Minnesota's governor. And I have every confidence that, if I gave it my all, I would succeed in that effort,\" he said in a statement. \"But as I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences. So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,\" he noted. Klobuchar, who has served in the U.S. Senate since early 2007, called Walz \"a true public servant\" in a post on X. JAMES COMER TO ACCUSE TIM WALZ OF BEING ‘ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL’ AT FRAUD HEARING Walz's announcement came after independent journalist Nick Shirley's reporting about alleged massive fraud linked to taxpayer-funded daycare facilities in the state went viral. But the governor asserted on Tuesday that he will not resign from office. \"I'm not goin' anywhere,\" he asserted. \"And you can make all your requests for me to resign over my dead body will that happen.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Walz ran as then-Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election.","summary":"While Minnesota Gov.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:13:57 GMT, 7 January 2026 |Updated:16:06 GMT, 7 January 2026 \n\nSteven Bartlett's fiancée Melanie Lopes has shared her first snap of her stunning engagement ring, after the business mogul popped the question on Christmas Day.\nIt was exclusively revealed by the Daily Mail earlier this week that the Diary Of A CEO podcaster, 33, had proposed to his partner of seven years in Morocco. \nMelanie shared a photo of her oval-cut sparkler on Instagram Stories, after the Dragons' Den star admitted the marriage proposal took him four years to plan. \nShe sweetly captioned the post: 'Mon amour.' \nSteven spoke about the engagement for the first time in Maggie Sellers Reum's Hot Smart Rich podcast, released on Wednesday. \nHe said of his fiancée Melanie, who is a French-Portuguese yoga entrepreneur: 'She knows me better than anybody, because she gets to see it all. When she says things, I listen very intently. She's very special.\n\nSteven Bartlett's fiancée Melanie Lopes has shared her first snap of her stunning engagement ring, after the business mogul popped the question over Christmas\n\nIt was exclusively revealed by the Daily Mail earlier this week that the Diary Of A CEO podcaster, 33, had proposedto his partner of seven years in Morocco\n'In many respects, she's like everything that I'm not. She's like an angel that fell from the sky. That's kind of how I describe it to my friends. \n'We've been together for almost seven years now, and she's very much what I'm aspiring to be. She's what I'm aspiring to be more like.'\nThe couple met on Instagram in 2016, but despite their careers being heavily focused on social media, they have chosen to keep their romance largely out of the public eye. \nMultimillionaire Steven, who is also a star of Dragons' Den and is said to be worth £320million, dated Melanie for a year before the couple briefly split as he focused on building his business empire.\nHowever, after realising he could not live without her, Steven flew 22 hours to Bali, where Melanie runs a breathwork and yoga retreat, to win her back, and their relationship has gone from strength to strength ever since. \nDuring their festive getaway, Steven presented Melanie with a diamond engagement ring and popped the question, with the wellness influencer delighted to say 'yes'.\nSources close to the couple say that after living together in both London and Los Angeles while navigating their demanding careers, they have never been happier and are excited to begin planning their wedding.\nRevealing more about the proposal, Steven said he had been planning the ring for years. He said: 'About four years ago, she was talking about engagement rings with a friend, and I was looking over her shoulder and looking at the ones she liked, and I was looking at her Pinterest, and saving the ones she said she really liked. \n\nThe couple met on Instagram in 2016, but despite their careers being heavily focused on social media, they have chosen to keep their romance largely out of the public eye\n\n Steven Bartlett's HUGE fortune revealed as he becomes one of Dragons' Den's richest ever moguls \n'So, I've had this folder in my phone for like three or four years of the ones she said she liked. And we were in New York yesterday, and there's a jeweller in New York that some of my friends that I really trust told me to go see, and they made the ring for us.'\nSteven said he used to fear that whilst he was successful, he would be lonely in a big house. \nHe said: 'Mel helps me anchor. And then I'll have kids and a family and responsibilities and dependencies. \n'And that's what I think it takes to be a good man, but also a good human being. I'm very excited about depending on other people and having other people depend on me.' \nSteven is best known as the host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, which regularly tops the UK charts and attracts millions of streams each month thanks to its engaging interviews and A-list guests.\nSince launching in 2017, Steven has interviewed a wide range of high-profile figures, from Kamala Harris to Louis Tomlinson, Davina McCall, Lewis Capaldi, and Simon Cowell.\nHe is also the youngest Dragon on BBC's Dragons' Den, appearing alongside Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden, and is regularly seen investing in new and emerging business ventures. \nSteven, who moved to the UK from Botswana at the age of two, dropped out of university at 18 to pursue his ambitions as a businessman.\nHe fell out with his parents, particularly his mother, who was 'heartbroken' after believing Steven had thrown away the education she never had growing up.\nHowever, Steven found success with his social media marketing agency, The Social Chain, which was valued at £300million when it first entered the stock market.\nHe is set for a busy year; alongside wedding planning, Steven will return to the upcoming series of Dragons' Den and continue recording his podcast, one of the most successful in the world.\nIn October last year, his company Steven.com, which houses his media ventures, including the firm Flight Story, was valued at £320million.\nSteven has said this will help him 'build the Disney of the creator economy,' referring to the multi-billion-pound industry of influencers who make a living through streaming and posting on TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube.\nSteven Bartlett\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSteven Bartlett's fiancée Melanie Lopes shares first look at her stunning engagement ring after the business mogul revealed he spent four years planning his Christmas proposal\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 34\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

But that’s with all of the seats filled, and that margin has fluctuated over the past 12 months with four deaths and four departures. In fact, Republicans began the 119th Congress at 219 seats, with Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz resigning before lawmakers were sworn in. \n\nLaMalfa’s death coupled with the resignation of Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene leaves the House at 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats. Yet the GOP majority is functionally narrower with Indiana Republican Jim Baird recovering after a car crash and presumably unable to make it to Washington for votes. Meanwhile, Democrats have two vacancies of their own.\n\nWhile it’s still unlikely that control of the House will switch party hands before the November elections, it can’t be ruled out completely.\n\nThe last time control of a chamber flipped in the middle of a congressional year was more than 20 years ago. In May 2001, Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords left the Republican Party to become an independent and caucus with Democrats, making South Dakota Democrat Tom Daschle the new majority leader.\n\nThe last time the House changed hands before a full election was nearly a century ago. In 1930, Republicans won a razor-thin majority on Election Day but by the time Congress convened some 13 months later, enough members had died and been replaced that it was Democrats who organized the chamber.\n\nRepublicans are still emboldened by the 2024 results that saw them win the White House, flip the Senate and retain the House, but Speaker Mike Johnson’s grip on the House continues to be precarious. Even though the vacant seats have so far opened up in safe Republican or Democratic territory, the timing of those vacancies still has an impact on chamber control and Republicans’ ability to pass legislation.\n\nThe calendar\n\nHouse Democrats will gain a vote following the Jan. 31 special election runoff in Texas’ 18th District. The seat has been vacant since Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner died in March last year. The party is guaranteed to hold the seat considering two Democrats, former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards and acting Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, are facing off. That will bring the House to 218 Republicans and 214 Democrats. \n\nThe all-party special election in Georgia’s 14th District to succeed Greene will take place March 10. But an April 7 runoff looks probable at this point, with a large field of unknown candidates. Given that President Donald Trump finished ahead of Kamala Harris in the district by 37 points, the seat will likely have a new Republican voting in Congress when the dust settles. That would bring the House to 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats. \n\nDemocrats then are likely to hold New Jersey’s 11th District, which is vacant after Rep. Mikie Sherrill resigned in November following her election as governor. Democrats here have a 13.5-point advantage, according to Inside Elections’ Baseline metric, which measures a district’s political performance by combining all federal and state election results over the past four election cycles into a single score. Given that and the current political environment, the Feb. 5 Democratic primary will be the most important race. But the seat won’t be filled until after the April 16 special general election. That would bring the House to 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. \n\nLaMalfa’s 1st District in California was redrawn last year to be safely Democratic. But the special election to succeed him will be conducted under the current lines — which saw Trump best Harris here by 25 points — so a Republican will be heavily favored to win. According to state law, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 14 days to declare a special election, which can take place between 126 and 140 days after that. That means the initial race could take place on June 2, the same time as the regular primary for the newly redrawn 1st District. If no one takes a majority of the vote in the special election, a face-off between the top two vote-getters would be necessary. \n\nIf the GOP holds the 1st District as expected, the House would finally be back to full strength, with 220 Republicans and 215 Democrats. But it seems unlikely that there won’t be more vacancies this year.\n\nMore to come?\n\nBeyond politics, LaMalfa’s death is a sad reminder of mortality and the fragility of life. At 65, he certainly wasn’t the oldest member of Congress (127 incumbent lawmakers are older), and there wasn’t public evidence of an underlying illness. \n\nSome of the oldest members are not running for reelection, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be any deaths before the election. \n\nAlso, tragedies happen. Baird’s current situation is an eerie reminder of 2022, when 58-year-old Republican Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana was killed in a car crash.\n\nBut deaths are not the only thing that could tip the balance of power this year, considering departures account for some of the vacancies as well. Greene left after coming to an impasse with Trump and his administration, particularly over the Jeffrey Epstein files. GOP Rep. Mark E. Green left Tennessee’s 7th District to take another job. Gaetz and fellow Florida Republican Mike Waltz left to join the Trump administration, though only one of them made the successful jump. \n\nLegal issues could also be a factor. For instance, New York Republican George Santos was expelled in 2023, opening up a Long Island seat that Democrats went on to flip. But an expulsion seems less likely this time around, even in extreme circumstances, based on the narrowness of the House majority. \n\nAnd not long ago, there was talk of other disgruntled Republicans joining Greene at the exits. South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace batted down those resignation rumors last month, but that doesn’t mean other lawmakers won’t entertain the possibility as the cycle evolves. \n\nEven if Republicans technically maintain a majority, passing legislation could be a challenge. There could be more members like Baird who may not be able to make it to Washington for votes, and there are lawmakers such as Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie who don’t appear interested in blindly supporting the president. \n\nThe phrase “Every seat matters” is typically dismissed as a cliché. But for the 119th Congress, it really does apply.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2026/01/07/house-republicans-majority-control-midterm-elections/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/house_gop_147_010726.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 14:40:23","author":"Posted January 7, 2026 At 2:40pm","authors":["Posted January 7, 2026 At 2:40pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":391708128,"title":"Tim Walz Personifies Democrats’ Decline","text":"Tim Walz is going away, but the Democratic Party’s Tim Walz crisis isn’t.\n\nThe Minnesota governor gave up his quest for a third term Monday: Staying out of jail will be challenging enough for him over the next few months, never mind prolonging his stay in office.\n\nFederal prosecutors estimate the Somali daycare scam and other frauds perpetrated under his watch cost taxpayers up to $9 billion.\n\nMoney like that goes a long way in politics.\n\nOver the years, Walz and his party have received plenty of campaign cash from the Somali community, a loyal—and influential—bloc in Minnesota Democratic politics.\n\nThe fraud was no well-kept secret; an independent journalist, Nick Shirley, easily exposed it.\n\nBut whistleblowers who’d tried to raise the alarm earlier were ignored—it wasn’t convenient for Walz and friends to notice what a key constituency was up to.\n\nJust 14 months ago, Walz was Kamala Harris’ running mate; he could have been a heartbeat away from the White House.\n\nHe was meant to be the answer to the national Democratic Party’s branding problems—its reputation for cultural weirdness and its difficulty courting white, male and rural voters.\n\nWalz was supposed to be a reassuringly “normal” Democrat, but it turns out what passes for normal in the party today is deep incompetence, corruption and worse.\n\nTim Walz is indeed a symbol of his party, in all the worst ways.\n\nMinnesota was the upper Midwest’s only holdout in the Trump wave of 2024, the last blue redoubt in a region painted red by Trump’s populist rebranding of the Republican Party.\n\nDoes Walz‘s disgrace put the state in play for 2028?\n\nThat would be catastrophic for the Democrats’ electoral map, throwing another 10 electoral votes to the GOP.\n\nThe last time the state voted for a Republican president was more than 50 years ago, when it backed Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\nIt’s been 20 years since a Republican even won a statewide election in Minnesota: Tim Pawlenty, reelected governor in 2006, was the last to do so.\n\nBut Walz and his scandals may have given Republicans two fresh chances this year and next.\n\nEven with Walz out of the way, his scandals will taint whoever gets the Democratic nomination for governor.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar wants the nod—but if she gets it and then wins in November, her vacated Senate seat will present another opportunity for the GOP in a special election next year.\n\nMinnesota’s other senator, Tina Smith, has already opted not to run for reelection this cycle, and her seat’s up in November.\n\nWalz’s Democrats—technically the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota—face a tough series of tests at the ballot box in the next few months, with the jaw-dropping scale of the Somali scandal threatening to overshadow everything.\n\nAnd, ironically, even Somali American voters in Minnesota have started souring on the Democrats:\n\nThe Harris-Walz ticket actually lost ground with voters of Somali descent in 2024.\n\n“In the Somali American hub of Cedar-Riverside, support for Harris dropped 14 percentage points” compared to 2020, according to a post-election report in the Minnesota Star Tribune, which noted, “Votes for Harris also dropped in precincts in the Seward neighborhood and along West Lake Street by 9 and 12 percentage points …”\n\nBiden-Harris policies toward Israel and Gaza were one consideration; another was that Somali Muslims aren’t entirely comfortable with the progressive social stances of the modern Democratic Party.\n\nThe Harris-Walz ticket still wound up garnering the support of about 80% of the Somali community, however.\n\nIf the Democrats’ grip on Minnesota is slipping, it’ll be more traditional constituencies who bring about the break—perhaps those who question how well the “farmer” and “labor” legs of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party have been served by a Democratic Party defined nowadays by manias for mass immigration and extreme identity politics.\n\nTim Walz was never a middle American Democrat; he was just a bland-looking white guy whose politics were as far-out as those of anyone else in his party.\n\nAnother Walz won’t win Democrats white, male or rural voters, even if he’s scandal-free.\n\nThe Democrats’ problem isn’t with the way their candidates look or sound—it’s what they believe and do.\n\nAnd there won’t be a Democrat who can match the appeal of Republican populism until there’s a Democrat who dares take the populist side on immigration and cultural norms.\n\nThat kind of Democrat, if he or she exists at all today, would be the opposite of Tim Walz.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2026 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Discovery rejects Paramount's amended takeover offer","text":"Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday rejected Paramount Skydance's amended takeover offer, the latest in a series of rejections in David Ellison's pursuit of the streaming and cable giant. The media company said it remains committed to the $82.7 billion deal it reached in December to sell its streaming service, studio and HBO cable channel to Netflix. \"The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas,\" Warner Bros. Discovery Chairman Samuel Di Piazza said in a statement. \"Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value,\" he continued. In a letter to shareholders, Di Piazza wrote that Paramount Skydance's offer carries \"significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger.\" The way the Paramount deal is structured creates a \"lack of certainty\" about its finalization, he added. Di Piazza adds in the letter that if the company were to agree to the Paramount merger and it failed to close, it would result in a \"potentially considerable value destruction.\" \"What matters most right now is our focus as we start the year,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in a memo to employees seen by NBC News. \"Our operating plans remain unchanged, and our priorities for 2026 are clear and intentional.\" Zaslav wrote that the \"review was conducted with discipline and rigor, and was supported by independent financial and legal advisors.\" On Dec. 22, Paramount Skydance increased its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery with a personal guarantee from billionaire Larry Ellison, who was backing the financing for the deal. His son, David Ellison, is the CEO of Paramount Skydance. However, that was not enough for Warner Bros. Discovery. That beefed-up offer followed Warner Bros. Discovery's Dec. 17 public rejection of Paramount. It also preceded multiple private rejections before Paramount Skydance went public. At stake is the future of one of the most storied media empires in the United States. The bidding by Paramount also comes amid a monumental shift in the media and streaming landscape at large. On Monday, Versant Media, the cable network spinoff from Comcast, began trading as an independent company. Shares have plunged more than 20% over the course of those two days. (Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and NBC News.) On CNBC, Di Piazza said it would be a mistake to compare Warner Bros. Discovery‘s cable networks to Versant. \"Discovery Global is different, it has a lot more scale,\" he said. Streaming companies such as Apple, Netflix and Amazon are also challenging traditional broadcasters such as Paramount-owned CBS for sports rights. Warner Bros. Discovery controls properties ranging from CNN Worldwide and the Discovery Channel to HBO, as well as the Warner Bros. film studio and archive. Despite the back and forth between Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, Netflix has so far proceeded with the deal it inked Dec. 5, under which the world’s largest streaming company would acquire a stake in WBD. Warner's cable networks would be spun out into a separate company as part of that deal. However, Paramount Skydance wants to buy everything Warner Bros. Discovery owns. Paramount's controlling shareholders, the Ellisons, have suggested they could obtain regulatory clearance more quickly and easily than Netflix. In mid-2025, the Ellisons acquired Paramount with approval from the Trump administration. But that approval only came after CBS News agreed to pay $16 million to President Donald Trump’s future presidential library over an interview that “60 Minutes” had conducted with then-presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. Netflix, for its part, has met with Trump at the White House over the deal. But Trump has said either bidder poses potential problems, in his view. Netflix said in a statement that it \"welcomed the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors’ continued commitment to the merger agreement\" the two companies reached last year. \"Netflix and Warner Bros. will bring together highly complementary strengths and a shared passion for storytelling,\" Netflix's co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said. Di Piazza said on CNBC that the difference between Paramount's offer and that of Netflix is that Warner Bros. and Netflix already \"have a signed merger agreement\" that has \"a clear path to closing.\" Di Piazza also said the Netflix deal offers \"protections for our shareholders, if something stops the close, whatever that might be.\" Trump has said he will be personally involved in reviewing whichever merger proceeds. Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-ammended-takeover-offer-rcna252750","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-warner-bros-ch-2127-c0d0fb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 12:30:50","author":"Steve Kopack","authors":["Steve Kopack"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.076},{"id":391705034,"title":"Intelligence, power, and moral clarity: Trump’s Venezuela masterstroke","text":"To be sure, the American public did not sign up for a prolonged war and will not abide by one. Trump’s America First base would sharpen its knives against him. The same precision and resolve that defined the initial raid must be maintained for the remainder of the larger mission.\n\nYet, despite the precariousness of the situation, the calculation behind the move remains sound. The strategic benefits outweigh the risks. And the moral basis for intervention is powerful.\n\nFirst, the moral case. Despite telling a New York judge that he is a “decent man,” Maduro is a full-fledged monster, even for an authoritarian despot. He ordered beatings and killings of political opponents and tortured protesters. His corrupt mismanagement of the Venezuelan economy sparked hyperinflation, food shortages, and mass migration from the country. His ties to drug cartels turned Venezuela into a dangerous narco-state that flooded America’s streets with drugs, empowering some of the most evil and vicious organizations the world over. And in 2024, he rigged the national election to retain power, with evidence revealing that he lost in a landslide. \n\nMaduro is an evil man to his core. He belongs in prison. It is good he is there.\n\nThe practical case is even easier to make. For one, the spectacularly efficient operation restored a good deal of American deterrence lost in recent decades. The U.S. performed this mission independently, without aid from allies, and it was a masterclass. It reinforced that America’s military is the greatest in the world, and it is to be respected and feared.\n\nFor decades, the world witnessed an American military terribly mismanaged and unable to finish the job, from the Vietnam War to the long slog in Iraq to the shameful Afghanistan withdrawal under Biden. But for the second time in Trump’s second term, the military executed a complex, history-altering mission. \n\nIf America’s enemies didn’t understand our capacity to exert our will through force before, they do now. Our fighters turned Venezuela’s $2 billion Russian S-300VM air defense system, thought to be the industry standard, into an expensive paperweight in under 20 minutes.\n\nWhen the world’s most advanced non-NATO air defense system can be neutralized in the time it takes to watch a Seinfeld rerun, adversaries recalculate. The U.S. is in a stronger global position than it was a week ago. That is beyond doubt.\n\nSpeaking of our adversaries, the move evicts them from a critical energy stronghold. With Maduro gone and the U.S. now in charge, China loses its access to the world’s largest proven oil reserves. PetroSinovensa, a partnership between the national oil companies of China, CNPC, and Venezuela, PDVSA, forged during the Chavez regime, develops extra-heavy crude that ships to China to service Venezuela’s sovereign debt. A new pro-U.S. regime will now likely be forced to rethink this arrangement as a matter of survival. \n\nOperation Absolute Resolve knocked Russia down a peg, too. For one, it demonstrated, yet again, that Trump is willing and capable of attacking a Kremlin ally with impunity. That Russia’s missile defense system sputtered only furthers the embarrassment. Russia’s condemnation of the raid as “armed aggression” at the U.N. Security Council, made with a straight face, apparently, reeked of panic.\n\nThe move also stands to worsen Russia’s economic woes. Putin relies on oil sales to prosecute his war in Ukraine, and Russia’s economy is sensitive to global oil prices. The United States’s goal to revitalize Venezuela’s oil sector could flood the market and drive down oil prices globally. Diminished oil revenues would significantly hamper Putin’s capacity to continue a war that distracts America, draining its resources. \n\nOther possible benefits could abound. Should Venezuela stabilize and become prosperous, many, if not most, of the migrants who flooded into the U.S. during Biden’s presidency might voluntarily return home. Future outflows will halt, thus resolving the “root causes” of illegal immigration that Kamala Harris never managed to figure out. \n\nTHE MILITARY’S STAGGERING COMPETENCE UNDER TRUMP\n\nFinally, a stable and prosperous democratic Venezuela would help rebuild the moral credibility lost during the Iraq War. It would demonstrate that American power can be used not just to dismantle a dictatorship, but also to help foster a self-sustaining democracy in its own hemisphere in a country with a democratic DNA and a desire for self-determination. Linking arms with the most recent Nobel Prize winner, María Corina Machado, will send a strong message to the world about how America really regards dictators. \n\nThere is still much to be done. And plenty can, and probably will, go wrong. But Trump’s bold choice is both logical and morally defensible. America should rally around the effort, not only because of what it means for Venezuelans, but also because of what it means for us.","summary":"Much could still go wrong for the United States following last week’s stunningly successful removal of illegitimate Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.

However, she did not completely shut down rumors that he could run for an unprecedented third term in office, noting that there were still three years until the election. \n\nIn public, Trump has admitted that it is unlikely that he’ll be allowed to run for a third term. \n\nHowever, Kai told Paul that her grandfather’s current stint in the White House has already caused problems in her social life, since she is often flanked by Secret Service agents for protection.\n\n“To be honest with you, it's really awkward when you're sitting and going on a date with a guy and they're two tables behind you,” she told Paul, adding that it was a “little weird.”\n\n“I try my best not to let it bother me,” she continued. “Especially the past year, since he's become President, I've had to learn that, yes, they're following me, but also to focus in pretending that they're not there.”\n\nKai is a competitive golfer and a social media influencer, known for appearing in videos at the White House with her grandfather.\n\nOn her own channel, she has amassed 1.4 million followers, and the video in which she met Paul has already racked up nearly 200,000 views, despite being uploaded less than a day ago. \n\nOn Paul’s podcast, she also lifted the lid on her feelings about former Vice President Kamala Harris, whom her grandfather defeated in the 2024 election. She told Paul that there is no “bad blood” between her and the Democrat grandee, who is widely believed to be planning another bid for the White House in 2028.\n\n“To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely,” Kai said when Paul asked her opinion on Harris. “Like, I would never run and I don't want anything to do with politics. \n\n'I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing, and I think if both sides met in the middle, everyone would be so much more happier, and I think there's radical left, there's radical right, and there's a lot of people who get too extreme.”\n\nKai added that she was “very much in the middle” and said Harris’ frosty relationship with her grandfather “is what it is.”\n\nShe also criticized social media companies, many of which are run by Donald Trump’s allies, including Elon Musk, for fuelling political divisions.\n\n'And that's where social media really ties into it because social media kind of makes your Instagram or your feed be one way or the other, and there's not a lot of things on social media if you're very much in the middle,” she said. “I think that kind of makes some people crazy, and some people buy into it too much.”\n\nKai rarely speaks publicly about her political opinions, but she addressed crowds at the Republican National Convention in 2024. She told the audience that her grandfather was “just a normal grandpa” months before his resounding election victory.","summary":"Kai Trump also revealed her thoughts on her grandfather’s nemesis, Kamala Harris, and her opinions on the state of US politics","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kai-donald-trump-third-term-logan-paul-b2895969.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/10/54/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-10-31-27.png?crop=2019,1346,x9.5,y0&trim=0,10,0,9&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/t0w2LpXJ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-07 11:07:51","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":391664266,"title":"Fox News’ Jesse Watters declares Trump taking Venezuela’s oil is ‘common sense’ while dismissing ‘imperialistic’ concerns","text":"Fox News host Jesse Watters swatted away concerns that Donald Trump’s plan to take Venezuela’s oil is “imperialistic,” instead claiming it was just “common sense.”\n\nWatters’s remarks come just days after U.S. troops successfully captured the South American petrostate’s former president, Nicolas Maduro. Since then, Trump has claimed that the United States will “run” Venezuela and has talked about reopening the country’s oil markets. \n\nOn the Tuesday episode of Jesse Watters Primetime, the host said that Trump’s actions were legitimate, comparing them to actions the U.S. took in Japan after World War II. \n\n“Trump says, ‘Take the oil.’ Democrats call that imperialistic,” Watters said. “We call it common sense. \n\n“You know, we won spoils after World War II. We told our allies, lose the colonies,” he continued. “We took half Japan’s gold they stole, built military bases on everyone’s turf, and pegged the world currencies to the dollar. Was that fair?”\n\nWatters also claimed that the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which were launched by the United States, had distracted the U.S. military from the expansion of China’s influence in South America.\n\n“We’ve neglected our own neighborhood for the last 25 years because we were stuck in the sand in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Watters said. “And while we were there, China swooped into our backyard and turned out all of our neighbors.”\n\nThere has been an immense domestic and international backlash to Trump’s capture of Maduro, with many world leaders admitting that the Venezuelan leader was a dictator but questioning the legality of the U.S. overthrowing him. \n\n“That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise,” former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X, following the capture of Maduro. “We’ve seen this movie before. Wars for regime change or oil that are sold as strength but turn into chaos, and American families pay the price.”\n\nOther world leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, shared similar thoughts. Starmer acknowledged on X that Maduro was an “illegitimate president,” but urged all parties involved in the Venezuela crisis to adhere to “international law.”\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News hosts have doubled down in supporting Trump’s strikes against Venezuela. Greg Gutfeld, co-host of The Five, even suggested that Venezuela’s oil belonged to the United States. \n\n“When he says, we're taking the oil, we can go, wow, that's kind of brash,” Gutfeld said. “Yeah, but, you know, it's honest. And is that good for America? Well, yeah, it was our oil. \n\n“I mean, he not only staunched the flow of drugs, he also is getting our oil back. That's what -- I coined this phrase this morning, killing two birds with one stone.”\n\nCurrently, Venezuela is navigating a transition of power from Maduro’s long reign as president. His deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, has been sworn in as acting president, with Trump publicly giving his approval. \n\nTrump passed over María Corina Machado, who was long seen as the leader of the opposition to Maduro, reportedly over her acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump has issued a stark threat to Rodriguez, saying she will “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” if she “doesn’t do what’s right.”","summary":"Jesse Watters claimed that the US taking Venezuela’s oil was legitimate because it looted Japan for gold in WW2","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jesse-watters-venezuela-maduro-fox-news-oil-b2895880.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/8/27/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-08-53-26.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Let6JVn1-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-07 09:54:58","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":391716796,"title":"The consequences of Guyana’s unfortunate politics in 2025","text":"YOU can win an election not on your own substance, but based on the circumstances that favour you. Had Jimmy Carter in 1980 concede the Democratic Party nomination to Edward Kennedy, Ronald Reagan would have been beaten badly. In 1980, a Kennedy name would not have lost.\nIn 2024, in the US, all the White liberals and White youths who voted for Barack Obama were gone from Kamala Harris. President Trump had a goldmine waiting for him. The American people were disgusted with the senility of Mr Biden. They thought the Democratic Party should have replaced him long before the election date.\nSecondly, America was not prepared for a Black woman president. How the Democratic Party could not see that reality simply showed that these people in the West think they are better than the peoples in the Global South.\nThe Kamala Harris defeat showed that their intellectual substance that they have shoved down the throats of the post-colonial world is more brittle than the intellectual fibre of the Global South.\nLet’s look at how politicians can win votes not because they are made of sound stuff, but because circumstances shaped fate to provide huge advantages to them. The fight for electoral victory in 2025 in Guyana should have been between the PPP and an entity named, APNU+AFC.\nThe prediction was that the PPP would win anyway. How good the APNU+AFC would have done was a ubiquitous curiosity. The presence and popularity of Irfaan Ali made a PPP loss virtually impossible. But as it turned out, there was no APNU+AFC and if there were, they would have been no WIN.\nWhat happened in Guyana’s electoral politics last year is one of the saddest yet comical moments in the entire history of Guyana, both colonial and post-colonial. How did WIN come to have 16 seats?\nAn APNU+AFC coalition was what the anti-PPP voters wanted. Again, we must invoke the words of Vice-President Jagdeo. He said there were voters who didn’t want to vote for the PPP, but they didn’t want to give their votes to the PNC. Why? Here are brief notes on why that happened.\nThe AFC told the PNC that its leadership was not politically attractive in Guyana. The AFC suggested that it was best that the APNU join with the AFC and have a consensus candidate from outside the PNC. The PNC told the AFC that the PNC was the bigger, more historic party, therefore by numbers, it must have the presidential candidate and that person must be Aubrey Norton.\nThe AFC told the PNC that was a naive reading of Guyanese politics. The AFC told the PNC Norton was not electable. The PNC informed the AFC that if Norton was not electable, so was Nigel Hughes.\nAt that stage, both parties were right. Norton’s credibility had gone, but Hughes’ political standing in Guyana had disappeared. But the AFC proved more flexible. The AFC dropped Hughes’s candidacy in place of another consensus candidate from outside. The PNC said it had to be Norton, and Norton it must be.\nAt that stage in Guyanese politics in 2025, We Invest in Nationhood (WIN) received its trump card. What the opposition supporters and opposition voters wanted was an APNU+AFC ticket without Norton and Hughes.\nThey wanted something new, presentable and exciting. If the PNC and AFC had given opposition voters that new thing, there would never have been a WIN party.\nDespite his money train that never stopped running during the election campaign, Azruddin Mohamed would have fallen by the wayside if there was an APNU+AFC entity with someone as the presidential candidate without baggage and coming from outside the perimeters and parameters on the PNC and the AFC.\nThe big story in Guyana in 2025 was the rise of WIN and what it did in three months that damaged the PNC. But there is more to this story and it needs to be told. There would have been no meteoric rise of WIN and the 16 seats it got would not have even been six had the PNC and AFC appeared as reasonable, credible people to their supporters.\nOnce more, Mr Jagdeo’s words reverberate. Mr Jagdeo said on election day, there were people who didn’t want to vote for the PPP, but couldn’t give their vote to the PNC.\nThe reason for this was when they looked at the PNC and the AFC and saw the failure to seek compromise, they went into a mental vortex. They couldn’t vote for the PPP but couldn’t vote for what the PNC had become. I think as a Pavlovian reflex, they chose WIN without WIN having anything going for it. That is why WIN will not survive beyond 2027.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Guyana National Newspapers Limited.","summary":"YOU can win an election not on your own substance, but based on the circumstances that favour you.

Local officials dispute claims in the video.\n\nNoem’s interview also comes after another high-profile CBS show, 60 Minutes, was told by Weiss shortly before airtime last month to pull a planned segment about how DHS sent hundreds of migrants to a notorious Salvadoran prison, an editorial decision widely panned inside and outside the CBS Newsroom. \n\nWeiss reportedly told producers, who had cleared the segment through multiple layers of internal review, that an on-camera response from a Trump administration official was needed. \n\nInternal deliberations around the segment, as well as a version of the clip itself, leaked online and in the media. In one of the leaks, the segment’s correspondent, Sharyn Alfonsi, accused Weiss of giving the Trump administration a “‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find “inconvenient.”\n\nWeiss’s tenure at CBS, which has reportedly been marked by constant infighting, has been under heavy scrutiny, given the the highly politicized atmosphere in which she took the reins at the broadcaster.\n\nWeiss’s decision making around the CECOT segment sparked claims she was influenced by political pressures, owing to CBS parent company Paramount Skydance’s ongoing bid to take over Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would need federal clearance.\n\nIn August, Skydance and Paramount officially merged following a complicated process dogged with accusations of political meddling.\n\nSkydance was founded by David Ellison, son of the billionaire Oracle tech mogul and Trump supporter Larry Ellison.\n\nShortly before the merger was complete, with approval hanging in the balance, Paramount agreed to a $16 million settlement in a lawsuit from Trump against 60 Minutes, which had alleged it deceptively edited an interview with his 2024 rival Kamala Harris.","summary":"Noem’s high-profile interview on CBS Evening News came after the network’s new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss ordered investigative show 60 Minutes to spike a report on Noem’s agency sending detainees to a brutal Salvadoran prison","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cbs-news-ice-raid-kristi-noem-bari-weiss-b2895758.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/2/47/Screenshot-2026-01-06-at-6-00-15-PM.png?crop=904,602.7,x0,y0.2&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oqVYLu5E-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-07 06:42:17","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.105},{"id":391693676,"title":"Who’s going to the ballot box this year? Here’s the election state of play","text":"This article covers the March South Australian state election and November Victorian state election. The United States will hold midterm elections in November, giving Democrats an opportunity to take control of Congress.\n\nThe South Australian state election\nwill be held on March 21. All 47 lower house seats will be elected in single-member districts, and 11 of the 22 upper house seats will also be up for election using statewide proportional representation with preferences.\n\nLabor won the 2022 SA election by 27 lower house seats to 16 for the Liberals with four independents, defeating a one-term Liberal government. Labor won the two-party vote at that election by 54.6–45.4.\n\nThere have been three SA polls taken since last May’s federal election where Labor won a surprise landslide. A May YouGov poll gave Labor a 67–33 lead, an October DemosAU poll gave them a 66–34 lead and an early December Fox & Hedgehog poll gave Labor a 61–39 lead.\n\nIf the election results reflect the DemosAU and YouGov polls, Labor would win the second biggest landslide at an Australian state or federal election, behind only the Western Australian 2021 Labor landslide (69.7–30.3 to Labor).\n\nThe 11 upper house seats up for election this year were last elected in 2018. Ignoring defections, Labor is defending four, the Liberals four, SA-Best two and the Greens one. The 11 continuing seats (elected in 2022) are five Labor, four Liberals, one Green and one One Nation. SA-Best was Nick Xenophon’s former party and it was popular in 2018.\n\nOn lower house polls, it’s very likely that Labor will gain at least one seat from 2018, giving Labor and the Greens at least a combined 12 of the 22 upper house seats, enough for a Labor/Greens majority.\n\nVictorian election: November 28\n\nThe Victorian state election will occur on November 28. All 88 lower house seats will be elected using single-member districts and all 40 upper house seats will be elected by proportional representation with preferences in eight five-member districts.\n\nThe Poll Bludger’s Victorian BludgerTrack indicates Labor had fallen behind the Coalition in early 2025, but the May federal Labor landslide saw Victorian Labor surge back to the lead. Labor has slipped since then, and it’s now roughly tied.\n\nWhile Labor is still competitive in the polls, Labor Premier Jacinta Allan’s ratings are dismal, with a recent Redbridge poll and Newspoll both giving her a net approval below -40.\n\nAs voters focus more on state politics in the lead-up to the election, I believe the Coalition is more likely to improve as Labor is dragged down by Allan. By the election, Labor will have governed in Victoria for 12 consecutive years and 23 of the last 27, so there should be an “it’s time” factor.\n\nVictoria is the last Australian jurisdiction to still use the discredited “group voting ticket” system for its upper house elections. The parliamentary electoral matters committee has proposed scrapping this system and holding a referendum to allow more members to be elected per district. \n\nAny change to the upper house electoral system would need to pass both houses of the current Victorian parliament by early this year to be used at the election. Labor has failed to reform the upper house at previous opportunities before both the 2018 and 2022 elections.\n\nUS midterm elections: November 3\n\nUnited States midterm elections will be held on November 3. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be elected using single-member districts. In the Senate, 35 of the 100 senators will be up for election using single-member districts where a state is the district.\n\nAlthough first past the post is used in most US states instead of preferential voting, minor parties usually get under 2% of votes, so Democratic or Republican candidates usually win outright majorities.\n\nIn 2024, Republicans won the House by a 220–215 margin over Democrats and the Senate by 53–47. All of the House and one-third of the Senate is up for election every two years, with this year’s 35 Senate elections including two specials.\n\nOf the 35 senators up for election, Republicans hold 22 and Democrats 13, but only two Republican seats are thought vulnerable: Maine and North Carolina. At the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris won Maine\nby 6.9 points and Donald Trump only won North Carolina by 2.2 points. Trump won all other states Republicans are defending by at least a double-digit margin.\n\nIt’s become increasingly difficult for Democrats to win the Senate, as the two senators per state rule skews Senate elections towards low-population, rural states. Even if Democrats gain Maine and North Carolina, Republicans would still hold a 51–49 Senate majority.\n\nIn analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of US national polls, Trump’s net approval is currently -12.0, with 54.0% disapproving and 42.0% approving. In Fiftyplusone’s aggregate of the generic ballot, Democrats lead Republicans by 44.1–39.7, a 4.4-point margin.\n\nAt the 2024 House elections, Republicans won the popular vote by 49.8–47.2, a 2.6-point margin. The swing to the Democrats suggests they will gain control of the House on current polling, but not the Senate.","summary":"Two state governments are up for re-election in Australia, while the US midterms offer an opportunity for the Democrats to take control of Congress.","url":"https://theconversation.com/whos-going-to-the-ballot-box-this-year-heres-the-election-state-of-play-272608","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/711103/original/file-20260106-56-alvu1p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C785%2C8256%2C4128&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 01:17:48","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":391708450,"title":"House Democrats Hold Far-Left Circus on Fifth Anniversary of January 6","text":"House Democrats and former members of the now-defunct January 6 Select Committee held a hearing for the day’s five-year anniversary on Tuesday, dragging out a posse of scandal-ridden, far-left lunatics for their circus.\n\nThe hearing featured hypocrites such as former Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA), who condemned political violence from the right despite endorsing Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones (D), who infamously fantasized about assassinating former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert (R) and his children. Luria did not rescind her endorsement after Jones’s texts leaked. \n\nShe has also been accused of violating House ethics rules multiple times, including for fundraising in connection with her official capacity on the January 6 committee.\n\nLuria had sent “numerous fundraising emails in recent weeks asking donors to reward her ‘principled leadership’ on the Jan. 6. committee,” the Washington Times reported at the time. “House ethics rules directly prohibit members of Congress from fundraising off their official duties.”\n\nThat same year, she also faced accusations of breaking House rules by withholding information from her required personal financial disclosures.\n\nAccording to the complaint from watchdog Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), “Luria failed to disclose her position as an officer and director of a corporation,” when she omitted holding a position as president of the Tidewater Montessori High School from 2015 to 2019, showing “an egregious lack of transparency that erodes public trust and leaves citizens unaware of potential conflicts of interest.”\n\nIronically, Luria has consistently railed against school choice and voucher programs while she used to be the president of a private school, and sent her daughter to one as well. \n\nDuring her testimony at Tuesday’s hearing, she criticized President Donald Trump’s actions as commander in chief, particularly his deployment of National Guard troops to high-crime cities and the investigation into allegedly seditious behavior by Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ). \n\nAfter losing her congressional seat to Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) and announcing her bid to run again in November, it could be argued that Luria wanted to join the hearing to get some free airtime to help her chances of winning. \n\nOne of the only two Republican members on the select committee, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), also spoke at the hearing, going on an anti-Trump rant. \n\nThis is the same Adam Kinzinger who revealed roughly 30 million lines of phone data collected without a warrant to the Democrat-led committee. \n\nThe RINO, or “Republican in name only,” endorsed former President Joe Biden and later former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election — and that is not where the strange things end. \n\nAccording to an X post from White House Communications Director Steven Cheung, Kinzinger has posted half-naked photos to the gay hookup app Grindr, despite being married to a woman. While the individual’s face is not in the pictures, their tattoo appears to match the former congressman’s. \n\nKinzinger was also heavily criticized for an October 2024 photo op where he and Democrat U.S. Senate candidate Lucas Kunce shot AR-15 rifles and other firearms at metal targets from just 10 yards away — leading a bullet fragment to ricochet and injure a reporter in the arm. \n\nDemocrats also brought out former January 6 prosecutor Brendan Ballou, who exemplifies the partisan nature of that witch hunt. \n\nBallou, a registered Democrat, has donated over $8,000 to leftist candidates and committees, including $2,000 to socialist Sen.

Ilhan Omar, who represents the Twin Cities area and is a naturalized citizen from Somalia, lamented the fraud, but said the focus on Somalis was because of bigotry.\n\nShe wrote a column for The New York Times accusing President Donald Trump of “hate speech” and “racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and division.”\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who was sworn into office on a Quran instead of a Bible, called the Trump administration’s recent order to end Temporary Protected Status for Somali nationals an example of “racism.”\n\nWearing a hijab, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan (aka “al-Flanagan”) told a crowd at a Somali market that “we have your back.” Somalis now number more than 107,000 in Minnesota, mostly in the Democrat-run area of Minneapolis-St. Paul.\n\nThe scandal may involve as much as $9 billion stolen, according to the lead federal prosecutor in Minnesota.\n\nFor his part, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is posing as a fraud-exposing superhero, instead of what he really is – a crook or clueless political hack.\n\nRemember, Mr. Walz is the guy who said he was placed on the Kamala Harris ticket in 2024 as the vice presidential nominee “because I could code-talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck, doing that.”\n\nAs part of his manly appeal, Mr. Walz ordered tampon dispensers to be placed in boys’ bathrooms in public schools. Yes, he did.\n\nDespite the Democrats’ insistence that there’s nothing to see here and that anyhow, the fraud is nobody’s fault, the story is growing.\n\nIn late December, independent YouTube journalist Nick Shirley ripped the cover off the scandal. His on-the-ground videos exposing phony childcare centers in Minnesota like the one with the “Learing Center” sign, have gone viral, with more than 130 million views.\n\nIn response, the Trump administration has announced even more aggressive investigations and a freeze on federal childcare funding to the Gopher State.\n\nThis is happening while the legacy media treat it as a non-story. They’re too busy dishing out irrelevant dirt from the Jeffrey Epstein files. It’s similar to the way fighter jets emit clouds of foil to confuse enemy radar.\n\nBeyond Minnesota, Americans know something is deeply wrong.\n\nThis isn’t just about illegal immigration or astronomical government fraud. It’s about both.\n\nMany Americans are furious that they’re not only losing their country to an alien culture because of one political party’s greed for power, but they’re paying for it with their tax dollars. And if they dare to complain, they’re called racists.\n\nThis isn’t about race. It’s about bringing in people with unassimilable cultural values who then turn around and rip us off.\n\nAlthough there was some local Minnesota media coverage back in 2022, The New York Times broke the story nationally that year about some Somalis milking safety net programs erected during the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe FBI probed into groups overseen by Feeding Our Future, which billed the government tens of millions of dollars for nonexistent meals. More than 75 people were arrested and charged. Other fraud schemes involved illicit Medicaid and housing payments and unfounded claims of autism, for which parents got kickbacks.\n\nIn 2024, the scandal wasn’t big enough to keep Tim Walz off the Democratic ticket. By then, he was a super good fraud fighter. And white male voter whisperer.\n\nLast month, thanks to Mr. Shirley, the far bigger scandal broke open. The Department of Homeland Security has sent teams to Minnesota to probe how fraudsters, mostly in the Somali community, were getting rich off the taxpayer.\n\nThe larger lesson here is something Milton Freidman said in 1999: “You cannot simultaneously have free immigration and a welfare state.”\n\nFree benefits and an open border, as under former President Joe Biden, are a magnet for an infinite stream of illegal aliens. This cannot be sustained.\n\nThis was the actual goal of two socialist economists, Richard Cloward and his wife Frances Fox Piven, who crafted the Cloward-Piven strategy in the 1960s. Their idea was to overwhelm the welfare state with demands until it collapsed, forcing Americans to surrender to full socialism.\n\nMr. Cloward has gone on to his reward, but Ms. Fox Piven, at 93, is still pushing her stuff on credulous academics and students.\n\nIn June 2019, during the Democratic presidential primaries, the 10 candidates on stage, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, were asked to raise their hands if they supported giving “undocumented immigrants” access to government health care. All of them did.\n\nRight now, “free” health care may not play as well. Obamacare has exponentially raised health care costs and health insurance premiums.\n\nDemocrats are threatening again to shut down the government in late January if taxpayer subsidies are not renewed for their free stuff army.\n\nIn light of the burgeoning Minnesota scandal, the giveaways may be losing public support.\n\nIn an X post quoted in National Review, former Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel said, “Welfare liberalism can’t win if voters believe their money’s being stolen, and that liberals will let it happen to avoid being called racist.”﻿\n\nWhich is exactly what happened in Minnesota. And undoubtedly in a lot of other places.\n\nThis will keep hitting the fan as the Justice Department and FBI look at more states that have had Democrat, one-party rule for decades, like California and Illinois.\n\nJust imagine what’s under some of those rocks.\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.","summary":"'Americans are furious that they're losing their country to an alien culture'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2026/01/somali-welfare-scandal-exposes-dems-kleptocratic-ways/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/peggy-flanagan-somalis-hijab-minnesota.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 23:49:14","author":"Robert Knight","authors":["Robert Knight"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":391609134,"title":"Trump store in suburban Philadelphia ‘kind of run its course’ and is set to close","text":"By MIKE CATALINI\n\nBENSALEM, Pa.

The shop's online store will remain open. \n\nMORE: Four survivors of Bristol nursing home explosion sue facility's operator, PECO for negligence\n\n\"After 6 wonderful years at our Bensalem location, we have made the difficult decision to close The Trump Store,\" the shop's Facebook post said. \"... A big thank you to all of our loyal customers and the life-long friends that we’ve made since our grand opening in February of 2020.\"\n\nThe owner of the Trump Store could not be immediately reached for comment about the reason for the closure. The business has a second Bucks County location at Target World Inc., a shooting range and gun store in Chalfont.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 election, the Bensalem store was spotlighted by USA Today for its shrine-like collection of apparel, including a Trump troll doll keychain and a yard sign that said, \"This home is voting for Felon 2024.\" Other items at the shop include Trump-inspired beef jerky, a $179 watch and a shirt with the president's face swapped on the body of a Philadelphia Eagles player wearing a No. 47 jersey. \n\nTrump's solid base in Bucks County played a key role in flipping Pennsylvania red in the 2024 presidential election. Trump carried the county over Democrat Kamala Harris by a margin of just 291 votes. Four years earlier, Trump lost to former President Joe Biden by more than 17,000 votes. Philadelphia and the rest of its collar counties went to Harris. \n\nNationally, voter turnout was slightly lower in 2024 than 2020, but Bucks County's turnout increased by nearly 4,800 votes between the two elections. \n\nThe store in Bensalem – which sometimes beckoned shoppers with an inflatable tube man version of Trump — is one of a number of independent businesses across the country that back the president but are not directly tied to the Trump Organization. \n\nThe president's family business has its own store that sells similar items and has come under scrutiny for some of its business practices. Trump Mobile, the president's wireless service that launched last year, accepted $100 deposits for gold-colored smartphones that still have not been delivered months after they were promised to customers. The wireless carrier has instead been selling refurbished iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices while continuing to take deposits for the $499 T1 gold phone, which doesn't have a firm release date. \n\nSince starting the campaign for his second term, Trump has used his Truth Social platform to promote limited-edition items including guitars, gold-plated watches and a $250 \"Victory 45-47\" fragrance. A January report from the watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington counted 168 new products launched between Election Day and Trump's inauguration, raising concerns about his using the presidency in various ways to generate profit for his private business ventures. The Trump Organization made an ethics pledge in January to limit the president's involvement in business dealings and halt its agreements with foreign governments. \n\nThe Trump Store said the business will remain active in the community despite leaving behind the storefront in Bensalem.\n\n\"We will continue participating at regional gun shows and special events,\" the store wrote on Facebook.","summary":"The Trump Store, a Bensalem shop that sells merchandise inspired by the president, will close at the end of January after a six-year run in a shopping center on State Road.","url":"https://www.phillyvoice.com/trump-store-bensalem-closing-bucks-county/","image":"https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/1625_Trump_Store.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 22:04:51","author":"Michael Tanenbaum,Usa Today","authors":["Michael Tanenbaum","Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":391754990,"title":"Brigitte Macron won her defamation case in France. Can she repeat in the US?","text":"They included a gym teacher, a gallery owner, and a publicist. Several said their online comments about the French first lady, Brigitte Macron, were in jest.\n\nBut on Monday, a Paris court found these people from all walks of life – 10 in all – guilty of cyberbullying, after they posted or reposted comments on social media questioning Ms. Macron’s gender and sexuality.\n\nThe sentences range from an eight-month suspended prison sentence to mandatory classes about online harassment. Some saw their access to social media suspended, and all 10 will be forced to collectively pay €10,000 (about $11,700) to Ms. Macron in moral damages.\n\nFor broader French society, the verdict is a clear message: Cyberbullying has no home here.\n\nBut as the Macrons look to a defamation lawsuit on the other side of the Atlantic they have filed against conservative firebrand Candace Owens, who has made similar claims about the French first lady, the presidential couple can expect an uphill battle.\n\nFreedom of speech protections differ between France and the United States, and the Macrons already struggled to win a previous defamation case in France.\n\nAs the Macrons seek justice over the first lady’s identity, they find themselves at the whims of the American legal system. Why did this case win in France, and could a similar one hold up in a U.S. court?\n\n“This case sends a message that, in a democratic society, people can’t just spread hateful conspiracy theories without any consequences,” says Emma-Kate Symons, a Paris-based journalist at the online observatory, Conspiracy Watch. “All eyes are on the U.S. now.”\n\nMistrust of the elite\n\nRumors that Brigitte Macron was born a man have been circulating online since Emmanuel Macron was first elected president in 2017. Conspiracy theorists claim Ms. Macron was born Jean-Michel Trogneux and changed her name to Brigitte Trogneux.\n\nThe Macrons say the claim is completely false and that Mr. Trogneux already exists: He is Ms. Macron’s 80-year-old brother who lives in the northern French town of Amiens.\n\nExperts say behind the claims is a deep mistrust of France’s political class and a mystery surrounding the Macrons’ relationship. At 48, Mr. Macron is 24 years younger than Ms. Macron, and they first met when he attended a high school where she was a teacher. They have never publicly discussed their atypical relationship.\n\n“This is about defiance. [The French] no longer believe in their political elite,” says Emmanuelle Anizon, author of “The Madame Affair: The Anatomy of a Fake News Story,” who led an investigation into the source of the conspiracy against Ms. Macron. “The more [the Macrons] hide their relationship, the more people think they could be hiding other things.”\n\nDespite how quickly the online rumors have gained traction, prosecuting those suspected of starting them has proved quite challenging.\n\nLast year, the Macrons filed a criminal defamation lawsuit against spiritual medium Amandine Roy and self-described independent journalist Natacha Rey, who were later found guilty of slander over their online claims that Ms. Macron was born male.\n\nBut the pair were later cleared on appeal, after the courts found that saying someone had changed gender was not an “attack on their honor.”\n\nThe Macrons were initially advised to drop their U.S.-based lawsuit against Ms. Owens, over concerns that a legal case would only amplify the rumors. Former first lady Michelle Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris were both subject to similar online conspiracies about their gender identity. But neither pursued legal action, where fees can quickly climb into the thousands and U.S. freedom of speech laws strongly protect comment about public figures.\n\nBut Ms. Macron said during questioning by police for the most recent French case that “all these allegations have had a significant impact on those around me and on myself.” The night before the verdict came in, she told French television that she hoped to “set an example” to young people that bullying will not be tolerated.\n\nAmerican speech protections\n\nThe latest ruling certainly sets a precedent as to how French courts process cyberbullying claims going forward. But legal experts say it will have little bearing on how the U.S.-based case plays out.\n\nIn France, cyberbullying is defined as online harassment or intimidation that is repetitive in nature, and has been punishable by law since 2014. While it is considered a crime in most states, there is currently no federal law against cyberbullying in the United States, making it more difficult for the Macrons to have pursued a U.S.-based lawsuit on those grounds.\n\nLegal experts say the Macrons were smart to have sought a lawsuit based on defamation in the U.S., rather than one centered on hate speech. In the U.S., hate speech is protected under the First Amendment, since the landmark 1969 Supreme Court ruling Brandenburg v. Ohio. In that case, the court ruled that inflammatory speech can only be prohibited if it is directed to incite or produce imminent lawless action of violence. Misgendering Ms. Macron almost certainly fails to meet that standard.\n\n“[The First Amendment] is all about the marketplace of ideas, and restrictions are minimal,” says Roman Zinigrad, an assistant professor of law at the American University of Paris. “If someone calls to kill a [certain ethnic minority group], for example, it’s considered hate speech. But practically anything else is allowed.”\n\nStill, the Macrons face challenges as they seek damages from Ms. Owens. While defamation laws do exist, the legal standards for proving defamation are stringent, with public figures facing a higher bar. Though all defamation plaintiffs must prove the statements made about them are false, public figures must additionally show that the statements were made with actual malice or a reckless regard for the truth was involved. Simple statements made in error about the famous do not rise to the level of defamation.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the case against Ms. Owens is impossible. Unlike French judges, who rely heavily on the technical aspects of the law, the reading of the law by American judges “involves a certain interpretation within the context of society,” says Dr. Zinigrad. “The law is not just a dead document.”\n\nFor now, the Macrons are celebrating their legal victory in France.\n\n“Up until now in France, we have had a tolerance for attacks against public figures, as if it’s part of the deal of being famous,” says Gérard Haas, a Paris-based lawyer who specializes in cyberbullying.\n\nBut now, there are clearer limits as to what can be said about others online, with potential sanctions to back it up. \n\n“It’s not easy” to say something criminal about a public figure, says Mr. Haas. “But it’s possible.”","summary":"French first lady Brigitte Macron may have won her case against those who lied about her gender in France.

Midterm elections are often viewed as a measure of voters' response to the sitting president's policies.\n\nAfter a year of aggressive deportation practices, a withdrawal from the international arena and economic upheaval, 2026 has begun with the Trump administration abducting a foreign leader and launching offensives on foreign nations.\n\nRepublicans will seek to maintain a 218-213 majority in the House, following the death of Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., announced on Tuesday, and three-seat majority in the Senate while Democrats hope to make gains and offer a check on Trump's power. The results will signal approval or disapproval of how the country is being run and will set the landscape for the final two years of Trump's presidency.\n\nRetirements to bring changes to Senate\n\nNine senators have announced they are retiring from the chamber in 2026, including one of the most senior lawmakers.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving Senate party leader in history, will end his 40-year career at the end of the current term. He is one of four Republicans retiring from the Senate.\n\nSix Republicans launched campaigns to succeed McConnell last year, along with eight Democrats. Kentucky has been a firmly Republican-leaning state, voting more than 65% for Trump in 2024.\n\nAlabama voted similarly in 2024, with about 64% of votes going to Trump. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., is ending his time in the Senate to run for state governor.\n\nLike Tuberville, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., will leave the Senate to run for governor of their respective states. Bennet has been a senator since 2009 while Blackburn entered the chamber in 2019.\n\nOf the senators not running for re-election, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is leaving open a seat that is considered to be the most competitive. Ernst has been a senator since 2015.\n\nRepublicans are backing Rep. Ashley Hinson to take Ernst's seat. Hinson was elected to the U.S. House in 2020.\n\nThree candidates are in the Democratic primary seeking to challenge Hinson in November: state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek and Nathan Sage, a military veteran.\n\nWahls was the youngest Iowa Senate Democratic Leader, serving in that role from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe race for an open seat in North Carolina features former Gov. Roy Cooper on the ticket for the Democratic Party. Cooper served two terms as governor.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley has earned the endorsement of Trump but he is being challenged in the primary by Michele Morrow. She ran an unsuccessful campaign for North Carolina's superintendent of public instruction in 2024 and has never held public office.\n\nNorth Carolina has historically been a tightly contested state. Trump earned about 50% of the vote there in 2024. Prior to that, the last time a presidential candidate received 50% of votes was 2012 when Mitt Romney received 50.4%.\n\nNorth Carolina's Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 2014. Kay Hagan was a state senator from 2009 to 2015 before being succeeded by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Tillis is retiring at the end of the term.\n\nThe Democratic Party has tapped former Sen. Sherrod Brown to attempt a return to the chamber in 2026 after he lost a bid for re-election in 2024 to Republican Bernie Moreno.\n\nBrown has launched a campaign to challenge Sen. Jon Husted, the Republican who was appointed to fill Vice President JD Vance's seat that he vacated when Trump was elected president.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., is running for re-election in a state won by Trump in 2024. Three Republicans have entered their party's primary to challenge Ossoff: Rep. Buddy Carter, Rep. Mike Collins and former college and pro football coach Derek Dooley.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp has given Dooley his endorsement.\n\nGeorgia's 6th Congressional District re-elected Democrat Lucy McBath to the House in 2024 by nearly 50 points over her Republican challenger. Democrats hold both of the state's Senate seats.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, will be challenged in 2026 but who will be on the other side of the ticket will not be known until the Democratic primary in June. Collins represents a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried by about seven points in 2024.\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills and military veteran Graham Platner are campaigning in the Democratic primary.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn is running for re-election but will first have to win a contested Republican primary. Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has been a key figure in Texas' redistricting battle and often opponent to Biden administration policies, will challenge Cornyn, along with Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nIn another battleground state, the retirement of Democratic Sen. Gary Peters will leave the race for a Michigan Senate seat open.\n\nFormer congressman Mike Rogers is expected to be on the ticket for Republicans after receiving an endorsement from Trump. Three candidates have entered the Democratic primary: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and physician Abdul El-Sayed.\n\nCongresspeople seeking new offices\n\nSeveral members of Congress are running for different offices outside of the House chambers, including 11 running for governor. Meanwhile 18 members of the House are retiring, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nRepublicans running for governor in their respective states include Iowa Rep. Randy Feenstra, South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace.\n\nRep Chip Roy, R-Texas, will not run for re-election as he will try to succeed Paxton as his state's attorney general.\n\nNew Mexico's 2nd Congressional District is held by Democrat Gabriel Vasquez but was won by Trump in 2024. New Mexico has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 2008.\n\nVasquez faces a challenge from Republicans Greg Cunningham, a veteran of the U.S. Marines and former Albuquerque police officer. Cunningham ran for a seat in the state legislature in 2024 and lost.\n\nArizona's 6th Congressional District seat, held by Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani, had several Democrats looking to challenge Ciscomani in November.\n\nSome candidates have begun dropping out of the Democratic primary as 2026 has arrived. JoAnna Mendoza, a military veteran, and engineer Chris Donat remain in the race. Mendoza has vastly outraised Donat, tallying $1.9 million in receipts compared to Donat's $21,061, according to Federal Elections Commission data.\n\nTrump won Arizona in 2024 with about 52% of the vote.\n\nColorado's newest seat, District 8, is held by Republican Rep. Gabe Evans. He represents the district located in the northern Denver area after flipping the seat for Republicans in 2024.\n\nEvans has a new challenger in the Republican primary as of November with former Air Force cadet and current Colorado Army Reserve Capt. Adam DeRito filing to run against him.\n\nDeRito has been in a long legal battle with the U.S. Air Force which expelled him hours before he was set to graduate in 2010. He was denied a diploma for allegedly violating academy rules by fraternizing with a subordinate. DeRito claims these allegations were retaliation for him reporting sexual assaults at the academy.\n\nThe Democratic primary is set to feature five candidates, former state legislator Shannon Bird, state lawmaker Manny Rutinel, Marine veteran Evan Munsing, Denis Abrate and self-proclaimed former Republican John Francis Szemler.\n\nMichigan is one of the biggest battleground states in 2026 with three seats expected to feature close races, along with an open Senate seat.\n\nDistrict 7, held by Republican Tom Barrett, has flipped in consecutive elections. Barrett, a U.S. Army veteran, will seek re-election with seven Democrats declared for their primary. He assumed the seat after Democrat Elissa Slotkin ran for and was elected to the Senate.\n\nAmong the Democrats vying to challenge Barrett is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, Michigan State professor Josh Cowen and William Lawrence, the founder of nonprofit environmental advocacy organization the Sunrise Movement.\n\nDistrict 10 will feature an open election as Rep. John James, a Republican, enters the state gubernatorial race.\n\nFEC campaign data shows a field of six Democrats seeking their party's nomination. Eric Chung, a former U.S. Department of Commerce official under the Biden administration, has raised the most out of any candidate, followed by Republican Robert Lulgjuraj, a former county prosecutor.\n\nAfter some delay, District 4 Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican, announced last month that he will seek re-election. Four Democrats have filed to appear in the primary, including state Sen. Sean McCann.","summary":"The 2026 midterm elections are coming later this year with 33 seats in the U.S. Senate and all 435 House seats on ballots across the country.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2026/01/06/2026-midterm-elections-house-senate-preview/4231767711258/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4231767711258/2026/1/9539d9099f4e7c96c8b6bab19a90912e/v1.5/2026-midterm-preview-Key-races-in-US-House-Senate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 17:35:28","author":"Joe Fisher","authors":["Joe Fisher"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":391685064,"title":"DOJ Launches Criminal Investigation Into Tim Walz","text":"On Monday, Tim Walz announced he was dropping his bid for a third term as Minnesota’s governor amid an ongoing fraud scandal. I said that dropping out of the race wouldn’t save him from being held accountable, and sure enough, on Monday evening, Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the Department of Justice has launched a sweeping criminal investigation into Walz for his potential role in the fraud.\n\nAppearing on Fox News with Jesse Watters, Bondi said the developments surrounding Walz were hardly surprising.\n\n“The scale of the fraud that the Trump Administration, with the help of great independent journalists like Nick Shirley, is uncovering right now… is surely shocking, but President Trump has been calling out Tim Walz for his incompetence and corrupt leadership for a very long time, and Trump was right about everything.”\n\nWalz, however, in announcing his dropping his reelection bid, blamed Republicans and President Trump for exploiting the crisis to make Minnesota “a colder, meaner place” by calling attention to the fraud. He also framed his decision as a selfless act designed to allow him to focus on bringing the fraudsters to justice.\n\n“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity.… So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.”\n\nThe Department of Justice obviously wasn’t buying this narrative.\n\n“This is a man who can no longer even win the support of the voters within his home state because his policies have failed them,” said Bondi.\n\nRelated: Walz’s Press Conference Was Such a Disaster That He Bolted Without Taking Questions\n\nShe went on to deliver a blunt assessment of what Minnesota has become under Walz’s leadership: “And now the great people of Minnesota, a state that was once known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes, has been turned into the Land of 10,000 Somali Schemes because of their governor.\"\n\n“And don’t forget, this is a guy who was at the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket, the number two,” she reminded listeners. “He was Kamala Harris’s running mate just about a year ago, until President Trump crushed them last November, and it was in large part because the president was calling out this fraud.”\n\nAccording to Bondi, investigating that alleged fraud became a priority from the very start of Trump’s second term.\n\n“And so, this has been a day-one priority for the Trump Administration, Jesse,” she said. “The Department of Justice has convicted and prosecuted nearly 100 defendants in Minnesota, and because of these new details and this new reporting that has come to light, this is an all-hands-on-deck across-the-entire-government effort.”\n\nThat effort now spans multiple federal agencies. Bondi said resources are being surged and funds frozen as investigators dig deeper.\n\n“You saw today, the Department of Homeland Security announced we have nearly 2,000 agents from the Homeland Security Investigations Team, the FBI is on the ground, and we’re freezing money.”\n\nShe added that the Health and Human Services Department has already taken concrete steps, including cutting funding to potentially fraudulent daycare centers, and she made clear that the investigation could reach to the very top of Minnesota’s government.\n\n“Rest assured, it’s a top priority for President Trump, and he believes that Governor Walz is criminally liable,\" said Bondi. \"And I think the Department of Justice is going to find out.”\n\n🚨 BREAKING: The Department of Justice is launching a CRIMINAL PROBE into Tampon Tim Walz in relation to endless fraud he oversaw in MinnesotaFINALLY!Walz may soon be moving straight out of the governor’s mansion and straight into a federal penitentiary 😏 pic.twitter.com/zrqcihXfbk— Nick Sortor (@nicksortor) January 6, 2026\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

Jerry Nadler.\n\nConway, 62, filed his paperwork to run on Dec. 22 but made his campaign official Tuesday with a video ad. He is a former Republican.\n\n\"We have a corrupt president, a mendacious president, a criminal president whose masked agents are disappearing people from our streets, who's breaking international law, and he's running our federal government like a mob protection racket,\" Conway said in his video.\n\nConway is a formerly conservative lawyer who rose to widespread fame when his then-wife, Kellyanne Conway, became an adviser to President Donald Trump in his first term. Despite his wife's position, he was an outspoken voice against the president. They divorced in 2023.\n\n\"I know how to fight these people. They are corrupt, amoral people,\" Conway said. \"They will stop at nothing to rig the system for themselves. I've been fighting Trump for years, and nothing will stop me.\"\n\nNadler, D-N.Y., announced in September that he would retire from Congress. The 78-year-old Nadler said he wanted to make room for a younger generation. He represents New York's 12th District, which includes Midtown and the Upper West and Upper East sides of Manhattan.\n\nThe 12th District voted for Vice President Kamala Harris by 64 points in 2024.\n\nThe field for that primary is crowded.

Kennedy's grandson; New York State Assemblypeople Micah Lasher and Alex Bores; activists Cameron Kasky and Mathew Shurka; journalist Jami Floyd; civil rights lawyer Laura Dunn; fundraiser Alan Pardee; nonprofit founder Liam Elkind; entrepreneur Micah Bergdale; and software engineer Christopher Diep.\n\n\"We're at a crossroads in our country, and Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the Constitution and the rule of law and democratic government that we have ever seen in our lifetime,\" Conway told NBC News.\n\nConway only recently moved back to the district, a point his opponents have made.\n\n\"This campaign welcomes George to the race. And the city. And the party,\" Bores said in a statement. \"I personally would be delighted to offer George local dining tips.

So why isn't he running in Bethesda, Md., or Alpine, N.J., where he belongs?\"\n\nConway said he spent his legal career working in the district and that it has \"been the epicenter of my life.\"\n\n\"I lived in this district for decades before moving out to the suburbs,\" he said. \"All four of my kids were born in this district, and my life is centered around this district.\"","summary":"Vocal Trump critic George Conway officially announced his run for the House of Representatives as a Democrat in New York for Rep.

Kelly O'Donnell has been following this for us tonight. Kelly the suspect breached a security perimeter?\nO'DONNELL: That's right, authorities say the 26 year old man was armed with a hammer when he approached the Vice President's personal residence in Cincinnati and he shattered windows. The Secret Service also said that he damaged one of their vehicles but he did not get inside the house. The Vances had returned here to Washington hours earlier. William DeFoor is being held on local charges including vandalism. Right now no motive has been identified. The suspect has a court-documented mental health history. The Vice President said he appreciates the well wishes but wants less attention about this, noting that he and his wife try to protect our kids as much as possible from the realities of this life.\n\nO'Donnell left out the specifics of DeFoor's previous arrests. Reportedly, in 2023, for trespassing at UC Health's Psychiatric Emergency Services building. He was found not competent to stand trial and charges were dismissed. And in 2024, he was charged with two counts of vandalism for breaking a front window to a Hyde Park business. Records reportedly show that DeFoor was granted \"treatment in lieu of conviction.\"\nShe also left out this from The New York Post, which reveals that DeFoor \"is allegedly the son of a prominent millionaire family, and appears to have been going by 'Julia' in recent weeks.\" The story also says that Defoor's father donated thousands to Kamala Harris’ failed presidential campaign in 2024.\nStill at least NBC reported the attack. Over on CBS Evening News, newly minted anchor Tony Dokoupil apparently couldn't squeeze in a mention of the attack, but had a full minute for Lakeview Oregon, which decided not to raise taxes for needed funds, but rather they put out a nude calendar called \"Outback Naked.\"\n\nDOKOUPIL: ..It's called outback naked.

With that information now out there, you can be sure the liberal media will run as far away from this as they can.","summary":"One would think that if the hometown residence of the Vice President of the United States had its windows smashed by someone wielding a hammer, who was subsequently arrested by police after being detained by Secret Service agents, that it would make the three nightly network newscasts.

For many, if not most Americans, the televised carnage of January 6, 2021, is a distant and apparently irrelevant memory.\n\n“Trump did what he set out to do. He has fundamentally changed this country forever,” said Michael Fanone, a former Washington, DC, police officer who suffered a heart attack after an insurrectionist attacked him with a stun gun that day. “And the American people let him do it.”\n\nAmanda Carpenter, a former Republican Senate aide and now a researcher for the group Protect Democracy, said Trump has actually turned history on its head and made it the official policy of the US government to lie about a day on which violence left 140 police officers injured and led to the deaths of five.\n\n“Our government has not just normalised January 6, it has radicalised the events into a loyalty test for top government officials,” she said. “Willingness to rewrite the history of that day, namely by pardoning violent rioters who maimed and injured police officers, is part of the Trump administration’s basic operations system.”\n\nTrump White House officials did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment. \n\nTuesday marks the first January 6 that Trump will be back in the White House since the one five years ago when he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol and warned them they would lose their country if they did not “fight like hell.” No commemoration of the day is on his public schedule, and a meeting with House Republicans is to take place not at the Capitol, but at the Kennedy Center which Trump recently had named after himself.\n\nTrump himself continues to lie on a near daily basis that he won the 2020 election, regardless of the venue. “The election was rigged in 2020,” he said at a Dec. 14 White House Christmas party.\n\nIn fact, Trump lost the 2020 election by 7 million votes overall, but by narrow margins in the key states of Arizona, Wisconsin and Georgia. He began lying in the wee hours of Election Night, before all the votes were even counted, that he had actually won. In the coming weeks, after his lawsuits to overturn the results began failing for lack of evidence, Trump and his aides instead had his allies in a handful of states won by Democrat Joe Biden concoct fake Electoral College slates for his vice president, Mike Pence, to accept as legitimate when Congress met on Jan. 6 to certify the results.\n\nAmerican democracy was saved that day when Pence refused to go along with Trump’s demand that he award him a second term or, alternatively, send the election to the US House, where Trump likely would have won because of his strength in rural, low-population states.\n\nJack Smith, the federal prosecutor in charge of the fraud and conspiracy criminal case against Trump for his actions leading up to and on Jan. 6, told lawmakers in testimony last month that the country is fortunate that Americans never learned what chaos might have unfolded had Pence gone along with Trump’s scheme.\n\n“Well, thankfully, we don’t know,” said Smith, whose prosecution ended when the Department of Justice, following established protocol against prosecuting a sitting president, dismissed the case after Trump won back the White House in 2024.\n\n“But I would say that he ― he and the other people who stood up and said, ‘I’m not going to do that,’ may have changed the course of history in terms of our country of having an election where someone took power in our country who didn’t actually win the election,” Smith said.\n\nPrevious vice presidents have had the opportunity to flout the rules in the way Trump had demanded of Pence but instead honored the will of the electorate.\n\nIn 1961, then-Vice President and Republican nominee Richard Nixon ― notwithstanding credible allegations of election fraud ― for the good of the country accepted the certified results and declared Democrat John F. Kennedy the winner.\n\nIn 2001, sitting Vice President Al Gore similarly accepted a controversial and divided Supreme Court ruling that ended his attempt to recount Florida ballots. He also certified the victory of Republican George W. Bush after losing Florida by 537 votes.\n\nAnd a year ago, former Vice President Kamala Harris certified Trump’s victory rather than ginning up fake electoral slates for herself in key states and declaring herself president-elect.\n\n“One of the ironies, obviously, is that a lot of Republicans wouldn’t have liked it if Kamala Harris had decided four years later which slates of electors to choose and which ones not to,” said Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff who, along with Pence and his family, had to take refuge when Trump turned his mob against Pence with an angry social media post.\n\nShort said he is not sure why voters did not consider Trump’s actions that day an unforgivable offense and chose to return him to power, but that one big reason may have been that Biden was, in the end, certified the winner and took office on schedule.\n\nPolling has shown that while Trump has persuaded his hardcore base that the insurrection was a justified protest against a “stolen” election, most Americans agree that it was an attempt to overturn an election that Trump had lost.\n\nShort said he doubts that other presidents who lose reelection would be able to get away with repeating Trump’s playbook. “I don’t think it did create a precedent for others,” he said.\n\nErick Erickson, a conservative radio show host who was so outraged by the Jan. 6 assault that he called on police to “shoot the protestors” and later urged the Senate to convict Trump on his impeachment to prevent him from seeking office again, said he also is not worried about the future of democracy.\n\n“I think democracy is fine,” he said. “But voters were offered two bad choices and picked what they thought was the least bad choice based on their self-interest. That is democracy in action.”\n\nPolice officers who defended the Capitol that day from Trump’s mob are less sure, pointing out that just five years later, some of the insurrectionists who committed the most violent crimes plan to march to mark the anniversary.\n\n“If we allow the memory of January 6 to be fully hijacked by Donald Trump and MAGA, then yes, we will have normalized this kind of anti-democratic authoritarianism,” said Aquilino Gonnell, a former US Capitol Police sergeant who now works with the anti-Trump group Home of the Brave.\n\nHarry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer, said Trump supporters are trying to whitewash what happened. “History bends toward distortion when accountability is denied,” he said.\n\nFanone, though, said the fact that Trump is back in the White House suggests that the battle for accountability has already been lost: “As my kids would say, ‘We’re cooked.’”","summary":"Trump supporters stand on U.S. Capitol Police armored vehicles as others take over the steps of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress works to certify the electoral college votes. WASHINGTON ― Losing presidential candidates who in the past were limited to asking for recounts and filing lawsuits may now, thanks to Donald Trump, have a new tool at their disposal: attempting a coup to steal the election by force and intimidation.\n\nFive years after inciting a violent attack on the US Capitol in a last-gasp effort to cling to power, Trump is now back in the White House, from where he has pardoned all those who participated in his insurrection, including the hundreds who assaulted police officers.

Doug LaMalfa dies at 65","text":"Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a fourth-generation rice farmer from Northern California known for his focus on agriculture and forestry policies, died Tuesday at age 65.\n\n“Early this morning Congressman Doug LaMalfa returned home to the Lord,” his chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, said in a statement. “Congressman LaMalfa cared deeply for the people he served and worked tirelessly to hold the government to its word to fix our failing forests, build water storage, and leave people to be free to choose what is best for themselves.”\n\nHis office did not release a cause of death but characterized it as “unexpected.”\n\nLaMalfa’s death further erodes the Republican majority in the House: With Monday’s resignation of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the GOP will hold a 218-213 advantage in the chamber, with two Democratic vacancies and two Republican vacancies. \n\nTributes poured in from both sides of the aisle Tuesday for LaMalfa, who was chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus.\n\nSpeaking at House Republicans’ retreat in Washington, President Donald Trump said he was “really saddened” by the news and called LaMalfa a “fantastic person.”\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., called LaMalfa “a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America.”\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said LaMalfa was a “principled conservative” and “was never afraid to fight for rural communities, farmers, and working families [and] brought grit, authenticity, and conviction to everything he did in public service.”\n\nCalifornia Rep. Young Kim praised her fellow Republican as a “genuinely kind, decent man who treated everyone with warmth and respect.”\n\nCalifornia Sen. Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat who served with LaMalfa in the House, called him a “friend and partner.” \n\n“Above all, he was deeply committed to his community and constituents, working to make life better for those he represented,” Schiff said on social media. \n\nFirst elected in 2012, LaMalfa represented California’s sprawling 1st District, a largely rural stretch that reaches from the northern suburbs of Sacramento to the Oregon state line and includes the cities of Chico, Redding and Yuba City.\n\nThe district was reshaped last year under a new Democrat-drawn map that California voters approved in response to mid-decade redistricting in GOP-controlled Texas. Under the new lines, the 1st District now extends south along the Pacific Coast into blue-leaning wine country, transforming from a Solid Republican seat that Trump carried by 25 points in 2024 to one that Kamala Harris would have carried by 12 points, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. \n\nLaMalfa was already facing several Democratic opponents, including educator Audrey Denney, who lost to him in both 2018 and 2020, and Mike McGuire, the former leader of the California Senate. \n\nUnder California law, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has 14 days to schedule a special election to fill LaMalfa’s seat. The rules also stipulate that the election must take place between 126 and 140 days after that. The special election would be held under the current district lines, not the redrawn ones. Under California rules, all candidates will run on the same ballot, with the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advancing to the special general election. \n\nIn Congress, LaMalfa was a senior member of the Agriculture Committee and chaired its Subcommittee on Forestry and Horticulture. He also served on the Transportation and Natural Resources committees. In 2024, he was elected chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, which focuses on rural issues. \n\nA staunch conservative who embraced a small-government ethos, LaMalfa was an advocate of proactive forest management and fewer regulatory hurdles, especially after watching a series of devastating forest fires rip through his rural district.\n\nLaMalfa used the aftermath of the 2021 Dixie fire as a backdrop for a video address on behalf of the Republican Party, highlighting the destruction from the blaze and arguing for passage of GOP legislation intended to mitigate future problems and restore forest growth.\n\nLaMalfa started out in politics by volunteering with the local Republican Party. He was first elected to the California State Assembly in 2002 and served for nearly a decade in the legislature, including a brief stint in the state Senate, before his election to Congress. \n\nAccording to Spannagel, his chief of staff, LaMalfa is survived by his wife, Jill, four children and a grandchild. \n\n“His tragic and unexpected passing leaves a deep impact on many,” Spannagel said. \n\nThere are currently four vacancies in the House, two for each party. Democrats are expected to fill one of them via a Jan. 31 all-Democratic special election runoff in Texas’ 18th District. New Jersey is scheduled to hold a special election in April to fill the seat of Democratic former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who was elected governor last fall. A special election for Greene’s seat in Georgia is yet to be set. \n\nJackie Wang and Aidan Quigley contributed to this report.\n\nThis report has been corrected to reflect the rules for the timing of a special election in California.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2026/01/06/doug-lamalfa-dies-house-republicans/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/house_gop_079_012225.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 11:39:42","author":"Posted January 6, 2026 At 11:39am, Updated January 7, 2026 At 4:13pm","authors":["Posted January 6, 2026 At 11:39am, Updated January 7, 2026 At 4:13pm"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.34}]}
