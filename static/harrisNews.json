Their plight could give the President Trump-appointed broadcast regulators at the Federal Communications Commission yet another reason to nix the Skydance deal given the administration’s desire to protect local broadcast news.\n\nUnless, of course, CBS backs off, something it has so far been loath to do given the pressures on its bottom line, sources said.\n\nMost Americans don’t appreciate the complex business dealings that go into watching a football game or a sitcom on their local affiliate. Here’s a 30,000-foot explanation. Cable companies pay local broadcasters like Sinclair, Nexstar, Gray Media and Cox Media for their signal so they can run their lines into the homes of millions of Americans.\n\nYes, it’s a shrinking number of viewers and a demo that skews older but it’s still substantial. There’s money to be made reaching this audience in terms of fees and advertising. That’s why local broadcasters become “affiliates” of major news networks and pay for their programming.\n\nThe entire arrangement is under stress, however. Cord cutting has pulled viewers away from network programming and cable fees are under pressure because there are fewer viewers. Ad rates are falling. Networks are moving programming to their streaming services, most of which aren’t profitable.\n\nTake it or leave it\n\nThe affiliates say they are caught in the crossfire, particularly when it comes to CBS as the network is seeking to squeeze every last dime out of a dying business model. CBS, they say, is negotiating dozens of contracts and — according to people repping some of the affiliates in the scuffle — demanding much higher fees on a take-it-or-leave it basis.\n\nThe fees are said to be so draconian that the affiliate business model is in existential danger at some point and maybe soon, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nA Paramount spokesman had no comment but people at the company directed me to a recent earnings call where its co-CEO, George Cheeks, addressed the affiliate issue and the cost pressures on the company.\n\n“We’re investing heavily in must-have live sports and the most watched prime-time entertainment schedule. Now if this dynamic were to change, it would be difficult for us to continue to foot that bill. And in that case, the affiliates and local viewers, they would be harmed.”\n\nHere’s where things could get interesting, and force CBS to back down. Just as CBS is moving forward with these price hikes, Shari Redstone, the media heiress who controls Paramount and its CBS subsidiary wants to sell the -company to independent studio Skydance.\n\nThe sale is significant for her. She and her family will walk away with $2 billion if the deal is approved by the FCC. It’s a modicum of the wealth left to her by her late father, Sumner Redstone, who built Paramount into a colossus before its value was decimated with the rest of traditional broadcast. But it’s more than enough to live on.\n\nFairness issues\n\nThat’s only if the Trump FCC approves the deal, which it’s delaying as it investigates fairness issues at CBS News. As I have written, Redstone is so desperate to get the deal approved that she is willing to settle a separate $20 billion lawsuit with Trump himself, who sued CBS’s “60 Minutes” for the same reason the FCC is holding up the deal. Both involve claims that “60 Minutes” doctored an interview with Trump’s 2024 opponent Kamala Harris to make the Democrat sound more presidential during the height of the campaign.\n\nYeah, it’s a real mess. And it could get messier because the Trumpers actually like local broadcasters as opposed to the “fake news” big guys. They believe local news is largely devoid of left-wing agitprop found at the networks, and it’s still an important source of information for small-town America.\n\nThat’s why they want the affiliate model to survive since Middle America is ground zero of the MAGA base, and much of it watches stuff the old-fashioned way, on television supplied by the affiliates.\n\nFCC Chair Brendan Carr, Trump’s point man on this, has his hands full regulating a changing media landscape and ensuring that broadcasters play by the rules, which under the law demands news-fairness guidelines for the privilege of using public airwaves as opposed to cable.\n\nHe has also made clear his support for local broadcasters, or in his words: “We don’t want local broadcasters to ultimately go the way of newspapers, and when you look at the current dynamic, I’m not sure it’s entirely healthy . . . We want local broadcasters to feel empowered to actually serve the interests of their local communities and not simply become a pass-through for nationwide content coming principally from Hollywood and New York.”\n\nLooks like Shari has another reason to worry about the Skydance deal.","summary":"The obstacles impeding Paramount’s $8 billion sale to Skydance keep piling up, and much of it involves CBS, the so-called Tiffany Network, and whether it has shed its rep for disseminating honest news.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/24/business/ugly-behind-the-scenes-battle-between-cbs-and-its-affiliates-adds-another-wrinkle-in-paramount-deal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/25.Gasparino.WEB_.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 23:43:29","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":324558978,"title":"Trump’s Address to West Point Graduates Blends Praise, Politics, and Complaints","text":"WEST POINT, N.Y.

His legacy would have been cherished.'\n\nHe argued the Democratic establishment enabled a delusion that Biden was the only person who could defeat Trump in the election.\n\nCarville described him as 'well-liked, admirable,' a man who 'exhibited strength through personal tragedy,' but ultimately 'should have been enjoying life'.\n\nIn the podcast Carville and Hunt do not give credence to any Republican conspiracy theories that suggest Biden's health was covered up far in advance.\n\nLast week, Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.\n\nHunt said: 'There's no evidence the cancer was known about a year before, as Trump and others have charged. He hadn't even taken a PSA test since 2014.'\n\nThe pair also do not point to any single moment of cognitive decline that caused a policy crisis.\n\nHunt continued: 'I didn't find one instance in all the books where his slippage caused a real policy disaster.'\n\nCarville added: 'We pretty much know the parameters of what happened—but there's plenty of specifics left.\n\n'And there are going to be so many books written on this s***. God knows what else we'll find out.'\n\nCarville and Hunt did not spare Biden's Republican rivals either, unloading on what they called a 'clown show' of incompetence on Capitol Hill currently.\n\nThey seethed at Kristi Noem's ignorance of basic constitutional principles, specifically her conflating habeas corpus with the authority to deport migrants.\n\nCarville said: 'Joe Biden may be old, but he knows what habeas corpus is.

The Biden family arguably inflicted significant damage on the Democratic Party by keeping the aged Joe Biden in office beyond his prime; the Democratic Party further harmed itself by 1) appointing Kamala “Queen of Word Salads” Harris as the successor without consulting a single primary voter about their opinion. Despite these missteps, this may ultimately benefit the country.\n\nNew York University professor and leftist podcaster Scott Galloway, in a recent episode of his podcast “Pivot,” recognized the initial issue accurately. The follow-up analysis? Not as much.\n\nHarsh language follows:\n\nIn a recent episode of his “Pivot” podcast co-hosted with journalist Kara Swisher, Galloway contended that former President Biden’s mishandling of the 2024 election for the Democratic Party will define his “legacy.”\nSpeaking of how Biden ensured former Vice President Kamala Harris would be his replacement on the campaign trail last year, he said, “The reality is she was not a strong candidate and President Biden and his family’s narcissism have severely (expletive deleted) this country. Severely. And that is his legacy.”\n\nSo far he’s right. And he even had a notion as to how they should have proceeded after old Joe’s shockingly bad debate performance.\n\nGalloway added that Harris was “not a great candidate,” though he praised her efforts in trying to replace her boss. “I think she did a good job given the hand she was dealt with, but this is a candidate who didn’t make it to Iowa four years earlier, which says to me America didn’t think of her as a great candidate.”\n\nAnd that’s where he goes wrong. \n\nKamala Harris didn’t do a good job. She did a perfectly awful job. She picked the worst possible running mate in Tim “Great Walz of China.” She is an execrable public speaker. In their one debate, Donald Trump absolutely defenestrated her. Her campaign staff was the worst; recent reports indicate they didn’t even tell her how bad their internal polling numbers really were. It’s all coming out now, and the Democrats are spinning like gyroscopes trying to put lipstick on the pig that was Kamala Harris’s campaign.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnintended consequences are unintended.

She made the remarks Friday night while discussing Original Sin, a new book about Biden’s decline by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson. In the exposé, Tapper and Thompson claim that only a small group of aides had regular access to Biden and the First Lady.\n\n“Six or seven? That was the number that had the close-up access? And I say this because in some ways, I think it’s exonerating of much of the Democratic Party,” McEnany said Friday night on Fox News’s Jesse Watters Primetime.\n\nMcEnany said it’s common for only an exclusive group of people to have access to the president.\n\n“I worked at the RNC, didn't have much access to President Trump,” she said. “Worked on the campaign. Didn't have much access to President Trump at the time. It really was a small cadre in the West Wing.”\n\nThe book, which hit the shelves this week just days after Biden revealed his cancer diagnosis, details the then-president’s failed reelection bid and the alleged cover-up of his decline, physically and mentally. The book made several shocking claims, including that Biden’s aides wanted to put him in a wheelchair.\n\n“Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” Tapper and Thompson wrote.\n\nTapper and Thompson also detailed an alleged interaction between Biden and George Clooney, in which the president failed to recognize the A-list actor.\n\n“It was like watching someone who was not alive,” an unnamed “Hollywood VIP” who witnessed the interaction told the authors. “It was startling. And we all looked at each other. It was so awful.”\n\nThe book also covers Biden’s decision to drop out, and the subsequent reaction from Democrats. David Plouffe, who worked on Kamala Harris's campaign, told Tapper and Thompson that Biden “totally f***ed us” by not stepping down sooner.\n\nPlouffe characterized the campaign as “a f***ing nightmare,” which he said was “all Biden.”\n\nIn response to the book’s release, Biden spokesperson Chris Meagher previously said his team is “still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline.”\n\n“In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president,” he said.","summary":"Kayleigh McEnany served as Donald Trump’s press secretary during the final months of his first term","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-kayleigh-mcenany-biden-decline-book-b2757305.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/09/24/09/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 19:59:12","author":"Joe Miles,Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Joe Miles","Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.471},{"id":324523750,"title":"Trump’s Address to West Point Graduates Combines Commendation, Politics, and Complaints","text":"President Donald Trump delivered a speech at West Point on Saturday, marking the first service academy commencement address of his second term.

Jasmine Crockett of Texas as \"the type of leader\" their struggling political party needs during a Friday appearance on The Breakfast Club radio show.The endorsement comes as Hogg faces potential removal from his leadership position following a credentials committee vote this month that challenged his February election due to procedural errors.Newsweek reached out to Hogg and Crockett via email on Saturday for comment.Why It MattersThis endorsement highlights the ongoing identity crisis within the Democratic Party following comprehensive losses in the 2024 election cycle. Democrats lost the White House, Senate, and House, creating uncertainty about the party's future direction and leadership. The public backing of Crockett, known for controversial statements and confrontational tactics, signals a potential shift toward more combative political messaging.Recent polling shows former Vice President Kamala Harris currently leading potential 2028 presidential candidates, followed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.What To KnowHogg praised the Dallas congresswoman's confrontational political style, describing her as someone who \"fights and calls out the bulls***\" and possesses the authenticity Democrats seek in leadership.Crockett, 44, has established herself as one of President Donald Trump's most vocal critics since his 2024 election victory. She has referred to the president as a \"dictator\" and \"enemy to the United States,\" calling him \"the person that allegedly got elected.\" In March, she suggested uncertainty about whether the U.S. \"will have elections\" in 2028.During interview, Hogg elaborated on why he views Crockett as ideal Democratic leadership material. \"I think Jasmine is, frankly, the type of leader that we're really looking to support in some senses, right?\" he told host Charlamagne Tha God. \"Somebody who is out there that frankly doesn't give a damn what the other side — at least the elected Republicans in Congress — say.\"Hogg described Crockett as having the \"authenticity\" Democrats seek in a standard-bearer, noting that \"people want to see somebody who fights and calls out the bulls*** ultimately.\"The congresswoman has made several controversial statements beyond her Trump criticism. She described a deported alleged MS-13 gang member as \"a lot less criminal\" than Trump and argued in a December Vanity Fair interview that Hispanic Trump voters had a \"slave mentality.\" In March, she mocked Texas Governor Greg Abbott's wheelchair use, dubbing him \"Governor Hot Wheels,\" prompting Abbott to suggest she has \"nothing to sell but hate.\"Crockett is also positioning herself for greater party leadership roles. Earlier this month, she announced her intention to compete for the top Democratic position on the House Oversight Committee following Rep. Gerry Connolly's decision to step down due to his cancer battle. As the committee's current vice ranking member, Crockett told Politico she is \"ready to shine a light on the very dark things taking place in our country under this administration.\"The lawmaker faces potential competition from Ocasio-Cortez, who previously lost the ranking member position to Connolly in December by a 131-84 vote, reportedly with backing from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The oversight committee leadership race could serve as another test of progressive influence within the Democratic caucus.Hogg, 25, became a national figure following the 2018 Parkland school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where he was a senior. Since his DNC election, he has drawn criticism for plans to spend $20 million challenging long-serving Democratic House members in primaries, creating friction with party leadership.What People Are SayingDavid Hogg on The Breakfast Club: \"I love her. She is amazing. I think that people want to see somebody who fights and calls out the bulls*** ultimately. I think that's what Jasmine does.\"President Donald Trump on Meet the Press earlier this month: \"I can't name one Democrat, I mean, I look at the Democrats. They're in total disarray. They have a new person named Crockett. I watched her speak the other day. She's definitely a low IQ person. And they said she's the future of the party.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris praised Crockett and other politicians during a speech April 30 posted by PBS News Hour: \"And I will tell you the courage of all these Americans inspires me. And I have been inspired. By movements like the one in Wisconsin that put Susan Crawford on the Supreme Court. By the State of the People Power Tour that is aiming to ignite a grassroots movement to lift up voices and advance freedom and justices. And ty leaders across the spectrum including Congressional Leaders like Corey Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Cross, AOC, and Bernie Sanders. All who in different ways have been speaking with moral clarity about this moment.\"What Happens NextThe full DNC will vote in June on whether to remove Hogg from his vice chair position and conduct a new election.Meanwhile, Crockett's rising profile within progressive circles, combined with Hogg's endorsement, positions her as a potential voice in shaping the party's approach to Republican opposition.","summary":"The embattled DNC vice chair endorsed Rep.

Severely. And that is his legacy.”\n\nGalloway began his point by stating that the party should have had a primary following Biden’s withdrawal from the race so that the best possible candidate could have beaten then-GOP candidate Donald Trump.\n\n“I was Saturday afternoon quarterbacking,” he said. “I said have a mini ‘Shark Tank ’- like primary with the best eight candidates – go from two debates with eight, then to four, then to two. It would have dominated the media cycle.”\n\nGalloway added that Harris was “not a great candidate,” though he praised her efforts in trying to replace her boss. “I think she did a good job given the hand she was dealt with, but this is a candidate who didn’t make it to Iowa four years earlier, which says to me America didn’t think of her as a great candidate.”\n\nIn 2024, Galloway recorded a video for Democrats voting from abroad. In January 2025, he posted an article on Medium with the title “How to Survive the Next Four Years.” \n\nThe former president has been criticized by his own party in the months following the election for not dropping out of the race soon enough and leaving room for a Democratic primary. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., argued days after the election that “had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race.” She added, “The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, there would be an open primary.” \n\nFormer Harris surrogate and DNC fundraiser, Lindy Li, also grilled Biden for endorsing Harris immediately after dropping out, saying the move headed off a primary.\n\n“I actually think President Biden, you know, the whole endorsing her thirty minutes after he dropped out, I think that was a big f-you to the party,” she said several days after Trump’s victory. \n\nOther Democratic figures have said Biden compounded this problem by demanding that Harris stay in lockstep with his presidential agenda. According to a recent book written by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, the former president “would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win. But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: Let there be no daylight between us.”\n\nDuring the podcast, Galloway added that Biden’s insistence on Harris running, and her subsequent loss, will be how he’s remembered.\n\n“I will get s— for this because people are correctly feeling empathy for him, but his legacy, in my view, has been ruined by this,” he said. \n\nReps for Biden did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","summary":"NYU professor and liberal podcast host Scott Galloway criticized the Biden family this week, saying its \"narcissism\" has hurt the country.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/24/media/biden-familys-narcissism-severely-f-the-country-says-liberal-nyu-professor-scott-galloway/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/2024-former-us-president-joe-105248767.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/22oNtWhC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-24 18:01:42","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":324500198,"title":"Brett Favre suggests Netflix documentary targets him for Trump support","text":"Brett Favre appears to believe Netflix is out to get him due to his support of President Donald Trump.

She is pictured alongside Emhoff on the iconic aircraft in August 2024\n\nHarris was dressed in black on both sightings but traded her heels for a $1350 pair of white Celine sneakers at the domestic terminal. \n\nWhen former first couple Barack and Michelle Obama patronised the heritage-listed Balmoral venue in March, 2023 the menu items included Coral Trout, WA Marron, Handmade Fettucine and Sydney Rock Oysters.\n\nLed by executive chef Aaron Ward, the beachside restaurant features a 350-strong wine list with seasonal mains in 2025 ranging from a $49 roasted eggplant to a $65 Rangers Valley wagyu. \n\nHarris' visit was a more low-key stop-in than that of the Obama's ahead of which a crowd of about 200 revellers watched on as the couple made for the venue's private 'Good Room' for lunch. \n\nIt was a rare public sighting of Harris who has kept a relatively low profile since she and her would be VP Tim Walz were resoundingly wiped out by returning Republican president Donald Trump in November. \n\nTrump secured wins in all seven swing states, improving on his 2016 victory over former Democrat nominee Hilary Clinton making him the second president in US history to serve non-consecutive terms following Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. \n\nThough Harris has been tight-lipped on her plans for the future, rumour has abounded she may run as governor of California in a bid to oust the term-limited Gavin Newsom. \n\nBranded as Harris' first speaking engagement in Australia, promotional material for the Gold Coast event described her as a 'trailblazer through her entire career, committed in her vision for ensuring all Americans can climb the ladder of economic opportunity.'\n\nHarris pictured with her dining party on Friday night before flying to the Gold Coast\n\nHarris is pictured arriving at Sydney's domestic airport on Saturday ahead of a scheduled speaking engagement at a real estate conference on the Gold Coast\n\nExact moment of Kamala Harris' blistering split with Joe Biden revealed in bombshell new book\n\nMany of Kamala Harris´ supporters and detractors alike think she'd have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.\n\nNo other candidate in California could match her résumé of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.\n\nBeyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: 'I´ll see you out there. I´m not going anywhere.'\n\nTo make another run for president, Harris would have to convince national Democrats that she's the face of the party´s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last year. \n\nShe's also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.\n\nThe 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump´s agenda in Washington.\n\nDoug EmhoffCaliforniaKamala Harris\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWhy ex-US Vice President Kamala Harris was dining at Sydney restaurant seven months on from her defeat at the hands of Donald Trump\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The former Democrat presidential nominee was pictured dining alongside her husband Doug Emhoff in a rare public appearance since her historic defeat in November.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14745737/Former-Vice-President-Kamala-Harris-dining-Sydney-restaurant-Donald-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/24/16/98715289-0-image-m-94_1748102272862.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/24/2806239797124877634/1024x576_MP4_2806239797124877634.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-24 15:58:08","author":"Editor,Nick Wilson","authors":["Editor","Nick Wilson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.281},{"id":324480236,"title":"Jon Stewart, Obama speechwriter rip Harris, others over Biden’s mental acuity: ‘Lied to the American people’","text":"The hosts of “Pod Save America” and Jon Stewart are questioning former President Joe Biden’s mental acuity following the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s book, “Original Sin.”\n\n“So everybody goes on television and goes, ‘You don’t understand,” Jon Stewart said during a Thursday episode of his podcast, “The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart,” discussing how people would try to frame concerns about Biden’s health. “I sit with this guy. He’s the smartest one in the room. I can’t keep up with him. I’m exhausted. I went to a meeting, and he was using words I didn’t even know were words! They were fantastic! I had to look them up. He’s the smartest man in the world.'” \n\nOn Tuesday, “Original Sin,” which looks in part at the efforts made by top Biden aides and allies to hide the truth about Biden’s mental and physical health, providing a depiction of a president who was routinely confused and disorientated during his term, was released.\n\nDuring his podcast Thursday, Stewart talked about how he thinks those in Biden’s circle tried to control what the public saw. \n\n“You know, Kamala Harris comes out, ‘I sit with this man. You don’t understand,’” Stewart said. “You don’t see it.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, has anyone filmed that? Because you should show that.’ Because it was a very simple case to puncture. People are saying, ‘I’m a little concerned about his stamina and cognitive ability. Here’s how we can dispel that.’ Just put him out there and let him show us how f—ing smart – and they wouldn’t do it. Because they knew they couldn’t.”\n\nJon Favreau, former President Barack Obama’s head speechwriter from 2005-2013, said that the people closest to Biden were not honest about his decline. \n\n“Throughout Biden’s term, you had it with the age issue, you also had it with inflation, right,” Favreau said.\n\n“In the Biden administration, a lot of elected Democrats were like, ‘Oh, look at all the statistics and the numbers,’” he added. “And then poll after poll and focus group after focus group would have people be like, ‘No, prices are high and it’s really bothering me.’ And we’d just be like, ‘That’s just the media.’ Or ‘That’s just Republicans.’ And I think the same thing happened around Joe Biden’s age. The closer you got to Joe Biden, the closer the adviser or the family member, the more I think they were not just lying to the American people, but lying to themselves.”\n\nFavreau also said that he thinks Democrats struggle with accepting and telling the truth. \n\n “I think a big problem with the Democratic Party over the last several years, decade maybe, maybe even back to the Iraq war, we have a hard time hearing hard truths and admitting hard truths to ourselves,” Favreau said. “And then we have a hard time telling hard truths to the voters.”\n\nFavreau is featured in “Original Sin” in an anecdote where he and his “Pod Save America” co-hosts Dan Pfeiffer and Jon Lovett met with Biden at the White House on April 26, 2024. The book described them as “deeply disturbed” after their discussions with Biden that night, with the authors describing the president as rambling and “incoherent.”\n\nHowever, in a Feb. 13, 2024 episode of “Pod Save America,” Favreau seemed to downplay concerns about Biden’s health.\n\n“The number one concern that people have had about Joe Biden is his age. Those concerns have predated Robert Hur, they have predated anything Trump has said … it is not just about people who see like out of context clips or that the Republicans put out, or crazy TikToks or whatever else,” he said.\n\nThis discussion with his “Pod Save America” hosts came days after Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report was released on Feb 5, 2024, looking at the former president’s handling of classified documents. \n\n “If you watch Joe Biden speak, often times he sounds frail, and he sounds more frail than he used to even in 2019 and 2020,” Favreau said. “Now that may, and I think it doesn’t have anything to do with how sharp he is mentally, but the voice sounds frail and he shuffles more because of the arthritis in his back so for most people in the country who are just watching him be president what do they see when they turn on the television? They see him shuffle and they hear him and he is swallowing a lot more of his words now – obviously he’s had a stutter but it doesn’t sound like the stutter did even in 2020 – he’s just soft-spoken and quiet.” \n\nCo-host Tommy Vietor, who worked for Obama for almost a decade, appeared to agree with Favreau’s dismissiveness. \n\n “All the commentary about the age and Biden’s memory which seemed unfair or ad hominem at worst, and then second there is a debate about Biden’s age and fitness for office that was already happening. This just kicked it up and focused the media’s attention on it in a very damaging way via this DOJ report,” Vietor said during the February 2024 episode. \n\nOn Sunday, Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis was announced, with his spokesperson telling Fox News days later that the last time he received a blood test that screens for prostate cancer was in 2014.","summary":"The hosts of \"Pod Save America\" and Jon Stewart are questioning former President Joe Biden’s mental acuity following the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s book, \"Original Sin.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/24/us-news/jon-stewart-podcast-hosts-question-bidens-health-following-original-sin/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105232535.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/22oNtWhC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-24 15:46:58","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":324500200,"title":"Biden family's narcissism 'severely f-----' the country, says liberal NYU professor","text":"NYU professor and liberal podcast host Scott Galloway criticized the Biden family this week, saying its \"narcissism\" has hurt the country.

It would have dominated the media cycle.\" Galloway added that Harris was \"not a great candidate,\" though he praised her efforts in trying to replace her boss. \"I think she did a good job given the hand she was dealt with, but this is a candidate who didn’t make it to Iowa four years earlier, which says to me America didn’t think of her as a great candidate.\" JAKE TAPPER DECLARES BIDEN WHITE HOUSE LIED ABOUT 'CHEAP FAKES' AFTER CNN PEDDLED NARRATIVE IN 2024 In 2024, Galloway recorded a video for Democrats voting from abroad. In January 2025, he posted an article on Medium with the title \"How to Survive the Next Four Years.\" The former president has been criticized by his own party in the months following the election for not dropping out of the race soon enough and leaving room for a Democratic primary. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., argued days after the election that \"had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race.\" She added, \"The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, there would be an open primary.\" Former Harris surrogate and DNC fundraiser, Lindy Li, also grilled Biden for endorsing Harris immediately after dropping out, saying the move headed off a primary. \"I actually think President Biden, you know, the whole endorsing her thirty minutes after he dropped out, I think that was a big f-you to the party,\" she said several days after Trump's victory. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Other Democratic figures have said Biden compounded this problem by demanding that Harris stay in lockstep with his presidential agenda. According to a recent book written by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, the former president \"would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win. But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: Let there be no daylight between us.\" During the podcast, Galloway added that Biden’s insistence on Harris running, and her subsequent loss will be how he’s remembered. \"I will get s--- for this because people are correctly feeling empathy for him, but his legacy, in my view, has been ruined by this,\" he said.

Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nWith House Republicans narrowly passing President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act—which is designed to blow up the national debt, cut taxes for the rich, and partially pay for that by gutting programs for the poor and working class—you’d think MAGA conservatives would be cheering. But many of them aren’t.\n\nLet’s back up.\n\nTrump defied historic voting patterns in 2024 by winning voters making under $50,000 a year, 50% to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ 48%. He tied her among voters making over $50,000, at 49%. And when the threshold was raised to $100,000, the income divide got starker: Trump won the under-$100K crowd, 51% to 47%, while Harris won the over-$100K vote, 51% to 47%.\n\nThat flipped the old partisan narrative. In general, Republicans were the party of the working class, and Democrats the party of those with more money.\n\nWhile culture-war hysteria around transgender people and immigrants drove much of Trump’s support, his promise to lower prices “on Day 1” clearly resonated with economically desperate voters. Exit polls back this up. He won 76% of those who had faced “severe hardship” from inflation in the previous year, and 52% of those who’d faced “moderate hardship.” Meanwhile, Harris dominated among those who said they’d faced “no hardship,” winning 78% of them.\n\nAs former Daily Kos reporter Kerry Eleveld once said in our old podcast, “Democrats are the party of voters who don’t have to look at prices when grocery shopping.” \n\nThat’s why we see so many variations of “this isn’t what we voted for” in all these “Leopards Ate Faces” stories. Yes, we could scream, “IT WAS ALL THERE IN PROJECT 2025!” But let’s be honest: Most voters aren’t policy wonks. For those doing price math in the grocery aisle, politics isn’t a priority. Trump’s promise may have been absurd, but it was simple and seductive.\n\nBut falling for those lies has a cost. On the economic front, Trump and the Republican Party are governing like they always have—for the ultrawealthy, connected, and powerful, at the direct expense of their own voters. As I’ve written repeatedly, it’s like Trump is trying to hurt his base.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, House Republicans voted to gut Medicaid, which disproportionately helps rural Americans. Their tax cuts for billionaires effectively raise taxes on low-income voters—i.e., their core voters in last year’s election. MarketWatch, reporting on a University of Pennsylvania analysis of a close-to-final draft of the GOP tax bill, noted: \n\n The top 0.1% of households would rake in over $390,000 in after-tax income.\n\n The top 1% would gain $44,190.\n\n Households making $51,000 to $92,999 a year would get an additional $815.\n\n The lowest-income households, though, will see their after-tax income shrink by $940.\n\nYes, that voter making under $50K, they get to deal with Trump’s price-raising tariffs and a tax hike.\n\nOn Reddit’s r/conservative subreddit, the reactions to the House passing the bill were surprisingly muted.\n\nSome echoed traditional deficit concerns, such as the commenter who noted, “Conservatives are supposed to want less government spending and less debt. This bill will add trillions of dollars of debt over the next 10 years. We're not even kind of moving in the right direction.” \n\nBut a surprising number took umbrage at the gutting of Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.\n\nOne top commenter the subreddit—i.e., not a troll—wrote, “I'm all for cutting waste fraud and abuse on Medicaid and SNAP, but … I think if the medicaid/SNAP changes go through as is, GOP will get mauled in the mid-terms.”\n\nAnother top commenter noted, “[I]t's not that I like high taxes, it's that I think high taxes on the lower, middle, and upper-middle-class are much more damaging than high taxes on the ultra-rich. It's both about keeping taxes low on most people, and about preventing the concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny number of people. It's also frustrating because Trump has repeatedly spoken out in favor of such tax hikes on the richest taxpayers as a way of making budgets and tax breaks work.” \n\nThis commenter also called the Medicaid provisions “cruel,” and on SNAP, they said, “[I]t's going to deny benefits to some people we would probably prefer have them. for example the people who are going to be hit hardest are the people who live in areas where jobs are scarce, who have difficult lives with a lot of barriers to getting anything done, and who have other life responsibilities like caring for family members or doing something else important in their community that they don't get paid for.”\n\nIf only there was a party that worked to protect such people …\n\nAll over social media, Trump voters are realizing they’re the ones being labeled as “fraud and waste.” Like this gem on Threads:\n\nAgain, we can point to Project 2025—the Heritage Foundation’s agenda for a second Trump administration—and note how it promised to gut SNAP and Medicaid. Yes, we warned them. But pointing fingers now isn’t useful.\n\nWhat is useful? Turning this betrayal into motivation.\n\nNo, we won’t win over all Trump voters. Many are too far gone. It’s a cult.\n\nBut we don’t need all of them. We don’t even need most. We just need a small shift. \n\nIn Pennsylvania, Trump won last year by 120,266 votes. In Michigan, it was 80,103. And in Wisconsin, 29,397. Altogether, that makes for just 229,766 votes in an election where 155,512,532 were cast—or just 0.15% of all ballots. That’s how small of a shift we’re talking about, though obviously, the bigger the better.\n\nI can’t recall ever seeing a party so eagerly swing a baseball bat at its own voters—many of them new to the Republican coalition.\n\nThe pain is real. And yes, most of us are impacted in some way. But if we can turn that pain into political clarity for even a slice of those voters, we can begin to reverse the damage—and take back our future.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

'I don't have prostate cancer'","text":"With Kamala Harris dragging her feet forever to announce what she is going to do next, the Democrats are now pinning their hope on former chief of staff to Barack Obama, Rahm Emanuel, to step up and fill the vacuum in the leadership. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already said that she is placing her bets on Rahm. Rahm is also not shying away from these insinuations and already said that he's preparing. “I am in training — I don’t know if I’ll make the Olympics,” he said a few weeks ago. After Joe Biden's prostate cancer detection, The Free Press caught up with Rahm and asked how he was doing. \"I don’t have prostate cancer,\" he said. On his presidential bid, he said: “Before I make a decision, I want to know that I have an answer to what I think ails our country, ails our politics, and ails the party—and they may all be the same answer.\" Emmanuel's elder brother Zeke is an oncologist and was on air discussing Biden's cancer detection. “Oh yeah. He did not develop (prostate cancer) in the last 100 days, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that,\" he said on Morning Joe. Who is Rahm Emanuel? Rahm Emanuel is an American politician and diplomat born November 29, 1959, in Chicago, Illinois. A member of the Democratic Party, he has held several high-profile positions: US Ambassador to Japan (2021–2025), appointed by President Joe Biden, where he worked on strengthening US-Japan relations. From 2011 to 2019, he remained the first Jewish mayor of Chicago. Before that, he was the White House Chief of Staff (2009–2010) under President Barack Obama, helping pass the Affordable Care Act and the 2009 stimulus package. He was the representative for Illinois’s 5th District (2003–2009), serving as Democratic Caucus Chair and leading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to a 2006 House majority. Between 1993 and 1998, he remained the senior adviser to Bill Clinton. Emanuel was raised in an Orthodox Jewish household, with his father, a pediatrician, immigrating from Israel and his mother active in the civil rights movement. He is married to Amy Rule, with three children.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-rahm-emanuel-top-dem-likely-to-run-for-white-house-in-2028-i-dont-have-prostate-cancer/articleshow/121382029.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-121382046/121382046.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 14:28:10","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":324462396,"title":"Top finance guru sends blistering reality check to Trump administration","text":"Financial guru Dave Ramsey has warned that federal lawmakers need to 'do their job' to help save Americans' money with their economic policies. \n\nMulti-millionaire Ramsey told Fox Business while at the EntreLeadership Summit in Denver, Colorado: 'Do your job and get something passed that lets us keep our money. It’s pretty simple.\n\n'It's all this political infighting, this absolute bulls**t, at the end of the day. Except for these massive things like, again, just governing. This idea that we love small business in Washington is an absolute load of horse manure.' \n\nRamsey didn't hold back on his feelings about the recent uncertain shift in the economy, especially when it comes to tariffs. \n\nThe guru, who is estimated to be worth around $200million, believes that once tariffs are 'smoothed out' and Congress does its job and passes a bill that will protect American's pockets, residents can expect a calmer environment. \n\n'What we need is a predictable environment,' he told Fox Business. \n\n'If I know this is what my cost is, then I know that this is [what] my price is. Or I know I can't make it in that country anymore, I need to make it a different country. And I've got to resource, you know, reset my resources.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it clear he wishes for more things to be made in America, including movies, which he recently placed a 100 percent tariff on for any production produced outside of the US. \n\nThe Republican has also recently announced a 'big, beautiful bill' that passed in the House. \n\nThe package also provides for $350billion to go to MAGA projects including to Trump's new 'Golden Dome' missile defense system and his mass deportation policies.\n\nTo fund the massive loss in federal revenue, Congress has decided to make deep cuts to social programs and add work requirements to Medicaid.\n\nIt is also estimated to add about $3trillion to the national deficit - which terrified some of the far-right conservative voting block. \n\nThe bill is expected to be heavily edited in the Senate, including cutting taxes on tips and overtime and auto loans, as well as, extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increasing the Child Tax Credit.\n\nRamsey isn't too sure small businesses are being protected under this new economy. \n\n'These guys in here will tell you, they spent half their lives and a lot of money just trying to keep from getting the snot beat out of them by Washington,' Ramsey told Fox Business. \n\n'It's the unpredictability that kills business in general, but it's devastating to small business,' the entrepreneur, who voted for Trump, continued. 'All I need is a predictable environment, and then I'll pivot and I'll exist.' \n\nSmall business owners' fear and hesitancy is a far cry from how they felt in December, right before Trump was gearing up for his inauguration. \n\nFollowing Donald Trump's November victory, small business owners were feeling more hopeful than they have in years, a poll showed.\n\nJob Creators Network Foundation (JCNF) regularly surveys 400 small business owners to glean how they feel about economic and policy issues in the news.\n\nThe results reveal that small business owners' feelings about the US economy had hit its highest level since July 2021.\n\nIt found that more than six in 10 small business owners were optimistic that the Trump administration would be positive for Main Street.\n\nThe survey also revealed that these owners voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by a whopping margin.\n\nThey backed Trump 51 percent to Harris' 34 percent, a giant 17-point margin, the survey found.","summary":"Multi-millionaire Dave Ramsey sent a blistering reality check to federal lawmakers, whose economic policies have been threatening everyday Americans.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14745731/dave-ramsey-finance-guru-warning-dc-lawmakers.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/24/14/98714915-0-image-m-86_1748093430527.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 13:59:25","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.11},{"id":324456434,"title":"'Everybody should be afraid': Former DOJ attorney details Trump’s 'terrifying shift'","text":"In a press release on January 31, 2025 — roughly a week and a half into Donald Trump's second presidency — attorney Stacey Young explained why she had left the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). \n\nYoung, who worked in the DOJ Civil Division and later the DOJ Civil Rights Division, declared, \"Our democracy and the rule of law depend on a robust, apolitical civil service, above all at the Department of Justice.

So we should be scared not only because DOJ is investigating and charging, prosecuting individuals who seem to be targets just for retribution, but it's also attacking individuals who the DOJ is not finding enough evidence to actually pursue.

As Jake Tapper and co-author Alex Thompson promote \"Original Sin,\" an account of the cover-up that features high-level Democratic sources, media critics have noted CNN and other mainstream outlets downplayed or were even hostile to the suggestion that Biden could be losing his grip before last year's debate against President Donald Trump. Here are four examples at CNN. NEW BOOK REVEALS BIDEN'S INNER CIRCLE WORRIED ABOUT HIS AGE YEARS BEFORE BOTCHED DEBATE PERFORMANCE CNN White House correspondent pushes White House ‘cheap fakes’ narrative Videos of Biden freezing up or appearing confused at various events went viral throughout 2024, but the White House aggressively pushed back, saying some of them were edited in a misleading fashion or didn't show what they purported. The term \"cheap fakes\" was popularized, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted from the podium that fact-checkers and mainstream outlets also embraced the term. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz pushed the White House’s narrative last year about a video of Biden appearing to freeze up at a fundraiser with Jimmy Kimmel, saying Biden had merely \"looked out at the crowd for a few seconds\" before walking offstage with President Barack Obama, adding that \"Republicans and right-leaning media outlets\" \"used this moment to say that President Biden froze.\" Moments later during a panel discussion, CNN commentator and former Kamala Harris adviser Jamal Simmons called Biden's fundraiser moment an \"obviously selected video.\" \"These are cheap fakes, [as] the White House and Biden people are calling them,\" Simmons told CNN's Erin Burnett. Tapper feels differently about them. JAKE TAPPER DECLARES BIDEN WHITE HOUSE LIED ABOUT 'CHEAP FAKES' AFTER CNN PEDDLED NARRATIVE IN 2024 \"The Biden White House falsely- when people showed that clip and asked what was going on- said it was a ‘cheap fake.’ They did this all the time when there was video that seemed to show Biden acting in an odd or unusual, seemingly out-of-it way, they would call it a ‘cheap fake.’ It was not fake. It was actual video,\" Tapper said last week. CNN cites expert expressing concern about ‘ageism’ In a story in the aftermath of the Robert Hur report where Biden was memorably described as an elderly man with a poor memory, CNN's website published an article expressing concerns about both Biden and Trump and what type of cognitive ability was normal for a person in their 80s. The article cited a professor who said Biden's issues with word recall were not necessarily indicative of someone having memory issues. Biden at times during the interview with Hur had difficulty remembering when he was vice president and the year of his son Beau's death in 2015. The article concluded with the professor saying that ageism was codified in how people talk to one another, suggesting that the skepticism about Biden was a form of prejudice against the elderly. \"Ageism is not just what people do to each other. Ageism is also a mindset that you carry within yourself,\" the professor said. \"It actually impacts your health negatively.\" JAKE TAPPER'S PAST COVERAGE OF BIDEN'S COGNITIVE DECLINE UNDER SCRUTINY AHEAD OF HIS NEW BOOK Media reporter shreds ‘bogus’ Biden narrative Ex-CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy repeatedly hammered proponents of the idea that Biden was in mental decline in his \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter before leaving CNN last year. \"For years, and particularly over the last few months, MAGA Media has portrayed Biden as a senile, mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government,\" Darcy wrote in a newsletter last June, before the then-president's disastrous debate. Darcy declared the debate would give Biden an easy chance to \"puncture the narrative\" that he lacked fitness for office, suggesting Republicans had stupidly lowered the bar so much that Biden would easily clear it and come out of the debate stronger. \"That's a worry for right-wing media figures, which risk seeing their bogus narrative about Biden being ripped up in real time,\" he wrote. Darcy also blasted the Wall Street Journal report last June about Biden's behind-the-scenes decline in his newsletter, saying it \"owes its readers — and the public — better.\" Asked for comment by Fox News Digital about his past coverage, Darcy, who left CNN last year to start his own newsletter called Status, pointed to his newsletter Wednesday where he declared conservative media outlets were taking an undeserved victory lap. BIDEN INSIDER EXPOSES HOW WHITE HOUSE 'GASLIT' THE PUBLIC ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT'S DECLINE \"For years, right-wing media pushed a warped narrative of Joe Biden as a brain-dead puppet controlled by sinister, shadowy forces. Now they’re demanding vindication—but they do not deserve it,\" he wrote. Ana Navarro stays committed to the cause Even after Biden dropped out of the race last July, \"The View\" co-host and CNN commentator Ana Navarro was committed to defending his mental acuity in office. Later that week, Manhattan Institute official Reihan Salam wondered if Biden should even stay in office until his term ended, but Navarro erupted that any talk about his state behind the scenes was mere speculation. \"No, it is speculation! It is speculation! Because actually, unlike you, I’ve actually seen the guy at 9:00 at night. I have seen him after he has had five different events in 24 hours,\" Navarro said at one point.

Although she continues to identify as a Republican, the left-wing commentator is an avid supporter of the Democratic Party, hosted the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and has referred to Biden and Harris as \"Uncle Joe\" and \"Auntie Kamala.\" CNN has stood behind Tapper's past reporting in light of his new job, pointing to examples when he aggressively covered the subject. For his part, however, Tapper has said he feels \"humility\" about his past work on Biden and praised conservative media outlets for discussing what was in plain sight. Fox News Digital's Joseph A.

He’s the smartest one in the room. I can’t keep up with him. I’m exhausted. I went to a meeting, and he was using words I didn’t even know were words! They were fantastic! I had to look them up. He’s the smartest man in the world.'\" On Tuesday, \"Original Sin,\" which looks in part at the efforts made by top Biden aides and allies to hide the truth about Biden’s mental and physical health, providing a depiction of a president who was routinely confused and disorientated during his term, was released. BIDEN INSIDER WAS REPORTEDLY 'AMAZED' AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE THEY WERE ABLE TO SPIN During his podcast Thursday, Stewart talked about how he thinks those in Biden’s circle tried to control what the public saw. \"You know, Kamala Harris comes out, ‘I sit with this man. You don’t understand,’\" Stewart said. \"You don’t see it.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, has anyone filmed that? Because you should show that.’ Because it was a very simple case to puncture. People are saying, ‘I’m a little concerned about his stamina and cognitive ability. Here’s how we can dispel that.’ Just put him out there and let him show us how f---ing smart – and they wouldn’t do it. Because they knew they couldn’t.\" Jon Favreau, former President Barack Obama’s head speechwriter from 2005-2013, said that the people closest to Biden were not honest about his decline. \"Throughout Biden’s term, you had it with the age issue, you also had it with inflation, right,\" Favreau said. \"In the Biden administration, a lot of elected Democrats were like, ‘Oh, look at all the statistics and the numbers,’\" he added. \"And then poll after poll and focus group after focus group would have people be like, ‘No, prices are high and it’s really bothering me.’ And we’d just be like, ‘That’s just the media.’ Or ‘That’s just Republicans.’ And I think the same thing happened around Joe Biden’s age. The closer you got to Joe Biden, the closer the adviser or the family member, the more I think they were not just lying to the American people, but lying to themselves.\" Favreau also said that he thinks Democrats struggle with accepting and telling the truth. \"I think a big problem with the Democratic Party over the last several years, decade maybe, maybe even back to the Iraq war, we have a hard time hearing hard truths and admitting hard truths to ourselves,\" Favreau said. \"And then we have a hard time telling hard truths to the voters.\" Favreau is featured in \"Original Sin\" in an anecdote where he and his \"Pod Save America\" co-hosts Dan Pfeiffer and Jon Lovett met with Biden at the White House on April 26, 2024. The book described them as \"deeply disturbed\" after their discussions with Biden that night, with the authors describing the president as rambling and \"incoherent.\" FLASHBACK: WHITE HOUSE PRESS SEC KARINE JEAN-PIERRE LAUGHS OFF QUESTION ON BIDEN'S HEALTH IN 2022 However, in a Feb. 13, 2024 episode of \"Pod Save America,\" Favreau seemed to downplay concerns about Biden’s health. \"The number one concern that people have had about Joe Biden is his age. Those concerns have predated Robert Hur, they have predated anything Trump has said … it is not just about people who see like out of context clips or that the Republicans put out, or crazy TikToks or whatever else,\" he said. This discussion with his \"Pod Save America\" hosts came days after Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report was released on Feb 5, 2024, looking at the former president’s handling of classified documents. \"If you watch Joe Biden speak, often times he sounds frail, and he sounds more frail than he used to even in 2019 and 2020,\" Favreau said. \"Now that may, and I think it doesn't have anything to do with how sharp he is mentally, but the voice sounds frail and he shuffles more because of the arthritis in his back so for most people in the country who are just watching him be president what do they see when they turn on the television? They see him shuffle and they hear him and he is swallowing a lot more of his words now – obviously he's had a stutter but it doesn't sound like the stutter did even in 2020 – he's just soft-spoken and quiet.\" Co-host Tommy Vietor, who worked for Obama for almost a decade, appeared to agree with Favreau’s dismissiveness. \"All the commentary about the age and Biden's memory which seemed unfair or ad hominem at worst, and then second there is a debate about Biden's age and fitness for office that was already happening. This just kicked it up and focused the media's attention on it in a very damaging way via this DOJ report,\" Vietor said during the February 2024 episode. On Sunday, Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis was announced, with his spokesperson telling Fox News days later that the last time he received a blood test that screens for prostate cancer was in 2014.

If a variable is a perfect predictor of Trump voting, it would score 1.0 on the scale. If it is a perfect non-predictor, it would score 0.\n\nSo, the most important predictor of being a Trump voter was the presence of conservatives in a state, followed by the percentage of registered Republicans, and the third was watching Fox News. A high score on all three meant greater support for Trump. \n\nTo illustrate this, 45% of Texans considered themselves conservatives, 33% were registered Republicans, and 51% watched Fox News. Using these measures, the model predicts that 57% would vote for Trump. In fact, 56% voted for him in that state in 2024. So, while the prediction was not perfect, it was very close. \n\nA similar predictive model can be used to forecast former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s vote shares by state. In her case, we need four variables to predict the results with 95% accuracy – the percentage of registered Democrats, liberals and moderates in a state, and also Fox News viewership.\n\nNot surprisingly in Harris’s case, the relationship between Fox News viewing and voting is strongly negative (correlation = -0.64). When viewership was high, the Harris vote was low.\n\nYears ago, the “fairness doctrine” used to mandate US broadcasters to fairly reflect different viewpoints on controversial issues in their coverage. Candidates for public office were entitled to equal air time. \n\nBut this rule was removed by the FCC in 1987, and has led to an era of some broadcasters becoming far more partisan. The FCC decision followed a period of debate and challenges to the fairness doctrine. This led to its abolition under Ronald Reagan, the Republican president who inspired Project 2025 – the document that in turn appears to be inspiring the Trump government’s policy agenda. \n\nWhen the Trump era is over, incumbent Democrats are going to have to repair US institutions that this administration has damaged. If they want to do something about the polarisation of US politics, they may also need to restore the fairness doctrine. \n\nHad it not been removed in the first place, it is possible that Harris would have won the 2024 presidential election, since Fox News would not exist in its present form.

Health care costs can be confusing, especially when you’re trying to figure out what Medicare actually pays for, and what comes out of your pocket.\n\nLet’s walk through it in plain English so you know what to expect in 2025.\n\nWhat Medicare Actually Covers in 2025\n\nHere’s the good news: Medicare does cover some home health care services—but only under very specific conditions. You need to meet certain requirements, and the type of care has to fall within strict guidelines.\n\nHere’s when Medicare will pay:\n\nA doctor must confirm that you need skilled care—like nursing, physical therapy, or speech therapy.\n\nYou need to be classified as “homebound.” That means leaving the house is difficult and typically requires help.\n\nThe care has to come from a Medicare-approved home health agency.\n\nServices Medicare will cover:\n\nSkilled nursing (like wound care or administering medication)\n\nPhysical, speech, and occupational therapy\n\nMedical social work support\n\nA home health aide (only if it’s tied to skilled care)\n\nCertain medical supplies like bandages or catheters\n\nWhat’s not covered:\n\nAround-the-clock home care\n\nPersonal help like bathing or dressing (unless it’s part of the skilled care)\n\nHousekeeping, laundry, or cooking\n\nOngoing non-medical support\n\nSo if someone mostly needs help with everyday activities or companionship—but not medical care—Medicare won’t step in.\n\nHow Much You’ll Actually Pay (Even With Medicare)\n\nLet’s talk about costs—because even with Medicare, there are still a few things to budget for.\n\nMedicare Part A (Hospital Insurance)Most people don’t pay a premium for Part A (as long as you or your spouse worked and paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years). Part A is typically involved when home care follows a hospital stay.\n\nMedicare Part B (Medical Insurance)This is where most of your home health care coverage comes from.\n\nIn 2025, here’s what Part B looks like:\n\nMonthly premium: $185\n\nAnnual deductible: $257\n\nCoinsurance: You pay 20% of the cost of any durable medical equipment (like walkers or wheelchairs)\n\nHere’s a bit of a relief: for qualifying home health services, Medicare usually covers the full cost—there’s no coinsurance or copay for the services themselves. That said, you’re still on the hook for other costs if you need more than what Medicare offers.\n\nIf You Need More Than What Medicare Covers\n\nWhen someone needs long-term care at home—especially help with everyday tasks like bathing, dressing, cooking, or even just companionship—that’s where out-of-pocket costs come in. These are services Medicare simply doesn’t cover.\n\nHere’s what private-pay in-home care looks like in 2025:\n\nAverage hourly rates:\n\nNon-medical companion care: $20 to $30/hour\n\nPersonal care assistants (help with hygiene and mobility): $25 to $40/hour\n\nSkilled nursing care (from a licensed nurse): $40 to $75/hour\n\nMonthly ballpark estimates:\n\nPart-time care (40 hours/week): $4,000 to $6,400 per month\n\nFull-time 24/7 care: $15,000 to $22,000 per month\n\nCosts vary a lot depending on where you live and how intensive the care is. Care in a rural town may be more affordable than in a large city.\n\nA New Policy Proposal to Keep an Eye On\n\nIn late 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a proposal aimed at expanding Medicare to include more home-based care services.\n\nHere’s what’s in the proposal:\n\nHelp seniors stay at home instead of moving to a facility\n\nOffer support for families who are struggling with caregiving\n\nAddress the issue where people have to spend down their life savings to qualify for Medicaid long-term care\n\nThe plan is estimated to cost around $40 billion a year, with the funding potentially coming from expanded prescription drug price negotiations. While nothing is finalized yet, it could signal a big shift in how home care is supported in the future.\n\nA Quick Look at Industry Momentum\n\nThis isn’t just a personal issue—it’s a growing business sector. Big healthcare companies are investing heavily in at-home care solutions.\n\nFor instance, UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest Medicare Advantage insurers, was trading around $295 per share in May 2025. This kind of investment tells us that home-based care is becoming a central focus of the healthcare industry.\n\nHere’s the takeaway: if you qualify under Medicare’s rules, you’ll get some support for skilled care at home. But if you or your loved one needs ongoing help with everyday tasks, you’ll likely need to cover those costs yourself.\n\nTo prepare, you might want to:\n\nLook into Medicare Advantage plans—they often offer more generous home care benefits than traditional Medicare.\n\nExplore long-term care insurance options (if you’re still eligible).\n\nTalk to a local aging services agency or a social worker to see what state or community programs may be available.\n\nAnd if you’re trying to figure out what options are available in your area—whether that’s Jaipur or anywhere else—I’d be happy to help you search.","summary":"If you&#8217;re exploring home health care—maybe for yourself, a parent, or someone you care about—it’s natural to feel overwhelmed.

He also said he would appear at an event on May 30 in Pittsburgh. .About 85,000 people now work in US steel mills, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics..“US Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,” the company said in a statement..“The partnership between Nippon Steel and US Steel is a game changer – for US Steel and all of its stakeholders, including the American steel industry, and the broader American manufacturing base,” the Japanese company said in its own statement..Both used “bold” to describe Trump. .While the White House declined to provide further details, Japanese media including Nikkei and Kyodo News reported that a buyout had been approved, citing US sources they didn’t identify. .The unexpected announcement via social media came shortly after the White House confirmed Trump had received a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which reviewed the proposed takeover..Trump had repeatedly said there must be an investment, not an outright ownership as was originally agreed by the two companies in 2023. In January, then-President Joe Biden blocked the deal, citing national security concerns. .Advocates for a merger argued Nippon Steel would revitalize the once-struggling American company through significant repairs to aging assets, investment to boost capacity and technology sharing. .However, the deal faced opposition from the influential United Steelworkers union, which operates US Steel’s integrated mills across the American Rust Belt. .“We cannot speculate about the impact of today’s announcement without more information,” USW President David McCall said in a statement on Friday night. “Our concern remains that Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs.”.Trump, Biden and the 2024 Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris all opposed the deal and insisted that the company remain in American hands..US Steel shares in New York ended the day up 21% at $52.01. The company in December 2023 agreed to sell itself to Nippon Steel for $55 per share in an all-cash deal. .The stunning reversal comes as the US and Japan are also engaged in trade negotiations over Trump’s wider series of tariffs. .Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington as part of a third round of tariff talks. That followed a telephone call between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, in which they agreed to an in-person meeting in Canada next month at a Group of Seven leaders’ summit. .Akazawa on Friday declined to comment on the steel issue, deferring until an official announcement is released. As for the tariff talks, he said negotiators were mindful of the June meeting between the leaders, but added it was unwise to rush any agreement..Japan faces a 25% US levy on cars, steel and aluminum, as well a 10% duty on all goods that’s set to jump to 24% in early July after a 90-day pause lapses if no trade deal is reached. .Japanese carmakers including Toyota Motor Corp. have already reported expected profit losses in the billions of dollars because of the tariffs. Given that his economy already contracted last quarter, Ishiba faces the possibility of Japan tipping into a recession if the trade pressures don’t abate..Akazawa will continue shuttling between capitals into next week, as he’s expected to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a key player at the previous two rounds of tariff talks, in Washington, also on May 30. .Trump’s blessing could bring about a new era for the US steelmaker, which once held the title of the world’s largest company. But Nippon Steel will have to justify to its shareholders why it would keep the aging, less-efficient and higher-cost integrated assets running. .The USW’s McCall has repeatedly said investments in the mills would make them the most efficient plants in the world, and that they would remain competitive for decades to come. He has remained unconvinced, however, of Nippon Steel’s promises since US Steel announced the sale..“Their ‘promise’ is always made with exceptions to back out of the statements,” McCall said earlier this week in a text message. “Nothing makes me think this one is anything but another desperate attempt.”","summary":"Trump Backs US Steel, Nippon Partnership After National Security Review","url":"https://gulfnews.com/business/economy/trump-backs-us-steel-nippon-partnership-following-cfius-review-1.500138523","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2025-05-23/6w051ne5/_1x_1.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 07:52:21","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"ae","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":324360614,"title":"Jon Stewart makes horrifying dark prediction about the end of Trump","text":"Jon Stewart has predicted Donald Trump will burn 'our f***ing country down for the insurance money' by the end of his presidency.\n\nThe comedian, 62, has spent much of his time lately punching left, taking on CNN for hiding Joe Biden's decline and saying Democrats needed to get over 'the stink' of covering for the former president.\n\nBut he returned to his typical form of trashing the right during an appearance on Bill Simmons' podcast this week.\n\nThe comedian claimed networks - including CBS and ABC - had chosen to 'pay tribute to the king' when the president came after them legally.\n\nWith Simmons comparing it to the Corelone family of The Godfather movies, Stewart had an even darker prediction.\n\n'What you're seeing now is, 'All must pay tribute to the king.'

But even if she were to forgo running for president, the field could still be packed.\n\nWhile the report that Emanuel is gearing up for a presidential bid was met with backlash, there are few Democrats who know more about getting things done in the White House.\n\nThe 65-year-old served as Obama’s chief of staff from January 2009 until October 2010, helping the administration navigate the great recession and passage of the Affordable Care Act. \n\nBefore that, he served three terms in the House. From the Obama administration he went on serve two terms as mayor of Chicago. \n\nBut his tenure there could come back to haunt him in a Democratic presidential primary after he clashed with the powerful Chicago teachers union that went on strike during his first term.\n\nHe also faced harsh criticism for how he handled the killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police officer in 2014.\n\nEmanuel first said he would but then opted not to run for a third term as mayor in 2019 amid low approval ratings. \n\nPresident Biden nominated him to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Japan where he served until just before the start of the Trump administration in January.\n\nNow, he’s back stateside and has been spotted all over the place with a speech before the Economic Club of Chicago, appearances on CNN and writing columns for the Washington Post.\n\nBut in discussing his plans with Politico, Emanuel remained coy. \n\n‘I’ve only been back two months, I have no idea what I’m doing,’ he told Martin.\n\n‘I’m not done with public service and I’m hoping public service is not done with me,’ he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNancy Pelosi believes former Chicago mayor and White House Chief of Staff&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nancy Pelosi Shares Who She Believes Will Be the Leading Democrat Candidate in 2028 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/nancy-pelosi-shares-who-she-believes-will-be-the-leading-democrat-candidate-in-2028/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nancy-Pelosi-reveals-the-top-Democrat-she-thinks-will-run.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 04:21:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":324327630,"title":"‘The Fourth Estate must succeed’: Clooney’s timely warning from history about Trump’s authoritarian America","text":"Heady days in New York City, with the Knicks basketball team enjoying their best summer in a quarter of a century and George Clooney chief among the true-blue celebrities to be seen in midtown Manhattan. \n\nSince March, Clooney has been a fixture in and around the Winter Garden theatre, where he has brought his enduring winsomeness and a garish black dye-job to the role of Edward R Murrow, the 1950s CBS anchor who was, in that fractious decade, regarded as the most trusted man in America.\n\nThe conceit of the play Good Night, and Good Luck concerns Murrow’s courageous stand against the bullying “Red Scare” senator Joseph McCarthy despite mounting pressure from his network to just play ball. \n\nClooney, who has never hidden his fascination with journalism, was filmed outlining the theme of the play at a meeting with fellow cast members in a segment that appeared on 60 Minutes before the March opening night.\n\n“When the other three estates fail – when the judiciary, the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the Fourth Estate has to succeed,” he said.\n\n“Has to succeed,” he repeated, offering a knowing point to the camera, “as 60 Minutes is here now on our first day.”\n\nBut can it?\n\nOn Monday, Wendy McMahon, the chief executive officer of CBS News, announced her resignation after four years, citing her disenchantment with the network’s position in relation to a lawsuit issued against it by Donald Trump. \n\nThe legal action concerns the US president’s accusation that 60 Minutes, the flagship CBS current affairs show for six decades, edited a Kamala Harris interview to reflect favourably on her during the presidential election. \n\nGiven the daily grotesquerie on display during the election rallies and interviews throughout last years, a complaint over editing standards seems almost quaint. \n\nBut it represents the battle for control over the independence of US media for which the Clooney play provides a (staggeringly expensively ticketed) parallel. The Trump legal complaint states the editing was election interference and is demanding an astonishing $20 billion in compensation.\n\nIn a resignation letter to her staff, McMahon spoke of the privilege of the role. “Championing and supporting the journalism produced by the most amazing stations and bureaus in the world, celebrating the successes of our shows and our brands, elevating our stories and our people ... It has been a privilege and joy,” she wrote.\n\n“At the same time, the past few months have been challenging. It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.”\n\nThe past few months have been overshadowed by the pressure from Paramount, the CBS parent company, to settle the Trump lawsuit even though CBS is adamant that it is without merit. Several legal experts have expressed the view that the network would win the case should it go to court. \n\nBut Paramount is eager to complete an $8 billion merger with Skydance, for which it will require approval from the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission. Several Democratic senators have written to Paramount to express concern that it may be involved in “improper conduct”.\n\nMcMahon’s departure follows the resignation of Bill Owens, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, who resigned in April after issuing a memo to staff stating that “over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it”.\n\nLast December ABC News settled a lawsuit with Trump, then US president-elect, for $15 million. By then, the Washington Post was in the midst of a series of high-profile resignations after its owner, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, spiked the paper’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris. \n\nAmong the recent slew of executive orders issued by the US president was a further blow to NPR and PBS, ordering the directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease funding, or “cancel to the maximum extent” as “neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events”.\n\nThe attack is just an extension of Trump’s long, slow war on mainstream media, which he both relentlessly pillories and yet of whose praise he remains curiously needy. Whenever a so-called “fake news media” publication or network offers positive comment on Trump, it will quickly be highlighted in the White House press briefings.\n\nBut as the Clooney play, hailing Murrow’s lionhearted stance, enters its closing weeks, the US media is facing into many long, dark winters as it covers the 47th president’s second term in office.\n\nIn his later years, Murrow resigned from CBS and accepted a role as the head of the US Information Agency, the parent company of Voice of America, the long-standing international news network which delivers news to countries with restricted press freedoms.\n\nOn Thursday, an appeals court declined to intervene in the executive order issued by Trump which will see 600 Voice of America contracts cancelled, and its broadcasts in effect silenced.","summary":"Clear parallels between play about 1950s McCarthyism and how US president is waging war on US news media today","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2025/05/24/the-fourth-estate-must-succeed-clooneys-timely-warning-from-history-about-trumps-authoritarian-america/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/FFQ7VVILNFWYVMU3C7VPCNNLMI.jpg?auth=86c3b9953da25788f1c59d45e20c7f555d9eb5ab6f39555ae13fff64b2f479dc&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 04:00:00","author":"Keith Duggan","authors":["Keith Duggan"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.285},{"id":324311172,"title":"Freedom of the Press Foundation says it will sue Paramount if it settles with Trump over 60 Minutes lawsuit","text":"The Freedom of the Press Foundation says it intends to sue Paramount if the production company settles with Donald Trump over his 60 Minutes lawsuit.\n\nThe non-profit organization said that corporations that own news outlets “should not be in the business” of settling “baseless lawsuits that clearly violate the First Amendment and put other media outlets at risk.”\n\nTrump sued the parent company of CBS News over a primetime election special that aired in October, shortly before the 2024 presidential election. It featured interviews with presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz.\n\nThe president accused the broadcaster of “unlawful and illegal behavior” in the way it had edited the interview with Harris. Trump and vice president JD Vance had declined to participate in the program.\n\nInterviews are always edited to fit into a program’s time limits, as well as for “teaser clips” to promote an upcoming program. CBS has denied Trump’s claim that any part of Harris’ interview was “deceitfully” edited.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Paramount Global boss Shari Redstone, FPF Director of Advocacy Seth Stern compared a settlement of the “meritless” lawsuit to a bribe, saying it “may well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system.”\n\nNot only would it “tank CBS’s reputation but, as three U.S. senators recently explained, it could put Paramount executives at risk of breaking the law,” he wrote.\n\n“Our mission as a press freedom organization is to defend the rights of journalists and the public, not the financial interests of corporate higher-ups who turn their backs on them.

And we hope other Paramount shareholders will join us.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted Paramount Global for comment on the letter from FPF.\n\nThe lawsuit threat from the press organization comes after Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and eight Democratic senators wrote their own letter to Redstone earlier this month, in which they urged her not to cave to the president’s $20 billion demand.\n\nSanders and the other senators wrote that Trump’s complaint was a “blatant attempt to intimidate the media and those who speak out against him.” The letter was signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Peter Welch, Chris Murphy, Ed Markey, Richard Blumenthal, Dick Durbin and Jeff Merkley.\n\nRedstone, who has now recused herself from the board’s discussion on the case, has long pushed for a settlement in hopes that it will convince the Trump administration to approve Paramount’s merger with Skydance.\n\nJohn Cusack, an FPF founding board member, activist and actor, added: “I’m proud that Freedom of the Press Foundation is doing what CBS’s corporate owners won’t — standing up for press freedom and against authoritarian shakedowns.” \n\nHe added: “People who aren’t willing to defend the First Amendment should not be in the news business.”\n\nThe executive producer of 60 Minutes, Bill Owens, last month quit his job over “lack of journalistic independence” amid the Trump feud.\n\n“Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience,” Owens told a shocked staff in a memo.","summary":"FPF said corporations that own news outlets ‘should not be in the busines”s of settling “baseless lawsuits that clearly violate the First Amendment and put other media outlets at risk’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fpf-paramount-lawsuit-trump-60-minutes-b2757059.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/19/19/60_MINUTES-TRUMP_97018.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 03:46:37","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.446},{"id":324307442,"title":"4 partners leave Paul Weiss after firm cut deal with Trump","text":"Four partners at Paul Weiss — including the high-profile Democratic attorney Karen Dunn — are departing the law firm, a spokesperson told CBS News, after Paul Weiss drew attention for striking a deal with President Trump to avoid targeting by the federal government.In addition to Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jessica Phillips and Jeannie Rhee are leaving the 150-year-old firm.\"On behalf of the firm, Paul Weiss is grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions.

Isaacson and Phillips served as litigators at the firm, according to their bios on Paul Weiss's website.CBS News has reached out to the four departing attorneys for comment.Earlier this year, Mr. Trump targeted Paul Weiss with an executive order that sharply limited how the firm could interact with the government, seeking to revoke staff members' security clearances and cut off any federal contracts. The move was part of a wider gambit to punish the president's foes in the legal community, which he claims have \"played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\"The president's executive order criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked on the team of Manhattan prosecutors that investigated Mr. Trump. It also took aim at the firm — and Rhee — for taking on a pro bono case involving the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and criticized Paul Weiss' diversity, equity and inclusion policies.But that order was later rescinded by Mr. Trump, who said Paul Weiss had agreed to a litany of compromises, like auditing its hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on causes that both the firm and the Trump administration agree upon.The apparent deal between the president and Paul Weiss — along with similar deals struck by other law firms threatened by Mr. Trump — proved controversial in the legal community.Some other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional. Judges have struck down Mr. Trump's orders against the firms Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block — with one federal judge on Friday saying Mr. Trump's Jenner & Block order was unconstitutional and resembled a \"screed\" at some points.","summary":"A group of high-profile attorneys have left Paul Weiss.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/four-partners-leave-paul-weiss-after-deal-with-trump/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/24/493417b6-2a1b-43cb-aa18-5d5367dcc5c8/thumbnail/1200x630/046b4e338c62abfa06d2d0d11b374bec/gettyimages-2170990246.jpg?v=48f078ae8a74a1412614b0db6f935e48","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3732425_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-05-24 02:35:10","author":"Joe Walsh","authors":["Joe Walsh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.003},{"id":324291164,"title":"EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Heartache for Queen superstar Roger Taylor as his daughter and her husband call it quits","text":"Queen drummer Roger Taylor has been happily married to Sarina Potgieter for 15 years, but his daughter Rory has been less lucky in love.\n\nI hear that Rory, a doctor, has separated from her husband, Rory Hoddell, who arranges luxurious ski holidays for rich clients.\n\nThe couple were married in 2021 in a lavish wedding attended by Roger's band mates.\n\n'It's terribly sad,' one of their friends tells me.

As part of the arrangement, the firm agreed to scrap its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, as well as provide $40 million worth of pro bono services to support Trump's agenda.Trump subsequently rescinded his executive order. In the wake of the settlement, Paul Weiss faced a firestorm of criticism and the head of the firm's pro bono arm, Steven Banks, resigned.More than 170 alumni of the firm also signed an open letter to the firm's chairman, Brad Karp, calling the decision to settle \"cowardly\" and adding that \"the very independence of lawyers and the legal profession is at stake.\"In total, the nine major law firms that settled with the Trump administration have agreed to provide about $1 billion in legal work, according to Bloomberg.What People Are SayingDunn, Rhee, Isaacson and Phillips said in an email to the firm on Friday both Bloomberg and The Times reported: \"We were disappointed not to be able to tell each of you personally and individually the news that we have decided to leave Paul, Weiss to start a new law firm.\"Brad Karp, the chairman of the firm, told The Times in a statement: \"We are grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions to the firm.

While discussing the CNN host’s recent interview with SiriusXM’s Megyn Kelly on “The Victor Davis Hanson Show,” co-host Sami Winc asked Hanson for his thoughts on Tapper’s new pushback against Biden.\n\n“But did he ever really say, ‘I’m sorry?'” Hanson asked. “I mean, he might have called Laura Trump up, but did he ever say to an audience, ‘What I told you was untrue? It was clear to me that he was mentally challenged, cognitively in decline. I attacked people who said that. I am sorry to all of you. That was unprofessional.'”\n\n“I don’t expect him to do the proper thing and resign because he misled the country with catastrophic effects,” Hanson added. “If you think of the border and Afghanistan and the autopen part, all the terrible things that Biden did. I shouldn’t say Biden did, somebody did in his name. So he didn’t do that. He did say he felt humiliated.”\n\nPrior to Biden entering the Democrats’ presidential primary in 2020, Republicans raised concerns over his mental fitness.\n\nCall-outs of Biden stumbling and struggling to speak at times were later pushed by the GOP after he won the 2020 election, but Democrats and media pundits quickly brushed off the concerns. (RELATED: Jake Tapper Tells Megyn Kelly Two Shocking Words He Sent His Team During Biden’s Debate Meltdown)\n\nIn 2020, Tapper interviewed President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, and accused her of “mocking” Biden’s “stutter,” telling her she had “no standing to diagnose somebody’s cognitive decline.”\n\nDuring his interview with Kelly on Tuesday, Tapper said he has since apologized to Lara Trump, stating he called her “months ago.”\n\n“But here’s my point. Why has he said anything about that he was fooled or he was mistaken? The answer is pretty clear. It’s for two reasons. One, Joe Biden is out of power. More importantly, he hasn’t been president since June of 2024. He has no power to either punished or reward Jake Tapper,” Hanson continued.\n\n“What I mean is if you flip that over in the converse, if Joe Biden was president right now, would he have said that?” Hanson asked. “No. If Joe Biden had stepped down and Kamala Harris was the candidate right now, would he have said that? No. So he was lying when he knew he was lying. So then the question is, why did he say it now? The answer is that he has a book out.”\n\nDuring Biden’s time as president and throughout his 2024 campaign, Tapper, among other media personalities, had defended the former president. Notably, during Biden’s disastrous debate against Trump, Tapper, who was one of the moderators, appeared to quickly bail out Biden after he froze mid-sentence during one of his arguments.\n\nHanson went on to speculate that Tapper’s publisher suggested the CNN host say he was “mistaken” about his coverage of Biden to “handle the incoming flack.”\n\n“So my question is the same as Russian collusion, laptop disinformation, 51 intelligence authorities, thousands of files that were classified at Mar-a-Lago. Do they ever apologize? No. Did they ever learn from their lies? No. They just go on to the next. So why would I believe that when he was lying then, he’s telling the truth now? I don’t believe that,” Hanson said.\n\n“So he, Tapper, just kind of married himself to this other guy’s book project and now he’s going to make millions of dollars after deceiving the American people and he doesn’t seem to be upset about it,” Hanson added. “I’d like to just ask him some questions. Jake, would you just please tell us, since you wrote the book and I haven’t read it and I’m not going to buy it, who was the person who conducted the auto-pin pardons?”\n\nIn addition to the uptick of media spotlight on Biden’s mental decline, the former president’s office revealed Sunday that Biden had been diagnosed with a “more aggressive form” of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone.\n\nDoctors and cancer experts have since told the Daily Caller that, due to the state of the cancer, Biden likely had it during his time as president.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), in one of her accustomed racialist rants, recently went after her party’s big Democratic donors, who raised a record amount of money for Kamala Harris’ short-lived campaign.\n\nCrockett played the race card when claiming that Democratic insiders were already backing the next party nominee as the “safest white boy.”\n\nHer racist irritation is puzzling. After all, two out of the last four Democratic presidential nominees have been African Americans.\n\nYet it is certainly easy to see why Crockett, who endlessly spouts off about race in congressional sessions, used the pejorative “white boy.”\n\nShe knows that there are no repercussions given her race and, to a lesser extent, her gender and left-wing ideology.\n\nRecently, a past 2018 slur resurfaced from another House Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). \n\nShe had falsely claimed, “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths in this country.”\n\nOmar’s stereotyped smear was not only racist but also factually incorrect.\n\nThe FBI’s 2018 data on perpetrators of murder, when the race of the offender was known, reveals that 54.9% of the nation’s murderers that year were African American, who constitute about 13% of the population.\n\nAnd when the race of the murderer in rare interracial killings was known, blacks were more than twice as likely to murder whites as whites were to kill blacks.\n\nDuring recent controversies over leaks at the Pentagon, former UN Ambassador Susan Rice injected race by smearing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nShe leveled a trifecta race/gender/sexual orientation slur — all irrelevant to the issue at hand: “Well, if you’re a white male Christian cisgender macho MAGA man, you can be as dumb as a rock and be deemed qualified to serve as Secretary of Defense.”\n\nIn all these cases, there was no fallout from racial categorization and demonization.\n\nAgain, we apparently accept the pernicious idea that those identifying as an oppressed group cannot themselves voice illiberal stereotypes.\n\nBut while our political elites and celebrities seem fixated on using racial putdowns for career advantage and personal notoriety, the people increasingly ignore their entrenched and off-putting racism.\n\nFor example, in a recent Rasmussen poll surveying public attitudes toward Trump’s first 100 days in office, 62% of Hispanics voiced approval (higher than the 49% of whites) — and 39% of blacks agreed.\n\nOne result of the 2024 campaign was that while Democrats seemed fixated on racial stereotypes, the public had moved on. \n\nVoters increasingly see class considerations transcending race.\n\nThat fact may explain why exasperated and flailing Democrats and leftists desperately seek to resurrect racial polarization instead of finding a popular middle-class agenda.\n\nHistorically, tribalism erodes a multiracial democracy.\n\nIt did when white leaders in the past expressed racist attitudes toward blacks — and it will again if black elites simply flip the paradigm and do the same.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.","summary":"Human nature is universal — but our political elites and celebrities seem fixated on using racial putdowns for career advantage and personal notoriety.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/23/opinion/angel-reese-and-the-privilege-of-anti-white-bigotry/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/chicago-sky-forward-angel-reese-105153885-e1748040003818.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 23:33:44","author":"Victor Davis Hanson","authors":["Victor Davis Hanson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":324269270,"title":"Hey, Bruce: The Democrats long ago abandoned the American workers of your lyrics — like roadkill","text":"Bruce Springsteen hates Donald Trump.

Imagine having so many electrifying hits and so many fans of so many political stripes — and opting to play bombs from your Trump Derangement Syndrome catalog. \n\nWhy perform “Jungleland” for the adoring masses when you can play the soliloquy “Orange Man Bad” for yourself?\n\nAnd then, voila, on Wednesday he went and dropped an actual TDS EP, “Land of Hopes and Dreams.” It features four live songs plus his Manchester Trump condemnation.\n\nHow stunningly brave to lob missiles at the president from England, a country literally jailing people over social media posts. But never mind all that.\n\nAs WFAN producer Al Dukes — a self-described “huge fan” of Springsteen — noted on X, the singer wouldn’t dare get up on stage in the United States and take precious minutes from a performance with an anti-Trump rant, because he’d get booed back to the swamps of Jersey.\n\nSpringsteen has long been a slobbering sycophant for anyone with the letter D next to their name. After sucking up to Obama for years, he threw his support behind the incompetent Kamala Harris and was on the roster of clueless celebrities who performed or spoke at her rallies.\n\nBut he doesn’t usually do political messaging on stage for paying customers, which is a sound policy.\n\nIt’s also one that’s kept me, a righty who has always had to separate the artists from the art, coming back. Born and raised near the Jersey Shore — Springsteen’s primordial soup — I was only 7 when I first saw him live. Since then, I’ve given The Boss more money than I want to admit. There’s been many concerts, albums and concert albums.\n\nWhile living lavishly on his tony Colts Neck spread, the iconic singer is still known for popping into local bars and working out at crappy chain gyms.\n\nYet he’s clearly not speaking with real people on those field trips.\n\nHis party policed speech, glorified identity politics and let scores of criminals into the country. Voters have rejected the elitism he truly champions under his blue-collar costume. \n\nEnough with the A-listers preaching to us little people from their private jets and mansions, they said.\n\nPerhaps Springsteen is too busy texting Obama, but he’s failed to notice that even his beloved Garden State has increasingly become red.\n\nHarris beat Trump by only 5 points — a whopping 10-point drop from Biden’s victory in 2020.\n\nThe Democrats long ago abandoned the American workers of Springsteen lyrics like road kill, and still view them as vile, stinky creatures, not valuable constituents.\n\nYet The Boss is still carrying water for the party that has subverted democracy for the last three presidential elections — a party that propped up a decaying old man so a shadow administration could govern.\n\nAnd he wants to lecture the side that said No to all that? \n\nSpare me all the peace, love and inclusion. \n\nA guy who never did a lick of labor but built his entire career on the lore of the grizzled working man, Springsteen remains stunningly out of touch with the temperature of the country.\n\nHe claims to be for the common man, but he’s hopelessly partisan. Just ask poor old sad superfan Chris Christie, who begged for his idol’s love for years but was always rebuffed — and skewered — by Springsteen because of party affiliation.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump — a man not blessed with the gift of restraint — of course took the bait.\n\nThe president unloaded on X, writing, “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States. Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.”\n\nThen he shared a video of himself swinging a club and the ball appearing to hit Springsteen on the back and knock him over.\n\nIt was unpresidential … but also funny. And, unintentionally, a nod to how ridiculous this bonfire of the boomer egos truly is.\n\nNext time, Bruce, spare us the lecture.

Meanwhile, current President Donald Trump is so flagrantly and consistently incoherent that the only way for his administration to deal with it is to ensure no transcripts of his rambling remarks are available. \n\nThis latest probe is technically more of a reopening. House Republicans investigated Biden’s alleged cognitive decline last year, but thanks to Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper making the rounds with their book about how Biden getting old is the biggest threat to American democracy, they’ve got an excuse to do it again. And of course, after Biden announced his prostate cancer diagnosis, the door was wide open for Rep. James Comer to continue his unhealthy vendetta against the Biden family.\n\nNot that Comer really needs an excuse. The fever swamp that is his brain likely means that pretty much any time anyone even mentions the Biden name, he spins up the House Oversight Committee to “investigate” something, anything. After Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, Comer ran to Newsmax to say that meant it was time to open another investigation into Hunter’s laptop. That was after he spent 15 months fruitlessly trying to invent some corruption for which Biden could be impeached. \n\nThe one-two punch of Tapper’s media blitz and Biden’s cancer diagnosis must have been a dream come true for Comer, who dashed off letters to Biden’s doctors and former aides. He wants Biden’s doctor to prove that his “financial relationship with the Biden family” didn’t affect his assessment of Biden’s fitness to serve, while also basically saying that the doctor helped cover up Biden’s decline from the public. Inquiries to former aides are so that Comer can “understand who made key decisions and exercised the powers of the executive branch during the Biden Administration,” with the implication there being, of course, that it was not Joe Biden. \n\nHilariously, Comer is pretending that one of the reasons Biden’s physician has to share the former president’s private medical information is that the Oversight Committee needs that to “explore whether the time has come for Congress to revisit potential legislation to address the oversight of presidents’ fitness to serve pursuant to its authority under Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.” \n\nComer has no actual interest in fitness to serve. This is just him building on Trump’s 2024 campaign rhetoric saying the 25th Amendment should be “modified” to allow for the removal of a vice president because Kamala Harris was part of a conspiracy to cover up Biden’s decline. Any real query into the capacity of a president to do his job would have to grapple with not just Trump’s inability to do the job but also his obvious handoff of vast chunks of decision-making.\n\nTrump routinely makes things up out of thin air, but that’s always been the case. That makes it difficult to tell whether he’s lost the plot or is just lying. When he showed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pictures from the Democratic Republic of Congo and insisted they were instead evidence of white genocide in South Africa, it’s just as likely that Trump knew the truth but didn’t care as it is that he genuinely didn’t have any idea what he was looking at. \n\nRelated | Trump's racist ambush of South African president gets even more bonkers\n\nBut even if you set aside all the times in which Trump blatantly lies in service of a political point, you’ve still got all the other times where it seems like he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He told the press he didn’t sign the Alien Enemies Act proclamation that paved the way for the mass deportation of Venezuelan migrants, despite his signature appearing on it. \n\nAnd he routinely admits he doesn’t know about major decisions. Earlier this month, The Washington Post compiled the most recent ones. He said he didn’t know his nominee for surgeon general, but had listened to a recommendation from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He said he hadn’t been briefed on U.S. soldiers killed in Lithuania. He wasn’t aware the administration was considering deporting people to Libya. He’s not the person responsible for the failure to bring Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia home from a Salvadoran prison, because, “We have lawyers that don’t want to do this.”\n\nIt’s a cliche to say that every accusation is a confession, but that’s pretty much what happens every time Republicans open their mouths.","summary":"Because they are absolute ghouls, House Republicans are opening an investigation into former President Joe Biden’s health, including demanding that his doctor testify about Biden’s private medical information.

In an interview on \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" Stewart slammed President Donald Trump’s pending lawsuit against CBS News and its parent company Paramount, saying it’s merely a way to get major corporations to grovel before the president's agenda. \"But what you’re seeing now is, all must pay tribute to the king,\" he said, elsewhere accusing other U.S. corporate leaders of paying Trump \"protection money\" to survive. SANDERS, WARREN WARN PARAMOUNT THAT SETTLING TRUMP LAWSUIT COULD BE ILLEGAL BRIBERY ACT Trump sued CBS News and Paramount – also Comedy Central’s parent company – for $10 billion in October over allegations of election interference involving the \"60 Minutes\" interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired weeks before the presidential election (the amount has since jumped to $20 billion). Both Trump and Paramount have entered mediation, which could conclude at any time. Stewart brought up the topic during the interview, saying that he’s comfortable hosting \"The Daily Show\" on Monday nights up \"until, you know, the company is bought out by people that don’t want anything to do with ‘The Daily Show.'\" \"And then who the f--- knows what’s going to happen.

The nonprofit is able to seek damages because it owns shares of Paramount. It plans to act on behalf of itself and other shareholders, alleging that the settlement would amount to the company’s executives “breaching their fiduciary duties and wasting corporate assets by engaging in conduct that US senators and others believe could amount to unlawful bribery that falls outside the scope of the business judgment rule.” The White House and Paramount did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nLast October, President Trump sued Paramount subsidiaries CBS Broadcasting and CBS Interactive, alleging that an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on longstanding CBS News program 60 Minutes was deceptively edited, in a manner that constituted election interference. Initially seeking $10 billion in damages, Trump amended the lawsuit in February to ask for $20 billion. Paramount Global has a market cap of roughly $8.5 billion.\nAlthough Paramount previously called the lawsuit “an affront to the First Amendment” in legal filings to dismiss this March, it has reportedly sought to settle; the company has a potentially lucrative merger pending with Hollywood studio Skydance that would require the Trump administration’s signoff.\nLast week, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone seeking information about any potential settlement, raising concerns that it would amount to bribery. “If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials,” they wrote, “they may be breaking the law.”\nTalks of a potential settlement had roiled CBS for months. Longtime 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens abruptly resigned in April, and CBS News president and CEO Wendy McMahon resigned earlier this month. “It’s become clear the company and I do not agree on a path forward,” she wrote in a memo to staff at the time.\nTrump’s lawsuit against Paramount isn’t an isolated attack on the media. He sued ABC News, owned by the Walt Disney Company, for defamation in March 2024 over comments from anchor George Stephanopoulos portraying the president as “liable for rape.” (A federal jury found President Trump liable for sexual assault in a 2023 civil case, but not rape.) The company settled the case in December. In late April, Trump posted comments on his social platform Truth Social that appeared to threaten The New York Times with the possibility of legal action in the future.\nThe type of lawsuit the Freedom of the Press Foundation plans to file, known as a shareholder derivative lawsuit, allows people and organizations who own shares of a publicly traded company to recover damages when executives harm the company. This is the same type of legal action that Tesla shareholders took to successfully fight CEO Elon Musk’s hefty $56 million compensation package, which Musk is now appealing. (Tesla also changed its corporate bylaws this month to make it harder for investors to pursue this type of lawsuit.)\nBest known for its free speech advocacy for media organizations, the Freedom of the Press Foundation sees this action—which is unlike any legal challenge it’s mounted before—as an extension of that mission, even though it targets a media organization.\nIf the Freedom of the Press Foundation does seek legal action and successfully sues Paramount over a proposed settlement, the damages would go to Paramount rather than the nonprofit itself. “You don't expect, as advocates for press freedom, to have to file lawsuits against executives of media publishers,” says Stern. “We're a press freedom organization trying to recover money for a media outlet from rogue executives.”","summary":"As Paramount considers settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview, the Freedom of the Press Foundation warns that it will sue over a deal that allegedly “could amount to a bribe.”","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/freedom-of-the-press-foundation-paramount-trump-settlement/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/6830d8de47797e411f30e857/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Paramount-Trump-Freedom-of-Press-Warning-Business-2164620757-1243412669.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 22:07:45","author":"Kate Knibbs","authors":["Kate Knibbs"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":324295802,"title":"Book: Kamala cursed out Anderson Cooper to colleagues after post-debate interview","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris had some nasty things to say about CNN anchor Anderson Cooper after their 2024 interview, according to a new book.\n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson’s new book, “Original Sin,” claimed that the former vice president called Cooper a “motherf—–” to her colleagues last summer following a tense interview the two had over former President Biden’s debate with then-GOP candidate Donald Trump.\n\n“This motherf—– doesn’t treat me like the damn vice president of the United States, she said to colleagues,” the excerpt read.","summary":"Said CNN anchor 'doesn't treat me like the damn vice president of the United States'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/05/book-kamala-cursed-out-anderson-cooper-to-colleagues-after-post-debate-interview/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anderson-cooper-cnn-news-anchors-media-reporters-joe-biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 21:57:12","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":324275050,"title":"Trump to 2.9M of his voters: Bleep off, suckers","text":"In the presidential election, Donald Trump won North Carolina’s 16 electoral votes thanks to 2,898,423 voters who pulled the lever for him — with many believing that he would deliver billions of dollars of federal aid to help them recover from devastating Tropical Storm Helene.\n\nOn Friday, he told them — and the 2.7 million voters who chose Democrat Kamala Harris and millions more residents — to fend for themselves: His administration denied another of the state’s request for tens of millions of dollars in needed aid.\n\nMore than 100 people died as Helene tore through western North Carolina in September, destroying homes, businesses and roadways. The storm’s record-breaking devastation totaled $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Recovery has been slow in parts of the region as some hard-hit mountain towns still appear ravaged by the storm nearly eight months later.\n\nIn the days immediately after the storm and before the election, Trump regularly criticized efforts by the Biden administration to help the state, and he often lied about the number of FEMA agents already on the ground and whether they were playing politics.\n\nTrump claimed without evidence that the Biden administration and North Carolina’s Democratic governor were “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.” And Trump adviser Stephen Miller said President Joe Biden “failed to evacuate or rescue” U.S. citizens, “just like you failed in Afghanistan.”\n\nThat led many voters to believe that Trump would bail them out. Instead, Trump has turned his back on them, with DOGE recommending the dissolution of FEMA.\n\nThe agency’s acting chief, David Richardson, announced plans to shift disaster recovery responsibilities to states for the upcoming hurricane season.\n\nGov. Mark Stein has called on the federal government to reform the agency but not to get rid of it, which he reiterated during his budget proposal announcement Monday.\n\nIn a letter to state officials, Richardson wrote that the state’s request for the federal government to pay for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days under major disaster ... is not warranted.”\n\nLast fall, Biden approved major disaster declarations for Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina, allowing survivors to access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery immediately. FEMA and other federal agencies, along with private businesses and nonprofit and faith-based organizations, responded to the disaster in at least seven states, from Florida to Virginia.\n\nBiden approved more than $930 million for North Carolina’s Helene relief in 2024, which included $450 million for individual assistance (housing and other needs), $380 million for public assistance, and $100 million for emergency road and bridge repairs. \n\nThe Trump administration recently denied extending 100% federal cost sharing, shoving more costs on to the state.\n\nBiden warned that Project 2025 would dismantle FEMA and the national weather services that warned residents of approaching storms. Trump disavowed any knowledge of Project 2025, but his administration is using as the playbook to destroy the federal government as the courts intervene.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Today, Trump is just 1.6 points underwater, with his disapproval down to 49.3% and his approval up to 47.7%. That’s a pretty big shift in a few weeks. Something is happening.\n\nIt’s not possible to pinpoint precisely what is behind the move. But it appears that even as criticism of Trump from the usual suspects becomes more shrill, the president’s supporters are sticking with him, joining a substantial number of the independents and former Biden voters who voted for Trump last November. \n\nA new focus group of Wisconsin swing voters conducted for Axios — all the participants voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024 — reported they are “mostly standing by Trump despite reservations.” Yes, there were plenty of reservations. “The speed and scale of Trump’s tariffs aren’t sitting well even with some who agree with the idea of tariffs,” Axios reported. “Some said they don’t like Trump’s treatment of neighboring ally Canada, his incivility and bullying, or his ambiguity about whether he’ll abide by court rulings.”\n\nThat is entirely consistent with the kinds of feelings some voters expressed about Trump in the first term. But the story goes on to say that the focus group’s reservations “are mostly outweighed by their faith that Trump’s moves will eventually boost jobs, pay, and fairness for American workers — even if it means paying more now. They also blame Biden and other politicians more than Trump for the current situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Axios reports that none of them, not one of 12 people in the group, “said they would pick Kamala Harris if they could get a do-over.”\n\nYou can speculate about the reasons why Trump’s approval is on the rise. For example, there’s no doubt that some voters worried by Trump’s initial tariff threats are now a bit relieved that he has moderated some of those positions. \n\nAnother possible explanation is that there has been a lot of attention lately on the terrible scandal of the Biden administration — the long effort by White House aides to conceal the extent of Biden’s mental and physical infirmities. It didn’t work, of course, because everyone could see the problem with his or her own eyes. But now we’re learning how top Biden officials tried to fool the public. And we’re learning more about just how bad a shape Biden was in and the great risk that posed to the nation. In any event, all the bad news about Biden is, by definition, good news for Trump.\n\nBut in the end, it might be easier just to say that the polls show what is not working in the eternal battle over Trump. Lawfare isn’t working, as far as polls are concerned. Hysterical claims — Trump crashed the economy! — aren’t working, as far as polls are concerned. Wild predictions, such as that Trump will destroy democracy, aren’t working, as far as polls are concerned. Americans have heard that kind of stuff about Trump for years now, and a significant portion of them just aren’t listening anymore.","summary":"WHY IS TRUMP APPROVAL RISING? President Donald Trump&#8216;s job disapproval rating first exceeded his approval rating on March 13.

A Supreme Court opinion yesterday gave Donald Trump a big win by allowing him to fire members of the so-called independent regulatory agencies. (At least, they used to be independent.)\n\nThe majority ruled that the president could remove these officials for now, with arguments to come later. The opinion is not conservative in any meaningful sense. It essentially overturns 90 years of precedent, and it does so using the Court’s “shadow docket,” which means an unsigned opinion delivered typically without oral arguments. Although couched in mild terms as a stay on lower-court rulings, this ruling—if it holds—will signal a radical shift that heralds a new era of big government.\n\nThese agencies—such as the Federal Communications Commission and the National Labor Relations Board—have a hybrid structure established by law. The president appoints members, and the Senate confirms them; they make their own decisions and are not directed by the White House. For the authors of Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s administration, they are a major problem. “What we’re trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them,” Russell Vought, the head of the Office of Management and Budget and an intellectual architect of Project 2025, told The New York Times in 2023. (I lay this out in detail in my recent book about Project 2025.)\n\nIn allowing the firings of members of these agencies, the right-wing majority would invalidate Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, a 1935 Supreme Court ruling. At the time, Roosevelt was looking to seize power for the executive branch, and American conservatives were horrified. The Democrat had found that William Humphrey, a staunch small-government member of the Federal Trade Commission, was an impediment to his agenda, and fired him. Humphrey sued and ultimately triumphed—posthumously—with a 9–0 Supreme Court ruling agreeing that Roosevelt could not remove him.\n\nThe right has long resisted centralization of power in the presidency and viewed Roosevelt as a boogeyman. But the MAGA right has embraced his approach, if not his policies. Congress very clearly did not intend for these agencies to be under presidential control, but Vought and his circle believe that the structure is unconstitutional. “There are no independent agencies. Congress may have viewed them as such—SEC or the FCC, CFPB, the whole alphabet soup—but that is not something that the Constitution understands,” Vought told Tucker Carlson in November. A major goal of Project 2025 is to get the Supreme Court to overturn Humphrey’s, and now that goal is in sight.\n\nThe reasoning of yesterday’s opinion is sometimes bizarre. The Trump administration argues that because these agencies function to execute the law, they ought to be under the control of the executive—that is, the president. The majority wrote that it believes that the administration is likely to prove that the agencies do indeed “exercise considerable executive power.” Having accepted that argument, it concludes that “the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.”\n\nIn other words, the majority argues that even though the existing system has been in place for 90 years, it is too dangerous to leave in place for a short time longer and must be set aside—even if the Court ultimately changes its mind and reinstates the members after oral arguments. This is not conservative: It neither takes a cautious approach toward change nor conforms to stare decisis, the idea that courts should defer to precedent. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in dissent, “Our emergency docket, while fit for some things, should not be used to overrule or revise existing law.”\n\nThe majority also excludes the Federal Reserve from its ruling, protecting Fed Chair Jerome Powell from Trump’s ire. This is probably a good thing for the nation’s economy, but as Kagan notes, the reasoning is flimsy. The carve-out simply reinforces the idea that the right-wing majority is functioning as politicians in robes, willing to assist Trump but wary of the economic impact of a Powell defenestration.\n\nIf the ruling stands, the Supreme Court will have decreed a big shift of power from Congress to the White House. The opinion came the same day that the Government Accounting Office concluded that the administration is violating the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 by withholding funds appropriated by Congress for an electric-vehicle-charger program. This case may be coming to 1 First Street NE soon enough: Trump and Vought also want to get the Court to declare the ICA unconstitutional.\n\nThese changes may sound dry and academic, but giving new powers to the president will have direct and serious effects on the way Americans live their lives. We can already glimpse what post-Humphrey’s America might look like, because agency leaders appointed by Trump are already proceeding not as independent actors but as surrogates for the White House.\n\nAt the Federal Communications Commission, Chairman Brendan Carr (a Project 2025 author) has used his power to threaten the broadcast license of outlets that are critical of Trump and to bully CBS News over an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. And just this week, the Federal Trade Commission reportedly sent the liberal watchdog group Media Matters a letter aligning with a lawsuit from Elon Musk’s X over a report it published about anti-Semitism on X. (Media Matters has denied wrongdoing.) If a Democratic administration took the same action against a similar conservative group, the shouts of “censorship” from the right would be deafening.\n\nWith the Supreme Court appearing ready to grant the president this new control, the only obstacle to growing authoritarian power is for Congress to defend its prerogatives—to write laws and create structures for agencies that function without White House interference. The current Congress doesn’t offer much reason for optimism.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\n“All They Want Is America.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson’s new book, \"Original Sin,\" claimed that the former vice president called Cooper a \"motherf-----\" to her colleagues last summer following a tense interview the two had over former President Biden’s debate with then-GOP candidate Donald Trump. \"This motherf----- doesn’t treat me like the damn vice president of the United States, she said to colleagues,\" the excerpt read. JAKE TAPPER'S BOOK IS 'A SLAP IN THE FACE' TO ANYONE WHO QUESTIONED BIDEN’S FITNESS FOR OFFICE, LINDY LI SAYS Harris allegedly added, \"I thought we were better than that.\" The account from Tapper and Thompson’s book provided details about Harris’ mood following the June interview where he grilled her over her boss’ dismal performance in his debate with Trump. During the conversation, Cooper did not hold back, telling her there were Democratic lawmakers who lamented Biden’s performance. \"One said it was a disaster and another called it a trainwreck. Those are Democrats especially worried that Biden did not punch back on Trump‘s lies,\" he said. MEDIA FIGURES SHOCKED AT BIDEN'S ‘BAD’ DEBATE PERFORMANCE: ‘TOTAL AND COMPLETE DISASTER’ She responded, \"People can debate on style points, but ultimately, this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance.\" The anchor cut her off with another question, asking, \"You debated against then-Vice President Biden four years ago, and he was a very different person on the stage four years ago when you debated him. That‘s certainly true, is it not?\" She dismissed Cooper’s insinuation that Biden’s mental decline was on display for the world to see at the debate, responding, \"I got the point that you're making about a one-and-a-half hour debate tonight,\" Harris said. \"I‘m talking about three-and-a-half years of performance in work that has been historic.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Harris appeared visibly frustrated with Cooper’s line of questioning. When asked if the man on the debate stage was the same person she’d been working with in the White House, she snapped, \"I‘m not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I‘ve been watching the last three-and-a-half years of performance.\" Tapper and Thompson’s book appeared to corroborate Harris’ anger towards Cooper that night. They wrote, \"After the interview, Harris was visibly angry with Cooper. He had been asking the questions the nation had been wondering, but she took it personally.\" Reps for Harris did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital for comment.

However, months later, CBS completed an internal probe into his conduct and determined he should be fired with cause, which they claimed nullified his salary and stock options, his lawyer, Larry Hutcher, confirmed to the Beast.\n\nDunn’s contract did not permit CBS to change the designation of his firing from “without cause” to “with cause,” Hutcher told the New York Post, which first reported on the arbitration panel’s decision. \n\nInstead, he said CBS should have kept Dunn as an employee until its internal investigation was completed, but, since it did not, Dunn was entitled to be paid until his contract expired.\n\nAn arbitration panel agreed with Dunn earlier this month, Hutcher said. The panel ordered CBS to pay $7 million in salary plus interest, for a total of $9.78 million. \n\nHutcher told the Beast he is “very pleased” with the decision, which will now move on to the Supreme Court for confirmation. He said CBS told him it does not intend to contest the panel’s decision in front of the high court, meaning Dunn may receive his back pay in a matter of weeks. \n\n“This was never about just money,” Hutcher said. “His reputation was destroyed, and this was about restoring that.”\n\nA CBS spokesperson told the Post that the network “strongly” disagrees with the panel’s decision. CBS did not respond to the Daily Beast’s request for comment.\n\n“Four years ago, we removed Peter Dunn as head of the CBS Television Stations for reasons that have been well documented and reported publicly,” the spokesperson told the Post. “This decision was not based on the substance of the allegations against Mr. Dunn.”\n\nHutcher claimed to the Post that his client’s firing was to appease a “woke mob.”\n\n“This was never about Peter’s conduct—it was to appease the woke mob,” he told the paper. “It was like the Red Scare, and it was very shortsighted and unfair.”\n\nCBS has been rocked with leadership shakeups and high-profile departures as the network tries to broker a truce with President Donald Trump, who remains peeved by a 60 Minutes report that he alleges was deceptively edited to help his Democratic challenger Kamala Harris last year. CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, is still in negotiations with Trump to settle a $20 billion lawsuit regarding the interview.\n\nCBS News and Stations CEO Wendy McMahon left the network earlier this week and alluded to the network’s wrangling with the Trump administration as the reason.\n\n“It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward,” she wrote to staff in a memo obtained by the Daily Beast. “It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.”","summary":"Andy Kropa/Invision/APAn arbitration panel has determined that CBS must pay a former executive almost $10 million in back pay and interest following his 2021 firing, his lawyer told the Daily Beast.\n\nPeter Dunn was ousted as president of CBS Television Stations after a Los Angeles Times report accused him of making “racist, sexist, homophobic, and discriminatory comments,” which included him allegedly referring to a news anchor as “too gay.” \n\nDunn was fired without cause and initially continued to be paid.
