Not too far from Pontiac, Fox News Digital spoke with voters in the heart of downtown Detroit, the seat of deep-blue Wayne County that went heavily for Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020 and 2024. Jayla, a graphic design intern currently in college, said that her life was better under Biden, who won Michigan narrowly in 2020 en route to ousting Trump from the White House. DR. OZ TOUTS INVESTMENT IN MEDICAID: 'I'M TRYING TO SAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL PROGRAM' \"Biden, especially with being a Type 1 Diabetic. I think his medical plans have kind of served me for better, whereas on the other side, I've kind of been actually going through it as a college student,\" Jayla said. \"Of course, Trump!\" Ronald, a native of Detroit suburb Livonia, told Fox News Digital. \"Just take a look at the economy. I don't want to go into the rest because you don't want to be canceled,\" Ronald said. \"I would say Biden,\" said Joseph, a Detroit native and quality management professional. \"Although people like to bring up the fact that things are so inflated, it also is due to the nature where we are currently as a society.\" Mary, an educator, was accompanying Joseph while walking through downtown Detroit. She said that her life was better under Biden because her student loans were forgiven. \"I had like six figures of student loans. So that definitely was a big help for me financially,\" Mary said. TRUMP TO UNVEIL NEW MAHA INITIATIVES AT 'MAKE HEALTH TECH GREAT AGAIN' WHITE HOUSE EVENT Josie, a Detroit native and social worker, raised concerns about Trump's changes to Medicaid through The One Big Beautiful Bill Act he signed into law last month. \"Biden, with the cuts that are happening to Medicaid and all of that stuff, it's making my work hard. It's impacting our community negatively, and a lot of people are going to need increased resources and all that, and we're having trouble finding even anybody, any social workers to do a job because there's no money,\" Josie said. PJ, a clothing maker, said that his life was better under Biden. \"Biden by far. I'm not a fan of either of them. I have to go with Biden,\" PJ said. \"A lot of these politicians, they don't really care about us, so it's kind of like, it's the same thing under different people,\" he added. Trump improved significantly on his showing in Wayne County in 2024 from four years earlier, as he captured Michigan and won the presidency over Harris. While he still lost the county by nearly 29 points, it was a far better showing than the 38-point defeat he took there in 2020, and he was able to more than make up the ground needed in the rest of the state.

However, those margins remain slim, making next year's midterms vital for both parties as they vie for control during one of the most tense and fraught political periods in recent memory.Democrats will look to secure Congress and reverse some of the policies the president has enacted upon taking office, while Republicans are keen to retain power and extend those policy wins for Trump and the GOP alike.Why It MattersRepublicans currently have 53 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate and 219 of the 538 seats in the House of Representatives, where four seats remain vacant at this time.Historically, the first midterm for a president sees his party lose seats, which Trump witnessed during his first term.As Trump is a non-consecutive two term president, it will prove difficult to know if he can expect similar drops next year. However, he has taken no chances and is looking to secure any advantage he can, which includes Texas and other Republican-controlled states redistricting ahead of the midterms.Meanwhile, California has retaliated against Texas by proposing to redistrict its congressional map in a similar measure.What To KnowGrassroots campaigns like the 2018 election that saw Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, secure her seat and the 2025 Democratic mayoral primary that saw longshot candidate Zohran Mamdani upset establishment favorite Andrew Cuomo, a former governor of New York, the question remains how valuable fundraising will be as a metric in future elections.Former Vice President Kamala Harris outspent Trump by millions of dollars in last year's presidential election and still lost.However, political analysts have long relied on fundraising as an indication of enthusiasm for each party and the level of reach and voter penetration candidates have achieved.Democrats saw huge fundraising margins ahead of the 2018 and 2022 midterms, both of which proved successful for the party as they first took power back from Republicans in the first Trump term and then held off a much-prophesized \"Red Wave\" during the Biden administration to keep margins slim for the Republican majority.At the top level, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is struggling to build a war chest in the face of Republican dominance, according to Politico, with the DNC raising around $15 million by the end of June as compared to the Republican National Committee (RNC) with $80 million.Politico found that major Democratic donors have held back from donating in the aftermath of Trump's dominant win, and have failed to generate enthusiasm among small-dollar donors, leading to the lowest funding level for the DNC at any point in the last five years.Who Is Leading Fundraising in the Senate?Once again the Democrats are seeing an advantage in fundraising, according to FEC data. The Democratic Senate candidates have collectively raised $159.7 million compared to Republican Senate candidates, who have raised $131.9 million.Those numbers in isolation only tell a part of the story. The top 10 Senate candidates by fundraising are evenly split between both parties, with the significant bulk of fundraising directed towards Senators Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Cory Booker of New Jersey.Ossoff lost a special election for Georgia's 6th Congressional district in 2020 but went on to win a Senate seat later that year. Georgia's near-toss up nature in the most recent elections has made it a vital state for both parties, with Ossoff raising just under $42 million, which comprises around 25 percent of the total money raised by Senate Democrats.Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina leads Republican fundraising with $17.3 million—significantly more than the second-highest fundraiser, Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who has raised $11.3 million.Joshua Joseph Weil, a Democratic candidate from Florida, had to withdraw from the race due to medical concerns, but he had outraised all Republicans aside from Graham.For Democrats, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, who announced a Senate bid for this coming term, round out their numbers in the top 10.For Republicans, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Senator John Cornyn of Texas round out their numbers in the top 10. Cornyn, who has the least money raised in the top 10, has raised just over $8 million.Who Is Leading Fundraising in the House of Representatives?Fundraising in the House is much closer, with Democrats still in the lead but by half of the advantage their Senate colleagues have. Democrats lead fundraising with just over $219.5 million compared to Republicans, who have raised just under $210 million.The House Democrats also have a little more share of the top 10 fundraisers overall, with Ocasio-Cortez leading the charge with $15.4 million raised, outstripping Representative Ro Khanna of California and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, with over double their individual efforts, which have each totaled a little over $6 million.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana tops the Republican fundraisers with just under $8.7 million raised, again almost double the next-most raised, which is by Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who has raised just under $4.7 million.Other notable members of the top 10 include Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat, with just over $3.8 million, and Representative Young Kim, a California Republican, who has raised the least in the top 10 with just under $3.3 million.","summary":"The Republicans hold slim majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, and the RNC has outraised the DNC after Trump's commanding win.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/midterms-fundraising-politicians-rake-cash-elections-democrats-republicans-2118259","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708549/washington-dc-capitol-fundraising-republicans-democrats.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=8143fa892fa11cea2c5c5c55a4437870","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 20:51:44","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":353673606,"title":"Fresh off Texas Senate’s approval, new congressional map is target of lawsuit","text":"Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nHours after the Texas Senate approved a new congressional map early Saturday morning that more heavily favors Republicans — legislation Gov. Greg Abbott plans to “swiftly” sign into law — a lawsuit against the governor was filed, alleging that the redrawn districts are racially discriminatory.\n\nThe 67-page complaint against Abbott and Secretary of State Jane Nelson supplements legal action filed by LULAC in 2021 challenging the state’s original maps and argues that redrawing districts mid-decade is unconstitutional.\n\nRedistricting usually happens at the start of the decade after U.S. census data comes out. The complaint argues that because the new map was drawn based on the same data used for the initial map passed by the Legislature in 2021, the measure was a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.\n\n“Even if racial and partisan considerations are an unavoidable part of redistricting, there is no need for legislatures to take those considerations into account a second time in a single decade,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe complaint, which is expected to be followed by others targeting House Bill 4, was filed by two law firms on behalf of 13 Texas residents collectively called “the Gonzales plaintiffs.” The bulk of their argument is that the new congressional map “dismantles majority-minority districts” by prioritizing Republican representation in Congress.\n\nAbbott’s office has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nOn the Senate floor Friday, Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford who carried HB 4 in the upper chamber, said the plan “meets the critically important goals of legality, of political performance for Republicans and of improved compactness,” and that he did not consider racial population data while crafting it.\n\nRepublicans pushed for the new map with their eyes set on gaining five more seats in Congress after pressure from President Donald Trump, who wants to preserve the GOP’s slim U.S. House majority in the 2026 midterms. But the complaint says that effort came at the cost of Latino and Black communities, which have largely supported Democratic candidates.\n\nThe new lines squeeze more Democratic voters in Houston and Dallas into districts the minority party already controls — a strategy known as “packing.” The Republican-backed map also “cracks” left-leaning communities by splitting voters who supported Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024 into Republican districts, according to an analysis by The Texas Tribune.\n\nThe complaint was filed by two law firms, The Law Office of Max Raena Hicks and the Elias Law Group, the firm of prominent Democratic attorney Marc Elias. They also allege that the new maps violate the Voting Rights Act for not creating enough Latino-majority districts to match the growth of Texas’ Latino population.\n\nFor example, the complaint points to Harris County, where the new map carves out only one district that’s majority Latino, although the county is nearly half Latino, according to the latest U.S. census.\n\nThe census also confirmed that Latinos make up the largest share of Texas’ population, and that Texans of color made up 95% of the state’s population growth in the last decade — but that’s not reflected in the new congressional map, the complaint alleges.\n\nWith the new district lines, the lawsuit charges, lawmakers are “intentionally destroying majority-minority districts and replacing them with majority-Anglo districts.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have waged a lively battle to fend off the GOP’s proposed map since Abbott announced that the first special session in July would include redistricting. House Democrats fled the state halfway through the first session, breaking the lower chamber’s quorum and halting all operations. But the members returned to Austin at the start of the second session.\n\nAnd on Friday, state Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, signaled her intention to filibuster the map well into Saturday. Republicans, however, ended the debate on HB 4, killing her effort. Lawmakers also listened to hours of hearings from Texans across the state who pleaded with them to leave their districts alone.\n\nThe complaint and others that are sure to follow are a sign that Democrats and civil rights groups will continue to fight the implementation of the maps ahead of the 2026 election.\n\nThe National Redistricting Foundation, which brought LULAC’s initial lawsuit, is also directing this new case.\n\n“Texas’s existing map already dilutes the voting power of communities of color,” Marina Jenkins, the foundation’s executive director, said in a news release.\n\n“In spite of that, the state has doubled down with an even more extreme racial gerrymander that goes even further to pack and crack communities of color and minimize the number of congressional districts where minority voters have the ability to elect candidates of their choice,” she later said. “The court has already agreed to consider expediting this case, and we are confident that justice will be delivered for Texans.”\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15!

(This is sometimes called “ballot harvesting” by opponents of the practice and it is currently illegal in about half of states.)\n\n56% oppose removing people from registration lists if they haven’t voted recently or responded to efforts to confirm their registration and address.\n\nAutomatic voter registration, same-day registration, early voting and voting by mail\n\nIn addition to making in-person early voting available for two weeks and mail-in voting available to any registered voter who wants it, about six-in-ten Americans favor automatic voter registration for eligible citizens (59%) and same-day voter registration (58%).\n\nAs has long been the case, there is more support for each of these proposals among Democrats than Republicans.\n\n77% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans support automatic voter registration.\n\nSimilarly, 72% of Democrats and 43% of Republicans favor allowing registration at the polls on Election Day.\n\nThe partisan gap over in-person early voting is narrower, and support has grown among Republicans since last year. Today, majorities in both parties (89% of Democrats, 71% of Republicans) favor at least two weeks of early, in-person voting.\n\nIn contrast, there is a wide gap of 51 percentage points in partisans’ support for mail-in voting. And this gap is substantially wider than it was five years ago – the result of a steep drop in support among Republicans.\n\nIn April 2020, during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, 70% of Americans favored allowing any voter who wanted to cast a ballot via mail to do so. This included nearly half of Republicans (49%) and nearly nine-in-ten Democrats (87%).\n\nNow, 58% of Americans support allowing voters to cast ballots by mail, including 32% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats.\n\nVoting by mail is more widespread today than it was before the pandemic, though the share of voters who cast their ballots in person in 2024 was greater than the share who did so in the pandemic election of 2020. According to Pew Research Center’s study of validated voters, voters in the 2024 presidential election were roughly equally likely to have voted in person on Election Day (34%), early in person (32%) or by mail (34%).\n\nTrump voters were more likely to vote in person on Election Day (38% of his voters did so) than voters who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris (29%).\n\nVoting by mail and state election rules\n\nWhile support for no-excuse absentee voting is strongly associated with party, both Republicans and Democrats living in states where mail-in voting is more common are more likely to support the practice than those living in states where absentee and mail-in voting is more restricted.\n\nIn states with universal mail-in voting – like California, Colorado and Nevada, where ballots are mailed to all voters before the election – 73% favor allowing any voter to vote by mail, including 91% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans.\n\nIn states where voters can request an absentee ballot for any reason, but ballots aren’t automatically sent to them – like Florida, New York and Pennsylvania – 58% favor allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail.\n\nSupport for mail-in voting is lowest in states where voters can only cast a mail ballot if they have a valid excuse. (For example, in Texas, excuses include being 65 years of age or older, illness or disability, or a legitimate reason for being out of one’s home county on Election Day.) In these states, 45% favor allowing anyone to vote by mail, including 22% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats.\n\nOther proposals: Voter ID, paper backups, removing inactive voters and ballot collections\n\nBroad bipartisan majorities continue to support requiring electronic voting machines to print a paper backup of the ballot: 84% of all U.S. adults favor this, including 87% of Republicans and 82% of Democrats.\n\nSupport for photo ID requirements also remains widespread in both parties. More than nine-in-ten Republicans (95%) and about seven-in-ten Democrats (71%) favor requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification to vote.\n\nRemoving inactive voters, ballot collections\n\nTwo other proposals are supported by fewer than half of Americans, both of them winning more support from Republicans than Democrats:\n\n45% of Americans – including 55% of Republicans and 37% of Democrats – favor banning mass ballot collections, sometimes called “ballot harvesting.”\n\n43% favor purging the voter rolls of those who have not recently voted or confirmed their registration. Some 63% of Republicans and 24% of Democrats support this.\n\nElection Day holiday\n\nRoughly three-quarters of Americans (74%) – including nearly identical shares of both Republicans (74%) and Democrats (76%) – favor making Election Day a national holiday.\n\nWhile majorities have favored this proposal for the last several years, support is now 9 points higher than it was in 2018, largely the result of a growing share of Republicans who back an Election Day holiday.\n\nAllowing convicted felons to vote after completing their sentences\n\nOverall, 66% of Americans favor allowing convicted felons to vote after serving their sentences. While majorities in both parties hold this view, support is higher among Democrats (77%) than Republicans (56%).\n\nViews of voting policies among racial and ethnic groups\n\nAt least seven-in-ten adults across racial and ethnic groups favor requiring paper ballot backups for electronic voting machines, photo identification requirements and early, in-person voting periods of at least two weeks.\n\nClear majorities across groups also back making Election Day a national holiday and allowing convicted felons to vote after serving their sentences. Support for allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences is higher among Black adults (76%) compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Still, at least six-in-ten White, Hispanic and Asian Americans also favor this proposal.\n\nAt least half of Hispanic, Black, Asian and White adults support automatically registering all citizens to vote, allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to and allowing people to register to vote on Election Day. But support for same-day registration at the polls and allowing any voter to vote by mail is higher among Hispanic, Black and Asian Americans than among White Americans.","summary":"Most Americans Back Expanded Early Voting, Voting by Mail, Voter ID - Pew Research Center","url":"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/08/22/majority-of-americans-continue-to-back-expanded-early-voting-voting-by-mail-voter-id/","image":"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/PP_25.08.22_voting_featured.jpg?w=1200&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 19:02:28","author":"Reem Nadeem","authors":["Reem Nadeem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":353655600,"title":"Gavin Newsom is the likely Democratic presidential nominee","text":"It will all probably work. The Democratic Party in recent months has shown that it has learned nothing from its failed 2024 platform. Democrats have decided that their tanking popularity is simply proof that they don’t “fight” enough, which is why every mediocre presidential wannabe from Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) to Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is trying to portray themselves as a fighter. Newsom’s Trump impersonation is his way of filling that same lane.\n\nUnlike those two, Newsom is a serious Democratic contender. A new Echelon Insights poll puts Democratic support for Newsom at 13%, second only behind Harris’s 26%. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is the only other candidate in striking distance, polling 11%. Of the three, Newsom is the only one who avoids the stink of Biden’s presidency and the health cover-up that defined it.\n\nHarris’s support is a bit of a mirage, as she is coasting on the name recognition of being the previous Democratic nominee. The best data point for this comes from a recent POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab poll, which shows Newsom leading Harris among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents 25%-19%. The voters most familiar with these two California politicians are ready to dump Harris and back Newsom in 2028. At the same time, Harris is off in the political wilderness after her loss, while Newsom will leave office at the start of 2027 and be able to roll right into his presidential campaign.\n\nNewsom also scratches all the progressive itches of the Democratic base, wielding a powerful Democratic primary resume that other candidates can’t match. As governor of California, Newsom has been at the forefront of some of the most extreme gun control proposals in the country, including his push in 2023 to enshrine gun control in the U.S. Constitution through a constitutional amendment. Newsom will boast about his high taxes on the rich, his push toward green energy, and every other left-wing priority that Democratic voters want and that California has imposed.\n\nPritzker’s progressive credentials in Illinois pale compared to Newsom’s in California, and no other Democratic candidate will attack Newsom for California’s failures, as California is the Democratic fever dream model for the country. Newsom has also made himself the face of Democratic gerrymandering, framing it to voters as part of that same “we must fight” narrative that Democrats want. Combined with Harris already having a presidential loss on her record, it is hard to see where any other Democratic candidates would have an advantage over Newsom in an open primary.\n\nWhat does that mean for the general election?\n\nDemocrats won’t hit Newsom for California’s failures (at least not effectively), but that will be different in a general election. California’s issues are well-documented: failing energy policy causing the state to rely on the “dirty” energy it hastily tried to eliminate, including Newsom trying to save oil refineries so gas prices don’t soar higher right before his presidential run. California has the highest gas prices in the country, one of the highest tax burdens, and some of the worst-performing schools.\n\nNewsom boasts about California’s gross domestic product, which ranks fourth in the world behind the U.S. as a whole, China, and Germany. Yet, California also has the highest poverty rate in the country. Newsom supports gun control for law-abiding Americans but wants soft penalties for career criminals.\n\nHowever, what Newsom lacks in policy success is that he makes up for it in media sycophancy and Hollywood connections. Liberal establishment media have been infatuated with Newsom for years, and you can already count on the fact that they are preparing their “J.D. Vance or Ron DeSantis is worse than Donald Trump” stories for 2028. Newsom focused his governorship on pandering to celebrities, granting special carveouts for Hollywood during his COVID-19 crackdown on businesses and promising tax breaks for Hollywood studios. The enthusiasm among those Democratic groups, and among Democratic voters, will be at a fever pitch after another four years of Trump.\n\nAs a political talent, Newsom, while unimpressive, will also be the best that Democrats have offered in over a decade. Newsom will not be as repulsive to voters as Hillary Clinton was. Unlike Joe Biden, Newsom can speak in complete sentences without a script in front of him. Newsom has both of those advantages over Kamala Harris. He is no Barack Obama, but he doesn’t have to be, especially with the Democratic Party’s built-in institutional advantages in media and entertainment.\n\nThe most notable issue Democrats face is that the party’s brand itself is toxic. The New York Times detailed the party’s voter registration “crisis,” with Democrats losing 2.1 million registered voters between 2020 and 2024 while Republicans gained 2.4 million. A Wall Street Journal poll found that 63% of voters view the Democratic Party as out of touch. The poll also has the Democratic Party at -30 net favorability, the worst number since the outlet began tracking this question in 1990.\n\nAnd yet, politics is a pendulum that inevitably swings back at some point. Even with their historic unpopularity, Democrats are expanding their polling lead in the generic congressional ballot by 3.9% as the 2026 midterm election cycle heats up. Trump’s approval is nearly five points underwater. While that is considerably better than most of his first term, it is underwater.\n\nOBAMA PRAISES NEWSOM’S ‘RESPONSIBLE APPROACH’ TO CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING AFTER TEXAS EFFORTS\n\nIf that negativity continues to fester, Newsom is not a toxic enough politician to counteract it. The White House has flipped parties in the last three presidential election cycles. If that is the new political trend for presidential elections, the Democratic Party nominee should have the momentum advantage in 2028, even with the party’s brand issues.\n\nThat nominee will likely be Newsom, who has all the advantages a Democratic presidential candidate would want in a primary. Newsom is the best-positioned Democrat to become president in 2028, and his candidacy in a general election cannot be dismissed out of hand by Republicans who recognize his failures in California. The country has become so polarized that any major party candidate is a real threat to win, including the governor of California, who has been brainstorming how to become president for the last several years.","summary":"It should not be lost amid the bizarre social media posts, Gavin Newsom is most likely to be the 2028 Democratic nominee for president.

This week in Atlanta, she used that post to help elect a new party chairman, Joe Gruters of Florida.

Taking Collins' seat in Maine would be a significant victory for the Democrats, who are hoping to take control of the Senate in November, 2026, which would greatly increase their ability to frustrate President Trump's policy agenda during his final two years in the White House.What To KnowOn Tuesday Graham Platner, a 40-year-old businessman and military veteran, announced he is joining the Democratic primary for the right to take on Collins in November 2026.Jordan Wood, the former vice president of liberal campaign group End Citizens United, is also seeking the Democratic nomination for the Maine Senate race and has raised $1.6 million according to Politico.There is speculation Maine Governor Janet Mills could also decide to run with Maine Public Radio reporting she has been heavily lobbied by national Democratic figures to launch a Senate bid.Whichever candidate wins the Democratic primary will have to face Collins in November 2026. While relatively little polling has been conducted due to the distance to the general election her potential opponents will likely be buoyed by her approval rating in some recent polling.A survey of 846 registered Maine voters conducted by the University of New Hampshire between June 19 and 23 found Collins had a net approval rating of -43 percent, with only 14 percent of those surveyed approving of her performance.By contrast, the survey gave Governor Mills an overall approval rating of plus 10, with 51 percent of Mainers viewing her favorably and 41 percent unfavorably.Similarly a Like Research Partners poll of 300 Maine voters over February 1-15 gave Collins a net rating of -33 percent, with 31 percent having a favorable view of her while 64 percent had an unfavorable one.However in better news for Collins a Pan Atlantic Research poll of 820 Maine likely voters over May 12-26 gave her a net positive rating of four, with 49 percent of voters approving of her against 45 percent who disapproved.Kamala Harris carried Maine by seven points in the 2024 presidential election and the state is seen as one of the Republicans top Senate targets for 2026.Collins has at times frustrated President Trump, opposing him on a number of issues including Pete Hegseth's appointment as defense secretary and additional tariffs on Canadian produce.What People Are SayingIn a campaign video, Democratic primary candidate Platner said: \"I'm not fooled by this fake charade of Collins' deliberations and moderation. The difference between Susan Collins and Ted Cruz is at least Ted Cruz is honest about selling us out and not giving a damn.\"Speaking to Politico he added: \"To call me a liberal, I think is fairly amusing. I mean, I'm a competitive pistol shooter. That's what I do on the weekends.\"I'm a firearms instructor. I spent multiple years, obviously, in the service utilizing firearms. I also grew up in rural Maine, where guns are a part of our existence.\"Jordan Wood said: \"Mainers deserve more from our senator than concern without action and I'm not waiting on anyone else's decision to fight for our state.\"Referring to a Senate run in July, Governor Mills said: \"I mean, look, I wasn't born with a burning desire to be in Washington, D.C.—any month of the year.\"And what's going on there is a bit chaotic. It's not something anybody would want to jump into and be a part of automatically.\"What Happens NextDemocrats will be hopeful of beating Collins in 2026 though it remains to be seen who their candidate will be. Polling suggests Collins is not popular in her state, but she could get a boost from moderate voters for standing up to Trump on certain issues.","summary":"Democrats are hoping to unseat Senator Collins, a Trump skeptical Republican, in the November 2026 midterm elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-chances-beating-susan-collins-maine-senate-election-2118219","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708512/susan-collins.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9ad267b3ca2e3bc3ea1a708bd228050d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 16:15:05","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.147},{"id":353608746,"title":"Netanyahu is winning in Gaza and losing the West","text":"This week the Israeli army launched a full-scale ground operation to seize the city of Gaza. The plan is ambitious and ruthless: 60,000 new reservists will be called up and another 20,000 troops will have their service extended. For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this is a “necessary step” to ensure Israel’s security. For the international community, it looks like a gamble that could push Israel into near-total isolation.\n\nThe United Nations has already warned that the offensive will trigger “mass destruction” and the death of civilians, including thousands of children already suffering from hunger. Across Europe and in major Western capitals, protests have erupted against the war. Yet Netanyahu shows no sign of backing down. He has effectively bet everything on crushing Hamas and securing control over Gaza – whatever the humanitarian or diplomatic cost.\n\nThis latest escalation does not happen in a vacuum. It comes after nearly two years of mounting tensions between Israel and its traditional Western allies, a process that began in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and has since transformed Israel’s international standing. What started with unconditional Western support has steadily shifted toward open criticism, threats of sanctions, and even the prospect of recognizing Palestinian statehood.\n\nBy the spring of 2024, Europe’s patience with Israel’s blockade of Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis had run thin. Josep Borrell, then EU foreign policy chief, announced a review of relations with Israel, including discussion of suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement. London froze free trade talks. Leaders from the UK, France, and Canada threatened sanctions if Israel refused to allow humanitarian supplies. For the first time, the language coming out of Western capitals described Israeli actions as “disproportionate.”\n\nNetanyahu responded with defiance, accusing Western leaders of “encouraging terrorism.” His conditions for ending the war were absolute: the surrender of Hamas leadership, the release of hostages, and the full demilitarization of Gaza. Any alternative, he insisted, was unacceptable.\n\nEurope’s pressure soon moved from rhetoric to legal measures. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, while France broke precedent as the first G7 nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Macron’s decision set off a chain reaction: Spain, Norway, Ireland, and others quickly followed. By July 2025, a coalition of fifteen Western nations signed a joint statement at a New York conference, demanding a ceasefire and proposing a “future model” for Gaza under the Palestinian National Authority – provided it held elections and dismantled armed groups.\n\nBritain, too, began edging toward recognition of Palestine, tying the decision to whether Israel would agree to a ceasefire. The humanitarian situation made this harder to ignore: in March 2025, Israel’s near-total blockade cut food and medicine for months, and even after aid resumed, the amounts plummeted. Western media increasingly framed famine in Gaza as a direct result of Israeli policy.\n\nEven Washington showed signs of strain. Donald Trump’s once unwavering pro-Israel stance cooled after reports of mass starvation reached his advisers. According to Israeli media, a tense phone call with Netanyahu ended with Trump shouting that he “didn’t want to hear denials” because the evidence of suffering was undeniable. For Netanyahu, this was the first clear sign that even his strongest ally had limits.\n\nEurope, meanwhile, pursued a multilayered strategy. Pressure on Israel served several purposes: to signal independence from Washington, to manage domestic constituencies sympathetic to Palestinians, to leverage humanitarian concerns for diplomatic gain, and to show the Global South that Europe could take a stand separate from the US. But this “sovereignty” remains largely rhetorical. Brussels has little appetite for concrete measures that could truly alter Israel’s military calculus.\n\nThat cynicism may, in fact, work to Europe’s advantage. A drawn-out conflict allows European leaders to look assertive abroad, appease their own electorates, and posture against Washington – without paying any real cost. Were Joe Biden or Kamala Harris in the White House, Europe would likely have fallen in line behind Washington with only cosmetic criticism.\n\nFor Netanyahu, however, the stakes are existential. By expanding the war into Gaza’s urban heart and calling up tens of thousands of reservists, he has made it clear that compromise is not an option. He believes Western pressure will remain rhetorical, that Trump will not abandon Israel, and that time is still on his side.\n\nBut the higher the stakes, the lonelier Israel becomes. Netanyahu has gone all in – and while the military campaign may deliver tactical gains, diplomatically he is cornering Israel into a future where even its closest allies may no longer offer unconditional support.","summary":"As Europe edges toward recognition of Palestine and Trump shows signs of impatience, Israel’s war risks turning into a lonely fight \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/623393-netanyahu-winning-gaza-losing-west/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.08/article/68a7cd5e85f5407f34092693.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 15:47:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":353601438,"title":"Is Jussie Smollett Innocent? The Complicated True Story Behind The Hate Crime Scandal","text":"The Truth About Jussie Smollett? Jussie Smollett in The Truth About Jussie Smollett?\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nIn 2019, Empire actor Jussie Smollett claimed he was the victim of a racially motivated attack in downtown Chicago by two masked men. His account came under scrutiny when the alleged perpetrators said the TV star paid them to stage a hate crime. Six years later, what do we know about the case, and was Smollett telling the truth or lying?\n\nNetflix’s new documentary, The Truth About Jussie Smollett, has propelled the controversial case back into the spotlight. Directed by Gagan Rehill, the film includes exclusive interviews with Smollett, Chicago investigators and the two men who claimed they were hired to stage the attack. The project marks Smollett’s first on-screen discussion of the incident since his 2019 Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts.\n\nForbesJussie Smollett Says He Is 'Further Victimized' By False Rumors Regarding His AssaultBy Adrienne Gibbs\n\nSmollett is best known for starring in Fox's hit hip-hop drama, Empire. From 2015 to 2019, he portrayed Jamal Lyon, a gay singer-songwriter who is estranged from his father because of his sexuality. Beyond acting, Smollett is also an R&B singer and an advocate for H.I.V./AIDS prevention and racial justice. According to The New York Times, in 2019, he served on the boards of four charitable organizations, including the Trayvon Martin Foundation and the Black AIDS Institute.\n\nHowever, Smollett’s life took a dramatic turn in early 2019 when he reported being the victim of a hate crime. Here’s what to know about the case, including what Smollett revealed in the documentary and the evidence for and against him.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhat Happened To Jussie Smollett?\n\nThe Truth About Jussie Smollett on Netflix.\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2019, Jussie Smollett told the Chicago Police Department that he was attacked around 2 a.m. near downtown Chicago. He alleged that two white men assaulted him, poured an unknown liquid on him, put a noose around his neck and yelled racist and homophobic slurs, including that it was \"MAGA country,\" referring to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan. The actor was treated at a hospital but did not have serious injuries.\n\n“Overnight the Chicago Police Department received a report of a possible racially charged assault and battery against a cast member of the television show Empire,” the original CPD statement read. “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”\n\nIn response, CPD investigators worked to locate the two alleged attackers by following leads and reviewing surveillance footage. The actor also claimed that a week earlier, he received a racist letter on the set of Empire addressed to him. The envelope contained an unknown powdery substance and ransom-note style lettering, according to CBS News.\n\nIn the days following the incident, Smollett received widespread support from celebrities and political figures, including actor Viola Davis, singer John Legend and then-former Vice President Joe Biden. President Trump called the news “horrible,” and former Vice President Kamala Harris said, “This was an attempted modern day lynching.”\n\nMeanwhile, Smollett continued to claim that everything he told police was true. “I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement in early February 2019. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”\n\nThat same month, he gave his first interview on GMA, where he reiterated his innocence. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone Black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett told Roberts. “A lot more.”\n\nWhen Did Investigators Begin Questioning Jussie Smollett’s Story?\n\nThe Truth About Jussie Smollett? (L to R) Bola 'Abel' Osundairo and Ola Osundairo in The Truth About Jussie Smollett?\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nUltimately, Chicago authorities discovered evidence that showed Smollett had possibly staged the incident. They obtained CCTV footage and ride-share records that show that the alleged attackers were actually two Nigerian American brothers named Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were extras on Empire.\n\nDuring their interviews, the Osundairo brothers told police that Smollett had hired them to stage the attack. They claimed he orchestrated the crime after the cryptic letter sent to the Fox studio failed to generate attention. According to CBS News, one brother allegedly purchased the rope used in the incident at Smollett's request. They further claimed that during the staged attack, one brother held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and shouted slurs at Smollett.\n\n\"I believe he wanted to be the poster boy of activism for Black people, for gay people, for marginalized people,\" Bola Osundairo said in the documentary.\n\nOla Osundairo added that when Smollett asked them to \"beat him up,\" he \"thought it was crazy.\" \"But at the same time, I’m like, ‘It’s Hollywood.’ This is how it goes,’\" he said in the documentary.\n\nThe brothers even told detectives that they rehearsed the attack with Smollett days before it occurred, and that he paid them $3,500. Sources told ABC News that the payment was disguised for fitness training to prepare for an upcoming music video. The $3,500 check reportedly covered a five-week program, consisting of $600 weekly for workouts and $100 weekly for nutrition planning.\n\nABC News also published text messages allegedly exchanged between Smollett and one of the Osundairo brothers, whom he referred to as \"Bon.\" These messages contained discussions about exercise routines and meal plans in the days leading up to the alleged attack.\n\nIn the documentary, Smollett claimed that the text exchange was code for him requesting drugs — specifically an herbal steroid to lose belly fat that is illegal in the U.S. He also said the $3,500 check was actually for personal training sessions led by Bola.\n\nWas Jussie Smollett Arrested?\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MARCH 26: Actor Jussie Smollett leaves the Leighton Courthouse after his court appearance on March 26, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. This morning in court it was announced that all charges were dropped against the actor. (Photo by Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nSmollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report. He was arrested just hours after the grand jury heard evidence that Smollett falsely reported being attacked. He was released on $100,000 bail and returned to the Empire set in Chicago.\n\nIn response, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson criticized Smollett for exploiting the pain and anger associated with racism while wasting resources that could have been used to investigate actual crimes. “I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,” he said, according to The Times.\n\nShortly after, the producers of Empire announced that the actor’s character would not appear in the final two episodes of the show’s fifth season. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the producers said in a statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”\n\nIn March 2019, Smollett was indicted by a Chicago grand jury on 16 felony counts, and Smollett pled not guilty. But a few weeks later, Chicago prosecutors dropped all charges against Smollett, resulting in backlash from Johnson and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Chicago Police Department Commander Ed Wodnicki told NBC Chicago that the reversal of charges was a \"punch in the gut.”\n\n\"We worked closely throughout our three-week investigation to get to the point where we arrested the offender,” Wodnicki said. “For the state's attorney at this point to dismiss charges without discussing this with us at all is just shocking.\"\n\nHowever, Smollett’s freedom didn’t last long, because in late 2019, a special prosecutor was appointed to review his case. The actor was indicted on Feb. 11, 2020 by a grand jury in Chicago. In the second indictment, he faced six counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly making false police reports, in addition to his existing lawsuit with the city.\n\nWhat Happened At Jussie Smollett’s Trial?\n\nJussie Smollett, center, arrives at the Leighton Criminal Court Building for the beginning of his trial on new disorderly conduct charges on November 29, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. - Former \"Empire\" star Jussie Smollett is accused of making false reports to authorities that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in 2019.

He was ordered to pay around $120,100 in restitution to the city of Chicago and was fined $25,000, which was the maximum amount.\n\nHe only spent six days in jail before the Empire star was released on bond pending an appeal. However, an appeals court later upheld the disorderly conduct convictions, the Associated Press reported at the time. He was ordered to complete the 150-day jail sentence.\n\nWhy Did The Illinois Supreme Court Overturn Smollett’s Conviction?\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MARCH 26: Actor Jussie Smollett waves as he follows his attorney to the microphones after his court appearance at Leighton Courthouse on March 26, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. This morning in court it was announced that all charges were dropped against the actor. (Photo by Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe most significant development in the case came in November 2024, when the Illinois Supreme Court overturned his conviction, ruling that Smollett had been wrongfully charged after entering into a non-prosecution agreement with the Cook County state's attorney.\n\n\"Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied,\" the ruling said, according to NBC News.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Dan K. Webb, who brought the second case against Smollett, released a statement disagreeing with the Illinois Supreme Court’s decision. “Make no mistake — today’s ruling has nothing to do with Mr. Smollett’s innocence,\" he said.\n\n\"The Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury’s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct,” Webb continued. “In fact, Mr. Smollett did not even challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him in his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.”\n\nThe city of Chicago and Smollett finally settled their lawsuit on May 1, 2025. In an Instagram post, the actor explained that he was offered the opportunity to have the suit dismissed in exchange for a charitable donation. He donated $50,000 to the Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts and committed to an additional $10,000 donation to the Chicago Torture Justice Center.\n\nWhat Evidence Supports That Jussie Smollett Was Telling The Truth?\n\nATLANTA, GA - SEPTEMBER 3: Jussie Smollett attends 2022 Atlanta Black Pride Weekend Film Festival- \"B-Boy Blues\" screening at IPIC Theaters at Colony Square on September 3, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)\n\nIn The Truth About Jussie Smollett, the former Empire star maintains his innocence. But what evidence supports Smollett's claim that he was telling the truth about his assault?\n\nThere are two witnesses can corroborate parts of Smollett’s account, according to the film. A security guard at the Sheraton reported seeing a white man running down the street around the time of the alleged attack. Additionally, a neighbor in Smollett’s building saw a man with a rope hanging from his coat while walking her dog in front of the building. \"I thought to myself, this is it, this is going to exonerate me,\" Smollett explains in the documentary.\n\nTwo freelance journalists who examined the police videos showing the alleged attackers also claimed that the person running down the street appears to be white, not Black like the Osundairo brothers.\n\n\"Why would Jussie hire two Nigerian guys to do an attack that he was going to say was perpetrated by white guys, if it was going to be caught on tape?\" questioned Tina Glandian, attorney at Geragos and Geragos, who represented Smollett.\n\nSmollett added that during the investigation, he was \"playing whack-a-mole with rumors, with lies.” However, \"at a certain point, it’s too many, and you can’t catch them all,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of the documentary, the actor concluded by saying, “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter whether someone likes me or doesn’t like me. It doesn’t matter whether you like the way I’m giving this interview. It doesn’t matter whether you like the way I look right now or not.”\n\nHe continued, “Doesn’t matter whether you love my performances or can’t stand them. That’s unimportant. What is important is, regardless of what you think about me, flaws and all, flaws and greatness, whatever you think, joy and sorrow. I didn’t do that [fake a hate crime] and that’s all that matters.”\n\nThe Truth About Jussie Smollett is streaming on Netflix.

Now it's his GOP and the MAGA faithful are in the lead","text":"AgenciesDonald Trump\n\nAmy Kremer was an early tea party leader who supported Donald Trump for president in 2016. She ran for Congress from Georgia in 2017 and got less than 1% of the Republican primary vote. In 2021, she organized the rally near the White House that took place hours before hundreds of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to protest his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. As voters Trump to power in 2024, Kremer unseated a conservative stalwart to become a Republican National Committee member. This week in Atlanta, she used that post to help elect a new party chairman, Joe Gruters of Florida. He's another original Trump backer who has been described by the president as a \"MAGA warrior\"- a reference to the \"Make America Great Again\" movement. \"I never thought I'd be sitting here for something like this,\" Kremer said. \"It's Donald Trump's party now.\" Sitting presidents typically choose their national party leaders. But today's RNC, with grassroots activists such as Kremer and a leader in Gruters, demonstrates how much the Republicans have changed from the establishment-controlled Grand Old Party and now reflect Trump and his populist nationalism.Live Events Almost a dozen interviews with RNC members found an affinity for the president that they described as running deeper than for his predecessors. They insist Trump's remaking of the economy, the federal government and America's role in the world are overdue, and they are confident his political struggles will not doom the party in the 2026 midterm election. They described a seamless relationship between the White House and the party machinery, and as better than during Trump's first term. Perhaps most notably, they argued that Republicans' \"America First\" and MAGA identity are not simply about Trump's charismatic branding but rather evidence of a movement that predated his presidency and will last beyond. \"When you see the working-class people that bought into this, it was for real. It wasn't a fly-by-night,\" said the Nevada Republican chairman, Michael McDonald. \"Donald Trump brought something that needed to wake up the party, and he did. And it's never going back.\" Trump didn't begin as a Republican Party man Kremer took her RNC seat when the party convened at the 2024 convention in Milwaukee. She was one of nearly four dozen new members out of the 168 seats. Another 21 new members joined the committee in Atlanta. \"That's all MAGA,\" she said. Nevada's McDonald was elected in 2011 and is now the longest-serving Republican state party chair. He laughed when asked about party dynamics during Trump's first campaign and presidency. \"We had people inside the Republican Party throwing marbles at our feet,\" said McDonald, who was indicted as a fake elector after the 2020 election, accused of scheming to keep Trump in the White House even after he lost Nevada to Biden. A Nevada judge dismissed the case last year. Trump's second-term secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was a Florida senator and one of Trump's primary rivals in 2016. In that campaign, Rubio had called the would-be president a \"con artist.\" At the GOP convention that year, another candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, flouted protocol by not explicitly endorsing Trump. Trump's initial breach with the party seemed a liability after he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. A Washington outsider, he had little choice but to build a West Wing and executive branch that included plenty of Republicans who were not true believers. His first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, led the RNC while Trump ran for president and had dealt with GOP power players who wanted to block Trump's nomination. Trump's first RNC chair was Ronna Romney McDaniel, niece of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who had warned publicly against Trump's election. In office, Trump leaned on his ability to control news cycles and narratives. He largely ignored party mechanics and was not intimately involved in the 2018 midterm campaign, when Democrats won back a U.S. House majority. New Trump-friendly faces surfaced anyway People around Trump laid long-term groundwork despite his seeming detachment from the party. McDonald said loyalists Steven Bannon, David Bossie, Susie Wiles, who is the current White House chief of staff, and others helped build state-level infrastructure and recruit candidates for state party leadership, RNC seats and down-ballot offices. Other newcomers emerged on their own, inspired by Trump. \"I speak for a whole generation who was frustrated by the status quo and being politically correct,\" said John Wahl, the Alabama party chairman. In 2021, he became the youngest GOP chairman nationally at age 34. Wahl succeeded Terry Lathan, who had been a loyal party soldier for nominees ranging from moderates like Arizona Sen. John McCain to party crashers like Trump. Yet in 2023, once she was out of office and free to choose a GOP presidential primary candidate, she backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump. Lathan did not attend Trump's 2024 nominating convention in Milwaukee. Bryan Miller, who was elected to head Wyoming's Republican Party this year, supported Trump in the 2016 primaries, not long after Miller had retired from the Air Force and joined his county GOP committee leadership. He recalls watching his state's most high-profile Republican, then U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, helped lead the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. She endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump in 2024. Miller said he \"wouldn't have believed it\" if he had been told a decade ago that he would be become state chairman and that Liz Cheney, daughter of a former Vice President Dick Cheney, would be unwelcome among Wyoming Republicans. 'America First' unity overrides any disa greements Fealty to Trump does not mean there's complete harmony among Republicans. Evan Power, chair of the Florida GOP and a onetime Rubio aide, agreed that some Republicans still prefer conservative orthodoxy on global trade and international alliances. But he said Trump speaks to voter anger over an uneven economy and that Trump's confrontational approach toward other nations is no different from how the president conducts domestic politics. \"Now people know that his combative fighting style is what wins elections,\" Power said. Miller pointed to National Guard troops on the streets of the District of Columbia and acknowledged questions about using armed federal military power to police an American city. \"I'm OK with it - as long as we remain within the confines of the law, the way it's set up\" for military personnel to be \"only in supporting roles,\" he said. Kremer, who once lambasted President Barack Obama's health overhaul as a budget buster, said she knows the new tax breaks and spending cuts pushed by Trump are set to add trillions of dollars to the nation's debt. \"There's not another person that would deport the illegals and shut down the border,\" she said. \"It's opportunity cost. You know he's going to spend more. I'm not OK with it, but I know you can't have everything.\" Trump himself has learned some of that same bottom-line pragmatism where the party is concerned. During his 2024 campaign, Trump pushed out McDaniel from the RNC. He tapped daughter-in-law Lara Trump and Michael Whatley of North Carolina as party co-chairs. Now, Whatley is Trump's pick for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, and Gruters is leading the RNC. Vice President JD Vance chairs the RNC's finance operations in an unusually high-ranking link between the White House and the party's fundraising apparatus. And with nearly every new turnover across the party's organizational chart, the scales tip further in Trump's direction. \"He sat in exile for four years and thought about what he could have done better,\" said Power, the Florida chair, \"and he's executing on all cylinders.\"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpwhite houserepublican partyDonald Trumprepublican national committeenational guardgrand old partymaga\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Elliott Morris found, when comparing 1,500 \"synthetic\" survey respondents and 1,500 real people, that large language models (LLMs) were overall very bad at reflecting the views of actual human respondents.\n\nUsing six OpenAI models — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 nano, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and o4-mini — Morris instructed each LLM to respond as various demographics. In one example, the researcher prompted the LLMs to respond as a white 61-year-old woman in Florida who makes between $50,000 and $75,000 per year and who considers herself a moderate voter.\n\nUsing typical real-world political survey questions, the LLMs were asked things like \"Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?\" and given a five-point scale ranging from \"strongly approve,\" \"slightly approve,\" \"slightly disapprove,\" strongly disapprove\" and \"don't know/not sure.\"\n\nThe results weren't exactly inspiring. The worst-performing model, which was not specified, was 23 points off from the real respondents overall, while the best-performing model, GPT-4o-mini, was 4 points off.\n\nAnd the more closely Morris zoomed in, the worse things looked. As this graphic from the study shows, even the \"voters\" generated by the best-performing model, 4o-mini, veered further from reality as they were instructed to respond as groups who are less well represented in the United States population, like Black, Asian and Pacific Islander respondents.\n\nFor any pollster looking to do a good job, this is a big deal.\n\nImagine, for instance, a presidential campaign crafting its messaging for Black voters using the data above. When it comes to that cohort's disapproval rating of Trump, there was a 15 percentage point difference between what actual people responded versus what 4o-mini predicted, with the AI significantly exaggerating that bloc's disapproval rate for Trump.\n\nObviously, any campaign that used only that AI-generated data would miss the mark — instead of looking at the views of real respondents, it would be looking at a funhouse mirror reflection of a demographic cooked up by a language model with no access to actual data.\n\n\"The performance of our 'synthetic sample' is too poor to be useful for all of our research questions,\" Morris wrote. \"In computing overall population proportions, the technique above produces error rates at a minimum of several percentage points, too large to tolerate in academic, political, and most market-research contexts.\"\n\n\"Synthetic samples generate such high errors at the subgroup level,\" he continued, \"that we do not trust them at all to represent key groups in the population.\"\n\nThese results, while not entirely unexpected, fly in the face of the recent push to use AI-generated responses in political polling regardless of accuracy. One AI polling startup, Aaru, told Semafor after last November's presidential election that even though it incorrectly predicted Kamala Harris would win, its methods were, somehow, still superior to traditional polling.\n\n\"A coin flip is a coin flip. 53-47 is not significantly different from 48-52,\" Aaru cofounder Cameron Fink told the website. \"Statistically speaking, we’re within the margin of error — so we did well.\"\n\nHeck, maybe that's a good enough attitude to get hired by a political campaign — but it's not going to do much help for any candidate trying to win.\n\nMore on AI and politics: AI Powering MAGA Botnet Confused by Trump's Connections to Epstein, Starts Contradicting Itself","summary":"As if the institution of political polling were not already fraught enough, pollsters are now surveying AI instead of real people to cut costs and save time.

It happened the same week as House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., again didn't rule out bringing Harris in before his committee, as he investigates whether former President Joe Biden’s top aides conspired to hide signs of mental decline in the ex-commander-in-chief. LONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION \"I think that it would be helpful to hear from Kamala Harris,\" Comer told Fox News Digital on Thursday. \"And I think that, you know, if I were her, wanted to have a political future, I would want to set the record straight on a lot of this stuff. Because it's going to haunt her her entire political career, because nobody thinks that Joe Biden was calling the shots in the end.\" The House Oversight Committee’s ranking member has traditionally served as a top foil to the party in power, coordinating their party’s response to investigations led by the panel’s majority. RON KLAIN DODGES REPORTERS AFTER MARATHON GRILLING IN BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE Among House Oversight Republicans’ key focuses right now is the probe into Biden. A Republican member of the panel, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., previously called for Harris to be subpoenaed, but Comer said it was still up in the air. \"We haven't decided whether we're going to issue the subpoena or not, but certainly she's welcome to come to the committee,\" Comer said. Garcia said Wednesday that he was \"honored\" to be sworn in by Harris, who he said \"has always fought for our country and shown us what true leadership looks like.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I’m especially grateful to have been able to share this moment with Vice President Harris, and I’m ready to get to work to hold Donald Trump and his administration accountable for their corruption and abuses of power. We will deliver real results for the American people,\" Garcia said in a statement without mentioning Comer’s Biden probe. He was elected to the ranking member role via an internal House Democratic Caucus vote, besting three other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas. Crockett notably dropped out of the race after failing to win Democratic leaders' recommendation for the job.","summary":"Rep.

And this time, Gen Z is looking further afield than A24 films, HBO shows and indie bands.They're looking so far back in fact, that they've reached the presidency of George W. Bush, and have anointed the former president as the new it boy du jour, with #BushTok and #BushCore having exploded all over Gen Z's digital watering hole, TikTok.As nostalgia for the Bush presidency sweeps the internet, Newsweek spoke to the experts about why Gen Z is falling in love with Bush.Newsweek has reached out to a media representative for Bush via email for comment.Gen Z's Political LeaningsGen Z occupies a unique space politically, and political polarization is a native tongue for the tech-raised generation.There is a significant gender divide when it comes to America's youngest adult generation: an October poll from the New York Times and Siena College showed a striking 51-point gender divide among Gen Z voters. Women aged 18 to 29 favored former former Vice President Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump by 38 points, while men in this group favored Trump by 13 points.This is the widest gap among any generation. Gen Z's political affiliations, though, can be slippery. Much has been made of how Gen Z men are tilting toward the right, but Trump has largely surrendered all the gains he made with male Gen Z voters in the 2024 election. A CBS News/YouGov survey published in July found that Trump's net approval among 18- to 29-year-olds had all but collapsed—from 55 percent in February to just 28 percent by July.At the same time though, the way Gen Z engages with politics is unconventional compared with previous generations. While the first few months of the Trump presidency have been marked by continuous protests against him and the administration, Gen Z has been noticeably absent from this activism.George Bush's Online RevivalOne video edit of Bush, comprised of different clips of him, has been viewed 1.6 million times. Another edit, which has the text overlay \"George W. Bush Mentality,\" and features clips of him speaking, has been viewed 1 million times, and, a clip of the former president talking about the 2001 film Shrek, has been viewed over 2 million times.Gen Z's fondness for Bush takes different forms. Many videos of him are humorous, with Gen Zers sharing edits of Bush as some kind of inadvertent comedy icon. One clip of Bush speaking to late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, followed by a video edit of the former president, has been viewed over 3 million times, and is captioned \"Funniest Prez?\"In other edits, Bush is positioned with fondness as a sort of lovable grandpa. Other TikToks though, have taken to fully romanticizing the former president.One TikTok, from the account @theclairenecessities, taps Bush for a viral trend about calling off your marriage. The trend involves a clip from the TV show Gossip Girl, where the character Chuck Bass (played by Ed Westwick), tells the character Blair Waldorf (played by Leighton Meester), not to go through with her wedding. In the edit, Westwick saying \"Don't Marry Him,\" can be heard over the Gracie Abrams song, I Love You, I'm Sorry.The @theclairenecessities TikTok has the text overlay, \"when I'm about to walk down the aisle but George W Bush when he found out about 9/11 shows up,\" and is captioned \"In another timeline it was never Laura,\" in a reference to Bush's wife and former first lady, Laura Bush. The top comment on that video, which was liked more than 3000 times reads, \"I've always loved him.\"Newsweek spoke with Lama Mohammed, a tech policy fellow and researcher at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics Policy about the trend.\"In a time where Y2K is back and even trendy among Gen Z, their new fascination with George W. Bush is likely our generation's yearning for 'simpler times,' despite being too young or not alive to remember 9/11 or the Iraq War,\" Mohammed said.\"Clips going viral on TikTok with Bush saying, 'now watch this drive' or 'fool me once, shame on, shame on you,' resurface the former president as an endearing, goofy grandfatherly figure whose 'Bushisms' provide entertainment and even an escape from the current political climate,\" Mohammed added.Newsweek also spoke about the trend with Sarah Burnham, a postdoctoral scholar at Tufts University's Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.\"Young people have always been creative in their digital expression, and media creation is an important part of how they approach politics,\" Burnham said. \"It can be a great way for young people to find community, be exposed to different perspectives and experiences, and make their voices heard. It can also serve as an entry point to other forms of political action.\"\"The fact that youth are looking to the past may be a sign of their dissatisfaction with the present: our research has found that only 16 percent of young people believe democracy is working well for them,\" Burnham added.And there's a nostalgia at play here for an entirely different era of politics.\"Many comments on videos tagged as #Bushcore use past moments to contrast the current administration,\" Mohammed said. \"Users are saying, 'These were like Bush's lowest moments. Somehow they tower over Trump's best,' or 'I would've NEVER thought 20 years ago…I wish he could be president again…I miss him,' representing how unhappy Gen Zers are with contemporary politics.\"\"A recent YouGov/Economist poll shows that President Trump continues to have a significantly low approval rating among young voters—61 percent disapprove. They use Bush's persona as relief, reminiscent of times when there was supposedly more empathy and community in politics,\" she added.This nostalgia isn't necessarily new for Gen Z either. Following the 2024 presidential election, edits comparing debates past and present became popular, with some social media users lamenting how the tone of political debates had changed.And it definitely plays into the fondness for Bush. One TikTok edit, which has been viewed over 800,000 times is solely dedicated to clips of Bush and former first lady Michelle Obama and is captioned \"Love their friendship sm,\" celebrating their positive relationship that existed across party lines.\"In another viral TikTok, Bush discusses sharing values with Mexican Americans—the caption read, \"Back when they had empathy.\" Mohammed told Newsweek. \"Although a Republican, Gen Z has seemed to develop an appreciation for Bush, viewing him as someone sympathetic towards immigrants.\"The Post-Presidency Legacy ShiftBeyond nostalgia, there is another interesting factor at play here: how the popularity of presidents changes after their presidency ends and evolves as the years pass.According to the American Presidency Project, Bush's final presidential approval rating was 34 percent. Former President Jimmy Carter held the exact same final presidential approval rating.In a YouGov ranking of the most popular U.S. presidents for Q2 of 2025, Carter ranks at number 7 with a popularity score of 62 percent, and Bush ranks at 20, with a popularity score of 41 percent. Former President Joe Biden sits just above Bush at 19, with a popularity score of 42 percent. Trump ranks at 25 on that list, with a popularity ranking of 37.\"Those who lived through Bush's presidency likely associate him with the drastic financial and human costs of the Iraq War, the Great Recession following his administration, and his failures to address Hurricane Katrina,\" Mohammed told Newsweek.The trend notably comes ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Many Americans remember the mayhem when Katrina made landfall off Louisiana on August 29, 2005. Nearly 20 years later and the storm has been memorialized as a \"man made disaster.\" Many Gen Zers though, will be too young to remember.\"Repackaging Bush as nostalgia is less about their understanding of his policies and more about their discontent with the current state of American politics. The effect of this dissatisfaction is already taking effect,\" Mohammed said.","summary":"As #BushTok sweeps the Internet, Newsweek spoke to experts about what America's youngest adult generation's fondness for the president means for politics today.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/george-bush-gen-z-tiktok-bushtolk-hurricane-katrina-2117582","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2706994/genz-falling-love-bush.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=794fd91e18e0923ff9116033ba9f8a0b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 09:00:03","author":"Marni Rose McFall","authors":["Marni Rose McFall"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":353525730,"title":"GOP senators push Kamala Harris testimony as House Oversight eyes subpoena","text":"As the 11th member of former President Joe Biden's administration appeared before the House Oversight Committee this week, Fox News Digital asked senators on Capitol Hill if former Vice President Kamala Harris should testify next. \"I think they should take her behind closed doors and figure out what she knows and what she's willing to talk about,\" Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., is leading the investigation into the alleged cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline and use of the autopen during his tenure as president. Comer said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" last month that the \"odds\" of Harris getting a subpoena to appear before the House Oversight Committee are \"very high.\" INSIDE THE BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE: 8 AIDES QUESTIONED, MORE ON THE WAY While Marshall told Fox News Digital that Harris should testify, he admitted, \"I don't think you need her testimony to show Americans what I knew as a physician a long time ago, that Joe Biden had a neurodegenerative disease of some sort.\" HOUSE REPUBLICANS FLOAT GRILLING JOE, JILL BIDEN AS FORMER AIDES STONEWALL COVER-UP PROBE Marshall has a medical degree from the University of Kansas and practiced medicine for more than 25 years before running for public office. \"All you had to do is look at his very fixed, flat face,\" Marshall explained. \"Look at his gait, the way he walked. He had a shuffled walk. He didn't move his arms, hardly at all. When he talked, it was very monotone, a very soft voice. He had malingering thought processes. I don't think it took much to figure that out.\" After listing the former president's symptoms, the Kansas senator lamented that Biden \"turned weakness into war,\" creating a national security threat. During Biden's presidency, the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan resulted in the death of 13 U.S. soldiers, Russia invaded Ukraine and Hamas attacked Israel, triggering the ongoing war in Gaza. But as Republicans demand transparency, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital that he is far more worried about the \"challenges we face right now,\" particularly on the economy, inflation and the impact of Trump's tariff policies. Meanwhile, Sen. John Hoeven R-N.D., defended the accountability argument, telling Fox News Digital that Americans \"always want more information and more transparency.\" \"If you're involved in an administration, you [should] always be willing to come in and say what you did and why you did it, and you know what it's all about.

SCHMIDTNew York Times\n\nWhen federal agents armed with a search warrant showed up at John Bolton's home outside Washington at dawn Friday, it was a display of one of the government's most intimidating powers, in this case deployed against a fierce and high-profile critic of President Trump.\n\nIt is not yet clear what evidence the Justice Department cited in convincing a federal judge to sign off on the search warrant, or what culpability Bolton might have in an on-and-off investigation into whether he mishandled classified information dating back to when he served as Trump's national security adviser during the president's first term.\n\nBut the episode illustrated how Trump's campaign of retribution has undercut the principle that law enforcement should keep a substantial distance from politics, stoking questions about whether even legitimate investigations are colored by the president's insistence on putting his perceived enemies through the same treatment he faced as a target of multiple inquiries.\n\nFrom Trump's first term, he was repeatedly warned by aides — including his White House counsel and chief of staff at the time — that he should refrain from publicly accusing his enemies of breaking the law.\n\nAmong the reasons, aides told him, was that someday, when one of his enemies did do something wrong, the public might not believe it because there would be a perception that the accusation stemmed from Trump's drive for retribution.\n\n\"For all we know, the investigation into John Bolton's conduct may be rock-solid, but Trump's Justice Department has lost any presumption of regularity,\" said Barbara L. McQuade, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and a U.S. attorney during the Obama administration.\n\n\"One of the reasons prosecutors keep their mouths shut about politics is so that if and when investigative activity is undertaken, there will be no appearance of bias,\" she said. \"In light of all of the threats the Trump administration has made to target his enemies, they have lost any presumption of good faith.\"\n\nIn his seven months back in office, Trump and his administration have used a whole-of-government approach to go after his perceived enemies as well as people and institutions he sees as impeding his agenda, including academic institutions, news organizations and law firms. In doing so, they have not only in many cases put legal and financial pressure on their targets but also sent broader signals about the hefty costs that criticism of Trump could incur.\n\nIn the case of the search of Bolton's home, the developments were accompanied by almost gleeful statements from administration officials. Trump's FBI director, Kash Patel, who before taking office listed Bolton as a member of an executive branch \"deep state,\" posted on social media, \"NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.\" The deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino, reposted Patel, saying, \"Public corruption will not be tolerated.\"\n\nTrump's retribution campaign has long focused on putting his perceived enemies through what he believes he unfairly endured as he was investigated, first by a special counsel during his first term and later by federal and state prosecutors during the Biden administration. In some ways, the search of Bolton's home mirrors the FBI's 2022 search of Trump's Florida home and private club, Mar-a-Lago, to retrieve classified documents he had kept and refused to return after leaving office.\n\nExecuting a search warrant at an individual's home is considered among federal law enforcement's greatest powers. It casts the specter of criminality over the person whose home is being searched, as it typically creates scenes of FBI agents — wearing their trademark windbreakers with the bureau's initials emblazoned on the back — going in and out of the person's home.\n\nExactly those images were beamed out from coverage at Bolton's home Friday as journalists assembled outside to provide live updates on the search. Agents later appeared to be entering Bolton's office in Washington.\n\nFor the FBI to have obtained a search warrant, an agent has to provide an affidavit to a federal judge, who would then have to rule that there was probable cause that there was evidence on the premises that a crime had been committed.\n\nBolton has a long and contentious history with Trump. He served as national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019, often finding himself at odds with the president and his aides. He documented his experience in a book, \"The Room Where it Happened,\" which painted the president as an uninformed leader with authoritarian instincts. It was published only after the administration engaged in a lengthy review of whether it contained classified information.\n\nA foreign policy hawk, Bolton is a frequent guest on cable television news, where he typically sharply criticizes Trump, especially on his handling of Russia, a topic that has been front and center in recent weeks.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 election, Bolton again warned about why he believed Trump was unfit to be president, although he refused to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhen Trump returned to power in early 2024, Trump stacked his administration with officials like Patel who openly embraced his retribution agenda.\n\nDuring the time Bolton worked in the first Trump administration, he helped put together plans that led to Trump ordering the killing of a top Iranian general. Because of Bolton's role in those plans, there was intelligence showing that the Iranians wanted to kill him. To protect Bolton, the federal government provided him with a security detail throughout the Biden administration.\n\nBut just a day after being sworn in, Trump stripped Bolton of his security detail.\n\nDespite losing his security, Bolton continued to publicly take on Trump, including as the FBI raid occurred Friday.","summary":"When federal agents armed with a search warrant showed up at John Bolton's home outside Washington at dawn Friday, it was a display of one of the government's most intimidating powers, in this case deployed against a fierce and high-profile…","url":"https://buffalonews.com/article_3d19fdea-2bc9-5e4f-b4d1-2e4ad77be876.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/6a/96a5b2b3-80b7-58e7-8bb4-3732dad1b647/68a9638cb50f2.image.jpg?crop=898%2C471%2C0%2C69","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 06:45:44","author":"MICHAEL S.

The governor has not officially announced a bid for president. \n\n“That’s a 40-point climb, my goodness gracious! A rising tide of support for Gavin Newsom,” Enten said. “Remember, back in 2023, the majority of Democrats did not want Joe Biden to run for another term; but California Democrats in Gavin Newsom’s home state did not want him to run, either.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the White House for comment. \n\nTensions between the California governor and the president rose amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids across the country. \n\nIn June, Californians took to the streets of Los Angeles to protest against Trump and his ICE raids, leading the president to deploy hundreds of Marines and thousands of National Guard troops to quell demonstrators. Newsom sued the Trump administration for what he called an “unlawful” move.\n\nNewsom’s criticism of Trump has evolved into full-on mockery as he imitates the president’s social media mannerisms while promoting his new push to redraw congressional maps so that California Democrats could gain five more seats before the midterm elections. The move is in response to a Texas Republican effort to pick up five more seats, which Trump told CNBC they are “entitled to.” \n\n“NOT EVEN JD ‘JUST DANCE’ VANCE CAN SAVE TRUMP FROM THE DISASTROUS MAPS ‘WAR’ HE HAS STARTED. NOT EVEN HIS EYELINER LINES LOOK AS PRETTY AS CALIFORNIA ‘MAP’ LINES,” Newsom’s press office wrote on X Saturday, mimicking Trump’s use of capital letters in posts. \n\n“HE WILL FAIL, AS HE ALWAYS DOES (SAD!) AND I, THE PEACETIME GOVERNOR — OUR NATION’S FAVORITE — WILL SAVE AMERICA ONCE AGAIN. MANY ARE NOW CALLING ME GAVIN CHRISTOPHER ‘COLUMBUS’ NEWSOM (BECAUSE OF THE MAPS!). THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. — GCN.”\n\nNewsom also went after Trump on TikTok, where the White House recently made an account. In a video posted Wednesday and captioned, “coming for his neck,” the governor mocked Trump with clips of him stumbling up stairs of Air Force One and getting scared by a Bald Eagle during a 2015 photoshoot.\n\nFor his part, Trump bashed Newsom as “the man who is destroying the once Great State of California,” in a Truth Social post Wednesday night.\n\n“Gavin Newscum is way down in the polls,” the president said. \n\nIn a new Politico/Citrin Center poll, California Democrats said they prefer Newsom over Trump’s 2024 opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, 25 to 19 percent, in a 2028 presidential primary. \n\nEnten explained the importance of home state polling for presidential candidates during Friday’s broadcast. \n\n“If they can’t win the primary in their home state, they ain’t going to win anywhere,” the data guru said.","summary":"For several days the California governor’s social media has been working overtime to troll Trump as their feud has heated up","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/newsom-trump-fight-polling-trolling-b2812856.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/23/2/48/Screenshot-2025-08-22-at-10-45-40-PM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NjEpxGqT-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-23 03:30:17","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.149},{"id":353430896,"title":"Jussie Smollett felt 'extremely emasculated' by outpouring of support after assault story went viral","text":"Former \"Empire\" star Jussie Smollett said he felt \"extremely emasculated\" by the outpouring of support he received after he came forward with his assault allegations.

The documentary featured a news clip rounding up messages from A-listers like Viola Davis and John Legend, as well as then-former Vice President Joe Biden, who said, \"Homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.\" FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT TO BYU, THE MEDIA'S HISTORY OF PEDDLING RACE HOAXES A clip of President Donald Trump's reaction was also included, saying at the time that the alleged attack was \"horrible.\" \"There was a moment when I went on social media, and I felt like I was being eulogized,\" Smollett said. \"I felt like I had died, and I was alive to see - and what people were saying was so kind, but it was too much for me.\" \"It made me very uncomfortable, made me very extremely embarrassed. It made me feel extremely emasculated,\" he continued. Later in the documentary, Smollett attempted to fend off the questions that had swirled around the time of the controversy, including why he refused to hand his phone over to the police, which he said was to hide his drug use, as well as why he was walking around at 2 o'clock in the morning. He claimed he \"always did that.\" JUSSIE SMOLLETT CALLS CHICAGO PD AND RAHM EMMANUEL ‘VILLAINS' WHILE DENYING HATE CRIME HOAX In the early hours of Jan. 29, 2019, during a historic polar vortex in Chicago, Smollett alleged he was attacked by two MAGA hat-wearing thugs who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor while he was out getting a Subway sandwich, yelling \"This is MAGA country!\" He claimed the two men assaulted him, poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck. The incident was quickly denounced by the left, including then-Sen. Kamala Harris who called the attack a \"modern day lynching.\" The media similarly offered sympathetic coverage. \"GMA\" anchor Robin Roberts sat down with Smollett for his first interview following the alleged incident, offering minimal skepticism to his claims.

Smollett was later charged and convicted for his crimes against the city of Chicago but was let out of jail just six days into his 150-day sentence. Smollett's conviction was later overturned in 2024, and the actor reached a settlement with the city of Chicago in May.

Greg Abbott pushing through a new congressional map to benefit Republicans and California Gov. Gavin Newsom seeking to do the same for Democrats, Obama lent a weary world his wisdom.\n\n“Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he began in a Wednesday post on X.\n\n“But,” he stipulated.\n\nBut of course.\n\n“Since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Gov.

We’re neutralizing what occurred, and we’re giving the American people a fair chance,” Newsom declared before signing his plan into law on Thursday.\n\nJust how much more lopsided must it be for elections to be “fair” to “the American people,” by which Newsom means “the Democratic Party”?\n\nNow, it’s undeniable that Republicans have also drawn unrepresentative maps in states they control.\n\nWisconsin, Texas and the Carolinas are particularly damning examples.\n\nBut with both Team Red and Team Blue adopting no-holds-barred approaches to redistricting, honest observers must admit that gerrymandering is a bipartisan pastime in which all’s fair — even if it shouldn’t be.\n\nAnd that’s precisely what makes Obama’s claim to the moral high ground so galling.\n\nNewsom has every right to advance his undemocratic map; Obama has every right to support it.\n\nThey ought not insult our intelligence by flattering themselves, though.\n\nThey’re motivated by the same political objectives that Republicans are, not some nobler commitment to principle that excuses their actions — much less makes them deserving of praise.\n\nObama is the same ambitious, self-serving partisan he was back in 2001, when he personally helped draw an Illinois state Senate district to boost his political prospects after falling short in a House campaign the year prior.\n\nThe lines he created gave him new constituents in some of Chicago’s wealthiest neighborhoods — donors he tapped to fuel his ascent to the US Senate and, not long after, the White House. \n\nSo much for only reluctantly endorsing Newsom’s proposal to retaliate against Texas: Obama himself embraced the power of the gerrymander in a smoke-filled room decades ago.\n\nHis haughty tone now is perfectly representative of the Democrats’ collective hero complex.\n\nNot to mention their palpable disdain for the public, whom they believe can be duped into believing in it.\n\nIt adds insult to injury — and sanctimony to sin.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Barack Obama took blue California's side in the redistricting fight with Texas, but his own history with gerrymandering makes his claim to the moral high ground galling.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/22/opinion/hypocrite-obama-scorns-gerrymandering-unless-it-helps-him/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/OB121212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:09:36","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":353425994,"title":"CNN’s Harry Enten Explains Why Gavin Newsom’s Trump Feud Is Earning Him ‘A Rising Tide of Support’ | Video","text":"CNN’s Harry Enten explained how Gavin Newsom’s continued feud with Donald Trump is leading to “a rising tide of support” from voters, particularly California Democrats. \n\nThe network’s chief data analyst explained Friday how the California governor’s many prods and call-outs against the president have only led to his growing success in the polls.\n\n“I absolutely think it’s showing signs of working; and let’s take a look at the voters who know Gavin Newsom best — those voters out in California, those California Democrats,” Enten said. “California Democrats on Newsom for [president].

Now a Netflix Documentary Promises New Insights.","text":"Just when we thought we were finally done with the whirlwind saga of the alleged 2019 hate crime against Empire actor Jussie Smollett—“whirlwind,” of course, being a reference to the shocking twist that Smollett might have been lying about the whole thing—Netflix, in customary fashion, has come a knockin’. A new documentary, The Truth About Jussie Smollett?, which premiered on Friday, seeks to answer its own titular question once and for all. The documentary retells the erratic epic from two perspectives: that of those who maintain, like the Chicago courts decided, that Smollett definitely lied about being attacked by white men in the streets of Chicago, and those who have found so-called evidence that may prove the contrary. Below, I present to you a breakdown of the initial alleged hoax and all of the ways the new documentary is pushing against what we all thought we knew (or what we had forgotten because it was way too confusing to follow at the time).\n\nBefore we even begin to get into this new documentary, can you give me a brief rundown of the initial saga? It was so confusing!\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2019, Jussie Smollett—a Black, openly gay actor who had risen to popularity while on the hit Fox drama series Empire—filed a police report stating that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist hate crime while in downtown Chicago. He alleged that, as he was approaching his residence at around 2 a.m., two masked men, one of whom he said he believed to be white, had shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured “an unknown substance” (which Smollett can be seen identifying as bleach in police bodycam footage that was released much later) on him, and tied a noose around his neck. Upon follow-up questioning, Smollett additionally alleged that the assailants had made references to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Around this time, it was also revealed that the FBI was investigating a letter that had been sent to Fox’s offices in Chicago prior to the alleged attack. The letter was purportedly targeted at Smollett and contained an unidentified white powder. After news of the attack broke, Smollett received a large outpouring of support from fans and fellow notable figures, including Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who both condemned the reported act as an example of an attempted modern-day lynching.\n\nChicago PD began investigating the report as a “possible hate crime” but failed to find significant photo or video footage of the incident, despite the area having a plethora of surveillance cameras. Early skepticism began to emerge online as people questioned Smollett’s recounting of events and cast suspicion upon his initial refusal to submit his cellphone to authorities. (He eventually did submit redacted phone records.) Despite the early doubters, Smollett maintained in his first statement after the alleged attack that he had been cooperating with the authorities and remained “100 percent factual and consistent.” In a live performance staged the day after his statement, Smollett thanked his supporters before infamously, and inexplicably, stating, “I’m the gay Tupac.”\n\nOh, riiiiight. I do remember that—though I still don’t know what it means.\n\nNeither does anyone else. Still, the skepticism never fully subsided, especially not when the authorities detained two persons of interest: Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, brothers of Nigerian descent. It was soon revealed that Smollett personally knew at least Abimbola, who had been hired for a stint as Smollett’s personal trainer and, along with Olabinjo, had been an extra on Empire. The brothers reportedly told investigators that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack after feeling that the threatening letter sent to Fox hadn’t inspired enough alarm. Smollett’s lawyers acknowledged that Smollett knew at least one of the brothers via the aforementioned personal training services but denied the trainer’s involvement in a larger statement refuting Smollett’s own involvement overall, stating: “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”\n\nOn Feb. 20, Smollett was charged by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office with a felony disorderly conduct charge in relation to his filing a police report. Meanwhile, CBS News Chicago journalist Charlie De Mar had tracked down surveillance footage of the Osundairo brothers buying materials believed to be linked to the alleged assault. The following day, Smollett was officially arrested by Chicago PD, who alleged that the actor had orchestrated his own assault because he was hoping the notoriety would help boost his salary on Empire. The authorities claimed that Smollett had sent the aforementioned threatening letter to himself and that he had paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500—in the form of a check made out to Abimbola—to orchestrate the attack. (The check was reportedly labeled as being for a “five-week nutrition/workout” program in preparation for an upcoming music video Smollett was planning to shoot called “Don’t Go.”) On March 8, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts of disorderly conduct. Smollett pleaded not guilty. In a surprising turn that angered both the mayor and police department, on March 26, the prosecutors dropped all charges, not because they found Smollett innocent, but because Smollett had reached a deal to forfeit a $10,000 bond payment and perform some community service in exchange.\n\nYou said the prosecutors dropped the charges, but didn’t Smollett serve time?\n\nA full six days of it! But before we get to that, we need to talk about the civil suit. Following the dropping of the charges, Chicago police ordered Smollett to pay $130,000 to cover the cost of the police investigation (including overtime) into his report, but the actor refused. On April 12, 2019, the city of Chicago filed a civil suit against Smollett, which was met by Smollett with a countersuit. The civil suit was settled in May of this year, six years after the legal battle started, with Smollett agreeing to make a $50,000 donation to a Chicago-based nonprofit. (Separately but surely pointedly, Smollett also promised to make an additional $10,000 donation to the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which aids victims of abuse at the hands of Chicago law enforcement.)\n\nIn June 2019, the Chicago PD released the bodycam footage of the initial officers responding to the call. In it, Smollett is shown with the makeshift noose still around his neck, telling the officers that he kept it on because he wanted them “to see it.” This struck some following the case as an odd and unlikely choice for a Black man who has just been attacked, and would become a sticking point for Smollett’s disbelievers. In August 2019, a special prosecutor was assigned to independently investigate, at the behest of a Cook County Circuit Court judge, the initial charges against Smollett and the prosecutors’ eventual decision to drop those charges. After more than a full year of investigating, on Feb. 12, 2020, Smollett was eventually indicted again by a grand jury, this time with six counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to the police. The special prosecutor claimed that “sufficient factual evidence” was found supporting the notion that the state’s attorney’s office was wrong for dropping the charges. Smollett once again pleaded not guilty. The trial began over a year later in November 2021, and on Dec. 9, 2021, the jury found Smollett guilty of five of the six counts. Smollett was sentenced to 150 days of jail time, 30 months of probation, and ordered to pay $145,000 in a combination of fines and restitution to the Chicago PD. However, the actor only ended up serving six days of his sentence after his legal team launched an appeal. Notably, Smollett maintained his innocence throughout the entire ordeal.\n\nStill, on Nov. 21, 2024, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned Smollett’s conviction.\n\nWait, what?! What does that mean?\n\nIt is common for convictions to get overturned because of legalities, not necessarily because of a change in evidence or the jury’s verdict. Smollett’s lawyers worked on an appeal for years, arguing that their client shouldn’t have been charged again after the state’s attorney’s office dropped its charges in exchange for community service and a bond. Illinois judges agreed that, even if the special prosecutor decided that the prosecutors shouldn’t have dropped the charges, it doesn’t change the fact that they did drop those charges, making it unfair for the court to not honor that earlier agreement to resolve the matter without jail time.\n\nI feel caught up now, for better or for worse. Regardless, let’s move on to the new information in the Netflix documentary. I’m assuming it makes some sort of argument to exonerate Smollett? \n\nYes and no. The Truth About Jussie Smollett? presents two schools of thought when it comes to the actor. The documentary, directed by Gagan Rehill (best known for the Netflix doc Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal), begins primarily with talking-head interviews from two people formerly involved with the case: Melissa Staples, the former chief of detectives for the Chicago police, and Eddie Johnson, former superintendent of the Chicago police. Johnson casts doubt upon Smollett’s story with questions we’re already familiar with, like, for example, why would Smollett keep a noose around his neck? Or, why was Smollett so reluctant to hand over his phone? Additionally, if Smollett had been walking home from a Subway restaurant when he was allegedly attacked, then why was the Subway bag in his hand still in “pristine condition”? Furthermore, Staples walks the audience through the various methods that detectives used to firmly place the Osundairo brothers at the scene, from tracking down surveillance footage to subpoenaing taxi and ride-share records. Johnson brings up Smollett’s bombshell Good Morning America interview shortly after the purported attack, during which Smollett stated that the two figures caught on the surveillance cameras were definitely, without a doubt, his attackers. However, Smollett also maintained that the Osundairo brothers had nothing to do with it. The police’s stance is that those two figures were undoubtedly the Osundairo brothers. Johnson says that Smollett “inadvertently identified two guys to the whole country.”\n\nThe Osundairo brothers are also present in the doc to tell their side of the story, claiming that Smollett asked them to beat him up, with the end goal of posting the surveillance footage caught by his building’s security to social media.\n\nAnd what’s the evidence presented that suggests Smollett might have been telling the truth? \n\nSmollett counters some of the classic points of skepticism early on in the documentary. He alleges that he wasn’t sitting around with the rope around his neck, but that he had “put it back on because we wanted to show them what was happening.” Smollett also acknowledges that he didn’t want to hand over his phone to the police not only because of the sensitive information on it related to other notable figures, but also because “the large thing” that he didn’t want disclosed was his “drug use.” “I had to explain every single eccentricity of mine,” Smollett explains in the doc. “It was like playing whack-a-mole with rumors, with lies … but at a certain point it’s just too many” and “you can’t catch them all.” Smollett explains that he was making “great money,” and wasn’t dissatisfied with his pay (which is the police’s assumed motive). He further clarifies a text he sent to Abimbola, in which he wrote, “May need your help on the low,” by stating that he was referring to “an herbal steroid that was illegal here in the U.S. that could be gotten in Nigeria” and is used to “lose belly fat.”\n\nThe biggest focus of the documentary involves two more witnesses who corroborate Smollett’s side of the story: Anthony Moore, a security guard who was working at a nearby Sheraton hotel that evening, and Rebecca Bell, a neighbor of Smollett’s who was walking her dogs just over an hour before the attack was supposed to have taken place. Both Moore and Bell state that they saw white men in the area that evening. Bell explains that she saw a white man in the neighborhood with what looked to be “a little bit of rope” sticking out the back of his jacket around 12:45 a.m. Moore, who says he flashed his light in the face of one of the assailants near the time of the alleged attack, claims that, though the man was wearing a ski mask, he was clearly a white male. The security guard also notes that the police investigating the case only ever showed him a lineup of exclusively Black men.\n\nTwo figures feature heavily in the last third of the documentary, presenting potential evidence that they believe exonerates Smollett: Abigail Carr, a documentary producer, and Chelli Stanley, a freelance journalist. (Both are listed in this film’s credits as consultants.) Carr and Stanley cast enormous doubt upon the Chicago Police Department. Carr states that she did her own investigating and found that “there was no hard proof connecting the Osundairo brothers to the crime,” from eyewitnesses to forensics. For her part, Stanley says she looked into the law enforcement team handling the case and found that the 38 detectives and supervisors assigned to the case had “a combined 563 misconduct allegations formerly filed against them by the citizens of Chicago, ranging from criminal sexual misconduct to shooting people and selling drugs.” She also states that “one of the first people that showed up on the scene was accused in a formal complaint of homophobic hate speech against a Black man,” though it’s worth noting that Smollett has never mentioned any wrongdoing on the responding officers’ parts when they answered the call. Carr also casts doubt upon Johnson’s integrity by revealing that he was later fired for misconduct for lying and saying he was having a medical episode after officers found him asleep at the wheel in a parked police vehicle, when footage actually showed he had been drinking for a few hours beforehand.\n\nAdditionally, the documentary frames the saga within Chicago’s poor history with, as Stanley puts it, “tampering with” and “hiding” evidence. The doc uses the case of Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old boy whose murder at the hands of a Chicago police officer in 2014 was misrepresented as justified by law enforcement until video of the shooting, released to the public, disproved the preliminary internal police reports. Though the murder happened in 2014, it remained a hot-button issue nationally and within Chicago, pointing at a growing mistrust of local law enforcement at the time of Smollett’s incident. (The implicated officer in the McDonald case was sentenced in January 2019.) The documentary posits, via various talking-head interviews from journalists, that the Chicago Police Department, under a mountain of scrutiny at the time due to the McDonald case, “wanted a win.”\n\nWhile that may be culturally significant in terms of the climate at the time, it does feel a little weird that they use McDonald’s murder so heavily within this documentary about a celebrity who was found guilty by a jury of his peers for staging a fake hate crime. Do they present any other evidence? \n\nStanley and Carr discuss two further pieces of evidence that they believe prove Smollett was telling the truth. The first is a segment of surveillance footage, which appears to be visually brighter than the rest of the footage shown, and which Carr and Stanley claim shows white men at the scene. The second is a video of a conversation between Gloria Rodriguez, the Osundairos’ lawyer, and Olabinjo. In that conversation, Rodriguez is explaining to Olabinjo—who was already a convicted felon and was potentially in some hot water when firearms were discovered at his home during the raid—the difference between an expunged record and a sealed record, specifically telling him, an aspiring actor, that directors, agents, and the like can’t find sealed records. To Carr and Stanley, this conversation is proof that the Osundairos hammered out a deal with law enforcement to claim they were at the scene. However, Rodriguez states that Olabinjo’s record is neither expunged nor sealed, and explains that the police don’t have the authority to seal somebody’s record, making the assertion, in her words, “ridiculous.”\n\nThe documentary ends with Smollett maintaining that he didn’t fabricate a hate crime hoax. And, to cast further doubt, the production team shows the lighter-toned surveillance footage to some of the interviewees and asks them to describe what they see. Both Staples and Johnson say they see an unmasked Black man, both Carr and Stanley say they see a white man, Rodriguez says that she also sees a white man, and Moore says that he sees a Black man.\n\n… I still have so many questions.\n\nTotally. Smollett claims he never changed his story and, from what I can tell, this is true. However, there are many discrepancies that someone has to answer for. If the Osundairo brothers weren’t involved, what were they doing at the scene? If the argument is that they weren’t at the scene, how would the local police know to get a warrant to search their homes to get the so-called leverage of the firearms to then coerce them into giving a false statement? While the focus on the specific video footage in the documentary is interesting, what does it matter if Olabinjo’s documents are neither sealed nor expunged, and if the doc’s own interviewees can’t come to a consensus about the racial identity of the two men in the surveillance footage? Many questions falling on Smollett’s side still stand, too: Why would you hire two Black men to allege you were attacked by white men? All in all, The Truth About Jussie Smollett? seemingly leaves us with the same questions we’ve had for, at this point, more than half a decade—years’ worth of legal back-and-forth that already ended up in a guilty conviction. And that leaves us with just one question: Why make the documentary at all?","summary":"The whole confusing saga, plus the film The Truth About Jussie Smollett?’s new claims, explained.","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2025/08/the-truth-about-jussie-smollett-documentary-netflix-crime-attack-case-now.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/cd6ccc21-8a39-4441-a02c-df8d32e345df.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:53:38","author":"Nadira Goffe","authors":["Nadira Goffe"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":353409738,"title":"Chris Wallace, the son of a ‘60 Minutes’ legend, is now advising CBS’s new owner","text":"Veteran news anchor Chris Wallace, who is the son of 60 Minutes legend Mike Wallace and stepson of former CBS News president Bill Leonard, is now working for one of the investors of CBS’s new parent company and has repeatedly spoken with the network’s new owner.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Wallace revealed that he recently became a senior adviser for news and media investments at RedBird Capital Partners, one of the top investors of Skydance Media, the company that recently bought CBS parent Paramount in an $8 billion merger.\n\n“Mr. Wallace’s role is on the business side of the company, and he reports to Gerry Cardinale, the founder of RedBird,” the Times reported. “He said in an interview that any direct input for CBS News “is T.B.D.,” and that he was as likely to advise on strategy for RedBird’s other media interests, including The Daily Telegraph of London and the digital site Front Office Sports, as he was on, say, ‘60 Minutes.’”\n\nWallace’s new role comes months after he parted ways with CNN following the expiration of his contract. At the time of his departure from CNN, which was precipitated by CNN canceling his two shows and asking him to take a massive pay cut, the 77-year-old broadcaster suggested he would move to podcasting and independent journalism.\n\nInstead, as he told the Times, Wallace eventually decided that he was pretty much done with being in front of the camera and interviewing newsmakers. “I had spent literally half a century booking guests, researching guests and questioning guests, and it just didn’t hold any particular excitement for me,” Wallace said.\n\n“At this point, that isn’t something that’s in the cards,” he added when asked if he’d consider going back in front of the camera. “But having said that — and to mix a metaphor — who knows when an old fire horse wants to answer the bell?”\n\nPrior to his three-year run with CNN, Wallace had spent 18 years as the anchor of Fox News Sunday, where he also moderated two presidential debates. However, after decamping the conservative cable giant for CNN in late 2021, Wallace said Fox News’ hard-right opinion programming made it “unsustainable” for him to remain there. Prior to his time with Fox, Wallace served as the chief White House correspondent for NBC News.\n\nMeanwhile, with speculation swirling around the direction of CBS News under new Paramount chief David Ellison, especially following the politically strained merger process that saw Paramount pay Donald Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview, Wallace maintained that Ellison was a straight shooter.\n\n“I am absolutely convinced that any talk about the new owners wanting to move CBS News in a particular political direction is absolutely mistaken,” Wallace said, adding that Ellison “wants a news organization that lives up to the tradition of Cronkite and Murrow and my dad.”\n\nNotably, after the Paramount merger was officially completed earlier this month, Ellison’s first symbolic stop was to the CBS News offices in New York, where staffers told The Independent that he said “all the right things.”\n\nAt the same time, Wallace declined to talk about the Trump settlement or Paramount handling of 60 Minutes amid the furor over the Kamala Harris interview that sparked Trump’s lawsuit. Amid the previous Paramount leadership’s settlement negotiations with the president, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and the CBS News chief both resigned in protest, claiming their employment became untenable due to corporate interference.\n\nThough he wouldn’t speak about the circumstances surrounding the settlement, Wallace did offer a perspective to the Times when it came to oversight of the network’s flagship news magazine.\n\n“My stepfather, Bill Leonard, helped invent ‘60 Minutes,’ and of course my father was one of the first two anchors. In the early years, and in fact for years thereafter, it was routine that executives of CBS News would screen pieces and comment on them and expect their comments to be acted on,” he said. “I’ve been a little surprised at this notion that somehow ‘60 Minutes’ is an independent entity that isn’t part of CBS News.”\n\nFurthermore, Wallace stated that he has spoken directly to Ellison several times and told the company’s CEO that he wanted “to help him in any way I can.” Still, even as Wallace insists Ellison only has the news division’s best interests at heart, concerns continue to swirl within the network as Ellison has been in talks to purchase Bari Weiss’ “anti-woke” outlet The Free Press, and his father Larry is a well-known Trump ally and megadonor.\n\nIn fact, on Friday morning, Trump heaped praise on Ellison and seemingly indicated that he expected CBS News to give him favorable coverage moving forward.\n\n“I think the news is getting better. They‘re learning that they have no credibility,” Trump gushed. “CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well. A great man. He actually just bought CBS. And I think he‘s going to do the right thing with it.”\n\nEarlier this week, House Democrats sent Ellison a letter demanding documents and correspondence surrounding the Trump administration’s approval of the merger, stating that they were launching an investigation into whether anti-bribery laws were violated.\n\nIn particular, the ranking members of the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees are seeking answers to Trump’s boast that he reached a “side deal” with Ellison to air $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements on CBS as part of the lawsuit settlement, a claim that Ellison has yet to specifically address.\n\nThe lawmakers are also inquiring about Paramount’s decision to cancel the late-night show of outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert days before the merger was approved, as well as Skydance assuring the Federal Communications Commission that it will review “complaints of bias” at CBS News and eliminate all diversity, equity and inclusion policies after it took over Paramount.\n\n“Two wrongs do not make a right—illegitimate demands from the FCC or the Administration do not absolve your company from wrongdoing,” the Democrats' letter to Ellison stated.","summary":"‘I am absolutely convinced that any talk about the new owners wanting to move CBS News in a particular political direction is absolutely mistaken,’ Chris Wallace told The New York Times on Friday.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/chris-wallace-cbs-paramount-david-ellison-b2812687.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/15/21/GettyImages-615754664.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F95riPnZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:48:27","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":353413248,"title":"Head of Pentagon’s intelligence agency fired, officials say","text":"The head of the Pentagon’s intelligence agency has been fired, two U.S. officials told Reuters today, a move the top Democratic lawmaker on the Senate intelligence committee slammed as the latest example of politicizing intelligence by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, who led the Defense Intelligence Agency, was fired. But he is the latest senior military official to have been removed under U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe official, who confirmed Kruse’s removal on condition of anonymity, did not give a reason.\n\n“The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration’s dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country,” said U.S. Senator Mark Warner, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nThe firing was first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nLATEST FIRING\n\nThe move is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to penalize current and former military, intelligence and law enforcement officials whose views have been seen as at odds with Trump.\n\nIn April, Trump fired General Timothy Haugh as director of the National Security Agency, in a purge that included more than a dozen staff at the White House national security council.\n\nHegseth has also gone after uniformed military officials at the Pentagon. In February, he fired Air Force General C.Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was dismissed along with five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership.\n\nThe chief of the U.S. Air Force made a surprise announcement on Monday that he planned to retire only half way through his tenure.\n\nWhile it was not clear exactly why Kruse was fired, it comes after a preliminary DIA assessment leaked to the news media that said the June 22 U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities had set Tehran’s program back only a few months, a finding contradicting Trump’s claim that the targets were “obliterated.”\n\nThe leaking of the assessment, which Reuters also reported, enraged Trump. The White House denounced the top-secret assessment as “flat out wrong,” and Trump attacked CNN, the New York Times and other outlets that obtained the report, calling them “scum” and “FAKE NEWS.”\n\nThe Trump administration has conducted a sweeping purge of U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats that it says is part of an effort to slash the size of the U.S. government, shrinking the federal budget and punishing what it describes as the “politicization or weaponization” of intelligence.\n\nNews of Kruse’s firing came two days after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced that she was revoking on Trump’s orders the security clearances of 37 current and former U.S. intelligence professionals.\n\nThis week’s security clearance revocations were only the latest of scores of such revocations of Trump’s second term. They have included Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election, and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost last year’s vote.\n\nEarlier this week Gabbard also announced the first major overhaul of her office since its creation, slashing personnel by more than 40% by October 1 and saving more than $700 million per year.","summary":"The head of the Pentagon&#8217;s intelligence agency has been fired, two U.S. officials told Reuters today, a move the top Democratic lawmaker on the Senate intelligence committee slammed as the latest example of politicizing intelligence by President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/22/breaking-news/head-of-pentagons-intelligence-agency-fired-officials-say/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/web1_2025-08-22T192333Z_612487536_RC2WKDA9BHTQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MILITARY-INTELLIGENCE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:10:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":353447310,"title":"Ex-Vice President Kamala Harris is bringing her book tour to Philly","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is stopping in Philadelphia next month on her 15-city tour to promote her upcoming book \"107 Days.\" \n\nHarris will speak at the Met Philadelphia on Sept. 25 — two days after the book's release.

In the book, Harris dives into her experience running for president in 2024 and what she believes is the best way forward for the United States following her loss to Donald Trump last fall. \n\nThe book's title is derived from the 107 days between July 21, 2024, when former President Joe Biden announced he was ending his presidential campaign, and Nov. 5, 2024 — Election Day. Its description notes that her Secret Service code name was pioneer, a nod to her being the first woman to serve as vice president. \n\n\"Writing 107 Days felt like living the campaign in reverse — rewinding each moment and experiencing it all over again,\" Harris wrote in a social media post when she announced the book last month. \"Behind every speech I gave, hand I shook, and story I told on the road, there were deeper layers, quiet reflections, and lessons learned. This book is not a recap of our race. It is a candid and personal account of my journey — the shortest presidential campaign in modern history.\"\n\nPennsylvania was a battleground state during the election — together, Harris and Trump spent more than $500 million on advertisements and made more than 50 stops in the state, including several in Philadelphia.

I just actually wanted to piss people off,\" she added.At 29, Debono has carved out her own niche within the MAGA movement as an outspoken conservative living in a deep-blue city. Debono wields a growing social media following, fresh off her split in May from Date Right Stuff—the conservative dating app launched in 2022 by former Trump aide John McEntee. She told Newsweek that her politics have often felt \"all over the place,\" never fully at home with the new right, but also definitely not among liberals, either.She draws fire from both ends of the spectrum, sparring with \"tradwives\" and other hardline conservative women who call out her for being single, not particularly religious and, in their critique, too weak on transgender issues. Debono said she felt out of place when she went to a conference hosted by Turning Point USA, the nonprofit run by MAGA firebrand Charlie Kirk that has become something of a gathering place for young right-wingers.\"I was actually terrified,\" she recalled. \"I genuinely don't belong here.\"Debono said she's also been targeted by the left. \" Like everyone thinks like, oh, she's being racist, bigot, homophobic. I don't know what you people are talking about. I just wanna say what I want, when I want, I wanna pay less taxes. I wanna spend more money on the things that I want to spend more money on. It's just not that serious,\" she told Newsweek.\"I see crazy people on all sides and I think they all need to chill.\"An admirer of President Trump, whom she calls her \"favorite stand-up comedian,\" Debono believes that politics shouldn't be treated so seriously by either side.\"Everything is just like a bit to me,\" she said with a laugh.Dating as a NYC ConservativeAs the era of so-called \"closeted conservatism\" recedes in Trump's second term, New York City's right-leaning singles are taking advantage of a dating pool that belies the city's reputation as being hostile for young Republicans. With tickets going for $44 apiece, more than 70 people turned out for Thursday's party—some in \"Dark MAGA\" caps, others in denim fits or decked out in post-work business casual, and one donning a red, white, and blue Hawaiian shirt emblazoned with Trump's face.Several attendees told Newsweek that parties like this feel easier, offering a space where they're no longer \"walking on eggshells\" or pressured to \"self-censor.\" Even still, most of the partygoers asked to remain anonymous or off the record, with some citing a general distrust of the media.While politics flickered in the background—both in conversation, from jokes about the Sweeney campaign, and physically, courtesy of the harsh light coming from the Fox News cameras trawling the space for a segment — many revelers told Newsweek the real draw wasn't policy talk at all, but the relief of knowing everyone was starting from similar, shared values.Jack Wells, 30, told Newsweek from the rooftop overlooking Manhattan that dating has shifted noticeably under the new administration, with politics surfacing earlier in conversation and carrying more weight than before.Those with right-leaning political beliefs are \"more upfront than they used to be,\" he said, even as dating apps have created a new de facto filter for those who see a potential mate's opposing views as a \"dealbreaker.\" He recalled receiving an automated prompt from some matches that read, simply: \"Unmatch if you're conservative.\"Many in the group voiced fatigue with the dating app scene — a sentiment not at all exclusive to conservatives. Some cited bad matches and dull first dates, and said they're turning back to the age-old strategy of actually meeting people in person. If they can chat and flirt over shared politics, all the better.One woman Newsweek spoke to said she identifies as \"moderate\" on the dating apps, echoing a similar refrain throughout the night that \"city conservatives\" tend to be far less socially conservative than, say, Texas Republicans or the MAGA firebreathers who populate social media discourse. She noted that calling herself \"moderate\" can complicate the prospect of dating liberal men, explaining that while she's open to them, they often fail to reciprocate.Another partygoer, a 29-year-old Manhattan man who asked not to be named, said a past relationship with a liberal woman had soured him on pursuing relationships with women on the left. He recalled feeling unable to \"really fully be myself,\" often worrying that \"I would be judged.\"Debono echoed this sentiment earlier, telling Newsweek that after dating a liberal, she's now more convinced she needs a conservative partner.\"I can't,\" she said. \"Like, I've received a lecture—you make the wrong joke and suddenly it's Islamophobic, homophobic, and racist all in the same sentence. And it's just like, I can't do this.\"Liberals have become \"the party of the hall monitors,\" she said. \"They're always policing your speech.\"Two other attendees, Polish podcasters Tom Winiarski and Mikołaj Teperek, said they don't necessarily rule out dating liberals, but bemoaned the prospect of \"self-censorship.\" Self-avowed communists, though, are a \"red flag.\"The Warsaw-based duo partially timed their U.S. trip around the \"Good Genes\" party, making up for missing the infamous Make America Hot Again inauguration bash in Washington D.C. that was featured in a much-discussed New York magazine cover story. Teperek framed a copy of the issue, which dubbed the soiree, \"The Cruel Kids' Table.\"Despite the MAGA overlay, not everyone at the party was a Trump supporter. Two attendees told Newsweek they had backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, including Mo, a 27-year-old Iraqi immigrant living in New Jersey.Mo said he couldn't originally get behind Trump's tariff agenda and foreign policy, which he described as \"drunken kung fu\"—mimicking someone swinging wildly—though, he admitted, it has \"somehow landed okay.\"Asked why he came to a dating event marketed toward conservatives, he said it was a no-brainer. He is looking for a partner with an open mind, and hasn't found that among the liberal women he has dated.Another male attendee, a 33-year-old tech founder from D.C., identified himself as a liberal, a term he believes has been \"corrupted.\" His reason for attending the party also had little to do with politics. Conservative women are just better looking, he said.While many arrived hoping for romantic sparks, the night yielded more mingling than matches — though Debono said she was aware of a bunch of dates that have come out of her parties.Unlike the inauguration bash, there was no merchandise, monogrammed \"Make America Hot Again\" swag, or Trump paraphernalia scattered around the bar. To the extent the party was branded at all, it came by way of the online invitation, where the description played off the American Eagle campaign: \"They say good jeans never go out of style...But some things run even deeper. Like tradition. Discipline. And the innate ability to spot a liberal from fifty feet away. Conservatives have good genes. And we're throwing a party to prove it.\"Debono said Thursday's gathering marked her eighth Make America Hot Again party, with earlier editions co-hosted with Date Right Stuff and The Murray Hill Guy, a popular anonymous X account. The Canadian-born organizer said the mixers will go on, but she's already thinking about her next venture.\"My next thing is actually going to be Make America Funny Again,\" she said with a smile.","summary":"Dozens of New York City conservatives gathered for a \"Good Genes\" party, nodding to Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle campaign.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/denim-dating-conservatism-inside-make-america-hot-again-party-2117945","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708322/make-america-hot-again.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4f5b4b22fdc4bd2d73e90c2e40078c3b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 20:50:30","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.009},{"id":353395976,"title":"Gavin Newsom's 2028 Chances Jump After Trolling Offensive Against Trump","text":"The odds-on Gavin Newsom winning the 2028 presidential election have improved from 7/1 (12.5 percent) to 11/2 (15.4 percent) over the past week according to Star Sports, a leading bookmaker, as the California governor continues to troll President Donald Trump on social media.Newsweek contacted Governor Newsom for comment via email on Friday outside of regular office hours.Why It MattersNewsom has been widely tipped as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, with a recent Politico and Citrin Center poll finding he is the favored candidate of California Democrats, leading former Vice-President Kamala Harris by 25 percentage points to 19 percent.What To KnowOn Thursday Star Sports offered odds of Newsom winning the 2028 presidential election was 11/2 (15.4 percent), a noted improvement on the 7/1 (12.5 percent) recorded one week previously.Overall the California governor is now the second favorite to win in 2028 according to Star Sports, behind only Vice-President J.D. Vance on 11/4 (26.7 percent) and ahead of House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in third with 12/1 (7.7 percent).President Trump is the fourth favorite to win in 2028 on 16/1 (5.9 percent), a possibility he has toyed with, though it would mean abolishing the two-term limit set out in the 22nd Amendment.He is followed in the Star Sports odds by former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg on 18/1 (5.3 percent) and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro with 22/1 (4.3 percent).Newsom is also the favorite to be the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee, according to Star Sports, with odds of 5/2 (28.6 percent). This puts him ahead of Ocasio-Cortez on 5/1 (16.7 percent), Buttigieg with 15/2 (11.8 percent) and Shapiro on 11/1 (8.3 percent).Overall, Star Sports is offering odds of 10/11 (52.4 percent) on a Democrat winning the 2028 presidential election, compared to 21/20 (48.8 percent) for a Republican and 16/1 for any other party (5.9 percent).In recent weeks, Governor Newsom has attracted national media attention for backing a redistricting bill that would likely see the Republicans lose five seats in the House of Representatives. The move is a response to a Trump-backed Texas bill that could give the GOP five extra House seats from the Lone Star State. The California bill is designed to take effect only if the Texas one is ratified.The official Newsom press office X account has also taken to mimicking and mocking Donald Trump's style, posting in block capitals and using nicknames for opponents such as 'Just Dance Vance' for Vice-President J.D. Vance. Trump had repeatedly called Newsom \"Newscum\" on his Truth Social website.What People Are SayingSpeaking to Newsweek, Star Sports political betting analyst William Kedjanyi said: \"Gavin Newsom has always been a well-recognized figure in American politics but recently he's asserted himself as a leader of the resistance against President Donald Trump, especially with regards to more combative communications and taking Trump head on and getting under his skin. He's now 5/2 from 7/2 to be declared the Democratic Presidential Nominee in 2028...\"Interestingly the latest Politico poll from California had Newsom leading Harris with Democratic and left-leaning voters in the state. With his increased profile and increased recognition, we've cut Newsom from 7/1 into 11/2. The Democrats are also 10/11 to be the winning party, with the Republicans within reaching distance at 21/20.\"What Happens NextThe next Democratic Presidential primary contest is expected to begin in early 2028, followed by the presidential election against the Republican nominee in November.","summary":"Gavin Newsom's press office has been mocking President Trump with tweets in his style over the past few weeks.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsoms-2028-chances-jump-after-trolling-offensive-against-trump-2118007","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708284/gavin-newsom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a1ed0d4e2ac0efa5f27b136aaa5b734e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 20:40:44","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.028},{"id":353473358,"title":"Trump’s Distortions on Cashless Bail","text":"Since announcing the temporary federal takeover of Washington, D.C.’s, law enforcement, President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized state laws limiting the use of cash bail. But his arguments have strayed from the facts in three key areas:\n\nTrump claimed that “every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster.” But the balance of crime data doesn’t support the idea that crime has worsened as a result of the policies.\n\nThe president misleadingly claimed that under cashless bail policies, “Somebody murders somebody and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.” Some states that require cashless bail have exemptions for violent felonies and murder. And in the states where it is possible for a murder suspect to be freed pending trial without cash bail, per a judge’s discretion, it is exceedingly rare.\n\nTrump said, “We’re going to end that in Chicago,” via federal legislation. But it is unclear whether the U.S. Congress can pass a law to directly nullify state bail laws.\n\nNumerous states and cities have passed laws limiting the use of cash bail, though each is a little different. Some states with cashless bail policies still allow cash bail for violent felonies and murder, such as New York. Most include some sort of risk assessment to determine whether someone can be held in jail pending trial.\n\nThe move in some states toward cashless bail was prompted by those who argued cash bail unfairly punishes those who can’t afford to pay it, leaving them to await trial in jail. Opponents have criticized the laws as soft-on-crime policy that worsens crime.\n\nTrump, who has long railed against so-called cashless bail, raised the issue in his Aug. 11 press conference announcing the temporary federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington, D.C, which includes an infusion of National Guard and other federal law enforcement in the nation’s capital.\n\n“The radical left City Council [in Washington] adopted no cash bail,” Trump said. “By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster. That’s what started the problem in New York, and they don’t change it. … That’s what started it in Chicago. I mean, bad politicians started it, bad leadership started it. But that was the one thing that’s central, no cash bail.”\n\n“Somebody murders somebody and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out,” Trump claimed. \n\nTrump then vowed he would overturn these local and state bail laws via federal legislation.\n\n“We’re going to end that in Chicago,” Trump said. “But we’re going to change no cash bail. We’re going to change the statute and get rid of some of the other things and we’ll count on the Republicans in Congress and Senate to vote. We have the majority, so we’ll vote.”\n\nCrime Stats After Bail Changes\n\nAlthough Trump claimed that “every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster,” crime statistics overall don’t support that.\n\nTrump specifically mentioned the policies in New York and Chicago as having “started the [crime] problem” in those areas.\n\nThe Illinois Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equality-Today Act — better known as the SAFE-T Act — was signed into law in 2021. One part of the law, known as the Pretrial Fairness Act, eliminated cash bail for all offenses. It went into effect in September 2023. However, the act still allowed judges to detain a person who is considered a flight risk or who poses a threat to “any other person or the community.” A judge could also detain someone because of the nature of the crime.\n\nOverall, year-to-date crime from January to August 2025 dropped 15% compared with the same period in 2023, which was before the law went into effect, according to Chicago Police Department data. Murder is down 37%; robbery is down 36%; aggravated battery is down 5%, and burglary is down 18%.\n\nIn September 2024, Loyola University of Chicago’s Center for Criminal Justice published a report comparing the first six months of 2023 with the first six months of 2024 (after the new law went into effect). It found that violent crimes decreased by 7% and property crimes by 14%.\n\n“This does not answer the question of the PFA’s [Pretrial Fairness Act’s] impact, if any, on crime and public safety,” the report states. “It’s possible, for example, that crime would have declined further in the absence of the PFA. But it does confirm the unanimous sense of the Illinois practitioners we interviewed, that (as several of them put it) ‘the sky did not fall’ when the PFA went into effect.”\n\nAs for New York, its bail laws have been revised several times since the state Legislature created a 2019 law that eliminated the use of money bail and jail before trial for most misdemeanors and lower-level felonies. When crime began to rise in 2020 during the pandemic — as it did around the country in cities regardless of bail policies — lawmakers made several revisions to the law, allowing judges the discretion to set cash bail even in some cases involving lower-level offenses. However, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, there was “no evidence showing a connection between bail reform and rising crime rates.”\n\nA study put out by John Jay College of Criminal Justice in October 2023 examined the effect of eliminating bail in New York City and concluded, “Eliminating the option to set bail under the reform was not associated with a change in overall re-arrest, felony re-arrest, or violent felony re-arrest rates within either 2 years or during the pretrial period.” The study did find a “statistically significant” increase in violent felony re-arrests in the pretrial period among “‘high risk’ individuals with a separate pending case at the time of arraignment.” According to the authors, their findings were “broadly consistent” with two earlier studies that “found no impact of bail reform on crime rates within New York City or statewide.”\n\nAccording to New York City Criminal Justice Agency data, between January and May of this year, about 5% of those released pending trial were rearrested. Most of those rearrests were for misdemeanor offenses, but about 1% of those awaiting trial were rearrested for nonviolent felonies and less than 1% for violent felonies.\n\nA 2022 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights included an analysis of crime trends in Washington, D.C., between 2015 and 2019 and concluded the city’s system, as set by the 1992 D.C. Bail Reform Act, “has been successful in releasing defendants pretrial without sacrificing public safety and maintaining high court appearance rates.”\n\n“Throughout each of these years, between 88 and 91 percent of individuals released pretrial appeared at their court dates,” the report states. “Further, between 86 and 89 percent of individuals who were released pretrial were not re-arrested during this period, and between 98 percent and 99 percent of defendants released pretrial were not re-arrested during the pretrial period for a violent crime.” \n\nResearch by Jaquelyn L. Jahn at Drexel University and Jessica T. Simes and Jonathan Jay at Boston University published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2024 focused on the bail laws in New Jersey and concluded that gun violence did not increase or significantly change despite substantial declines to jail incarceration under its new policies, and even as national rates of gun violence increased during its study years.\n\nThat’s true in other places that have moved away from cash bail as well. The Brennan Center for Justice evaluated crime trends in 22 cities across the country that enacted some form of bail policies aimed at reducing cash bail and compared them with cities that did not. The 2024 report found “no statistically significant relationship between bail reform and crime rates. In other words, there is no reason to believe that bail reform has led to increased crime.”\n\n“These findings add to a growing body of literature showing that bail reform is an unlikely explanation for recent trends in crime, whether increases or decreases,” the Brennan report stated. “And they suggest that policymakers’ recent focus on weakening bail reforms as a response to crime has been misguided — and a distraction from smarter and more promising ways to enhance public safety.” Among those alternatives, the report said, are expanding access to mental health and substance abuse treatment programs.\n\nThe Trump Administration’s Case\n\nA White House official, who reiterated Trump’s claim that “cashless bail is a disastrous policy that makes cities across the country significantly more dangerous,” cited research from Yolo County, California, where the district attorney spearheaded a 2022 analysis of the local effect of an emergency state pandemic policy adopted in April 2020, setting bail at “$0” for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies — with some exceptions.\n\nAccording to the analysis, 70% of the people released from custody under the emergency guidelines were rearrested, and about half of those released were rearrested more than once. Rearrest charges included one for homicide, five for attempted homicide, 32 for robbery and 46 for assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe following year, the district attorney released a follow-up study that compared a random sample of people released as part of the emergency pandemic policy with a sample of people released with bail prior to the pandemic, and concluded that those released as part of the pandemic policy were far more likely to have been rearrested.\n\nNotably, however, the California zero bail policy differed from most modified bail policies in other states in that it did not include mandatory risk assessments prior to release. It was simply aimed at trying to relieve the spread of COVID-19 in jails and courts by reducing the number of defendants awaiting trial in jail.\n\n“The whole point of this study is not to debate the merits of some type of bail reform. It’s to look at the issue of zero bail where people are being automatically released,” Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig, who initiated the study, told CBS News in January.\n\nThe emergency policy resulted in the release of suspects by jailers, without judges considering things like criminal history or repeated offenses, Reisig said. Reisig told CBS News the study suggests judges should be deciding who gets released without bail.\n\n“I’m convinced, based on the data, that judges would have held people on bail,” Reisig said.\n\n“I actually do support smart bail reform,” Reisig said. “One-hundred percent. Zero-dollar bail is not smart bail reform, and it’s resulted in people being killed. That’s what the data shows. Now, let’s have some robust discussions about what, if anything, we do to fix the bail system.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Public Policy Institute of California did an analysis of the statewide effect of the state’s emergency zero-dollar bail policy and found that “during the early disruptive months of the COVID pandemic, implementation of emergency bail orders caused notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days.”\n\nWhile most of the rearrests were for felonies, there was no evidence of an increase in violent felonies, the report stated.\n\n“Lower-level offenders released on zero bail were not more likely to be rearrested for violent felonies after implementation,” the report said. “About four months after implementation, as the most volatile period of the pandemic passed, the overall effect on rearrests began to wane, at least for the 27 counties that continued emergency orders through 2020. After a year, the average effect of implementation was no longer statistically significant.”\n\nMoreover, the study found that over time as counties revoked the emergency bail orders — which took place from June 2020 to July 2023 — it “did not affect rearrests, regardless of offense type.”\n\n“The disruptive nature of the pandemic was likely a key factor in the temporary increase in overall rearrests when emergency bail orders were in place,” the report’s authors wrote. “Notably, increases in felony rearrests did not subside over time or when emergency orders were revoked.” (Emphasis theirs.)\n\nMurderers Not Immediately Set Free\n\nIn his press conference on Aug. 11, Trump said that under the policies, “Somebody murders somebody and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.” In remarks on Aug. 13, Trump again lambasted “cashless bail,” calling it “nonsense,” and said, “We want to make it so that people, if they murder somebody, they’re in jail, they don’t get out on no bail.”\n\nThe laws differ, but some states recommend no release for those charged with violent felonies and murders. That’s the case in New Jersey and New York, for example.\n\nBut even in states that don’t stipulate such restrictions, judges still have the discretion to deny release to defendants who are deemed a risk, including those charged with murder.\n\n“In Illinois, every case has the discretion of the judge on whether or not to release the accused,” David Stovall, a faculty member in the Department of Criminology, Law and Justice at the University of Illinois Chicago, told us via email. “Currently no one accused of murder (capital murder nor homicide) has been released to the public. It’s a misconception that’s rampant unfortunately.”\n\nBut there was one case. As the White House noted, in 2024 a Rockford, Illinois, judge released from jail a man accused of first-degree murder pending his trial.\n\n“I’ve considered the arguments of counsel, the evidence that’s been presented, the proffers, the pretrial service report, risk assessments, and the defendant’s criminal history. I have a lot of concerns about this,” Winnebago County Judge Debra Schafer said at the time. “It is a circumstantial link. There are no allegations that [defendant] made any statements relating to this. There are some veiled statements by codefendant pointing fingers in the direction of [defendant].”\n\nThe judge said that while there was probable cause to move the case forward, “I can’t find at this time that there’s clear and convincing evidence” to detain him without bail “and consequently I have to release him. That is as a result of this offense and what I’m being held to [with the new bail law].” The judge added, however, that the defendant was “going to have to follow some fairly strict requirements.” \n\nWe couldn’t find any other examples of defendants facing murder charges being released without bail in any of the handful of states that have enacted some form of cashless bail.\n\n“People charged with murder can certainly be released pending trial,” Adam Gelb, president and CEO of the Council on Criminal Justice, told us via email. “While it might be rare, it is legally possible as pretrial release is supposed to be based on public safety risk and risk of flight/failure to appear for trial. That assessment is made by the judge/magistrate and no bail reform, to our knowledge, mandated release for people charged with murder.”\n\nThe White House pointed to two convicted murderers who were released without bail in New York after being arrested on drug dealing charges. But both of those cases involved men who were previously convicted of murder and served lengthy prison sentences. They were both arrested on drug charges after they had been released from prison. Whether or not it was appropriate or prudent to release either of those men without bail, neither case involved a person facing a murder charge being released without money bail — the scenario Trump described.\n\nTrump has long railed against “no cash bail,” often wrongly claiming it means that accused murderers are immediately let go pending trial.\n\nIn 2024, Trump claimed his opponent, then Vice President Kamala Harris, “supports abolishing cash bail, which means bloodthirsty criminals that just killed somebody can immediately leave custody, go out and kill somebody else, which, by the way, they often do.”\n\nAs we wrote at the time, that’s not how it works.\n\n“It depends on what cash bail is replaced with,” Kellen Funk, a legal historian and law professor at Columbia Law School, told us in an email for that story. “No serious commentator or politician has proposed eliminating cash bail and replacing it only with automatic release.”\n\nFunk said proposals often “replace cash bail with judicial discretion,” which gives judges the option to detain defendants until trial, release them with “nonfinancial conditions” such as drug testing and a curfew, or release them without conditions except a requirement to appear in court.\n\nFor “felony homicide,” he said, “the law might recommend detention or set a presumption in favor of it, and in most cases in practice judges are inclined to order detention when the charges involve violent felonies.”\n\nChanging the Laws\n\nIn remarks on Aug. 13, Trump said he would start by trying to change the bail laws in Washington, D.C., “and then ultimately for the rest of the country.” \n\nAfter the president made his announcement about the temporary takeover of Washington, D.C., law enforcement, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said his committee is “advancing legislative solutions to protect Americans in their capital city” and planned to hold hearings with local officials in September.\n\nIn his press conference on Aug. 11, Trump said, “We’re going to end that in Chicago,” referring to the state’s no cash bail law. He said he would “count on the Republicans in Congress and Senate to vote. We have the majority, so we’ll vote.”\n\nImmediately after he made his comments, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik vowed that she “will be leading legislation to end [New York Gov.] Kathy Hochul and New York’s failed bail reform once and for all to Save New York and Save America.”\n\nBut while the U.S. Congress has the authority to overturn or modify laws passed by the Washington, D.C., government, that’s less clear when it comes to a federal law overriding state bail laws.\n\nTrump’s call for Congress to ban cashless bail policies around the country “oversteps constitutional boundaries,” Lisel Petis, policy director of criminal justice and civil liberties for the think tank R Street Institute, wrote in a commentary after Trump’s Aug. 11 press conference.\n\n“The Constitution is pretty clear on this one,” Petis wrote. “The Tenth Amendment says that any powers not given to the federal government belong to the states or the people. That includes the power to decide how to handle bail. Congress has no general authority to dictate how states set their bail laws. Bail policy falls under a state’s police powers—the authority to set laws and procedures that protect public safety and maintain order. These are core functions of state sovereignty.”\n\nHowever, Congress could opt instead for a carrot-and-stick approach to discourage cashless bail policies by tying such policies to a state’s eligibility for federal grants. That’s what some Democrats tried in 2021 when they proposed a bill that would have made “a state that uses a money bail system ineligible for funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.”\n\n“There is so much federal money going into states,” Meryl Chertoff, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law School, told Time, “and what the President has done is say, if you don’t cooperate with me on, let’s say, sanctuary city policies or immigration enforcement, I am going to withhold money that goes into your programs.”\n\nTying law enforcement priorities to eligibility for federal funding, Chertoff said, is “doing indirectly what he [Trump] cannot under the 10th Amendment, which provides states with a degree of autonomy.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

While we know this is undoubtedly a great loss for Missouri, it is a tremendous gain for America.”\n\nBailey said of his appointment: “My life has been defined by a call to service, and I am once again answering that call, this time, at the national level.” \n\nHere are five things to know about Bailey’s time as attorney general:\n\nProtecting Kids From Gender Ideology\n\nBailey won a lawsuit in April to compel Planned Parenthood to produce documents related to the “gender transition” of minors in Missouri.\n\n“This case is not just about documents—it’s about exposing institutions that mislead families, conceal critical information, and prey on vulnerable children under the guise of ‘care,'” Bailey said in a statement at the time. “My office is committed to uncovering the truth, holding bad actors accountable, and cutting through the noise and deception used to normalize irreversible procedures on minors.”\n\nBailey started investigating the use of “transgender” hormones, puberty blockers, and surgeries for minors in the state in March 2023 after a former caseworker at the Washington University Transgender Center said the center rushed children into treatment.\n\nBailey’s office sent civil investigative demands to Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Washington University in St. Louis, and the state’s two branches of Planned Parenthood.\n\nProtecting the Unborn\n\nIn January 2023, abortion activists filed suit seeking to dismantle Missouri’s pro-life law, which protects life starting at conception.\n\nBailey responded by filing a motion to dismiss the legal challenge. \n\nIn June 2023, the St. Louis Circuit Court dismissed 10 of the 11 challenges brought by the activists. The following October, the court dismissed the 11th count and granted Bailey’s motion to dismiss. \n\n“Today marks a significant triumph for women and their unborn children as a Missouri court has once again sided with our office in our endeavors to uphold the sanctity of life,” Bailey said at the time.\n\nThis July, Bailey filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood for allegedly deceiving women about the safety and efficacy of the abortion pill. The petition seeks more than $1.8 million in civil penalties for daily violations of Missouri law and up to $1,000 in damages or restitution for every Missouri woman Planned Parenthood provided abortion pills to in the past five years.\n\nSecuring the Border\n\nIn November 2024, Bailey and 16 other state attorneys general obtained a court order throwing out the Biden-Harris administration’s “parole in place” rule that allowed millions of illegal immigrants to obtain permanent residency in the U.S.\n\n“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris created a crisis at the southern border, leaving the American people to pay the consequences. In the wake of the federal government’s refusal to act, states like Missouri had no choice but to step in and take action to secure our southern border,” Bailey said at the time. \n\nThe “parole in place” program would have allowed aliens who had been unlawfully present in the United States for 10 or more years to receive a grant of “parole.” Aliens married to a citizen or the stepchild of a citizen would not have been required to leave the country.\n\nBailey also filed a lawsuit in July 2024 against the Biden administration for reportedly flying illegal aliens to the Show Me State to try to settle them there.\n\nHolding China Accountable\n\nThis March, Bailey won a $24 billion judgment in federal court against the Chinese Communist Party for “unleashing the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\n“This is a landmark victory for Missouri and the United States in the fight to hold China accountable for unleashing COVID-19 on the world,” Bailey said. “China refused to show up to court, but that doesn’t mean they get away with causing untold suffering and economic devastation. We intend to collect every penny by seizing Chinese-owned assets, including Missouri farmland.”\n\nThe federal court ruled that Missouri “has established this claim of damages through evidence satisfactory to the court,” proving that China caused and exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBailey announced Missouri would collect the $24 billion judgment and, if necessary, work with the Trump administration to identify and seize Chinese-owned assets in the state.\n\nDeregulating Energy\n\nIn 2023, Bailey successfully blocked the Biden administration’s attempt to impose regulations that he said would increase the price of energy for Missourians.\n\nThe order prevented the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing the regulations during the appeals process.\n\n“We have secured a court order BLOCKING the Biden administration’s mandate that forces businesses to track and report greenhouse gas emissions,” Bailey said on X at the time. “This mandate would’ve cost Missouri businesses millions of dollars per year.”","summary":"President Donald Trump announced this week that Missouri&#8217;s Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, will join Dan Bongino as co-deputy director of the FBI. “He has...

I mean, if you held up a romance novel and a Stephen King book, I think I'd know which one I'd rather read without turning a page. But while you can't always tell someone's politics based on how they look, I think it's fair to say that you can at least get a pretty good idea of where they stand based on how they talk. Pack your bags, football fans! OutKick is sending one lucky winner and a friend to Athens for Georgia vs. Alabama. Travel’s on us, VIP tickets in hand, and bragging rights for life. Enter Now! I know that when I talk to people, I'm always pleasant, but I do tune out a little if words like \"privilege\" or \"patriarchy\" start getting tossed around, or if they start going on about an \"existential threat\" to anything. Democracy, climate, Hooters… alright, so maybe I start listening a little for that last one. We all know the Democrats' biggest problem is a lack of sound policies, and the ones they have are straight-up Looney Tunes. Actually, that's an insult to the fine work of the Looney Tunes. I'm not sure any undecided voter sees policies that lead to more crime and dudes spiking volleyballs in girls' faces and thinks, \"That. Give me that.\" But as big a problem as the policies is the way the Dems talk about them, and now — nearly a year after a sound tub-thumping in the 2024 Election, the likes of which haven't been seen since the days of Chumbawamba — one think-tank has decided to tell leftists that it's time to rein it in. Think Tank Says It's Time To Stop Using Everyone's Least Favorite Woke Words A new memo from Third Way — a self-described center-left — think tank is advising Democrats to stop using some of their favorite words because, news flash, they're driving normal folks away from the party. It's kind of a long list (which in itself should have been a red flag), but I pulled a few of the greatest hits that they're only now realizing people hate… after years of people saying how much they hate these words. Some words they advise reeling in — dubbed \"Therapy Speak\" — send a message of \"I’m more empathetic than you, and you are callous to hurting other’s feelings,\" according to Third Way. These include leftist hallmarks like \"privilege,\" \"triggering,\" \"safe space,\" \"microaggression,\" and \"body shaming.\" Then you've got \"Seminar Room Language,\" like \"subverting norms, \"systems of oppression,\" \"critical theory,\" and \"cultural appropriation.\" Third Way said these are meant to make the speaker sound smart while making kitchen table issues sound trivial. Other words that they say need to be benched include nonsensical progressive favorites like \"the unhorsed,\" \"food insecurity,\" \"person who immigrated,\" \"chest feeding,\" \"cisgender, \"deadnaming,\" and, the one that I think made more people check out of the left-wing agenda more than any other: \"pregnant person.\" They're even saying to chillax with saying \"LGBTQIA+.\" I mean, your douchey woke friends might have to start resorting to speaking with grunts and hand signals after their vocabulary takes a beating like this. Democrats Still Don’t Get Why They’re Losing Credit to Third Way for calling this nonsense out, but even this seems as hollow as anything else the Left has done in the last two decades. Why do they want to do away with these words? Not because they realize that people are rejecting the policies that the words are associated with. They think that the words themselves are what are keeping people from voting blue or registering as a Democrat. It's just like how after the last election, a lot of Democrats thought the reason Kamala Harris lost wasn't because she was a cackling, word-salad-spewing buffoon at every turn of the campaign or because the party's platform is all about unnecessary vanity causes that don't affect the overwhelming majority of Americans. Nope. They were convinced that it was because Harris is a black female and because the Dems didn't have a Joe Rogan-like podcast. No one misses the point like the Left. Perhaps some sense has been knocked into the Dems over the last year, but for the most part, they still clearly don't get it.","summary":"A new memo warns Democrats to stop using words like &quot;privilege,&quot; &quot;triggering,&quot; and &quot;pregnant person,&quot; saying woke language is driving voters away.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/culture/democrats-just-starting-realize-everyone-hates-favorite-words","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/08/woke-words.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 19:50:07","author":"Matt Reigle","authors":["Matt Reigle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":353400896,"title":"'Declaring a war on America': Trump blasted for saying he may send military to more cities","text":"In what would be an unprecedented act and an escalation of his current occupation of Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump announced that he is willing to deploy U.S. Armed Forces to cities including Chicago and New York, after sending thousands of National Guard troops and FBI, DEA, DHS, ATF, and ICE agents to patrol the streets of the nation’s capital.\n\nThe President’s remarks came shortly after the Pentagon announced it will arm the 2,000 National Guard troops currently in Washington, D.C.\n\nDeploying the U.S. Military to a major American city in peacetime—without a national emergency, without invoking the Insurrection Act, and without a governor’s request—would risk violating the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\n“We haven’t had to bring in the regular military, which we’re willing to do, if we have to,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, speaking about his occupation of Washington, D.C. “And after we do this, we’ll go to another location, and we’ll make it safe also.

Nor is it a lack of trying, because there’s few things Americans love more than turning a season into a shared experience, even if participation is somewhat ironic. \nBut this summer, the only real shared theme was our unstoppable apathy. \nTake, for instance, the lack of a “song of the summer,” a tradition that goes back decades if not centuries. These days, we can usually identify it as the song blasting from car stereos as they head to the beach or similar. Despite super popular tunes from Netflix’s impossibly charming, animated feature K-Pop Demon Hunters, the best efforts from Addison Rae’s paean to passenger princess romance, and the barrage of interchangeable Christian-coded rock, there wasn’t one inexorable, summertime smash that defined the last few months. Charli XCX, whose Brat summer finally ended after over a year, attempted to pass the mantle to 26 or so artists (including the aforementioned Rae). Like the others, none of these options took hold. \n[Image: There is no summer after Brat Summer (which actually lasted an entire year). https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2222663983.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]\nThe closest thing we got to a song of summer was actually an eight second soundbyte cut from the low-cost UK airline Jet2. People shared and posted their personal bloopers (falling, flailing, failing, flopping) with the opening intro, “Nothing beats a Jet2 Holiday…” But that trend was more about looking back at our embarrassing moments with sardonic glee, not a rallying cry for this summer’s parties. The only thing it made clear was that the public yearns for America’s Funniest Home Videos. \nIt’s not like there weren’t other dominating trends either. But no one has been brave or unhinged enough to dub the last few months “Hot Labubu summer.” \nThis summer wasn’t about what we loved, it was about what we obsessed with but — like the tiny mythical elf turned plastic trinket that is Labubu — kind of hated. Whether it was Dubai Chocolate, pickles, West Village Girls, ChatGPT and AI, the $19 Erewhon strawberry, or Sydney Sweeney’s jeans, everything we talked about this summer (and for the past year) seemed to be fueled by disdain. If everyone genuinely liked Labubus, they wouldn’t be nearly as inescapable as they are now. \nThe truth may be that we’re all burnt out and the idea of putting in the work to make the time of year we’re in “fun” is impossible. Everything somehow became exhausting. Perhaps monoculture didn’t die as much as we found a way to tire it out, making even our obsessions loathsome. These days, everything is one minute away from becoming a political culture war. \nCharli XCX’s “Brat summer,” for instance, was never really invented to be made into a Kamala Harris endorsement, so when that happened, it did seem to siphon the joy out of it. There is nothing fun about being made to think about whether Harris is or is not Brat, and it was inexorably worse listening to wonks parse out the question online. It’s not unlike watching the White House’s social media account vaporize the delight out of a Jet2 Holiday trend. Apparently, there are now people upset over the Cracker Barrel logo because it removed the man and his barrel. \nIs Kamala still Brat? Is Cracker Barrel woke? Will Jet2 disavow the White House? \n[Image: Can Caitlin Covington save us from our existential dread summer? https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-22-at-12.23.10%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all]\nThese questions feel like cruel punishments. When will the United Nations step in? The battles are constant, and in this time of great sociopolitical upheaval, no entity truly has the level of culture dominance necessary to “declare” anything that feels truly mass. \nThere are signs that this American exhaustion is not bound to summer. \nApple orchard aficionados and corn maze maestros across the country were briefly plunged into a pre-seasonal panic when it was announced that Christian Girl Autumn was not happening this year, according to the most important Christian Girl who celebrates Autumn. \n“I just — I’m not going to be able to post fall videos this year,” said influencer Caitlin Covington, who has been the earnest and ironic avatar for the fall season and all of its aesthetics (cider doughnuts, chunky knitwear, leaves changing, Vermont, pumpkins, etc.) since 2019. \nHer reasoning? It was just too much. “It’s just a lot of pressure to make each video better than the last, make each fall trip better, and I just really need a break this year,” she added. \nTo all the 63-degree-loving fall girlies, this must’ve been what it felt like to watch Achilles fall in the last moments of the Trojan war. Unlike Achilles, however, Covington, with a fresh blowout, announced that she was “just kidding” a few hours later.\nWhen Covington mentioned that she was tired, the public reaction wasn’t shock or admonishment, but relatability. We’re drained, too. Enjoying a trend called “Christian Girl Autumn” as the comments talk about trad wives and gender roles? Pass, too hard. \nWe can’t even cobble together a summer celebration that we can all agree on. The only thing we may all actually share in this fall is a continuation of our hot weather apathy, a burnt out numbness that not even a Christian Girl Autumn may fix. \nThat is, unless Covington’s fall photoshoot is really, really good.","summary":"Whether it’s Brat, White Boy, Hot Girl, Barbenheimer or way back to the Summer of Love, Americans love to give summer a theme.&#160; Yet, in 2025, we just couldn’t get it together to make this summer anything.&#160; It’s not for a lack of options to get excited about — we had Labubus, Coldplay cheaters, And [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/458994/summer-2025-songs-culture-trends-fall","image":"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2210070526.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,13.387397942372,100,73.225204115256","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 19:00:00","author":"Alex Abad-Santos","authors":["Alex Abad-Santos"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":353369616,"title":"Elon Musk Loses Again: Billionaire Must Pay $500Million in Severance to Thousands of Ex-Twitter Employees — as Trump's Ex-Pal Deals With Legal Nightmare","text":"Elon Musk is having a rough week, and his latest headache is having to dig into his pocket and pay former Twitter employees $500million, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe billionaire has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought on by the platform's ex-employees, who accused Musk of not forking over their severance pay after he took over the company in 2022.Details Of The Lawsuit\"The parties have reached a settlement agreement in principle and began negotiating the terms of a long-form settlement agreement,” the filing noted. \"If the district court approves the proposed distribution, the agreement will resolve the litigation in its entirety and moot this appeal.\"\n\nTwo former staffers, Courtney McMillian and Ronald Cooper, had filed the original lawsuit against Musk, claiming Twitter's 2019 severance plan promised most employees at least two months of base pay plus a week of pay for every year of service. Meanwhile, senior staff were owed six months of base pay. \n\nHowever, according to the lawsuit, most workers did not see a single penny. \n\nWhile a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in July 2024, McMillian and Cooper appealed, and the case was set to go to trial before the agreement was made.Elon's Other Lawsuit ExplainedIt is not yet known how much money each worker will receive.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44billion in 2022, proceeded to change the popular platform's name to X, and then cut around 6,000 jobs.\n\nThe 54-year-old's problems do not end there, however. He was recently ordered by a judge to face a lawsuit claiming he ran an illegal $1million election lottery during Donald Trump's 2024 election run.\n\nHe is being accused of defrauding voters into signing a petition to support the U.S. Constitution, offering a chance to win cash.An 'Illegal' Lottery?Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty claimed that Musk and America PAC induced voters in several battleground states to sign the petition, promising to choose one person per day to win $ 1million. However, the lawsuit, filed on November 5, 2024, Election Day, notes the voters never had a chance to collect the winnings.\n\nAccording to McAferty, voters were required to provide personal information, including their addresses and phone numbers. Musk did his best to have the suit dismissed, listing \"red flags\" as proof he had not run the alleged illegal lottery.\n\nDespite his pushback, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman, who was appointed by President Obama in 2014, pointed to other statements suggesting the defendants were \"awarding\" the money, and that the $1million could be \"won.\"\n\n\"It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery, even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do,\" the judge said in response.Musk pulled out every single trick to help Trump, 79, beat Kamala Harris in November, introducing his \"lottery\" to the masses. But not everyone was a fan of the idea, especially Philadelphia district attorney Lawrence Krasner, who tried to block the gimmicky contest.\n\n\"l'll be seeking a lot more money than that for what Elon Musk and America PAC have done,\" Krasner said. However, Pennsylvania judge Angelo Foglietta ruled Musk's sweepstakes was not illegal at the time.","summary":"Elon Musk has agreed to pay $500million former Twitter employees in severance after he was accused of booting them and not forking over any cash.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/elon-musk-must-pay-twitter-severance-lawsuit-illegal-election/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/iBV81jWJi/0x0/elon-musk-twitter-severance2-1755884696295.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 18:40:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":353363636,"title":"Colin Allred Edges Out Leading Republican in Texas Race—Internal Poll","text":"An internal poll from former Representative Colin Allred's campaign showed him with a lead over state Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas' U.S. Senate race.Newsweek reached out to the Allred and Paxton campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersDemocrats will need to compete in states like Texas if they want to win control of the Senate. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority. Democrats view Maine, which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by seven points against President Donald Trump last November, and North Carolina, which voted for Trump by three points, as their best opportunities to flip GOP-held seats. But no other Harris-won or single-digit Trump seats are up for grabs, meaning they will need to win seats in more conservative states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio or Texas to win a majority.What To KnowAlthough internal polls are typically not viewed as reliably as independent surveys, the new poll underscores the potentially competitive nature of the race.Texas voted for Trump by double digits last year, but Democrats are hopeful the race could become competitive next year—particularly if Paxton defeats Senator John Cornyn in the Republican primary. Polls suggest that Paxton has built a lead among the state's conservative electorate but would not have Cornyn's advantage as a well-known, established incumbent in the general election.Allred led Paxton by 2 percentage points in the poll conducted by GBAO. Forty-nine percent of respondents said they would vote for Allred, while 47 percent said they intended to cast their ballots for Paxton. Four percent said they are undecided.The poll surveyed 800 likely voters from August 13-18 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.The release of the poll comes just days after an independent poll found that Allred could be vulnerable to a primary challenger, and the Allred campaign in the memo touted the poll as showing he is \"the one who can win it.\"\"If Democrats are to retake the majority, they must compete in Texas — and Colin is already proving that he's the one who can win it,\" the campaign's polling memo said. \"Research from GBAO shows Colin 2 points ahead of likely GOP nominee Ken Paxton, confirming earlier research from the GOP's Senate Leadership Fund and Donald Trump's own pollster.\"A Texas Southern University's Barbara Jordan Public Policy Research and Survey Center poll released Tuesday showed that former Representative Beto O'Rourke would have a lead over Allred if he decides to run for Senate (58 percent to 38 percent), while Representative Joaquin Castro and state Representative James Talarico could also be competitive against Allred in the primary.Republicans plan to spend millions of dollars to support Cornyn in the primary to avoid a more expensive general election, Punchbowl News reported this month.An Emerson College poll, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters from August 11-12, showed Paxton leading Allred by 5 points (46 percent to 41 percent), while Cornyn led Allred by 7 points (45 percent to 38 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points.Meanwhile, a survey conducted by GOP pollster Brad Parscale showed Paxton trailing Allred in a hypothetical matchup. It found that 52 percent of voters would likely vote for Allred to 37 percent for Paxton. It surveyed 1,000 likely voters in mid-April.Still, winning Texas would be a major uphill challenge for Allred or another Democrat. Texas has not voted Democratic on the presidential level since 1976 and has not voted for a Democratic senator since 1988. The state last elected a Democratic governor in 1990.Trump won Texas by more than 13 points last November, performing stronger in suburban areas while also making inroads in southern Texas, a heavily Hispanic area that shifted rightward.Allred, however, lost by a smaller 8.5-point margin against GOP Senator Ted Cruz.Paxton has challenged Cornyn in the primary from the right, and polls suggest he has an early lead. The Texas Southern University poll showed Paxton leading by 5 points (44 percent to 39 percent).What People Are SayingAllred campaign manager Dan Morrocco, in a statement provided to Newsweek: \"Colin enters this race stronger than ever — already leading Ken Paxton, backed by one of the highest favorability ratings of any candidate, and building the broad, diverse coalition it will take to win. That's why Texas is now firmly on the Senate battleground map, and why Colin is the Democrat who can finally deliver a statewide victory.\"Senator John Cornyn, on X: \"Another day, another poll showing [Ken Paxton] losing the Texas Senate seat. A corrupt Republican nominee would help elect first statewide Democrat in 30 years.\"Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist who co-authored the report from the Barbara Jordan Public Policy Research and Survey center, previously told Newsweek: \"The irony for Allred is that the qualities that make him more attractive to national Democrats—that is being more pragmatic, more centrist and better able to win over independents and moderate Republicans—tend to make him less attractive among Democratic primary voters who see him as too close to the center, too focused on appealing to moderate Republicans, rather than to progressive Democrats.\"What Happens NextThe Cook Political Report classifies the race as Likely Republican, meaning it is \"not considered competitive at this point\" but has \"the potential to become engaged.\" Sabato's Crystal Ball also lists the race as Likely Republican.The primary will be held on March 3, 2026.","summary":"Allred held a lead over Attorney General Ken Paxton in an internal poll released Friday in Texas' U.S. Senate race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/colin-allred-leads-ken-paxton-texas-poll-2117912","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708067/colin-allred-leads-ken-paxton-texas-poll.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=16c9e9710eadf2f323c7f346d2dbce41","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 17:39:35","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":353347892,"title":"Ben Shapiro compares Kamala Harris’ \"107 Days\" book tour to the post-apocalyptic horror film \"28 Days Later\"","text":"Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro recently compared former Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming book with the 2002 post-apocalyptic horror film 28 Days Later. The comment, made on X on August 22, 2025, was in response to the news of Harris' 15-city international tour to promote her memoir, 107 Days.The book, which is due to be released on September 23, details Kamala Harris' short-lived presidential campaign in 2024, which she frames as \"a journal\" of her 107-day candidacy, which followed President Joe Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the race.The tour, which was announced on Thursday, August 21, begins on September 24 and ends in late November, with events planned in major cities like New York and San Francisco, as well as international stops in Toronto and London. In response to the book tour, Ben Shapiro tweeted, saying:\"I'm just gonna assume this is the sequel to \"28 Days Later\".\"The film 28 Days Later focuses on a ruined, rage-infected zombie Britain starting 28 days after the outbreak. In Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, Jim, a bike messenger, wakes from a coma to a desolate London ravaged by a virus that turned humans into violent infected.According to The Guardian, an intensely scary horror film, 28 Days Later provides haunting images of the post-apocalyptic present.Ben Shapiro’s previous comments on Kamala Harris' upcoming memoirBen Shapiro recently commented on Kamala Harris’ appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where he talked about the interview and Harris’ newly announced memoir, 107 Days.In the video shared on his YouTube channel on August 2, Shapiro noted a number of talking points from their conversation and asked whether Harris is still popular, whether she is ineffective, and where Harris is politically after her failed run for president.\"For all the talk in the media about how she was 'brat' and joy and a wonderful candidate—Joy Reid said she ran a flawless, flawless campaign—and for all of that, ain't nobody talking about her running again in 2028. Weird,\" he added.Ben Shapiro claimed Harris' choice to publish a book detailing what she referred to as the \"shortest presidential campaign in modern political history\" came off as self-serving. He also mocked the TikTok trend that accompanied the book as being lame and stated that it was an effort by Harris to appeal to the younger audiences.\"But if she can't make it a bestseller by telling you about it, perhaps she can make it a bestseller by doing a TikTok trend about it, because there is nothing that more says you're in touch with the kids than being a 60-year-old person who's doing TikTok trends... Oh my god,\" he remarked.Ben Shapiro also criticized Kamala Harris for talking about personal stories in her book, like the time her husband forgot to celebrate her birthday, saying many of these stories were quite irrelevant for a political memoir and would not help her public perception.With tickets now on sale, including VIP packages with photo ops with Kamala Harris, the upcoming book tour events are set to stir up a lot of buzz from the Democrats as well as the Republicans.","summary":"Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro recently compared former Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming book with the 2002 post-apocalyptic horror film 28 Days Later.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/podcasts/news-ben-shapiro-compares-kamala-harris-107-days-book-tour-post-apocalyptic-horror-film-28-days-later","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/08/17048-17558703708897-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 17:11:55","author":"Diana George","authors":["Diana George"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.189},{"id":353423922,"title":"GOP Rep.

Brandon Gill (R-TX) suggested the possibility of the House Oversight Committee subpoenaing former Vice President Kamala Harris, as part of the committee’s investigation into former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline while in office.\n\nAccording to the Texas Republican, Harris could offer insight into Biden’s tenure.\n\n“The House Oversight Committee just interviewed former Biden White House spokesman Ian Sams yesterday,” host Cheryl Casone said. “I want to get your take on this. This is the latest testimony in the autopen investigation. Oversight Chair James Comer gave some insight into the interview. He revealed that the ex-Biden spokesman only saw the 46th president twice in two plus years of service, and then Chairman Comer also hinted at a subpoena for former Vice President Kamala Harris as they — excuse me, former President Biden’s mental decline. They say her testimony would be incredibly helpful to unravel the autopen portion of the investigation. And you even got these new documents showing even more people inside the Biden White House had raised concerns about what was going on. The oversight project obtain these documents from the DOJ. This former Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Bradley Weinsheimer, he raised concerns about Biden’s slew of term and pardons for Federal convicts. I want to get your reaction to all of this. You — by the way, serve on oversight, so I certainly want to get first and foremost your take on that?”\n\nGill replied, “Yes, of course. Listen, these are the people who portrayed themselves as being in the know, whenever all the American people watched Joe Biden on TV, we could see his cognitive decline. We saw his debate performance. We could see his eyes glazing over whenever reporters were asking him questions. And yet the people who should have been around him, who portrayed themselves as knowing Biden’s actual mental state, actually had no clue what they were talking about, and instead lied to the American people and said what you’re seeing isn’t the case. I know that he is totally fine whenever they had no clue. You know this isn’t just an indictment of the Biden administration and the people around him, but it’s also an indictment of Left-wing legacy media, who didn’t ask anybody if they had any evidence that Biden was actually as mentally acute as some of the people ostensibly around him were portraying it. This is a huge scandal and we’re going to continue these investigations.”\n\n“Are you going to subpoena Kamala Harris?” Casone asked.\n\n“I would like to see Kamala Harris subpoenaed,” Gill said. “I think that she should have been close to Joe Biden more than most people, and I think she’s got a lot to answer for as well.”\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on X @jeff_poor","summary":"During Friday's broadcast of Fox Business Network's \"Mornings with Maria,\" Rep.

After divulging his intentions to some women he knew, he said they reacted with shock.\n\n'All the women looked in and go, \"You mean, you're not voting for Kamala?\" And I go, \"I just can't do that.\" And then one of them leaned in further and said, \"Are you voting for Trump?\" And I said, \"I am.\" I swear!'\n\nGrazer may be unusual in admitting it, but plenty of people in the industry are just like him. Yet they fear being open about their vote, with good reason.\n\nLook at Sydney Sweeney, targeted by the woke left for her American Eagle denim ad.\n\nWhen tarring her as a racist didn't work, they dug up her voter registration — and yes, the 27-year-old actress, one of Hollywood's newly minted superstars, registered as a Republican in June 2024.\n\nIn her new cover profile for the Wall Street Journal magazine, Sweeney refuses to discuss her politics. And this is a woman who otherwise describes herself, in this very article, as 'pretty blunt'.\n\n'I've never understood why people try to beat around the bush and not just be direct,' Sweeney says.\n\nPerhaps her decision to stay apolitical is a financial one. As Michael Jordan famously (shrewdly) said, 'Republicans buy sneakers, too.'\n\nIf the last election proved anything, it's that celebrities — no matter how A-list — have zero influence in the way average Americans vote.\n\nLook no further than Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Rihanna, Oprah Winfrey and, of course, Taylor Swift, who seemingly thought her immense popularity could sway the election to Kamala Harris.\n\nAlas, it could not. Have most celebrities taken the note?\n\nNo — of course not!\n\nStephen Colbert just got himself canceled and the whole Late Show with it.\n\nHoward Stern has been on the bubble since inviting Harris on his show, confessing his terror should Trump win.\n\n'You've gotta win,' he told her on air last October. 'You just have to... like, the sun's literally gonna go out.'\n\nThe only thing on the way out is Howard's career. Oh — and his reputation as someone who understood his audience and never, ever would have talked down to them this way.\n\nSame with Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael Patrick King and Cynthia Nixon, whose on and off-screen wokeness killed 'And Just Like That'.\n\nDisney's 'Snow White' remake was doomed not just by insisting on a Latina version of the heroine, but statements and posts made by 24-year-old leading lady Rachel Zegler, who called the entire concept of the classic 'outdated', agitated for Palestine and said she hoped that 'Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace'.\n\nProducer Marc Platt was reportedly so alarmed he flew to New York City to hold crisis talks with Zegler. Disney scaled back the film's premiere considerably. But the harm was already done.\n\nPlatt's son Jonah, in a since-deleted post, said what would have been unsayable just two years ago.\n\n'Her [Zegler's] actions clearly hurt the box office', Jonah posted in March. 'Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation for her own immature desires at the risk of all the colleagues and crew and blue-collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful.'\n\nZegler, according to her IMDB profile, has yet to book another acting job.\n\nJust weeks ago, Disney and Lucasfilm company settled a lawsuit brought by actress Gina Carano, who was fired after posting right-leaning tweets.\n\nHer lawsuit was funded by Elon Musk and resolved with a Lucasfilm spokesperson stating that 'Ms. Carano was always well respected by her directors, co-stars, and staff, and she worked hard to perfect her craft while treating her colleagues with kindness and respect'.\n\nIn other words: Carano wasn't a racist, transphobic bigot who deserved to be fired.\n\nThe examples just go on: Lena Dunham, one-time feminist provocateur whose latest Netflix show 'Too Much' is a critical flop and has yet to be renewed; MSNBC gets spun off from NBC Universal and changes its call letters to 'MS NOW'; Dylan Mulvaney's book 'Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer', released in March, flopped; Bud Light, nearly brought down by its partnership with Mulvaney, debuted a new, male-centric ad campaign at last year's Super Bowl starring Post Malone, Trump supporter Dana White, and Peyton Manning.\n\nAnd what do you know — it worked. Bud's ad was the sixth-most watched on YouTube that night, according to Variety.\n\nQuietly, inexorably, Hollywood moves not just to the center but to Red America. Taylor Sheridan's modern-day Western 'Yellowstone', which premiered in the middle of President Biden's first (and only) term, was a mammoth, mainstream hit.\n\nSheridan followed with 'Landman', set in Texas oilfields and recently renewed for Season 2.\n\nBravo, with programming that normally caters to coastal elites, premiered Season 2 of 'The McBee Dynasty: Real American Cowboys' in June.\n\nMarvel star Chris Pratt this week told Bill Maher — who had a private dinner with President Trump in the White House earlier this year — that he loves the MAHA movement and his wife's cousin, HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n'There's certain things [that Bobby] oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way — like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food,' Pratt said. 'I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be having an allergic reaction to.'\n\nNow it's woke Hollywood causing allergic reactions.\n\nConsider that one of Netflix's biggest shows isn't 'With Love, Meghan' or anything the Obamas have produced but 'The Hunting Wives' — a MAGA-adjacent soap set in Texas with guns as the most prominent prop.\n\nShowrunner Rebecca Cutter told Variety that when she was pitching the show, she was asked: 'Is this a show that both liberals and conservatives can watch?'\n\nCutter says she replied, 'Yes, absolutely... My first job is never to be political or put my agenda in it.'\n\nTalk about waking up.","summary":"Hollywood is doing the unthinkable - going red.

In reality, the vast majority of D.C. residents oppose the move and feel it makes them less safe.\n\nAfter mocking MSNBC’s upcoming name change, claiming it was “because they‘re ashamed of it and they‘re disassociating it from NBC, which is also fake news,” Trump then brought up CBS and Ellison – and had nothing but good things to say.\n\n“I think the news is getting better. They‘re learning that they have no credibility,” he declared. “CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well.”\n\nTrump continued: “A great man. He actually just bought CBS. And I think he‘s going to do the right thing with it.”\n\nEllison is the son of close Trump ally and megadonor Larry Ellison, the Oracle founder who invested billions of dollars in David Ellison’s Skydance merger with Paramount. Weeks before the Federal Communications Commission – led by Trump’s hand-picked chairman Brendan Carr – finally approved the Skydance-Paramount deal, Trump similarly sang the younger Ellison’s praises.\n\n“Ellison’s great,” the president told reporters in mid-June. “He’ll do a great job with it.”\n\nEarlier this week, the ranking members of the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees sent Ellison a letter demanding documents and correspondence related to the administration’s approval process of the Paramount merger, which officially closed on August 7.\n\nSpecifically, the two Democratic congressmen are seeking answers surrounding not only the settlement of the Trump lawsuit, which has sparked accusations of bribery from lawmakers and free press organizations, but also the president’s claim that he reached a “side deal” with Ellison.\n\nShortly after the previous Paramount leadership announced it was paying Trump $16 million to settle the 60 Minutes complaint, Trump boasted that Ellison had agreed to air up to $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements and programming on CBS once the merger went through. While the old Paramount denied any knowledge of any secret agreement, Ellison has remained mum on the matter.\n\n“This offer was necessarily contingent on the FCC approving the deal and does not appear to present any legitimate value to the public, only to President Trump,” Reps. Frank Pallone and Jamie Raskin wrote Ellison this week. “Therefore, this appears to be an offer of payment and benefits to a government official designed to achieve a specific outcome from the government — in other words, a bribe.”\n\nAdditionally, the Democrats are inquiring about Paramount’s decision to cancel the top-rated late-night show hosted by outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert just days before the merger was approved, as well as Skydance’s assurance to the FCC that it would review “complaints of bias” at CBS News and eliminate all diversity hiring practices. Both Trump and Carr publicly celebrated Colbert’s cancellation.\n\nOn top of that, Raskin and Pallone noted that during the negotiations with Trump to settle the lawsuit, which CBS lawyers said was “without merit” and legal experts described as frivolous, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and CBS News chief Wendy McMahon both resigned in protest.\n\n“Two wrongs do not make a right—illegitimate demands from the FCC or the Administration do not absolve your company from wrongdoing,” the letter to Ellison stated. “If Skydance offered a side deal of up to $20 million worth of advertisement or programming to President Trump in order to receive regulatory approval for the merger with Paramount, these actions would run afoul of federal and state anti-bribery statutes.”\n\nThe lawmakers added: “Similarly, if Paramount forced out CBS’s longtime leaders, spent $16 million to settle a sham lawsuit with President Trump, or cancelled a highly popular comedy show that President Trump dislikes in order to curry favor with the Administration and to receive regulatory approval for the merger with Skydance, these actions would likely further embolden President Trump to use lawsuits and regulatory authority to attack media organizations that he finds objectionable in order to silence them.”\n\nIn the meantime, it appears that Ellison and his senior leadership are preparing to enact painful cuts to the news network. Puck’s Dylan Byers reported this week that Paramount sources had told him CBS News was losing around $50 million a year, a claim a CBS News spokesperson pushed back hard against, saying the news division is “currently profitable.”\n\nStill, based on the Byers item, it appears that Ellison and Paramount president Jeff Shell are laying the groundwork to make sweeping layoffs at CBS News – and soon. “The stage has been set for a round of painful cost-cutting,” Status News’ Oliver Darcy noted. “In other words, the disputed number may ultimately be less important than the larger narrative it helps justify: CBS News is about to face some painful budget cuts.”","summary":"‘CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well,’ Donald Trump declared on Friday.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-cbs-david-ellison-paramount-settlement-b2812624.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/22/14/05/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-s3gkc5cb.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xgaaYRH8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-22 16:51:45","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":353338952,"title":"Joe Concha slams James Carville: ‘He’s been wrong about everything’","text":"While in England on vacation, Vance spoke to U.S. troops stationed at the Royal Air Force Base in Fairford and met with foreign leaders, including British Foreign Minister David Lammy. \n\n“At this point [Carville] is only on because he says things in that Louisiana cajun accent that is usually provocative, and therefore that is what makes him interesting, I suppose,” Concha said on Fox & Friends. “But look at his record, the guy is always wrong.” \n\nCarville, the lead strategist in former President Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 presidential campaign, criticized Democrats for failing to target Vance in their political messaging. \n\n“Use JD Vance,” Carville said in Thursday’s episode of his podcast, “and just kick the s*** out of him every chance you get.”\n\nConcha argued that Carville doesn’t have credibility, noting that he has often been wrong in the past, including predictions that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would win in a “landslide” in the 2016 election and that former Vice President Kamala Harris would beat President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nHARRIS ANNOUNCES FALL BOOK TOUR FOR HER UPCOMING MEMOIR\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox & Friends on Friday, Concha said that Bill Clinton won in 1992 because of his “charisma” and former President George H.W.

Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, kicked off the frenzy Thursday, filing a declaration of candidacy for the newly drawn 9th Congressional District, anchored east of Houston. That seat, currently held by Democratic Rep. Al Green, was moved from southern Houston to the eastern parts of Harris County and Liberty County, going from a district that voted for Kamala Harris by 44 percentage points to one that Donald Trump would have carried by 20 points.\n\nBut with three of the newly created seats lacking an incumbent and two South Texas districts redrawn to be more favorable to Republicans, operatives expect a flurry of candidates to jump into races that Trump hopes yield five new GOP members of Congress.\n\nSouth Texas\n\nRepublicans were targeting two South Texas seats held by Democrats even before the map was redrawn to fold more GOP voters into those districts.\n\nTexas’ 28th Congressional District, centered in Laredo, and the 34th Congressional District, which includes Brownsville and McAllen, were two of just 13 districts nationwide to elect a congressional Democrat while being carried by Trump. Reps. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, and Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen — two of the House’s most moderate Democrats — were able to hang on to their heavily Hispanic seats in 2024.\n\nUnder the current boundaries, the 28th District voted for Trump by a 7-point margin, while Trump carried the 34th District by 4.5 percentage points. Both were redrawn to be seats that Trump would have won by 10 points.\n\nCuellar’s district lost Democratic-leaning precincts in the San Antonio area and picked up Live Oak County and a sliver of Hidalgo County, including parts of McAllen and areas west of the city. Gonzalez lost his portion of McAllen and Hidalgo County, instead gaining much of conservative Nueces County and its biggest city, Corpus Christi.\n\nThose two districts were already on the National Republican Campaign Committee’s target list — meaning the nominees will receive ample resources — and had attracted challengers. Former Rep. Mayra Flores, who lost to Gonzalez in 2022 and 2024, switched to run in Cuellar’s district — though operatives and Gonzalez have speculated she could switch back to the 34th.\n\nBut Republicans are also excited about Eric Flores, an army veteran and lawyer from Mission who launched his campaign in July.\n\nIn Cuellar’s district, Webb County Judge Tano Tijerina has formed an exploratory committee, a formal step toward launching a run in the 28th District. Tijerina, a former Democrat, switched parties after the 2024 election. He had been a Democratic county judge for nearly a decade.\n\nBecause of Texas’ resign-to-run law, Tijerina would need to step down from his county judge job if he launches a formal congressional campaign with more than one year and 30 days left in his term.\n\nSan Antonio\n\nSeveral local elected officials in San Antonio are thinking about running in the newly drawn 35th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and outlying eastern areas in Bexar, Guadalupe, Wilson and Karnes counties, the latter three of which are heavily Republican.\n\nThe new seat, cobbled together from pieces of five current congressional seats, would have voted for Trump by a 10-point margin had it existed in 2024.\n\nGrant Moody, the only Republican on the Bexar County Commissioners Court, said in a statement that he is exploring a congressional bid in the new district.\n\n“Texans are known for our hard work, devotion to selfless service, and conservative values — and they deserve to be represented by someone who shares those ideals,” Moody said. “I’ve always felt called to serve my community and country, and these new maps present a unique opportunity to continue serving.”\n\nSan Antonio City Council member Marc Whyte, whose district in San Antonio’s North Side is part of the new 35th District, is also exploring a bid. Though the City Council is nonpartisan, Whyte, an attorney first elected in 2023, represents the only conservative-leaning district in the city and previously ran, unsuccessfully, for the Texas House as a Republican.\n\n“I’m certainly looking at it,” Whyte said in a text message.\n\nState Rep. John Lujan, a Republican and former Bexar County sheriff’s deputy who represents a number of towns outside San Antonio, and Kristin Tips, a San Antonio funeral director who heads the Texas Funeral Service Commission, are also contemplating running, according to a source familiar with the district.\n\nAustin Republican Rep. Chip Roy’s announcement that he is running for attorney general also leaves a vacancy in his Central Texas-based 21st Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and Bexar County. That seat could see enormous interest — Roy was one of 18 Republicans who ran in the 2018 primary, the last time the seat was open.\n\nThe Republicans contemplating a run in the 35th Congressional District may also be interested in the 21st District. Whyte said he is looking at both.\n\nBexar County GOP Vice Chair Kyle Sinclair, who has run in different San Antonio-area congressional seats in the past two cycles, said he is also exploring running in both the 35th and 21st Congressional Districts.\n\nIn a statement, Sinclair noted that he has relationships with the GOP grassroots and at the state and federal levels, and argued his “background could serve the community well.”\n\n“Additionally, I am committed to securing necessary resources — such as federal disaster relief funds, and support for local rebuilding efforts following the devastating July 2025 floods — to continue the Hill Country recovery,” Sinclair said.\n\nThe redrawn 32nd Congressional District is the safest Republican seat that GOP map-drawers created. Currently a geographically compact district that contains about a third of the city of Dallas and some northern and eastern suburbs, the district was redrawn to become far more rural.\n\nUnder the new map, the 32nd District contains just 11% of the city of Dallas and extends east into six heavily Republican, majority-white counties, running nearly to Longview in East Texas.\n\nRep. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch, was drawn out of the district. It went from voting for Harris by 24 percentage points to favoring Trump by 18 points.\n\nGiven how red the district is, the candidate that emerges could stand to spend decades in Congress, making it an attractive seat for ambitious Republicans.\n\nAlready, Ryan Binkley, a businessman and the founding pastor at Create Church in Richardson, has announced he is running. Binkley mounted a long-shot Republican presidential bid in 2023, competing in the first four states before dropping out and endorsing Trump. He spent millions of his own money in the process and never received more than 1,000 votes in any contest.\n\n“I believe we need leaders in Washington, D.C. with real-world experience who will fight for your freedom, fight for your prosperity and your family’s safety,” Binkley said in a launch video, calling himself a “strong, common-sense Texas voice.”\n\nOperatives are also eyeing state Rep. Katrina Pierson, a longtime tea party activist and communications consultant from Rockwall. Pierson was Trump’s national spokesperson in his first presidential campaign and a senior adviser on his 2020 bid. She went on to successfully defeat Republican then-state Rep. Justin Holland in a 2024 primary and is in her first term in the Legislature.\n\nPierson ran for Congress in 2014, losing a primary to Republican Rep. Pete Sessions. She contemplated running for an open Dallas-area seat in 2021 before ultimately deciding against it, saying at the time she was “not closing the door on Congress.”\n\nBut Pierson has not indicated if she is interested in running for the seat.\n\n“I need to get through the [legislative] session before even thinking about it,” she said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15!

Washington police arrested an average of 56 people daily last year, according to city data.\n\nThe Justice Department, which did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, has not specified whether the arrests were made entirely by federal agents or whether they include law enforcement action by Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nBut local TV channel ABC 7 News quoted federal officials as saying the numbers included arrests by all agencies in the city.\n\nIt’s also not clear whether the detention of undocumented immigrants is included in the tally. Arrests made by ICE were only distinguished in Bondi’s daily announcements on Thursday and Friday.\n\nBut Trump and his aides are talking up the arrests as a considerable feat.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Trump rode around Washington with law enforcement officers in a show of control and defiance against critics of the crackdown.\n\n“We’ve had some incredible results. … It’s like a different place. It’s like a different city. It’s the capital. It’s going to be the best in the world,” the US president told soldiers and law enforcement officers.\n\nVice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also visited Union Station on Wednesday, where they ordered burgers at a fast food restaurant as protesters chanted against them.\n\nTrump first suggested federalising law enforcement in Washington after an employee of his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted during a carjacking early this month.\n\nWhy Washington?\n\nSince he entered politics in 2015, Trump has described major cities, which are almost all run by Democrats, as infested by crime, drugs and homelessness.\n\nThat perception echoed some rural conservative attitudes towards liberal cities.\n\nTrump has long threatened to send the military to cities he views as dangerous, but the US Constitution gives the power of policing to the states, not the federal government.\n\nWashington, DC, however, is not a state. As the US capital, it has no votes in the US Congress or enshrined state rights.\n\nWhile the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gives the local government some control over the city, the federal government retains some powers over Washington. For example, Congress may overturn local resolutions approved by the city council.\n\nThe law also allows the president to take over policing in the capital for 30 days.\n\nThe city votes overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party – Democrat Kamala Harris won Washington against Trump, a Republican, with 92.5 percent of the ballots last year – and it has been ripe for a Trump crackdown.\n\nSeveral residents expressed bewilderment to Al Jazeera and questioned the need for patrols by federal forces in crowded metro stations and tourist areas that are low-crime spots.\n\nIced out. 🥶 pic.twitter.com/xhexqgmbzS\n— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) August 14, 2025\n\nCrime in DC\n\nWashington is a city of 700,000 people with a metropolitan area that extends into suburbs in Maryland and Virginia and encompasses more than six million residents.\n\nKindle said some tourists and Republican officials want Washington to look like an “amusement park” rather than the densely populated metropolis that it is.\n\n“They think that this is like Disneyland. This is a tourist spot. It should be sanitised for them,” he said. “But they’re seeing what they would see in their own cities.”\n\nDespite improvements in recent years, several residents told Al Jazeera that crime still remains a concern in Washington.\n\nThe city has a homicide rate of about 25 per 100,000 residents, which is significantly higher than the national average but lower than other cities of similar size, including Detroit, Michigan, and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nUS News & World Report, which tracks crime data, does not include Washington on the list of the 25 most dangerous cities in the country.\n\nSome welcome the National Guard\n\nWashington continues to suffer from property crime that sometimes turns violent, especially carjackings involving juveniles, with 190 incidents recorded this year so far.\n\nIn defending the deployment of troops in Washington, the White House argued on its website that the capital has the fourth highest homicide rate in the country – “nearly six times higher than New York City and also higher than Atlanta, Chicago, and Compton.”\n\nLeroy Miles, a 75-year-old retiree, said “it’s good” that federal forces are helping the local police.\n\nMiles said he was no fan of Trump and called him a “crook” but accused local authorities of not doing an adequate job in combating crime.\n\n“These young people out here, they’re robbing and killing. They’re carjacking. So they need some type of old law and order,” said Miles, who has always lived in Washington.\n\n“What’s happening – a lot of people don’t like it, but it might work.”\n\n‘Less safe’\n\nParker stressed that there is no crime crisis in Washington, but he added that it “doesn’t mean that we don’t have more work to do”.\n\n“There are ways in which our local government can productively work with the federal government,” Parker said.\n\n“And what is happening here – where there is an influx of federal officers across the city and National Guards, people deployed, including those from other states – is not the way. This is not how this should be done.”\n\nHe underscored that the Republican-controlled Congress has cut and so far failed to restore $1bn in funding for Washington – money that would go to fighting crime, paying police officers and supporting city services that enhance public safety.\n\nThe council member expressed admiration for National Guard troops, who are called on to help in crises and natural disasters, but he said bringing outsiders to police the city could erode trust between the community and law enforcement officers.\n\n“We’re already seeing it. I have heard directly from residents who are second-guessing calling 911 in instances of true emergencies for fear of what’s going to be the outcome or who might show up at their door,” he said.\n\n“I’m hearing from parents that they are concerned about sending their kids to school for the first day of school next week. I am hearing from residents who are defending and rallying against ICE patrols that are seeking to criminalise our neighbours.”\n\nParker said the federal crackdown is making Washington “less safe”.\n\n‘We are on edge’\n\nA Washington Post poll released on Wednesday suggested 80 percent of Washington residents oppose “Trump taking control of DC’s police and federal troops patrolling the streets” while 72 percent of respondents favour the city becoming a state.\n\nLoss of local control in a place where tax-paying citizens do not have federal voting representation is another aspect that is raising protests against the Trump takeover.\n\n“We have, as a country, allowed for the disenfranchisement of Washingtonians, and now there is an effort to undermine the local autonomy that we do have,” Parker said.\n\nWes, a Washington resident who wished to be identified by his first name only, citing fear of reprisal by the government, warned that the tensions around the issue could boil over.\n\n“We are on edge. You got people that’s scared to come out of their houses,” Wes said outside the Columbia Heights metro station, which saw a heavy ICE presence earlier this week.\n\n“You got people scared to walk the streets like they used to because of this show of force. We do not trust the police here at all. Now you bring somebody we don’t know, that has no skills about you. They’re not even from here. They don’t know how this city works.”\n\nHe said that with people growing frustrated with excessive policing and cuts to social programmes, violence and riots could break out, and Trump would be to blame.\n\n“He thrives on chaos. And if there ain’t no chaos, he creates chaos,” Wes said.","summary":"Critics call the federal takeover of Washington, DC, a &#039;manufactured crisis&#039; aimed at political gain.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/22/on-edge-trumps-military-deployment-in-us-capital-sparks-fear-confusion?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-20T165128Z_510305234_RC2FAGAIV52R_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CRIME-DC-1755865778.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 15:53:58","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":353517816,"title":"John Roberts Is Responsible For America’s Embarrassing Gerrymandering Mess","text":"This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM’s home for opinion and news analysis. It was originally published at Balls and Strikes. \n\nAt the behest of President Donald Trump, Texas Republicans are in the midst of making their state even more of a mockery of the concept of representative democracy than it already was. In an attempt to preserve the GOP’s narrow House majority in the 2026 midterms, lawmakers are tinkering with the boundaries of the state’s 38 congressional districts to create five more safe Republican seats, forcing several Democratic incumbents to seek re-election next year in districts that are suddenly, alarmingly red. Scrambling the map in this manner would ensure that in a state in which Trump earned 56 percent of the vote in 2024, Republicans would lock up 80 percent of the state’s representation in Congress for the rest of the decade.\n\nIn response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has asked lawmakers in his state to create a new map that would eke out five additional safe Democratic seats until 2030. Ambitious elected officials elsewhere are exploring similar retaliatory options, eager both to make the national electoral landscape friendlier for their parties and also to publicly take credit for doing so. In Texas, Republicans grew so desperate to maintain the quorum necessary to move forward that they had a handful of Democrats physically confined to the chamber overnight—generally speaking, not a sign that democracy is “in a good place.”\n\nAs is so often the case in American politics, you can draw a straight line between this frantic gerrymandering arms race and a mind-bendingly stupid decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause in 2019, the five Republican justices held that court challenges to partisan gerrymanders could not go forward in federal courts because such cases present a “political question”—basically, a question that judges (ostensibly) cannot answer using legal principles. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts explained that the Constitution yields no workable standard for determining when a given gerrymander goes too far to be legal. Citing the line in Marbury v. Madison about the Court’s duty to “say what the law is”—always a good sign that a conservative justice is about to bullshit you—Roberts concluded that this time, the Court’s “duty is to say, ‘This is not law.’” (Do you see what he did there?)\n\nIt is of course true that the Supreme Court did not invent partisan gerrymandering, let alone force Texas Governor Greg Abbott to speed-run fascism by issuing civil arrest warrants for Democratic lawmakers who had the temerity to oppose his redistricting gambit. But the Court is responsible for its choice to tie its own hands six years ago, thus enabling these lawmakers to cement themselves in power without fear of interference from pesky, meddling federal courts. \n\nIn what is, in my view, still one of the most embarrassing paragraphs to appear in the pages of the United States Reporter, Roberts wraps in Rucho by noting that the holding constrains only federal courts; Congress, he says, would remain free to enact anti-gerrymandering legislation, as would lawmakers at the state level. The argument here is that voters who are dissatisfied with corruption in the political process don’t actually need John Roberts’s help, because they can always seek redress of their grievances via the aforementioned corrupt political process. This is roughly analogous to the fire department pulling up to a burning house, attaching the hoses to fire hydrants, and then politely informing the owner that it could rain any minute.\n\nRoberts’s premise is, to put it generously, dubious: As Steve Vladeck points out, there are standards the Court could have decided to prescribe for use in partisan gerrymandering cases, if it were so inclined. The problem, of course, is that the conservative justices do not give a shit about partisan gerrymandering, because they understand basic facts about how politics in this country works: Nationwide, Republicans control 59 of 99 state legislative chambers, and hold both the legislature and the governorship in 24 states, compared to just 15 for Democrats. In other words, Republicans have more power over the line-drawing process in more places than their Democratic counterparts, who are always scrambling to catch up.\n\nAs Newsom has demonstrated, Democrats are as capable as Republicans of drawing maps that ruthlessly squeeze their opponents out of power. But the bet Roberts made in Rucho is that, on balance, the existence of unchecked partisan gerrymandering is better for his fellow Republicans than the absence of unchecked partisan gerrymandering. Appealing to the supposed difficulties of crafting “politically neutral” standards for solving problems is a time-honored maneuver among judges seeking to wash their hands of problems they do not want to solve. At one point, Roberts carefully notes that the justices in the majority do not “condone” partisan gerrymandering, but if they did, I am not sure how they would have decided the case any differently.\n\nWhat is happening in Texas and California and elsewhere right now demonstrates just how vapid and hollow the reasoning in Rucho always was. You do not have to have a law degree to understand that a Texas map that transforms a 56-42 advantage into a 79-21 blowout is not, in any meaningful sense, fair. You do not need to be a Supreme Court justice to understand that a California map that would turn Kamala Harris’s 58 percent vote share in 2024 into 94 percent of power in the House does not allow for equal participation in the political process. \n\nBut this is the price that Rucho is forcing millions of voters to pay: Roberts borrowed the language of judicial humility, warning of the potential dangers of cavalierly empowering federal courts to answer hypothetical questions that might be difficult. All he did is prevent federal courts from answering very real questions that are not.","summary":"This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM’s home for opinion and news analysis.

Jon Husted this week after Democrat Sherrod Brown, who represented Ohio in the Senate for almost 20 years before being unseated last year, announced he is running for Husted’s seat. \"Sherrod Brown’s recent announcement means Ohioans will face a clear choice in 2026,\" Jon Husted for Senate Communications Director Tyson Shepard told Fox News Digital. \"For 30 years, he has imposed Washington’s problems on Ohio, pushing radical liberal policies that have left a lasting burden on the next generation. Jon Husted offers the opposite approach, applying Ohio’s values and solutions to fix a broken Washington. The challenges our nation faces are the same ones Husted has helped our state confront and overcome, championing the values he learned growing up in northwest Ohio: hard work, personal responsibility, family, faith, freedom and patriotism.\" Republicans across the Buckeye State have echoed similar sentiments this week, expressing optimism that Husted, who was appointed to the Senate earlier this year by Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to fill the seat vacated when J.D. Vance left the Senate to become vice president, will defeat Brown next year. GOP SENATOR REVEALS WHY TRUMP'S 'COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT' WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR HIS MIDTERM RACE Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, who defeated Brown last year despite entering the race as an underdog in the polls, said on X this week, \"After 50 years of living off the tax payer, losing an election by a wide margin with $300 million in out of state money, abandoning working Ohioans to be Chuck Schumer’s lap dog, and sucking up to coastal elites, it’s time for @SherrodBrown to just go away.\" \"Ohio is lucky to have @SenJonHusted in the Senate!,\" Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan posted on X after Brown’s announcement. DeWine has commented on the race as well, calling Brown a \"formidable\" candidate but saying that he believes Husted \"will win.\" Ohio Republican Congressman Max Miller told AM 1420 The Answer this week that he has \"no idea what Brown is thinking getting back into this race\" adding, \"Men in women's sports, open borders, selling out to China? Ohioans don't like that.\" Republican leaders outside the state of Ohio are lining up behind Husted as well, including Senator and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott, who said about Brown on X, \"We beat him once. We’ll beat him again.\" TRUMP URGES TEXAS REPUBLICANS TO SWIFTLY PASS REDISTRICTING MAPS WHILE NEWSOM, CALIFORNIA DEMS COUNTER Support for Husted has also come from some corners of Ohio that historically would have been fond of Brown, who has championed himself as a candidate of the working class over the past 20 years, as evidenced by endorsements he received this week from the sheriff of Brown’s home county and an endorsement from the Northwest Ohio Building & Construction Trades Council (NWOBCTC), which represents 18 affiliated local unions and thousands of skilled workers across eight Ohio counties. \"More momentum for @JonHusted,\" Ohio Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who ran in the Republican primary to unseat Brown last year, posted on X in response to the Northwest Ohio Building & Construction Trades Council endorsement. \"While Sherrod Brown talks a big game his record tells a different story. He has toed the line for coastal elites focusing on their radical leftist agenda and ignoring the needs of Ohios working families. Jon actually fights for Ohio workers and this is a well earned endorsement!\" Brown, who spent over three decades representing Ohio in the House and later the Senate, was highly recruited by top national Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who made two trips to the Buckeye state to try and convince Brown to run again. 4 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN 2026 MIDTERMS TO EXPAND THEIR MAJORITY Husted, who has served as Ohio's Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State, has Trump's endorsement as he runs next year to fill the final two years of Vance's six-year term. \"I didn’t plan to run for office again, but when I see what’s going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown, who served as chair of the Senate Banking Committee during his tenure in D.C., said in a campaign launch video. Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), argued in a statement that \"no one fights harder for Ohio than Sherrod Brown. From securing Ohioans’ retirement and Social Security benefits to cracking down on fentanyl from China and Mexico, Sherrod will always do what’s right for Ohioans.\" The X account belonging to the DSCC has been actively touting Brown's announcement, labeling Brown as a candidate who is \"looking out for Ohio workers' and accusing Husted of \"selling out Ohioans’\" with his support for Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Ohio was once a top general election battleground state, but has turned increasingly red over the past decade. Trump carried the state by 11 points over then-Vice President Kamala Harris. But Brown outperformed the top of the ticket, losing to Moreno by less than four points. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The party not holding the White House typically experiences strong turnout in midterm elections and Democrats are optimistic about a strong showing with Trump not on the ballot to boost Republican turnout but Republican Vivek Ramaswamy running for governor of Ohio in 2026 could help alleviate that issue along with lingering negative attitudes toward the Biden administration. \"Having Sherrod on the ticket and asking Ohio voters who were strongly supportive of President Trump and the mission of our party, whether they want to go backwards, that’ll be a strong turnout argument for us with our party faithful in Ohio,\" Ohio Republican Party Chair Alex Triantafilou told Spectrum News. \"Because we cannot return to the days of Sherrod Brown and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\" Brown is the second top recruit Senate Democrats have landed this year, in addition to Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina, as they work to try and win back the chamber's majority next year. The GOP currently holds a 53-47 majority in the Senate.","summary":"GOP Sen.

If it were, then the 2024 presidential election in which Trump defeated Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris was not an honest election. Yet, it absolutely was, and Trump won it with the help of mail-in voting.\n\nWorries and concerns about fraudulent mail-in ballots are akin to seeing Bigfoot walk in the wild. It just doesn’t happen. Mail-in ballots are as secure as any other voting mechanism. Thinking otherwise is nothing but sheer paranoia. Why this baseless conspiracy still exists, especially after 2024, in which mail-in voting helped Trump win the presidential election, is mind-numbingly frustrating. \n\nLater, the president then made a post on Truth Social bashing mail-in voting, proclaiming that he was going to lead a movement to remove it.\n\nThe president’s post was rife with inaccuracies, including that the United States is the only country to use mail-in voting. That, of course, is not true. But the caveat in all of this is that it was mail-in voting that helped propel Trump to victory. He had a much better GOTV strategy and ground game in the 2024 presidential election, which prioritized utilizing mail-in voting. This strategy worked. Instead of rejecting it, Trump should use his political genius to embrace it and maximize it in his favor. \n\nMail-in voting became controversial during the 2020 presidential election that happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and many of his supporters believe that Democrats used mail-in voting to cheat, despite no legitimate or substantive claims showing exactly how it was done. No investigations showed rampant fraud with mail-in voting. And, the U.S. has used mail-in voting for years, long before the 2020 election. At no other time were there accusations of widespread voting fraud. \n\nSure, there should probably be some reforms implemented. It would probably make sense that if a voter was to choose the convenience of mail-in voting, then there should be requirements to have that ballot arrive before Election Day. However, that and other possible reforms, can be sorted out later. The crux of the matter is mail-in balloting helps people vote.\n\nFurthermore, if done correctly, with a cogent strategy and dedicated effort to maximing its return, mail-in voting can be weaponized to be a wonderful tool for Trump and other Republicans. It is a way to make voting more convenient, which could increase the number of people who vote in each election. This is a very good thing, and being the marketing guru and superb businessman that Trump is, there is no doubt in my mind that he can use it to his advantage. \n\nTrump should do what is right and beneficial. He should make mail-in voting great again.","summary":"President Donald Trump made an unexpected pivot earlier this week after his diplomatic outreach and foreign policy meetings to attempt to end the Russia-Ukraine war.
