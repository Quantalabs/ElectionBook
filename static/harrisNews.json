Walz gave a fiery speech on Monday in front of Democrats gathered for the party’s summer strategy meetings in Minneapolis, where Democratic leadership is attempting to unify a party riddled with internal division. During the speech, Walz, a progressive who served as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024, opined about his and Harris’ 2024 election loss, saying, \"We know [Harris] was the most qualified and would have been a fantastic president.\" \"We wouldn't wake up every day to a bunch of s--- on TV and a bunch of nonsense,\" he asserted. \"We would wake up to an adult with compassion and dignity and vision and leadership doing the work.

That's what we should be doing.\" Though doubling down on DEI, Walz criticized the media for reporting on Democratic infighting.

Have Trump attack","text":"On Monday, President Donald Trump took questions from reporters, where he ramped up his threats to send the National Guard to cities including Chicago and Baltimore after having done so in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles.\n\nOver the weekend, he threatened to cut off funding for the rebuilding of the Key Bridge if Maryland’s Democratic Gov. Wes Moore did not allow the National Guard into Charm City. Trump said that “African-American ladies ... beautiful ladies” encouraged him to send the guard into Chicago. \n\nUnsurprisingly, Illinois’ Gov. JB Pritzker pushed back, saying Illinois “has at this time received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have made no requests for federal intervention.” \n\n“Do not come to Chicago,’ Pritzker warned Trump.\n\nBut while Trump’s targeting of blue cities crosses the line from bullying Democratic officials to being authoritarian, despite his insistence he is not a dictator, the president might learn that this will only embolden governors and prime them to be his successors in the White House. \n\nAs Inside Washington has written in the past month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom saw his fortunes change largely after Trump targeted Los Angeles by sending in the National Guard without his consent and Marines into the state. Newsom responded by suing Trump. \n\nWhen Trump pressured Republican-led Texas to redraw its congressional map, Newsom went to his state’s legislature to pass a ballot initiative to allow for a redraw of California’s map in kind as a one-time break from the state’s bipartisan redistricting committee. \n\nThe results are now in showing that Newsom’s gambits have paid off in the eyes of Democratic voters. Last week, the University of California Berkley’s Institute for Governmental Studies released a poll showing that 51 percent of Californians approve of his performance and 43 percent disapprove. By comparison, in late April, he was at a dead even with 46 percent of Californians approving and disapproving of him. \n\nNewsom has never been a particularly strong electoral performer. In fact, in 2022, when he sought re-election, he underperformed Joe Biden’s 2020 performance. That essentially killed any chance of Newsom running in 2024. \n\nBut now, it’s fairly clear Democrats in his home state responded well to his fighting. Among Democratic voters as a whole, the Republican pollster Echelon Insights found that his favorability ticked up by three points and he now trails only Kamala Harris when asked who should be the party’s nominee. \n\nAnother example comes in New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. Like Newsom, she underperformed Biden in 2022 after she assumed the governor’s office when Andrew Cuomo resigned. During last year’s Democratic National Convention, Nancy Pelosi essentially blamed Hochul’s underperformance in New York in 2022 for Democrats losing the House of Representatives. \n\nHer polling was not that great either. In January, a Siena College poll showd 39 percent of New Yorkers had a favorable opinion of her and 47 percent had an unfavorable opinion. In New York City, 42 percent of residents had a favorable opinion of her and 41 percent had an unfavorable opinion. \n\nSince then, she has repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration. When Trump attempted to kill congestion pricing in New York City, she has responded in court. When masked federal officers put New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in handcuffs, Hochul showed up to ensure his safety.\n\nNew Yorkers seemed to positively respond. In a recent Siena College poll, 42 percent of New Yorkers have a favorable opinion of her and 50 percent of residents of New York City do. \n\nShe’s also made fighting Trump a staple of her re-election campaign. On Monday, she dropped a campaign ad depicting her clashes with Trump. \n\nAll of that likely means that Democratic governors probably wish that Trump would pick on them too. On Monday, Trump said that Moore told him “sir, you’re the greatest president of my lifetime.” \n\nMoore had a simple response on X.\n\nHe tweeted: “lol. Keep telling yourself that, Mr. President.”","summary":"As Trump goes after Illinois and Maryland, Eric Garcia breaks down the data to show how his attacks helped Gavin Newsom in California and Kathy Hochul in New York","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-newsom-wes-moore-pritzker-democrat-attacks-b2813711.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/25/15/22/SEI263303143.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NNhrpSMR-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-25 21:51:33","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.242},{"id":354243018,"title":"One Of ‘The View’s First Guests Back From Summer Break Will Be Must-Watch TV","text":"Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor will be one of the first guests to appear on “The View” when the co-hosts return from their hiatus in September.\n\nSotomayor will appear on the daytime talk show on Sept. 9, one day following the program’s season premiere, Variety reported on Monday.

AMID PLUNGING POLLS, ANEMIC FUNDRAISING, DEMOCRATS LOOK TO REBOUND AT PARTY'S SUMMER MEETING Martin, pointing to the forceful response by Democrats to moves this summer by Trump and Republicans to create more right-leaning U.S. House seats in states across the country through rare mid-decade congressional redistricting ahead of next year's midterm elections, said that he's \"sick and tired of this Democratic Party bringing a pencil to a knife fight.\" \"We cannot be the only party that plays by the rules anymore,\" he urged. Democratic Party leaders and officials face a multitude of problems as they try to escape the political wilderness. The party is trying to escape the political wilderness after last year's elections, when Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate and fell short in their bid to win back the House majority. And Republicans made gains with voters who make up key parts of the Democratic Party's base. DNC CHAIR TELLS FOX NEWS PARTY HAS HIT ‘ROCK BOTTOM’ But the situation has only worsened for the Democrats in the 10 months since last year's election setbacks. The Democrats' brand is deeply unpopular, especially with younger voters, as the party's poll numbers continue to drop to all-time lows in national surveys. The DNC faces a massive fundraising deficit at the hands of the rival Republican National Committee (RNC), fueled in part by major party donors cutting back their contributions as they express their frustrations with the national party committee. New voter data first reported last week by the New York Times showed Democratic Party registration plunging while GOP sign-ups were on the rise in the 30 states that register voters by party. \"There's no doubt that … we have work to do,\" Martin acknowledged in a sit-down interview this summer with Fox News Digital. But seeing a silver lining, he added that \"when you hit rock bottom, there's only one direction to go, and that's up, and that's what we're doing.\" On Monday, amid talk that Democrats remain divided over a slew of policy and political issues, Martin highlighted that \"in this big tent party of ours, we are unified towards one single goal, to stop Donald Trump and put this country back on track.\" LONGTIME TRUMP ALLY TAKES OVER CHAIRING REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota took aim at talk of the party's divisions. Klobuchar rejected the \"we suck club\" label and said \"we’re not getting into it when they try to divide us on every single issue online. Complaining about each other to each other – it isn’t how we win again.\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz took aim at media reports of the party's divisions, saying \"it boggles my damn mind that in the midst of a military takeover of our cities and the attempt to go into others, the flaunting of the rule of law, the coolness and the unconstitutional nature of the way they're attacking our neighbors, that the press finds the need to talk about, ‘oh, there's a division in the Democratic Party.’\" \"There's a division in my damn house, and we're still married, and things are good,\" Walz said. \"That's life. That's life. We are strong. We are strong because we challenge each other.\" Walz, who served as then-Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democrats national ticket last summer and autumn, slammed Trump as \"petty as hell.\" And he said Americans wake each morning to \"a man child crying about whatever's wrong with him.\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told the audience that he and fellow Democratic state attorneys general who've fought the Trump administration in court have \"sued this dude 44 times and we'll sue him 44 more and 44 more after that.\" \"We have sued Trump for gender-affirming care. We are not going to scapegoat the transgender community.\" Ellison highlighted. While the 2024 election has faded in the rearview mirror, Republicans have been relentless in characterizing Democrats as extreme leftists. Former RNC chair Michael Whatley, who formally stepped down last week as he runs for the Senate, argued in a Fox News Digital interview last week that the Democrats \"are moving further and further and farther to the left. They are walking away from Main Street right now. They are beholden to left-wing radical woke policies.\" \"They haven't learned a single thing from their election losses in 2024,\" Whatley claimed. RNC communications director Zach Parkinson, responding to Monday's DNC session, told Fox News that \"under Ken Martin’s leadership, Democrats have sunk to their lowest approval rating in 35 years, the DNC is still paying off millions in debt from Kamala Harris’ failed campaign, and Martin himself is actively supporting a communist for mayor of New York City. As Republicans, we think he is doing a fantastic job, and we fully endorse him to stay on as DNC Chair.\" The \"communist\" reference points to Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee in this year's New York City mayoral election. But despite all the problems and setbacks facing the Democrats, they have enjoyed some victories of late. Democrats have scored a slew of off-year and special election wins, ahead of next year's midterm elections, when the GOP will be defending its majorities in the House and Senate as the party in power will likely face historical political headwinds. Democrats have also landed some top recruits - former Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina and former Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, in two of the most crucial 2026 Senate races. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And while the Democratic Party's poll numbers are in the gutter, the approval and favorable ratings for Trump and the GOP are nothing to brag about. Plus, polls indicate that the so-called ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ which is the Trump-inspired massive Republican domestic policy, tax cuts and spending law, remains unpopular with Americans. \"We've already won, this year, 38 special elections…..We're winning all across this country, including in many places that haven't gone blue in generations,\" Martin touted. And he said that \"not all of these elections make national news, but I know that every race matters. Every inch of ground that we gain matters. Every single inch.\"","summary":"Democrats face fundraising deficits and low approval ratings but remain unified in opposing Trump, with DNC chair Ken Martin saying party has hit &apos;rock bottom.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-chair-demands-dems-stop-bringing-pencil-knife-fight-summer-meeting","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/ken-martin-dnc-summer-meeting1-minneapolis-aug.-25-2025.jpg.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6377364485112","publish_date":"2025-08-25 20:39:11","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":354243712,"title":"CBS looks to hire ‘ombudsman’ as part of Trump settlement — here are the hours and what it pays","text":"JOB OPENINGWanted: MAGA-leaning broadcast executive looking to serve as a news “ombudsman,” and make CBS News less of a mouthpiece of the Democratic Party.Stating Salary: $250,000 a year.Hours: One day a month.\n\nNot a bad gig — and it’s exactly what executives at CBS are searching for at the broadcaster, The Post has learned.\n\nThe position is part of a settlement agreement with President Trump’s media regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, which investigated whether the network’s Democrat-friendly political tilt violated FCC “public interest” guidelines.\n\nThe investigation centered on a controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election that Trump and many conservatives believed was edited to make Harris sound more coherent.Executives at the network are said to be making calls to gauge interest in the job.\n\nThe move to hire an executive to monitor and root out newsroom bias also comes as CBS got some good news in the investigation front: FCC chair Brendan Carr will not be ramping up a new probe into criticism that “60 Minutes” also took pains to edit out former President Joe Biden’s verbal incontinence during an earlier interview.\n\nFormer Paramount chief Shari Redstone is said to have settled a separate private lawsuit brought by Trump over the Harris editing — paying $16 million, with the new owners privately agreeing to run pro-MAGA public-service ads — over concerns discovery would lead to questions about the editing of the Biden interview that ran in October 2023, months before the former president dropped out of the race over questions about his stamina and mental agility.\n\nCBS isn’t looking for much from the ombudsman, at least that is how it now appears. Sources told me the work load would amount to about a day a month — which outside observers said was ridiculous. The salary would be in the low six figures, sound $250,000 a year, these people said.\n\n“I was told about the ombudsman job listing and said $250,000 is way too low given all the bias over there,” said one top telecom lawyer with direct knowledge of the matter. “You’re going to be working a lot more than one day a month.”\n\nA CBS press rep declined comment, as did an FCC official.\n\nThe FCC’s Harris investigation centered on whether CBS’s 60 Minutes unfairly edited the word-salad-prone Democratic presidential nominee to sound more coherent while she answered a policy question.CBS denied the charges, but the inquiry throttled its parent company Paramount’s $8 billion merger between CBS’s parent, Paramount and independent studio Skydance until the network gave into the FCC’s demands.\n\nThe creation of an ombudsman was a condition placed on the network by Carr to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which closed on Aug. 7. Other conditions include the end of Diversity Equity and Inclusion hiring practices.\n\nThe job search is being led by Jeff Shell, the new head of CBS News now that the merger is complete. CBS has agreed to have a mediator to handle complaints about the political leanings of its news for two years.\n\nThe ombudsman will report directly to Shell, a veteran TV executive, and not the FCC, The Post has learned.\n\nSo far, the network has been interviewing right-wing media executives at think tanks, people with knowledge of the matter say.\n\nThe FCC will be monitoring the effectiveness of the ombudsman in rooting out what conservatives, and Carr himself, considers wide-spread left-wing bias in the network’s news programming, people with knowledge of the matter tell The Post.\n\nSuch bias in local broadcast news can violate FCC fairness guidelines that apply to public airwaves as opposed to cable.\n\nThe FCC can deny local broadcast licenses and levy fines over violations of those rules.","summary":"The position is part of a settlement agreement with President Trump’s media regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, which investigated whether the network’s Democrat-friendly political tilt violated FCC “public interest” guidelines.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/25/media/cbs-looks-to-hire-ombudsman-as-part-of-trump-settlement/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/paramount-cbs-ombudsman.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1756134111&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kIb2Uf9S-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-25 20:36:06","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":354243016,"title":"Bill Maher Apparently Dumbfounded By Common Sense","text":"Bill Maher is seemingly shocked that Trump has used normal methods to sweep up a broad patchwork of different voters.

He also lamented friend-turned-foe Chris Christie’s appearance on ABC News’ “This Week,” saying that he “refused to take responsibility for these criminal acts.” On the show, the former New Jersey governor condemned the FBI raids against the president’s ex-national security advisor John Bolton.","summary":"\"At a minimum, they should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime,\" the president writes on Truth Social\n\n\nThe post Trump Says FCC Should Revoke ABC and &#8216;NBC Fake News&#8217; Licenses Over Unfavorable Coverage appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-wants-abc-nbc-fake-news-fcc-licenses-revoked/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/donald-trump-wsj.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 20:10:21","author":"Tess Patton","authors":["Tess Patton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":354229886,"title":"Dems being advised to cut out ‘woke words’ they tried forcing everyone to use is a rich irony","text":"The Dems have a novel strategy as they look towards 2028: sound normal.\n\nThis comes from a new policy memo, published online by left-leaning think tank Third Way, that suggested politicians scrap 44 words — such as “privilege,” “cultural appropriation,” “the unhoused,” “birthing person,” “Latinx” and “justice-involved” — from from their vocabulary ASAP.\n\nDems are a little late in realizing that everyday Americans are turned off by the academic gobbledygook that’s been coming out of politicians’ mouths. \n\nThe great irony is, after years of policing everyone else’s speech to enforce the standards of wokeness, Democrats now need to speech-police each other to sound less woke — that is, if they want to stop hemorrhaging popular support.\n\nThe memo breaks down alienating language into six categories, the first of which is “therapy speak.” Third Way advises that these words — such as “triggering,” “safe space,” “holding space,” “body shaming” and “centering” — condescendingly imply to voters that “I’m more empathetic than you.”\n\nSimilarly, “seminar room language,” the report claims, suggests “I’m smarter and more concerned about important issues than you” and “your kitchen table concerns are small.”\n\nThe terms that communicate that message include “subverting norms,” “systems of oppression,” “critical theory” and “Overton Window.”\n\nThis is the very sort of language that reveals that Democrats are no longer the party of the underdog. They have taken up the side — and the language — of the educated elite.\n\nThe report also advises getting rid of terms that suggest one is “beholden to groups, not individuals” and that “people have no agency,” such as “radical transparency,” “stakeholders,” “food insecurity,” “housing insecurity,” and “person who immigrated.”\n\nExplaining away crime is also a no-no, according to the report. Terms that suggest “the criminal is the victim” and “the victim is an afterthought” include “justice-involved,” “carceration,” “incarcerated people,” and “involuntary confinement.”\n\nKamala Harris has been known to use some of these now-banned phrases, including “incarcerated people” and “unhoused.”\n\nThird Way additionally suggests dodging any language that communicates to voters that “you will be called a racist if you do not use the latest and correct terminology,” such as “BIPOC,” “allyship” and “intersectionality.”\n\nSimilarly, language that suggests voters’ “views on traditional gender and gender roles are quaint at best” must also go.They include “inseminated person,” “chest feeding,” “cisgender,” “heteronormative” and “LGBTQIA+.”\n\n“Much of the language above is a red flag for a sizable segment of the American public,” the report asserts. “It is not because they are bigots, but because they fear cancellation, doxing, or trouble with HR if they make a mistake. Or they simply don’t understand what these terms mean and become distrustful of those who use them.”\n\nEven progressive nighttime host Jimmy Kimmel has come around to the same conclusion, saying of his own side on a podcast earlier this month: “It’s the loud voices that scare people from saying what they believe … A lot of their points are valid, but a lot of them are also just repulsive, in that they repel people. They go like, ‘Oh, you’re no fun. I don’t want to be around you.’”\n\nThis is all entirely true … but it might be too little too late.\n\nEveryday voters are fed up with years of finger-wagging and language policing, and the left has finally woken up to this reality. It only took two Trump victories — thanks in no small part to a growing multiethnic coalition — to wake them up.\n\nThe Democrats have ceaselessly poked fun at President Trump’s simple diction since he ran for office a decade ago, but by doing so they’ve ignored an important insight: The American people would rather elect someone who sounds like a family member at their kitchen table than a humanities professor at a liberal arts college.\n\n“We got to talk to people like real human beings,” Democratic Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear told Politico in February. “We’ve sanitized different language so significantly that, you know, people don’t feel like we’re talking to them … It’s hard to communicate when you’re not using some normal language.”\n\nPerhaps more Democrats will have the balls to stand up to the woke scolds in their own party. Maybe such resounding defeat and plummeting polling numbers will be a wakeup call. But, so far, the party has succumbed to fear of the mob and allowed the squeakiest wheels to seize control.","summary":"The Left has a novel strategy as they look towards 2028: sound normal.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/25/opinion/dems-nix-45-woke-words-from-vocab-privilege-birthing-person-latinx-intersectionality-and-more/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/110071054.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/drbmCQ5n-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-25 20:02:50","author":"Rikki Schlott","authors":["Rikki Schlott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":354249784,"title":"Hillary Clinton Laments ‘I Wish I’d Been Wrong’ About Trump as He Plans to Send Troops to Chicago","text":"Hillary Clinton lamented Monday that some of what she predicted for President Donald Trump’s second term one year ago is already coming true. \n\nThe former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee posted on X a side-by-side comparison of her prediction that Trump would militarize diverse cities in the name of “law and order” with screen-grabs of recent headlines from NBC News and The Washington Post about the president sending the national guard to Washington, D.C. and planning to do the same in Chicago. \n\n“On the left, my warning from September 2024 about what Trump 2.0 would look like.

Honestly, let that sink in.”\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson responded to Trump’s threats to send the national guard into his city on Sunday. \n\n“The governor, the Cook County board president and I are in complete alignment: Chicago is not calling for a military occupation of our city,” Johnson said in a statement. “We are currently evaluating all of our legal options to protect the people of Chicago from unconstitutional federal overreach … No matter what happens, the City of Chicago will not waver.

The governor’s rage-quit came at a time when the Democratic Party is suffering historic disapproval ratings and lacks a current party leader ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\n“Think of how easy it would be to be a damn Republican. Oh, what should I wear today? This stupid, frickin’ red hat,” Walz said. “What should I say today? I don’t know, just make sure it’s cruel. Who do we listen to? [President Donald Trump].

Vance. Ever since, Walz has attempted to stay in the public light by raging against the administration, including comparing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Gestapo in Nazi Germany during a commencement speech.\n\nThe former vice presidential candidate revealed in July that he will not run for president in 2028 and help ensure that whoever the Democratic nominee is wins.\n\nWalz also became angry at criticisms of his masculinity and stated on “This is Gavin Newsom” in March that he could “kick most [Trump supporters] ass[es]” in a fight. The Harris campaign attempted to present Walz as the down-to-earth Midwestern father who is passionate about masculine interests, though he failed to properly shoot a shotgun and misstated a common football term, despite being branded as the relatable football coach.\n\nDemocrats’ approval ratings have reached historic lows since the 2024 election. The Wall Street Journal found in July that 63% of voters view the Democrats unfavorably, the highest percentage in the WSJ’s polling dating back to 1990. An NBC News poll from March found that just 27% of voters had a positive view of the party, which was the party’s lowest rating since 1990, while a CNN survey discovered that Democrats’ favorability rating stood at 29%, which is the lowest recorded rating since 1992.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump also previously obtained a $15 million settlement with ABC over false statements made on air by George Stephanopoulos.\n\nCarr has made it clear that he supports Trump's battles against broadcast stations.\n\n\"For years, people cowed down to the executives behind these companies based in Hollywood and New York, and they just accepted that these national broadcasters could dictate how people think about topics, that they could set the narrative for the country—and President Trump fundamentally rejected it,\" Carr told NewsMax after the FCC announced its Paramount/Skydance merger approval. \"He smashed the facade that these are gatekeepers that can determine what people think.

It also accuses Apple of de-prioritizing \"super apps\" and AI chatbot competitors, including xAI’s Grok, in its App Store rankings, while pushing up OpenAI by integrating its ChatGPT chatbot into Apple products.\n\nThe complaint noted: \"Unless the court enjoins Apple and OpenAI's unlawful conduct, defendants will continue to thwart competition, and their competitors, like plaintiffs, will continue to suffer the anticompetitive consequences.\"\n\nPreviously, Musk cried on X and claimed: \"Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation.\"\n\n\"xAI will take immediate legal action,\" he added.OpenAI CEO Calls Out Musk, His Former Business PartnerIn response, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has been in a feud with Musk for years, said: \"This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.\"\n\n\"I hope someone will get counter-discovery on this, I and many others would love to know what's been happening,\" he added after posting an article to back up his claims. \"But OpenAI will just stay focused on making great products.\"\n\nMusk co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015, but left the startup three years later due to not seeing eye-to-eye over the company's direction.

The 54-year-old agreed to pay $500million and settle a lawsuit brought on by former Twitter employees, who accused Musk of not forking over their severance pay after he took over the company in 2022.\n\nTwo former staffers, Courtney McMillian and Ronald Cooper, had filed the original lawsuit against Musk, claiming Twitter's 2019 severance plan promised most employees at least two months of base pay plus a week of pay for every year of service. Senior staff were also owed six months of base pay.\n\nHowever, according to the lawsuit, most workers did not get paid at all.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44billion in 2022, changed the platform's name to X, and then cut around 6,000 jobs.Musk should just set up shop inside of a courtroom because he has also been ordered by a judge to face a lawsuit claiming he ran an illegal $1million election lottery during Donald Trump's 2024 election run.\n\nThe World's Richest Man is being accused of defrauding voters into signing a petition to support the U.S. Constitution, offering a chance to win cash.\n\nArizona resident Jacqueline McAferty claimed that Musk and America PAC induced voters in several battleground states to sign the petition, promising to choose one person per day to win $1million. The lawsuit, filed on November 5, 2024, Election Day, notes the voters never had a chance to collect the winnings.\n\nMcAferty claims voters were required to provide personal information, including their addresses and phone numbers.While Musk attempted to have the suit dismissed, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman, who was appointed by President Obama in 2014, pointed to other statements suggesting the defendants were \"awarding\" the money, and that the $1million could be \"won.\"\n\nMusk was not shy at all in his efforts to help Trump beat Kamala Harris in November, introducing his \"lottery\" to the country, but now it seems it will come back to bite him.","summary":"Two of Elon Musk's companies are suing OpenAI and Apple, accusing them of trying to 'monopolize' the AI market.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/elon-musk-sues-apple-openai-monopolizing-market-sam-altman/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/VBp_kMX1Q/0x0/musk-lawsuit-apple-openai-1756144334888.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 18:30:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":354212448,"title":"Tired of winning?

And it’s not because Trump’s wall has been completed, but because the president, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and border czar Tom Homan put down the hammer in warning anyone thinking of entering the country not to do so or risk being arrested and deported. \n\nFor context, that’s the number of migrants who crossed into the country under former President Joe Biden in December 2023. Overall, according to Customs and Border Protection, 10.8 million migrants were encountered entering the country illegally under the Biden-Harris administration, with millions more “gotaways” entering and not being encountered. \n\nThat’s the number of murders that occurred in the last 10 days in Washington, D.C., all thanks to Trump’s decision to employ National Guard troops in the district. \n\nDemocrats and many of their friends in the media, of course, reflexively opposed this decision. And once again, they’re on the wrong side of the issue.\n\nThat’s the number of D.C. residents who say crime is a serious problem, according to a recent Washington Post poll. Yet here’s what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said about Trump’s order:\n\n“I walk around all the time. I wake up early in the morning sometimes and take a nice walk as the sun is rising around some of the Capitol and the other monuments and things. And I feel perfectly safe,” claimed Schumer, all while failing to mention he has a security detail around him at all times for these early morning strolls.\n\nOn cue, the Washington Post attempted to push the narrative that everything is A-OK in Washington when it comes to crime before stepping on a large rake. \n\n“This is a safe city, but overhearing and witnessing gang threats and then watching the camera footage of the thuggery is disturbing,” said one resident quoted in a Washington Post story. But besides contradicting themselves in the same sentence, this same source hilariously would not provide their name out of concerns for their own safety. \n\n2.1 million and 2.4 million \n\nThe first number is the number of Democratic voters the party has lost from 2020 to 2024, according to voter registration numbers. As for 2.4 million, that’s the number of voters the Republican Party has gained in the same period. \n\nAnd that raises the question: Why is this happening? As we learned during the 2024 election, Trump has been able to co-opt core Democratic voters in the form of the Teamsters, the largest union in the country with more than 1.3 million members, which refused to endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris after endorsing previous Democrats, including Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former President Barack Obama. \n\nThe decision came after the 122-year-old organization released internal polling showing rank-and-file members supporting Biden over Trump by 8 points days before his own party forced him to drop out of the race. \n\nBut when the matchup became Trump vs. Harris, the same internal polling showed a seismic shift, with Trump topping Harris by a 27-point margin, 58% to 31%. If Trump were winning the Teamsters by that margin, it’s easy to deduce that the United Auto Workers also supported Trump over Harris due to her advocacy of electric vehicle mandates. It’s also easy to see restaurant workers unions going to Trump for first proposing no tax on tips before Harris lamely copied the idea. \n\nTrump also captured the highest percentage of the black vote in more than 50 years — 20%, up from 8% in 2016 — and 47% of the Latino vote, a huge improvement over his 2016 performance of just 28%. If Democrats expect to win any national elections again, they cannot do so without dramatically improving their numbers among these key groups. \n\nDemocrats in Congress are currently polling at 19% approval, according to a recent survey by Quinnipiac. \n\nOne reason: They’re trying to out-Trump Trump on social media. Exhibit A is Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). \n\n“A MESSAGE TO TRUMP,” wrote his press office on X recently. “Stop peddling the same lies you used in Los Angeles to infect other cities and states with your authoritarian regime. Stop using our honored military as pawns in your twisted game. Stop the theatrics and the attacks on our citizens.”\n\nIn other words, Newsom is against additional resources being deployed in Washington and would rather have America function more like California, which ranks in the top 10 of the “most dangerous states to live in” category, according to U.S. News & World Report. \n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), who has the maturity of a drunk sophomore on social media, disagrees. \n\n“Gavin Newsom has achieved the impossible — he has united a very divided America. THEREFORE, when we return to Washington, D.C. in September I will be NOMINATING him for the NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,” the congressman wrote on Saturday. \n\nWe’re truly governed by children. \n\n$515 million \n\nThat’s the amount of money Trump won’t have to pay the state of New York after a state appeals court ruled the fine violated the Constitution’s ban on excessive fines. This was a huge blow to New York Attorney General Letitia James, who literally ran for her position on taking down Trump without naming what crime she believed had been committed. \n\nJames herself is now under federal investigation for mortgage fraud after allegedly lying on loan applications to secure better loans, even going so far as to say she was married to her father and misrepresenting her residence. \n\n1.4 million \n\nThat’s the number of immigrants who have entered the country in the first six months of 2025, marking the lowest number in 55 years. \n\nThat’s what the Dow Jones closed at on Friday after jumping more than 800 points following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaling his willingness to lower interest rates in the near future (finally). The S&P and Nasdaq also closed at record highs. \n\nTrump has had an active eight months. \n\nThe border is secure. \n\nLawfare against him has miserably failed. \n\nThe economy and the markets are absolutely on fire. \n\nTrump is winning the tariff war (Canada dropped retaliatory tariffs this week).\n\nWashington, D.C., is far safer. \n\nTrump has gotten Putin and Zelensky to agree to a trilateral meeting. \n\nDemocrats are polling at record lows, dropping into the teens.\n\nInsider Advantage, the most accurate poll of the 2024 election, has Trump’s approval at 54%. \n\nThe blue team has no leader, unless Newsom’s snark tweets are your thing. \n\nWe may have just witnessed Trump’s best week yet. \n\nAnd the crazy thing is, there’s still more than 73 weeks left in his second term.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

He also said Thursday the administration would ideally be “re-grassing” parks and installing new sprinkler systems. (Subscribe to MR.

All of these actions are “brazenly political,” according to Axios. (RELATED: Here Are The Craziest Examples Of What’s Happening At The Smithsonian)\n\nSure, $2 billion might be a steep price tag for a D.C. facelift.

Madame President’s “visionary proposals to rebuild the cradle of democracy” are “uplifting citizens and inspiring a generation of children to defend the sanctity of American institutions,” they would likely report. And I would support it, too, even if it was her idea.\n\nBut, no, Axios wants to spin a worthy, bipartisan goal into a MAGA fever dream. Something tells me there are a lot of D.C. residents (maybe even some who work at Axios) who would quietly welcome any effort, whether from a Republican or Democratic administration, to revitalize the city’s infrastructure and parks.

Angie Craig and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan are getting serious in their fight to be the one who runs under the DFL Party banner for retiring Sen. Tina Smith’s seat.\n\nBoth candidates — veteran officeholders with impressive credentials — are well positioned to succeed Smith as Republicans are considered the underdogs in this contest. But first, they must battle each other for the support of Democratic voters in the state in what is expected to be a very costly and bruising primary fight.\n\nThe contest has been fairly subdued as both candidates have been focusing on raising campaign cash and establishing networks of support. But things are going to be noisier. \n\nCraig, D-2nd District, has during her six years in the U.S. House turned a “purple district” into a reliably Democratic stronghold. To help keep the district in Democratic hands, Craig highlighted her moderate stance and distanced herself from her party’s stance on policing, which sought reforms to curb abuses.\n\nGOP is underdog in Minn. senate race, but here’s who’s trying to flip seat\n\nCraig, 53, instead sponsored bills that would provide police forces more money and support. And in January, before Smith announced her retirement and the prospect of a Senate seat was in the offing, Craig voted for the first GOP bill put to a vote in the U.S. House this year.\n\nThat was the controversial Laken Riley Act, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented immigrant in Georgia. The bill, now law, directs federal authorities to detain and deport immigrants who are accused — not yet convicted — of specific crimes if they are in the country illegally.\n\nThose breaks with her party, although infrequent, could prove a liability with left-leaning activists who are likely to back true progressive Flanagan at next year’s DFL nominating convention.\n\nBut Craig said she’s not worried, pointing out that Gov. Tim Walz and his running mate Flanagan failed to win the DFL endorsement, as did former Gov. Mark Dayton.\n\nCraig said she’s going to compete for the endorsement, but will continue her campaign for the U.S. Senate if she fails to win it. “I feel very optimistic that I will be at the finish line to take on the Republicans,” she said.\n\nShe also said she is “committed to give all DFLers a chance to have a vote” on her candidacy in next August’s Democratic primary.\n\nNeeding the support of left-leaning Democratic voters, Craig is fashioning herself as a maverick who “raised hell” in the U.S. House and will challenge the decorum of the U.S. Senate.\n\n“You can’t get anywhere in Washington unless you shake things up,” she said.\n\nShe also said she’s a “battle-tested candidate” who has faced tough — and very well-funded — Republican challengers to keep the 2nd Congressional District in Democratic hands.\n\nThere are two major declared GOP candidates in the race, former NBA player Royce White and Adam Schwarze, a former Navy SEAL. Unlike the Democrats vying for Smith’s seat, neither Republican candidate has held political office before.\n\n“We have it as ‘Leans Democratic,’ but the Democratic field seems pretty clearly stronger than the Republican field,” said Kyle Kondik of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. \n\nKondik also said Craig has more experience running competitive races in a competitive congressional district “and she’s more in the mold of the kind of candidate national Democrats tend to prefer in statewide races.”\n\n“That said, in the context of 2026, I think either would be favored in a general election,” he said.\n\nA fight for DFL endorsement\n\nFlanagan, meanwhile, is supported by well-known progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. — who appeared with Flanagan at the State Fair over the weekend — and dependent on left-leaning grass roots. Yet, like Craig, the lieutenant governor is trying to avoid political labeling.\n\n“I consider myself more than anything to be pragmatic,” she said. “Most Minnesotans care about each other and getting things done.”\n\nYet, like Warren, Flanagan is an economic populist, saying the average American stands no chance in a system that favors the wealthy. “People think the economy is rigged right now,” she said. “It’s all of us versus the billionaires.”\n\nUnlike Craig, who is well known in her congressional district but less known in the rest of Minnesota, Flanagan, 45, has campaigned state-wide and been endorsed by state officials, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, state lawmakers and county commissioners.\n\n“I believe I’m going to get the DFL endorsement,” she said.\n\nFlanagan is also confident she can run a successful general election campaign, which would require support of moderate Democrats and independents in a state that is “blue,” but one in which Kamala Harris defeated Donald Trump by only about 4 percentage points.\n\nShe said she expects the support of “a lot of DFLers, but also a lot of people who are really freaked out about what’s happening in this country.”\n\nIn a dig at Craig, Flanagan said, “I am not of Washington; I am of Minnesota.”\n\nAnd she also pointed out that Smith served as lieutenant governor before she served in the U.S. Senate. But Smith was appointed to that seat after former Sen. Al Franken resigned — she did not win it through an election.\n\nDavid Schultz, political science professor at Hamline University, said that although Flanagan ran statewide, it was Walz who carried the load as far as campaigning. “There is very little evidence that a lieutenant governor makes a difference on a ticket,” Schultz said. “Voters were voting for Walz.”\n\nSchultz also said it’s common for the candidate who does not receive the party’s nomination to win political office. “More often than not, in the last 20 years the convention-endorsed candidate does not win the primary,” he said.\n\nHe also said Craig could claim success if she manages to keep Flanagan from winning the necessary support — 60% — of the delegates to snare the DFL endorsement. \n\nHardscrabble childhoods\n\nThere may not be a lot of light between the messaging of the Democratic rivals as they start their campaigns in earnest soon.\n\nBoth will attack Trump and GOP policies, especially the “big beautiful” bill that cuts social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps and ends clean energy tax breaks.\n\nAnd both candidates will make the economy, which appears to be weakening, a focus of their campaigns.\n\nCraig said she has traveled across Minnesota to introduce herself to the suburbs, cities and rural areas and has hit the “picnic circuit” all summer. “What (voters) are telling me is that they have a sense of economic anxiety,” she said.\n\nRelated: The race for Angie Craig’s US House seat is heating up\n\nBesides similar messaging on the campaign trail, Craig and Flanagan share something else — a hardscrabble childhood and ambitions and skills that led them to successful political careers. \n\nThey’ve also broken barriers, Craig as the first LGTBQ member of Congress from Minnesota and Flanagan as the first Native American Senate candidate from Minnesota.\n\nBoth women were raised by single mothers who depended on the social safety net.\n\nFlanagan, a member of the White Earth Nation, still lives in the Twin Cities suburb she grew up in, St. Louis Park, with her mother. She said that she suffered from severe asthma as a child and depended on Medicaid for medical help.\n\nFlanagan also said food stamps helped put food on the table at her home and that she is running for the Senate “because growing up I felt that the bottom could fall out at any minute.”\n\nCraig grew up in a trailer park in Arkansas and worked her way through college.\n\nShe found success — and affluence — in the business world as an executive at a medical device company.\n\nMeanwhile, Flanagan has made her mark in the political world and as an advocate, serving in the state House and as executive director of the Children’s Defense Fund-Minnesota.\n\nWith the U.S. Senate in play in next year’s midterm elections, whether Flanagan or Craig are on the general election ballot may not matter to national Democrats. They are likely to step in to help either candidate in a race that is estimated to cost at least $40 million.","summary":"As Minnesota’s political season kicks off with the State Fair, the focus is shifting to the marquee race for the Democratic nomination for Tina Smith’s seat.\n\n\nThe post Angie Craig and Peggy Flanagan flex their political muscles in race for U.S. Senate seat appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/national/washington/2025/08/angie-craig-and-peggy-flanagan-flex-their-political-muscles-in-race-for-u-s-senate-seat/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25226656795969-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 17:30:34","author":"Ana Radelat","authors":["Ana Radelat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.168},{"id":354201234,"title":"Mexican immigrant-turned-congresswoman blasts Dem claims Texas redistricting hurts Hispanic vote","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Former Rep. Mayra Flores, the millennial Republican who upset a border-district Democrat amid the Biden border crisis, said Texas redistricting is anything but disenfranchisement of minority voters as its critics claim. \"Four of the five new districts are actually Hispanic-majority districts. And, remember, in the previous map, the Democrats’ biggest complaint was that Hispanics were not represented well,\" Flores, who is rumored to be considering returning to Congress in 2026, told Fox News Digital. Flores said that beyond the crowing about mid-decade redistricting, the left’s complaints about the new district lines are driven purely by political concerns. \"They're upset because these Hispanics – they’re conservative Hispanics – have voted for President Trump. This map actually is more of a representation of what Texas is today,\" said Flores, who was born in Tamaulipas, what is now one of the most violent Mexican states in terms of cartel violence. It directly abuts her home district. AMERICA'S ORIGINAL SANCTUARY STATE REBUKE'S BONDI'S WARNING; DENIES OBSTRUCTION OF ICE In 2024, 12 of 14 Texas border counties flipped red and went for President Donald Trump, in part because of such concerns – including one that hadn’t gone Republican since 1912. In 2022, Flores won a special election for the then-34th District, but then lost the seat to Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in the next race. \"Conservative Hispanics contribute to the political landscape by supporting Republican candidates, policies; particularly on issues such as economic development, family values, religious freedom and, of course, border security,\" she said. She said liberal interests sued over the current maps, and that there is surprise over how many Hispanics in Texas actually support border security and conservative policies. Flores said Hispanics and Latinos are not a homogeneous voting bloc for the left, pointing also to Florida, where Latinos and other minorities came out in large numbers for Trump – and where two Cuban-American lawmakers, Reps. Maria Salazar and Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade are both Republicans. Politicians therefore need to seize the redistricting opportunity to make sure every congressional district is representative proportionally to their state’s political and ethnic makeup, she said. ABBOTT CLEARS FINAL REDISTRICTING HURDLE AS TEXAS SENATE PASSES NEW TRUMP-APPROVED MAP Critics point to New England – where no state currently has a Republican member of Congress, despite conservative pockets in places like Massachusetts, Maine, and Connecticut – as a prime example. By contrast, Democrats have lambasted the mid-decennial redistricting as a power grab orchestrated from afar by Trump. Democrats and liberal voices, however, disagreed with Flores’ assertions. \"The Don demanded. The Texas Legislature complied. Voters got hurt,\" blared a Monday editorial from the San Antonio Express-News. The paper accused Republicans of directly \"diluting\" Latino and Black representation in the new map by \"packing them into districts where they have more of a majority than needed to win representation of those seats\" or \"dispersing them into multiple districts where they lack the numbers to have a say in who their representatives are.\" BOSTON’S WU FIRES BACK AT BONDI, CITING REVOLUTION, AS OTHER CITIES SLAM FEDS OVER ‘SANCTUARY’ WARNINGS Along with other Democrats, the paper also referenced the new map’s merging of Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Gregorio Casar into the same district confines near Austin. Casar is a millennial \"Squad\" member and Doggett is, conversely, the longest-serving member of the state’s delegation. Doggett indicated last week he won’t run again if facing Casar. Casar told NPR the new map attempts to \"silence the voices of my constituents and get folks like me out of Congress,\" by adjusting Austin-area lines – and claimed it violates the Voting Rights Act. Additionally, Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, went about 55-45 for former Vice President Kamala Harris, but Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, is also among its political ranks. The county would see an increase in proportional representation for Republicans, according to reports.

In Maryland, lawmakers finally redrew what a judge called a \"broken-winged pterodactyl\" of a Democratic district that included several noncontiguous pieces of Baltimore suburbs. Flores said Texas, Florida, California and New York are worth revisiting on a congressional-districting basis if only for the trends of major ingress to the first two from the latter two states. \"We want to make sure that again every congressional district is a representation of the overall state and for critics to say that this [Texas] map silences the voices of minorities when four of the five of them you map are actually Hispanic majority,\" Flores said. \"Look, Hispanics are switching toward the Republican Party and will continue to support the Republican Party because the Democrat Party has gone so far left, and you would think that after 2024, they would have learned their lesson and they would come more to the middle,\" Flores said. \"Let’s see what happens in the 2026 midterms.\"","summary":"Texas redistricting creates Hispanic-majority districts as border counties flip Republican, sparking debate over minority representation and voting rights.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mexican-immigrant-turned-congresswoman-blasts-dem-claims-texas-redistricting-hurts-latino-vote","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/trump-mayra-flores-tx.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6350602244112","publish_date":"2025-08-25 17:08:41","author":"Charles Creitz","authors":["Charles Creitz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":354189468,"title":"The fall’s 10 most anticipated books, from Pynchon to (Priscilla) Presley","text":"By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Fall books mean more than literary fiction. The top releases this season range from a fairy tale newly told to memoirs about a famous writer’s indomitable mother and life after marriage to a famous rock star. Some books were a decade or more in the making, while former Vice President Kamala Harris’ “107 Days” was finished in a matter of months.\n\nHere are 10 new books to look for.\n\n“Hansel and Gretel,” Stephen King\n\nYou may think you know the Grimms’ fairy tale about two children lost in the woods. But a new edition this fall promises a fresh and modern take: the words are by Stephen King and the illustrations from the archives of the late Maurice Sendak, who had worked on a 1990s opera adaptation. Warns King in the book’s introduction: “You will say that I have taken liberties with the story told by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm — I have, and I don’t apologize.” (Sept. 2)\n\n“Mother Mary Comes to Me,” Arundhati Roy\n\nArundhati Roy’s memoir offers anguished tribute to her longtime tormentor and heroine: her late mother, Mary Roy, the educator and activist who founded a renowned high school in India and otherwise rarely missed a chance to disparage but still inspire her famous daughter. “I had constructed myself around her,” the author writes. “I had grown into the peculiar shape that I am to accommodate her. I had never wanted to defeat her, never wanted to win. I had always wanted her to go out like a queen.” (Sept. 2)\n\n“The Wilderness,” Angela Flournoy\n\nAngela Flournoy’s acclaimed debut, “The Turner House,” was set around an aging family home in Detroit. In “The Wilderness,” she traces the cross-country lives of five Black women from youth to middle age. The author also offers a mini-tour of airports, from the underwhelming sites of landing at Charles de Gaulle in Paris to the view of pyramids in Cairo. A universal truth, she writes: “If the surrounding city has a decent Black population, then a good number of them will be working at the airport.” (Sept. 16)\n\n“107 Days,” Kamala Harris\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster is promising a compelling campaign memoir from former Vice President Kamala Harris that addresses “everything we would want her to address.” That presumably includes Harris’ thoughts on the mental and physical condition of President Joe Biden, whose decision to withdraw his candidacy led to Harris’ historic, frantic and unsuccessful run against Republican Donald Trump. Harris has called the book, written with the assistance of Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Geraldine Brooks, the result of looking back “with candor and reflection.” (Sept. 23)\n\n“The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” Kiran Desai\n\nKiran Desai’s first novel in nearly 20 years, since her Booker Prize-winning “The Inheritance of Loss,” is on the Booker longlist and is also a story of contrasting lives: a successful novelist returning to her native India and a New York-based journalist — a copy editor for, of all places, The Associated Press. (Desai has not yet named a real-life counterpart as inspiration.) Separated by geography, they are connected by the will of their families, who would very much like to arrange a marriage. (Sept. 23)\n\n“Softly, As I Leave You,” Priscilla Presley\n\nPriscilla Presley has been so defined by her years with Elvis that the 2023 biopic “Priscilla” ends with their breakup in 1973. But readers of “Softly, As I Leave You” will learn that she forged a long and successful career on her own. She was Bobby Ewing’s ex-fiancee, Jenna Wade, in “Dallas” and the love interest for Leslie Nielsen in the “Naked Gun” spoofs. (Presley appears briefly in the current remake.) She even revealed a knack for marketing. When Elvis’ Graceland estate was in disrepair in the years following his 1977 death, she opened it to the public and helped make the property among the world’s most popular tourist destinations. Currently in a legal battle with a former business partner, Presley also writes of enduring other tragedies besides the death of her ex-husband, notably the loss of daughter Lisa Marie Presley two years ago. (Sept. 23)\n\n“We Love You, Bunny,” Mona Awad\n\nSix years ago, Canadian author Mona Awad’s bestselling “Bunny” was praised by Margaret Atwood, among others, for its blend of horror and academic satire set around a clique of creative writing students who call each other “Bunny.” In her follow-up novel, onetime outsider Samantha Heather Mackey is herself a bestselling author and the bunnies have a few things to say about her material. “So funny that you described me as a maniacal hair braider,” one of them tells her. “I laughed until I cried blood.” (Sept. 23)\n\n“The Impossible Fortune,” Richard Osman\n\nRichard Osman is an all-around success story, an author, producer and personality who has been a fixture for years in British television. He now enjoys critical acclaim and millions of sales as the creator of the “Thursday Murder Club” mystery novels, in which four pensioners in a retirement community take on cases new and old. The fifth in the series, “The Impossible Fortune,” blends wedding plans and a sudden disappearance that has Osman’s sleuths in search of answers. (Sept. 30)\n\n“Shadow Ticket,” Thomas Pynchon\n\nThomas Pynchon’s latest novel is his first in more than a decade. Now 88, the author most famous for the epic “Gravity’s Rainbow” has rarely settled for a simple storyline. Like his comic novel “Inherent Vice,” there’s a detective at the center of the narrative, one Hicks McTaggart, who will “find himself also entangled with Nazis, Soviet agents, British counterspies, swing musicians, practitioners of the paranormal, outlaw motorcyclists, and the troubles that come with each of them.” (Oct. 7)\n\n“Unfettered,” John Fetterman\n\nFew Washington legislators are more recognizable than Sen. John Fetterman, the 6-foot-8-inch, hoodie-wearing Pennsylvania Democrat whose physical and mental health struggles and his battles with both Republicans and his own party have kept him in the news since he ran for the Senate in 2022. His publisher, Crown, is calling “Unfettered” a “raw and visceral” and “unapologetic account of his unconventional life.” (Nov. 11)","summary":"Some books were a decade or more in the making.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/08/25/most-anticipated-books-fall/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Books-Fall-Preview-Guide_36427.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 16:55:03","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.361},{"id":354189472,"title":"Fall is books’ biggest season.

George Packer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist, will publish his first novel since the 1990s, “The Emergency.”\n\n“The Land of Sweet Forever” compiles stories and essays from the late Harper Lee, who in 2015 stunned the world by authorizing the release of “Go Set a Watchman,” a precursor to her classic “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Fiction also is expected from Patricia Lockwood, Ian McEwan, Thomas McGuane, Gish Jen, Ken Follett and John Irving, while two Booker Prize winners will have memoirs out: Margaret Atwood has written “Book of Lives: A Memoir of Sorts” and Arundhati Roy, best known for “The God of Small Things,” will publish “Mother Mary Comes to Me.”\n\nSome books arrive highly anticipated, even if the wait was relatively short. R.F. Kuang’s “Katabasis” is her first novel since the bestselling satire “Yellowface,” which came out in 2023. Megha Majumdar follows her acclaimed debut from 2020, “A Burning,” with “A Guardian and a Thief.” Salman Rushdie’s story collection, “The Eleventh Hour,” is his first book of fiction since he survived a stabbing attack in 2022.\n\n“We Love You Bunny,” the follow-up to Mona Awad’s dark campus satire from 2019, “Bunny,” is a meta-tale of a novelist gone viral.\n\n“No book has stuck with me longer than ‘Bunny.’ I missed the fever-dreamy world of it so much,” Awad wrote in an email. “I think part of the reason had to do with the incredibly creative and rich reader response, which I still can’t believe. It kept the story alive and expanding in my head and I felt compelled to return.”\n\nThrills, chills, romance\n\n“Gone Before Goodbye” pairs Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon with master thriller writer Harlan Coben. “Da Vinci Code” author Dan Brown brings back protagonist Robert Langdon in “The Secret of Secrets,” and “Exit Strategy” is the latest Jack Reacher novel from brothers Lee and Andrew Child. Richard Osman’s “Thursday Murder Club” series continues with “The Impossible Fortune” and Mick Herron has written his ninth “Slough House” book, “Clown Town.”\n\nChild-friendly tension will arrive in a new edition of “Hansel and Gretel,” as written by Stephen King, with illustrations from the archives of the late Maurice Sendak.\n\nNew romance and romantasy is expected from Tessa Bailey, Harley Laroux and Ana Huang, whose “The Defender” is the second book in her “Gods of the Game” series. Ali Hazelwood follows her paranormal hit “Bride” with “Mate” and Brynne Weaver begins the “Seasons of Carnage” series with a tale of serial killers in love, “Tourist Season.” Erin A. Craig, known for such scary tales as “House of Salt and Sorrows,” has written “A Land So Wide.”\n\nCelebrities telling all\n\nPriscilla Presley’s “Softly, As I Leave You” continues her story from the memoir “Elvis and Me,” which ended with their breakup and Elvis’ death, in 1977. (The book was completed before her current legal battle with a former business partner). Michael J. Fox remembers the ’80s in “Future Boy,” Paul McCartney looks back on his post-Beatles work in “Wings” and Patti Smith reflects on childhood, love and grief in “Bread of Angels.”\n\nMemoirs also are coming from Lionel Richie and Anthony Hopkins, Kenny Chesney and Cameron Crowe. Charlie Sheen opens up about his scandalous life in “The Book of Sheen” and Emmy-nominated actor Cheryl Hines, wife of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is scheduled to release “Cheryl Hines Unscripted.”\n\n“With humor, wisdom, and unflinching honesty, Cheryl navigates the highs and lows of fame, family, and an unexpected foray into politics — complete with twists no one saw coming,” the publisher, Skyhorse, describes her book.\n\nA break from Washington\n\nPublishers have said that they didn’t expect books on President Donald Trump to have the same appeal as they did during his first term; apart from Jonathan Karl’s election chronicle “Retribution” and Scott Jennings’ “A Revolution of Common Sense,” few fall titles center on him and few so far are in the pipeline for 2026.\n\n“Readers are looking more for books on the economy and geopolitical landscape than they are on anything more current in politics,” says Barnes & Noble’s director of books, Shannon DeVito, citing Andrew Ross Sorkin’s “1929,” about the stock market crash; and Joyce Vance’s “Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual for Keeping a Democracy.”\n\nSome prior administrations will be heard from. Former Vice President Kamala Harris has completed “107 Days,” about her hurried 2024 campaign. “Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines” is a memoir from a White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, Karine Jean-Pierre, who has since announced her departure from the Democratic Party. Former first lady Michelle Obama’s latest looks back on her life — or at least what she has worn — in the illustrated fashion memoir “The Look.”\n\nA handful of books anticipate next year’s 250th anniversary of U.S. independence. “The American Revolution: An Intimate History,” by Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward, is a companion to Burns’ upcoming documentary. Walter Isaacson’s “The Greatest Sentence Ever Written” looks in depth at the Declaration of Independence. Donald Sassoon’s “Revolutions: A New History” documents the worldwide impact of America’s break from Britain. Joseph Ellis’ “The Great Contradiction” probes the flaws and virtues of Thomas Jefferson and other founders.\n\nOther works will reflect on the war in Gaza, which nears its second anniversary, with releases ranging from former Hamas captive Eli Sharabi’s “Hostage” to diary excerpts from Palestinian Plestia Alaqad, “The Eyes of Gaza.”\n\nPoetry old and new\n\n“The New Book” compiles final words from poet Nikki Giovanni, who died last year. Ada Limón’s “Startlement” is her first collection since her term as U.S. poet laureate ended last spring, while former laureate Billy Collins is releasing “Dog Show,” which features watercolor drawings by Pamela Sztybel.\n\n“The Poems of Seamus Heaney” collects all of the work by the late Nobel laureate and “Only Sing” features more than 100 unpublished works by the late John Berryman. Harryette Mullen, Anne Waldman, Leila Chatti, Roque Raquel Salas Rivera and Chet’la Sebree are among the contemporary poets with books out this fall.\n\nVisions of the future\n\nYou could fill a shelf, or an e-reader, this fall just with notable books on climate change, from Neil Shea’s “Frostlines” to Elizabeth Kolbert’s “Life on a Little-Known Planet: Dispatches from a Changing World.”\n\nIn “The Long Heat: Climate Politics When It’s Too Late,” authors Andreas Malm and Wim Carton examine our failure so far to prevent rising temperatures and what, if anything, is possible now, while warning of a “rough ride over the coming decades.” Environmentalist Bill McKibben, a self-described “hard realist” who has been writing about climate change for decades, has completed “Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization,” in which he challenges both climate deniers and those who say catastrophe is inevitable.\n\n“We’re not going to stop global warming, that’s no longer on the menu, but we can still talk about whether we can stop it from cutting off civilization,” McKibben told The Associated Press, citing the dramatic reduction in costs for solar power and other forms of energy he believes no longer should be called “alternative.”\n\n“People are used to thinking of solar and wind as the Whole Foods of energy — nice, but pricey.

Crime was falling, and a moderate new mayor was celebrating progress toward a downtown recovery.\n\nThat changed Friday, when Trump added the city to the list of places where he might send in the National Guard, which he had already done in Washington and Los Angeles.\n\n“You look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco — they’ve destroyed it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “We can clean that up, too — we’ll clean that one up, too.”\n\nThe idea that San Francisco was back in the president’s crosshairs was immediately shrugged off by some local leaders.\n\n“It’s a lot of bluster and insanity,” said Nancy Tung, the chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party.\n\n“If he wants to try to roll a tank down Lombard Street, go ahead,” she said, referring to the city’s famously serpentine street. “We’re ready.”\n\nSeeking to project a tough-on-crime image and railing against “bloodthirsty criminals,” Trump ordered National Guard members to Washington last week, even though violent crime has fallen recently there. In June, Trump deployed them in Los Angeles over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, suggesting they were needed to restore order during chaotic protests over deportations.\n\nFor a while, it seemed that San Francisco might have fallen off Trump’s radar. Seven months into Trump’s second term, San Francisco had generally avoided his rhetorical wrath and the militarization that took place elsewhere. Even when he took aim at a wider list of Democratic enclaves last week after first singling out Washington, Trump mentioned New York, Chicago, Baltimore and Oakland, California — but not San Francisco.\n\nAt the time, San Francisco leaders said they were watching the administration warily. Some said it was possible the city had been ignored because it had already begun embracing a law-and-order approach before Trump returned to office.\n\nFed up with homelessness problems, drug-plagued neighborhoods and a wave of property crime, San Francisco voters veered toward the middle in the past several elections. They recalled three school board members and a progressive prosecutor who had eliminated cash bail, and they backed a ballot measure giving police more power.\n\nMost notably, voters last year ousted San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, in favor of Daniel Lurie, a nonprofit leader and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune who made cracking down on crime and reducing homelessness staples of his campaign.\n\nLurie, unlike other California leaders, has avoided national issues and has refused to utter Trump’s name this year.\n\nThat held true even Friday, when the mayor ignored Trump’s threat.\n\n“My administration has made safe and clean streets our top priority, and the results are clear: Crime is at its lowest point in decades, visitors are coming back, and San Francisco is on the rise,” Lurie said in a statement.\n\nBilal Mahmood, an elected city supervisor who represents the Tenderloin, a low-income neighborhood that has long struggled with drug markets, had a decidedly different response for the president.\n\n“Donald Trump is a coward,” Mahmood said. “San Francisco is actually on the upswing, and he’s afraid of Democratic cities doing better.”\n\nTrump did not offer specifics on sending National Guard troops to San Francisco, and there is no guarantee he will ever do so. When a reporter in the Oval Office asked whether he had taken “concrete steps” to deploy troops in Chicago, another city he mentioned Friday, the president said he had not.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Trump can use federal troops to police cities outside Washington, where he has greater federal authority. The question has been litigated in federal court ever since he sent the National Guard to Los Angeles, and California lawyers have argued that the president could use soldiers only to protect federal buildings, not to serve domestic law enforcement functions.\n\nAsked by The New York Times earlier this week why Trump had focused less on San Francisco this year, a White House official said that the president’s naming of specific cities was simply focused on where crime was highest. (The cities he mentioned do have some of the country’s highest crime rates, but Trump also omitted high-crime cities in Republican states, like Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis.)\n\n“There are no theories, just the truth: President Trump wants every innocent, law-abiding American across the country to be safe — no matter what city they live in or who is in charge,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nCritics have often overlooked the fact that San Francisco’s violent crime rates were lower than in other major cities and that most of its homeless encampments and open-air drug use have been concentrated in a handful of neighborhoods near the city core.\n\nLurie’s approach has not been drastically different from that of Breed — who took a tougher posture on crime after the pandemic — though he has cracked down on handing out of drug paraphernalia and helped spur more economic development downtown. But he has been able to claim credit for trends that were already headed in a favorable direction for San Francisco: Demand for office space is ticking up, crime rates are down, fentanyl dealer arrests are up, and a tally of homeless tents in June found the lowest number since the pandemic.\n\nA plurality of residents have said in polls that life in San Francisco is improving. Lurie has been a ubiquitous presence on social media, filming cheery videos of himself all over the city, including one of him wearing a wetsuit to surf at Ocean Beach.\n\nHe concludes most videos with a similar refrain: “Let’s go, San Francisco!”\n\nOf course, many of the city’s problems remain: San Francisco’s downtown recovery lags behind those of other cities, overdose deaths from fentanyl remain high and its signature mall is nearly dead.\n\nTrump had not entirely ignored San Francisco this year. He threatened to defund the Presidio, a popular San Francisco park on federal land, and to turn Alcatraz Island back into a prison, though both ideas have so far made little progress. His administration stripped the name of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a former San Francisco supervisor, from a naval ship. And federal agents have aggressively arrested immigrants outside a downtown courthouse and clashed with protesters.\n\nStill, the president’s relative silence on San Francisco — until Friday — was a far cry from recent years, when Trump claimed without evidence that used needles from the city were flowing into the Pacific Ocean and suggested that former Vice President Kamala Harris, who got her start in California politics before facing Trump in last year’s election, had turned San Francisco into a “practically unlivable place.” During a 2023 debate with Newsom, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida memorably held up a map of the city depicting places where people had defecated on public streets.\n\nSome Democrats had offered a different explanation for how Trump was choosing his targets: Race played a major role, they said. Black Democratic politicians, including mayors of the cities he cited, had called out the fact that four cities that Trump mentioned on his target list, along with the two cities to which he has sent National Guard troops, all have Black mayors and large Black populations.\n\n“I know dog whistles when I hear them,” said Barbara Lee, the former member of Congress who was elected as Oakland’s first Black female mayor this year.\n\nOakland’s crime rates are higher than those of many other cities, including San Francisco, but Lee noted that they had been dropping. “It’s just downright fearmongering, and it’s wrong,” she said of Trump’s targeting her city.\n\nThe White House said that crime rates, not race, were factoring into which cities Trump was mentioning.\n\nSan Francisco progressives like Aaron Peskin, a former supervisor who ran for mayor last year, suggested that Trump had largely held his fire until now because wealthy, right-leaning tech executives were gaining influence over local politics. One of them, David Sacks, advises Trump on artificial intelligence and hosted a fundraiser for him last year in the city’s so-called Billionaire’s Row neighborhood.\n\nBut Peskin said Lurie would not be able to avoid the president forever.\n\n“At some point, San Franciscans are going to wake up and say, ‘We demand, Mr. Mayor, that you stand up to Donald Trump,’” he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"SAN FRANCISCO >> President Donald Trump had largely left San Francisco alone this year as he targeted Democratic-led cities and insisted that federal troops were needed to restore order.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/25/breaking-news/after-months-silent-trump-targets-san-francisco-over-crime/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/web1_20250825_brk_san01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 16:15:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":354191360,"title":"Dem Voters Snub ‘Irrelevant’ DNC In Favor Of Far-Left ‘No Kings’, Party Activist Says","text":"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has been facing a slew of struggles this year, the first under chairman Ken Martin’s leadership, CNN reported on Monday.\n\nMartin is grappling with mounting criticism from some members of his own party as the DNC has struggled with lackluster fundraising and growing infighting this year, according to CNN. The report comes after the DNC reported having $15 million on hand by the end of June, compared to the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) $80 million.\n\nSome anonymous sources told CNN that the DNC is also paying former President Joe Biden’s legal expenses for the House Oversight Committee’s investigation into his mental acuity during the time he served in the White House. Biden’s legal fees have already hit hundreds of thousands of dollars, one of the anonymous sources told the outlet. (RELATED: David Axelrod Claims Dems Uphold ‘Norms’ — But Reality Tells Different Story)\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris’ failed 2024 presidential campaign has also racked up millions in debt, CNN reported. Tory Gavito, a Democratic activist and president of Way to Win — a Democratic donor network — told CNN she thinks that the DNC has become “almost irrelevant.”\n\n“The party isn’t where the heart of the movement is,” Gavito told the outlet, instead highlighting recent protest movements such as the far-left, anti-Trump “No Kings” protests in June.\n\n“There is a lot of energy around thinking about what comes next, how to win, and how we govern, and none of it has been sort of captured yet within the party, and so that’s going to be their big charge moving forward,” Gavito added.\n\nMartin said in an interview with CNN that he knew before he stepped into his role as DNC chair that it would be a “thankless job,” adding that the gig is the “political equivalent to being a fire hydrant.”\n\n“You get pissed on by everyone,” Martin told CNN. “You get none of the credit when you win. You get all the blame when you lose. And if you’re doing your job right, you’re saying no more than you’re saying yes.”\n\n“I could give a shit about people right now in terms of people who are pissing on me, because at the end of the day, I have one goal. And that is winning elections,” Martin told the outlet, adding later, “I didn’t run to come here and ask folks in D.C. for permission to do things the same way that they’ve always been done.”\n\nStill, some Democratic state party chairs and other Democrats told CNN they think Martin is doing a good job as DNC chair. Moreover, Martin told CNN he feels “honored” to help cover Biden’s legal expenses for the House Oversight Committee probe.\n\n“It’s the least we could do for his service to our country and to our party,” Martin added.\n\nStephanie Cutter, who served as a senior adviser to Harris’ presidential campaign, has also been brought on to advise on the DNC’s response to the Oversight Committee investigation, according to CNN.\n\n“Would I prefer not to be in that position? Sure,” Martin told CNN. “But you know, at the same time, this is part of our job and responsibility to help our candidates in their campaigns, and we’ll continue to do that.”\n\nAllison Minnerly, a new Gen Z DNC member from Florida, told CNN that she thinks the committee has become too focused on “general things” that average Americans “would not care about.”\n\n“Whether it’s neutrality clauses or they’re focused on different amendments to our bylaws,” Minnerly, 26, told the outlet, “they’re focused on just general things an everyday person would not care about.”\n\nSome Democrats have expressed concern over an Aug. 20 New York Times report analyzing voter registration data which showed the Democratic Party lost about 2.1 million registered voters between the 2020 and 2024 elections, while the Republican Party added 2.4 million registered voters between 2020 and 2024. (RELATED: Democrat-Leaning Firms Reveal Just How Bad Dems Are Polling On Immigration)\n\nMoreover, an anonymous former DNC officer told CNN that Martin has now “made himself pretty irrelevant” after all the promises he made when he won the DNC’s chairmanship election in February.\n\n“He [Martin] won by playing a lot of small ball — and this is not a time for small ball,” the former DNC officer told CNN. “This is a time for us to be surgical and ruthless, and he’s made himself pretty irrelevant because of all the promises he made.”\n\nLiberal think tank Third Way released a memo Thursday listing 45 words and phrases they want Democrats to steer clear of using because “no ordinary person would ever dream of” saying them. Similarly, some working-class Americans who previously voted Democrat have claimed that they think the Democratic Party is “fighting for everyone else” besides them.\n\nMartin wrote in a February memo that Democrats need to “remind working Americans – and also show them every day – that the Democratic Party always has been and always will be the party of the worker.” \n\nThe DNC did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

No cash, come back in a couple of months and we'll give you a trial. You never see the person again,' Trump said. \n\n'They kill people and they get out. Cashless bail,' he commented.\n\n'We are ending it. We're starting by ending it in DC, and that we have the right to do through federalization,' he added. \n\nTrump promoted his efforts as something that both Republicans and Democrats should support, urging Congress to make the reforms nationwide.\n\n'By the way, the prison they have in DC is horrible,' he said, presumably warning future offenders against committing crimes in the city.\n\nIllinois is at the top of the list, said Trump's staff secretary Will Scharf as he handed the order to the president to sign. \n\nThe order will also push for law enforcement to put arrested suspects in DC in federal custody rather than local police custody, preventing them from getting released. \n\nCashless bail was enacted by Washington, DC in the 1990s, as a early adopter of pioneering justice reform policies. Advocates argue that cash bail policies are draconian and place a heavy burden on low-income communities. \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris was also a proponent of enacting cashless bail, campaigning for the idea in the 2024 election. \n\nBut Trump has criticized cashless bail for allowing dangerous criminals to go free and failing to incentivize them to show up for their court hearings.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump criticized cashless bail as 'nonsense' and blamed it for increasing crime in America's major cities.\n\n'We want to make it so that people, if they murder somebody, they're in jail, they don't get out on no bail,' he said.\n\nA study in California earlier this year found 70 percent of suspects released on zero-dollar bail, reoffended. The state recently ended its current money bail system.\n\nThe data showed suspects released on zero-dollar bail were twice as likely to be rearrested for felonies and three times as likely to be rearrested for violent crimes compared to those who had to post bail, CBS News reported.\n\nThe president celebrated his successful federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington, DC, boasting there were 'zero murders' in the city in recent days. \n\n'We're at a point where Washington is booming again,' Trump said, sharing a story of the son of someone he knew choosing to spend three nights in the city to enjoy the restaurants, museums, and night life.\n\nVice President JD Vance criticized the Democratic leaders of major cities of suffering from 'sickness in the head' by protesting Trump's proposal to send in the National Guard to help reduce violent crime. \n\n'Why are they more angry about federal law enforcement cleaning up streets other than the fact the streets need to be cleaned up to begin with?' Vance asked.","summary":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday to eliminate cashless bail for people arrested in Washington, DC, and other crime-ridden cities.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15032073/Trump-enacts-bold-new-cashless-bail-order-change-American-prison-forever.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/25/16/101527181-0-image-m-16_1756134818135.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 15:50:55","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.394},{"id":354166238,"title":"“Moderate is the new Republican”: Woman warns men are lying about who they voted for on dating apps","text":"A TikTok from creator @kellymacj has the app debating politics and dating after she shared how she spent two months with a man who misrepresented his vote in the 2024 election, claiming he supported former Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential run, when in fact, he had actually cast his ballot for President Donald Trump. \n\nShe ended the relationship immediately after his confession, though her video prompted wider debate online about whether “moderate” has quietly become code for “Republican” on dating apps, and why some men are lying about their politics to pursue liberal women in the first place.\n\nAre more conservatives lying about who they voted for?\n\nLast Monday, TikToker @kellymacj posted a video about the two months she wasted dating a man she thought she could have a future with.

IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEY ARE SIMPLY AN ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND SHOULD, ACCORDING TO MANY, HAVE THEIR LICENSES REVOKED BY THE FCC,” Trump blared on Truth Social in a Sunday night post. “I would be totally in favor of that because they are so biased and untruthful, an actual threat to our Democracy!!!”\n\nIn a subsequent online rant, the president called ABC and NBC “FAKE NEWS” while wondering why the “absolute worst and most biased networks” in the world weren’t “paying Millions of Dollars a year in LICENSE FEES” before calling for his FCC to strip the broadcast licensing rights from their stations.\n\n“They should lose their Licenses for their unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives, but at a minimum, they should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime!!!” Trump fumed. “Crooked ‘journalism’ should not be rewarded, it should be terminated!!!”\n\nHours before calling for retribution against the two broadcast networks, Trump groused online about an ABC News segment featuring Christie and threatened to re-launch an investigation of the former New Jersey governor over the 2013 Bridgegate scandal. The president also decided to take a jab at ABC News anchor Jonathan Karl over his hair.\n\n“I just watched Sloppy Chris Christie be interviewed on a ratings challenged ‘News’ Show, ‘This Week With George Slopadopolus,’ on ABC Fake News (By the way, what the “hell” happened to Jonathan Karl’s hair? He looks absolutely terrible! It’s amazing what bad ratings, on a failed television show that was forced to pay me $16,000,000, can do to one’s appearance!),” Trump wrote in the unhinged post, referencing the payoff ABC’s parent company Disney gave him to settle a lawsuit over a George Stephanoupolous interview.\n\n“Can anyone believe anything that Sloppy Chris says? Do you remember the way he lied about the dangerous and deadly closure of the George Washington Bridge in order to stay out of prison, at the same time sacrificing people who worked for him, including a young mother, who spent years trying to fight off the vicious charges against her,” the president added. “Chris refused to take responsibility for these criminal acts. For the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again? NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\n\nIn the end, Christie wasn’t charged with any crimes over the bridge closure – which had been seen as political revenge over a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie – and denied any knowledge of the incident. Two of his top aides were convicted of fraud and conspiracy, but the Supreme Court ended up overturning those convictions in 2020.\n\nDuring an appearance on Sunday’s broadcast of This Week, Christie took issue with Trump’s FBI raiding the home of the president's former national security adviser John Bolton, who – like Christie – has become an outspoken critic of Trump in recent years.\n\n“I think it’s kind of funny to hear the president talk the way he does about Bolton and classified information, yet, when he had classified information, the same rules didn’t apply,” Christie said during the telecast.\n\n“Donald Trump sees himself as the person who gets to decide everything. And he doesn’t care about any separation,” he added. “In fact, he absolutely rejects the idea that there should be separation between criminal investigations and the politically elected leader of the United States. This is much different than it’s ever been run before.”\n\nChristie also noted that this should not come as much of a surprise to the public, as “you were told this” would be what Trump would do if he became president again. “He told you he was going to do this, that he was going to have a Justice Department that acted as his personal legal representation. And that is what they’re doing,” Christie noted.\n\nMeanwhile, this is also far from the first time that Trump has threatened to use the Federal Communications Commission – which is led by his handpicked chief Brendan Carr – to enact punishment on media companies for not giving him obsequious coverage. \n\nBefore CBS News paid Trump to settle his lawsuit over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, which is now being investigated for potentially violating anti-bribery laws, Carr opened a review of complaints that the network had engaged in “news distortion.” The president also threatened CBS with “substantial punishment” this past spring over a separate 60 Minutes broadcast, warning that the network would “pay a big price” for the newsmagazine’s segments on the Ukraine war and the president’s annexation threats against Greenland.\n\nCarr has also taken swings at both ABC and NBC in recent months. \n\nThis past March, for instance, Carr told Fox News that ABC could lose its broadcast licenses over an investigation into Disney’s diversity hiring practices. “If the evidence does in fact play out and shows that they were engaged in race- and gender-based discrimination, that’s a very serious issue at the FCC, that could fundamentally go to their character qualifications to even hold a license,” Carr said at the time.\n\nWeeks later, Carr accused Comcast of “news distortion” because its cable news network MSNBC refused to call wrongly deported immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia a “violent” MS-13 gang member. Once again, Carr suggested that the NBC parent may have violated its broadcasting licenses over the way its networks had covered the Abrego Garcia case.\n\nWhile Trump and his FCC chair have repeatedly dangled threats of license revocations, investigations and lawsuits over the heads of mainstream news networks unless they soften their coverage of the administration, one broadcaster has been spared – conservative cable giant Fox News.\n\nImmediately after Trump took office, Carr reinstated a bevy of new bias complaints against ABC, NBC and CBS that had been dismissed by then-FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel in January ahead of her resignation. One complaint that he did not revive, however, was against Fox-owned WTXF-TV in Philadelphia.\n\nThat complaint, which the Media and Democracy Project filed, alleged that the claims laid out in the Dominion Voting System defamation case – which Fox News settled for a whopping $787.5 million – showed that owners Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch didn’t have the “character” to hold broadcast licenses. \n\nBesides receiving almost universally glowing coverage from Fox News, Trump has used the right-wing network as something of a staffing agency – hiring roughly two dozen former Fox employees for roles within his administration. \n\nStill, the president has expressed his disdain with the MAGA channel from time to time, whether it is over on-air pundits and correspondents not displaying unwavering loyalty to him or the network’s “biased” polling firm reporting approval numbers that Trump doesn’t like.\n\nAdditionally, the president is currently suing Rupert Murdoch – his on-again/off-again friend – for $10 billion after the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch’s News Corp., reported on an alleged “bawdy” birthday letter that Trump sent deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the card, calling it a “fake thing.”","summary":"‘They should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime!!!’ Donald Trump fumed on Sunday night.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-abc-nbc-broadcast-licenses-b2813617.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/23/21/TRUMP-REPRESALIAS_85583.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bEBt2nUO-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-25 14:34:15","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":354130334,"title":"Ex-CNN anchor Chris Wallace advising private equity firm that bought piece of CBS parent company: report","text":"Former Fox News and CNN anchor Chris Wallace is being paid as an advisor to the private equity firm that recently bought a stake in the company that owns CBS — the same network his father worked for as a “60 Minutes” correspondent, according to a report.\n\nWallace, the 77-year-old newsman — son of legendary “60 Minutes” bulldog Mike Wallace and stepson of CBS News executive Bill Leonard — has quietly signed on as a senior adviser at RedBird Capital Partners, the New York Times reported.\n\nWallace, who walked away from CNN last year after an unsuccessful stint marred by low ratings, now reports directly to RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale, according to the Times.\n\nThe firm holds a major stake in Skydance, the Hollywood outfit run by David Ellison that just seized control of CBS’s parent, Paramount, following the Trump administration’s approval of an $8 billion merger.\n\nThat puts Wallace, who never actually worked for CBS beyond a college internship and a short gig at a local Chicago affiliate in the 1970s, in a position to influence the same news division his famous family helped build.\n\n“I want to help him in any way I can,” Wallace told the Times when asked about Ellison. He confirmed to the Times that he has spoken directly with the 42-year-old media heir who now controls CBS.\n\nInside the network, his sudden proximity to the new boss has fueled speculation about how CBS News might be reshaped after years of turmoil.\n\nThe network was rocked during the Trump era when Paramount was forced to cough up $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the president over the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThough many legal experts mocked the suit as frivolous, the case triggered bitter infighting between Paramount executives and the journalists who produced the piece.\n\nNow, with Skydance at the helm, staffers are bracing for Ellison’s vision, which is likely to include considerable downsizing and cost-cutting.\n\nDavid Ellison, the son of Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, has cozied up to Trump socially and even explored buying The Free Press, a digital upstart founded by Bari Weiss that skewers mainstream news outlets like CBS.\n\nThat pedigree has some insiders whispering about a potential political tilt. Wallace pushed back hard on that notion.\n\n“I am absolutely convinced that any talk about the new owners wanting to move CBS News in a particular political direction is absolutely mistaken,” Wallace told the Times.\n\nHe said Ellison wants “a news organization that lives up to the tradition of Cronkite and Murrow and my dad.”\n\nWallace appeared to brush off concerns voiced by current “60 Minutes” correspondents that the new corporate owners will exert undue influence on the show’s news content and editorial decisions — saying that it wasn’t anything new.\n\n“In the early years, and in fact for years thereafter, it was routine that executives of CBS News would screen pieces and comment on them and expect their comments to be acted on,” Wallace said.\n\n“I’ve been a little surprised at this notion that somehow ‘60 Minutes’ is an independent entity that isn’t part of CBS News.”\n\nWallace’s own résumé runs across every major network. He covered the White House for NBC, spent nearly two decades hosting “Fox News Sunday,” and jumped to CNN in 2021.\n\nWallace’s much-hyped jump to CNN ended with a whimper — and a pink slip.\n\nThe veteran anchor, who reportedly raked in $7 million a year, never managed to deliver an audience to justify the price tag.\n\nHis two shows, “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” and “The Chris Wallace Show,” limped along with just 500,000–750,000 viewers an episode, numbers that were anemic by cable news standards.\n\nIn the key advertising demographic of 25-to-54-year-olds, Wallace often scraped by with only 85,000 viewers.\n\nExecutives pulled the plug after the 2024 election, axing both programs as part of a cost-cutting drive. Wallace was told he could stay on at a sharply reduced salary as a network analyst — but he declined.\n\nPublicly, Wallace spun his exit as a chance to chase “new opportunities” in podcasting and digital media. But reports made clear the real story: his shows were canceled, his salary was set to be slashed and CNN wasn’t willing to keep paying top dollar for a host who couldn’t deliver ratings.\n\nAfter leaving CNN last year, Wallace toyed with launching a podcast or independent news venture but quickly lost interest.\n\nWhen asked if there was a chance Wallace could return to the air under the CBS umbrella, he told the Times: “At this point, that isn’t something that’s in the cards.”\n\nHe then added: “But having said that — and to mix a metaphor — who knows when an old fire horse wants to answer the bell?”","summary":"Wallace, 77-year-old newsman and son of legendary “60 Minutes” bulldog Mike Wallace, has signed on as a senior adviser at RedBird Capital Partners.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/25/media/chris-wallace-advising-private-equity-firm-that-bought-piece-of-cbs-owner/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/110058448.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FUjzb5Ol-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-25 13:25:31","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":354119750,"title":"Trump’s ambition to take crime crackdown national will stoke tensions and legal showdowns","text":"America’s next big showdown is brewing over Donald Trump’s zeal to impose unusual presidential power as he eyes big, Democratic-run cities to expand a crime crackdown that sent troops flocking onto the streets of Washington, DC.\nTrump’s torrid rhetoric claiming that crime is out of control, which is often misleading, is a classic page from the playbook of strongman leaders. It could precipitate high tensions between the federal government and states over the limits of his constitutional and legal authority.\nThe president’s threats prompted alarmed Democrats on Sunday to warn that there would be no justification for him to dispatch troops to a city such as Chicago over local opposition.\n“We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he’s deeply unpopular,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”\nOn Friday, Trump told reporters that “Chicago will be our next” target while he would “help” New York after that. Trump last week also name-checked Baltimore and Oakland, California, where he argued crime is “very bad.”\nCNN reported Saturday that the Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, according to two officials. It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.\nTrump on Sunday lashed out at Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a potential Democratic presidential hopeful in 2028, who had suggested the president walk with him through Baltimore to view local attempts to stem violent crime. The president slammed the city as “out of control (and) crime ridden” and said he wouldn’t go there until the “Crime Disaster” was cleaned up.\nTrump’s critics argue his deployment of National Guard forces in the US capital and in Los Angeles in response to demonstrations earlier this year against his immigration policies are prototype operations for wider national crackdowns.\nBut the president has smaller legal leeway to surge federal troops into cities and to dictate law enforcement policies in the states than in Washington, a federal district.\nThe consequences are huge if Trump turns from Washington to other big cities\nSending troops or dedicating federal agents to police work into a major city such as Chicago or Baltimore against the will of Democratic state and city officials would create a new test of the presidential powers Trump incessantly seeks to expand and would threaten state sovereignty — which Republicans have historically sought to preserve.\nDeclaring yet another national emergency to federalize National Guard reserve troops normally commanded by a state governor would trigger legal showdowns over Trump’s preferred method of unlocking new and questionable executive authority. He suggested last week he might declare a national emergency in Washington, to get around a 30-day limit on troop deployments.\nMembers of the National Guard walk through the National Mall on Saturday in Washington, DC.\nJose Luis Gonzalez/Retuers\nA crackdown in a place like Chicago would also offer Trump the chance to ramp up his mass deportation effort with a surge force at a time when it is increasingly appearing that this is his key goal in Washington. A CNN analysis of government data found that in the first week after the administration took control of the capital’s police force and deployed federal agents and troops on the streets, there was a moderate dip in reported crime while arrests of immigrants were up tenfold from typical ICE arrest tallies.\nChoosing a big, Democratic city would also allow Trump to choreograph a new political extravaganza in a performative presidency built on televised spectacles from summits to bill signings and dealmaking. The substance often lags the political symbolism.\nThe risk would be that such moves could disrupt chains of command between local elected officials and police chiefs and upset community policing initiatives designed to stem violent crime. And it would reinforce a growing impression that Trump is seeking to normalize the anomalous use of soldiers in domestic settings to purse his political priorities.\nAs was the case in Washington, a Chicago crackdown would give Trump another opening to impose his conservative power and autocratic tendencies on a population that voted overwhelmingly for his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.\nAnd it would enable him to put Democrats in a political vise, forcing them to walk a tightrope between rejecting federal takeovers and his hardline tactics while risking alienating voters who are concerned about violent crime and the impact of past lax border policies.\nThen there is the question of paying for all this.\nTrump’s growing zeal for using federal troops and agents will sooner or later raise the question of resources. Prolonged National Guard deployments are expensive. Redeploying federal agents from other duties could affect the FBI’s ability to target transnational crime or anti-terrorism investigations. The resource issue raises questions about the administration’s capacity to enact long-term reductions in crime since open-ended deployments are unsustainable.\nDemocrats push back as Trump depicts dystopian crime crisis\nTrump’s warnings about supposedly lawless inner cities do not necessarily reflect the true picture of public order. For example, crime in Washington fell in 2024, and again so far this year. In Chicago, the police said Friday that homicides were down 31 percent this year, and shootings fell 36 percent. Still, that doesn’t mean people who live in big cities feel safe. Many would welcome seeing more police on the streets, and cities and states have been calling on the federal government for more partnerships and resources — but balk at Trump’s imposed solutions.\nThe president’s dystopian descriptions increasingly resemble an attempt to create a rhetorical crime emergency that he could then use to justify draconian methods that satisfy his desire to look strong and his attempts to push up deportations.\nAs Trump stokes a sense of crisis, Democrats are resisting\nPeople walk past Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago on March 7.\nTerrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\nFormer Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, “I think everybody should take a step back and realize that, as a commander in chief over his two terms, he’s only deployed and put boots on the ground in American cities, never overseas. And just think about what that means as a country.”\nEmanuel, a CNN senior political and global affairs commentator, suggested that Trump’s true purpose was to redouble immigration enforcement in cities — like Chicago — that do not cooperate with federal authorities in crackdowns against undocumented migrants. “This will not be about fighting crime,” he said.\nAnd Emanuel, a former senior member of Democratic House leadership, White House chief of staff and ambassador to Japan, offered some advice for his party, which has sometimes struggled to connect with voters on crime. “We have a strategy for fighting crime: more police on the beat and getting kids, gangs and guns off the street.”\nJeffries, from New York, said on “State of the Union” that Democrats, like all Americans, want safer communities, but opposed Trump’s power grabs. “We should make sure that the flood of guns into these communities is cut off. We should make sure that we’re dealing with the mental health crisis that exists all across the United States of America, and, by the way, which Donald Trump is exacerbating by cutting funds to actually help people who are dealing with emotional distress.”\nDemocratic local leaders are trying to discredit the president’s claim that crime is so out of control in cities as to merit such a crackdown.\nOn Saturday, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, issued a statement pointing out that his state had received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking whether it needs help, after Trump named Chicago as a future venue for his surge of military and federal personnel. “There is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the Illinois National Guard, deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active-duty military within our own borders,” he said.\nAnd Pritzker signaled that he’d do everything he could to push back against outside, federal power. “We will continue to follow the law, stand up for the sovereignty of our state, and protect the people of Illinois,” he said.\nOn Sunday, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN’s Isabel Rosales that his office sought to work with federal entities including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Secret Service. He said those agencies were trained to combat crime, while the National Guard is not.\nTrump is “operating as a dictator,” Raoul said. “Turning the military against these American citizens in cities on American land is unprecedented.”","summary":"America’s next big showdown is brewing over Donald Trump’s zeal to impose unusual presidential power as he eyes big, Democratic-run cities to expand a crime crackdown that sent troops flocking onto the streets of Washington, DC.

The president slammed the city as “out of control (and) crime ridden” and said he wouldn’t go there until the “Crime Disaster” was cleaned up.\n\nTrump’s critics argue his deployment of National Guard forces in the US capital and in Los Angeles in response to demonstrations earlier this year against his immigration policies are prototype operations for wider national crackdowns.\n\nBut the president has smaller legal leeway to surge federal troops into cities and to dictate law enforcement policies in the states than in Washington, a federal district.\n\nThe consequences are huge if Trump turns from Washington to other big cities\n\nSending troops or dedicating federal agents to police work into a major city such as Chicago or Baltimore against the will of Democratic state and city officials would create a new test of the presidential powers Trump incessantly seeks to expand and would threaten state sovereignty — which Republicans have historically sought to preserve.\n\nDeclaring yet another national emergency to federalize National Guard reserve troops normally commanded by a state governor would trigger legal showdowns over Trump’s preferred method of unlocking new and questionable executive authority. He suggested last week he might declare a national emergency in Washington, to get around a 30-day limit on troop deployments.\n\nA crackdown in a place like Chicago would also offer Trump the chance to ramp up his mass deportation effort with a surge force at a time when it is increasingly appearing that this is his key goal in Washington. A CNN analysis of government data found that in the first week after the administration took control of the capital’s police force and deployed federal agents and troops on the streets, there was a moderate dip in reported crime while arrests of immigrants were up tenfold from typical ICE arrest tallies.\n\nChoosing a big, Democratic city would also allow Trump to choreograph a new political extravaganza in a performative presidency built on televised spectacles from summits to bill signings and dealmaking. The substance often lags the political symbolism.\n\nThe risk would be that such moves could disrupt chains of command between local elected officials and police chiefs and upset community policing initiatives designed to stem violent crime. And it would reinforce a growing impression that Trump is seeking to normalize the anomalous use of soldiers in domestic settings to purse his political priorities.\n\nAs was the case in Washington, a Chicago crackdown would give Trump another opening to impose his conservative power and autocratic tendencies on a population that voted overwhelmingly for his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.\n\nAnd it would enable him to put Democrats in a political vise, forcing them to walk a tightrope between rejecting federal takeovers and his hardline tactics while risking alienating voters who are concerned about violent crime and the impact of past lax border policies.\n\nThen there is the question of paying for all this.\n\nTrump’s growing zeal for using federal troops and agents will sooner or later raise the question of resources. Prolonged National Guard deployments are expensive. Redeploying federal agents from other duties could affect the FBI’s ability to target transnational crime or anti-terrorism investigations. The resource issue raises questions about the administration’s capacity to enact long-term reductions in crime since open-ended deployments are unsustainable.\n\nDemocrats push back as Trump depicts dystopian crime crisis\n\nTrump’s warnings about supposedly lawless inner cities do not necessarily reflect the true picture of public order. For example, crime in Washington fell in 2024, and again so far this year. In Chicago, the police said Friday that homicides were down 31 percent this year, and shootings fell 36 percent. Still, that doesn’t mean people who live in big cities feel safe. Many would welcome seeing more police on the streets, and cities and states have been calling on the federal government for more partnerships and resources — but balk at Trump’s imposed solutions.\n\nThe president’s dystopian descriptions increasingly resemble an attempt to create a rhetorical crime emergency that he could then use to justify draconian methods that satisfy his desire to look strong and his attempts to push up deportations.\n\nAs Trump stokes a sense of crisis, Democrats are resisting\n\nFormer Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, “I think everybody should take a step back and realize that, as a commander in chief over his two terms, he’s only deployed and put boots on the ground in American cities, never overseas. And just think about what that means as a country.”\n\nEmanuel, a CNN senior political and global affairs commentator, suggested that Trump’s true purpose was to redouble immigration enforcement in cities — like Chicago — that do not cooperate with federal authorities in crackdowns against undocumented migrants. “This will not be about fighting crime,” he said.\n\nAnd Emanuel, a former senior member of Democratic House leadership, White House chief of staff and ambassador to Japan, offered some advice for his party, which has sometimes struggled to connect with voters on crime. “We have a strategy for fighting crime: more police on the beat and getting kids, gangs and guns off the street.”\n\nJeffries, from New York, said on “State of the Union” that Democrats, like all Americans, want safer communities, but opposed Trump’s power grabs. “We should make sure that the flood of guns into these communities is cut off. We should make sure that we’re dealing with the mental health crisis that exists all across the United States of America, and, by the way, which Donald Trump is exacerbating by cutting funds to actually help people who are dealing with emotional distress.”\n\nDemocratic local leaders are trying to discredit the president’s claim that crime is so out of control in cities as to merit such a crackdown.\n\nOn Saturday, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, issued a statement pointing out that his state had received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking whether it needs help, after Trump named Chicago as a future venue for his surge of military and federal personnel. “There is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the Illinois National Guard, deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active-duty military within our own borders,” he said.\n\nAnd Pritzker signaled that he’d do everything he could to push back against outside, federal power. “We will continue to follow the law, stand up for the sovereignty of our state, and protect the people of Illinois,” he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN’s Isabel Rosales that his office sought to work with federal entities including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Secret Service. He said those agencies were trained to combat crime, while the National Guard is not.\n\nTrump is “operating as a dictator,” Raoul said. “Turning the military against these American citizens in cities on American land is unprecedented.”","summary":"America’s next big showdown is brewing over Donald Trump’s zeal to impose unusual presidential power as he eyes big, Democratic-run cities to expand a crime crackdown that sent troops flocking onto the streets of Washington, DC.

If the Democratic Party hopes to remain competitive with the GOP, it must recover much of its base: Black voters. After all, it's well known that, absent the Black vote, Joe Biden would have lost in 2020.Republicans succeeded in capturing more Black voters than expected. Had Democrats taken a page out of the Republicans' playbook, they'd likely have won, saving the country—and world—from the current turmoil.An important part of the problem in the last election centered on declining Black turnout, not vote share. Consider the following comparison between Biden's numbers in 2020 to Kamala Harris' in 2024: Biden captured 89 percent of the Black vote; Harris just 85 percent. In swing states, it was even closer. Biden won 91 percent of the Black vote to Harris' 89 percent.Real differences emerge when it comes to turnout. Black turnout was down by 6 percent nationally and 2 percent in swing states relative to 2020. All things equal, Harris would have likely beat Trump in 2024 had Black turnout simply matched what Biden produced.What explains the reduction in Black turnout?In focus groups we conducted at Black Insights Research, Black voters in swing states and elsewhere expressed disappointment in the performance of the Democratic Party. Promises were not kept. One Black man we talked to epitomized the Black community's discontent with the Democratic Party after the election, explaining that, \"They [Democrats] take Black people for granted\" and \"need to try harder.\" This sentiment is shared by others across the country.One simple way to remedy this concern is to proactively reach out to the Black community. This approach makes a difference. Data from the 2020-2024 Cooperative Election Study Recontact Survey indicated that the Biden campaign contacted 69 percent of the Black community in 2020, but the Harris campaign contacted just 59 percent in 2024, a finding we corroborated in our 2024 data set.What's more, among those in the Black community who were contacted in 2024, our data indicated that a whopping 72 percent were high-propensity voters compared to a paltry 28 percent of the low-propensity group.Social science suggests this was a mistake. High-propensity voters are already primed to vote, so the information conveyed to them by campaigns has little influence on turnout. Low-propensity voters, a group that requires more information and persuasion to get out and vote, benefit much more from campaign contact. This, in turn, tends to increase their turnout. With this in mind, Black Insights Research tested this theory on data we collected on the Black community during the 2024 campaign, applying it to the Peach State.Had Harris tailored her campaign to reach more low-propensity voters in Georgia, we estimate (based on our models) she would've added more than 197,000 Black voters to the electorate in 2024, overcoming her vote deficit of 115,000, winning the state outright. This remains true even when accounting for the small percentage of new Black voters who may have voted for someone other than Harris.Furthermore, with the excitement in the Black community surrounding her campaign early on, outreach—especially to low-propensity Black voters, may have proven crucial. Had the party better capitalized on this momentum, our analysis suggests Harris may have prevailed in other swing states, increasing the likelihood of her beating Trump.This approach, mobilizing low-propensity voters, has proven successful in the past for grassroots groups in the state of Georgia. In the ultimate twist of irony, mobilization of low-propensity (mainly white) voters was used to great effect by the Trump campaign.Democrats and the Harris campaign faced many obstacles in 2024, not least of which was a short runway, along with the party's perceived policy indifference to the Black community. Harris (and her campaign) had no control over this.Nevertheless, with a war chest outstripping that of her opponent, Harris had the resources to run a targeted get-out-and-vote campaign aimed at mobilizing low-propensity Black voters. Her campaign failed to do so effectively.Let's be real: without support from the Black community, there is no viable Democratic Party.If absolutely nothing else, pursuing Black low-propensity voters is the one lesson Democrats can learn from Republicans as they plan for 2026 and beyond.Christopher Sebastian Parker and Christopher Towler lead Black Insight Research, a research firm that specializes in seeking solutions to more equitable outcomes for the Black community.

This swing to MAGA helped Trump win, kicked Democrats into the political wilderness, launched a thousand thought pieces and showed politicians that they ignore Latinos at their own risk. Now, Latinos once again hold the power to make or break American politics, thanks to redistricting fights shaping up in Texas and California. And once again, both Democratic and Republican leaders think they know what Latinos want. In the Lone Star State, the GOP-dominated Legislature last week approved the redrawing of congressional districts at the behest of Trump, upending the traditional process, to help Republicans gain up to five seats in the 2026 midterms. Their California counterparts landed on the opposite side of the gerrymandering coin — their maps, which will go before voters in November, target Republican congressional members. Texas Republicans and California Democrats are both banking on Latinos to be the swing votes that make their gambits successful. That’s understandable but dangerous. If ever a voting bloc fulfills the cliche that to assume something makes an ass out of you and me, it’s Latinos. Despite President Reagan's famous statement that Latinos were Republicans who didn’t know it yet, they rejected the GOP in California and beyond for a generation after the passage of Proposition 187 in 1994. When Hillary Clinton supporters whispered during the 2008 presidential race that Latinos would never vote for a Black candidate, they gladly joined the coalition that put Barack Obama in the White House. Trump increased his Latino support each time he ran — to the point that in 2024, a bigger proportion of Latinos voted for him than for any previous Republican presidential candidate — even though Democrats insisted that Latinos couldn't possibly stomach a man that racist. Many Latinos hate being taken for granted and don’t like the establishment telling them how to think. It's classic rancho libertarianism, the term I created in the era of Trump to describe the political leanings of the people with whom I grew up: Mexican Americans from rural stock who simultaneously believed in community and individualism and hated the racist rhetoric of Republicans but didn't care much for the woke words of Democrats, either. Such political independence exasperates political leaders, yet it's long been a thing with Latino voters across the U.S. but especially in Texas and California, where Mexican American voters make up an overwhelming majority of each state's Latino electorate. As Republicans in the former and Democrats in the latter launch their initial redistricting volleys, they seem to be forgetting that, yet again. The GOP is hoping voters in South Texas, one of the most Latino areas of the U.S., will carry their Trump love to the 2026 congressional races. There, two of the three congressional seats are held by Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, despite a swing from most of the region's 41 counties supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 to just five going for Kamala Harris eight years later. In their new maps, Texas legislators poured more Republican voters into those South Texas districts. They also configured new districts in the Houston area and central Texas so that Latinos are now the majority, but voters favored Trump last year. But a lawsuit filed hours after the Texas Senate moved the maps to Gov. Greg Abbott for his approval alleged that all the finagling had created \"Potemkin majority-Latino districts.\" The intent, according to the lawsuit, was to dilute Latino power by packing some voters into already Democratic-leaning districts while splitting up others among red-leaning districts. The legislators especially threw San Antonio, a longtime Democratic stronghold that's a cradle of Latino electoral power, into a political Cuisinart. Three Latino Democrats currently represent the Alamo City and its metro area: Cuellar, Joaquin Castro and Greg Casar. Under the new maps, only Castro is truly safe, while Casar is now in a district represented by Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who has announced he will retire. “We have three Hispanic-predominated districts in South Texas that we believe we can carve out for Republican leadership,” state GOP Rep. Mitch Little bragged on CNN this month. “It’s good for our party. It’s good for our state. And we need to ensure that Donald Trump’s agenda continues to be enacted.” The thing is, fewer and fewer Latinos are supporting Trump’s agenda. In Reuters/Ipsos polls, his Latino support dropped from 36% in February to 31% this month. Only 27% of Latinos approved of his performance in a Pew Research Center poll released this month. If this slide continues through next year and Latinos continue to reject MAGA, Texas Republicans would have done Trump's gross gerrymandering and sparked a nationwide legislative civil war for nothing. In California, Latino voters are also crucial to Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting push — but Democrats are hoping they'll be GOP spoilers, despite their recent tack to the right. Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley's district would swing into Sacramento, picking up many more Latino voters than he now has in the majority white Eastern Sierra. Proposed districts for Democrats Josh Harder and Adam Gray in Central California and Derek Tran in Orange County, all of whom the party is trying to buttress after they squeaked through in close elections in the fall, also include areas with more Latinos. A new congressional district in southeast L.A. County would probably be filled by a Latino Democrat. Powerful Latinos in the state have already come out in favor of Newsom’s so-called Election Rigging Response Act, and the governor is counting on them to convince Latino voters to approve the maps in November. But all this shuffling is happening a year after those very voters jolted state Democrats. Although the party still holds a super-majority in Sacramento, Democratic legislators serve alongside the largest number of Latino GOP colleagues ever. The biggest swings to Trump happened in areas with larger Latino populations, according to a Public Policy Institute of California report published last month. The president's popularity is especially souring in California due to his deportation deluge — but whether Latinos will support redistricting is another matter. Although 51% of Latinos support Newsom’s performance, only 43% said they would vote yes on his redistricting push — the lowest percentage of any ethnic group, according to a UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times. The poll also found that 29% of Latinos are undecided on redistricting — the highest percentage of any group. Such skepticism is the bitter fruit of a generation of Democratic rule in Sacramento, at a time when blue-collar Latinos are finding it harder to achieve the good life. Politicians blaming it all on Trump eventually created a Chicken Little situation that pushed those Latinos into MAGAlandia — and Newsom, by constantly casting redistricting as a necessary uppercut against Trump, is in danger of making the same mistake. California Latinos have helped to torpedo liberal shibboleths at the ballot box more often than Democrats will ever admit. A Times exit poll found 45% of them voted to recall Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 while 53% voted yes on the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in 2008 even as a bigger majority voted for Obama. So egghead arguments about how redistricting will save the future of democracy won't really land with the rancho libertarians I know. They want cheaper prices, and Trump isn't delivering them — but neither is Newsom. Latinos, as another cliche goes, aren't a monolith. They could very well help Republicans win those extra congressional seats in Texas and do the same for Democrats in California. But any politician betting that Latinos will automatically do what they're expected to ... remind me what happens when you assume something?","summary":"Texas Republicans and California Democrats are both banking on Latinos to make their gambits successful.

Later, a senior administration official, dressed down in a teal golf shirt and sitting in a velvet armchair, introduces himself as the man “protecting the nukes,” before dipping back into his chat with a young man about weapons of war. An acoustic rendition of “Just the Two of Us” plays across the dimly lit bar.\nCabinet secretaries, like Howard Lutnick at Commerce and Scott Bessent at Treasury, are known to swing by Ned’s. Jared Kushner has been spotted here too. On Sundays, members enjoying sundowners on the club’s rooftop bar have watched Donald Trump returning from Mar–a-Lago on Air Force One. One young Republican member, CJ Pearson, suggests that Ned’s “isn’t a partisan club,” but is “definitely the place to be in DC these days.”\n“On any given day, you can find yourself next to a cabinet official in the Trump Administration or an anchor for MSNBC,” Pearson tells VF. “You never know who you’ll run into, which I think is a part of the appeal.”\nHe’s right that Ned’s member list also includes Democrats, like Symone Sanders-Townsend, the former Kamala Harris adviser and current MSNBC host, as well as journalists, such as CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and The Wall Street Journal’s Josh Dawsey. It’s also been the location for extravagant soirees since launching in January, from The Washington Post’s reported million-dollar brunch following the White House Correspondents’ Dinner to a recent invite-only AI event, where the tech elite, like OpenAI’s COO Brad Lightcap, hung out with Washington policymakers.\nYet, on this night, the vibe feels decidedly Trumpy, which surely speaks to a cultural shift in the capital these past six months. It feels rare now to be at a club, restaurant or social occasion that is truly non-partisan. My friends tell me that even sports bars and Mexican restaurants in D.C. have been weaponized politically - after-work havens for the young, ever-ambitious MAGA set.\nI’m not the only one who senses it with Ned’s. “When I’ve been there, it’s been packed with Republicans,” Sally Quinn tells VF.\nQuinn, a trailblazing journalist, author, and Washington society fixture, isn’t a member of Ned’s, but has visited the club, including for a recent crypto party. She says some younger journalist friends have joined because there will be “someone from the administration they can hit up about a story they’re doing,” making it valuable from a reporting perspective. Meridith McGraw, a White House reporter at The Wall Street Journal, suggests you can sense how the city’s social scene changes with who’s in power.\n“It might be a polarizing era of American politics, but Democrat or Republican, MAGA or not, everyone wants to try the trendy new restaurant or go to a fun party to meet people,” she says. McGraw adds that in addition to Ned’s, a newer restaurant near the White House called The Occidental is another spot where you’re highly likely to run into someone from the administration.\nMembers’ clubs aren’t a new phenomenon in DC, where they’ve long functioned as havens for those with power and influence to socialize discreetly. The Metropolitan Club, for one, lists at least a half dozen former presidents as members, while Cosmos Club, founded in 1878, has had its share of presidents and Supreme Court justices hobnobbing beneath its Renaissance–style ceiling paintings. I’m told, though, they’ve become more popular in DC under the new administration—where hot spots have shifted, and even the places that were popular under Trump’s first term have gone out of fashion.\nCNN’s Alayna Treene, who covered Trump’s first presidency for Axios, says the scene has very much changed this time around, with old Republican haunts like The Trump Hotel being replaced by the growing number of members’ clubs. Speaking of the hotel, Treene says, “Often you would find Rudy Giuliani lounging in an armchair, holding court with a drink in hand. Other times, you’d find Kellyanne Conway, Sebastian Gorka, or a MAGA influencer. Back then, even Trump himself would take his motorcade the short distance down Pennsylvania Avenue to socialize at the hotel.”\nNow, Treene says, many in government opt for membership clubs instead. “One of the biggest differences in the second term is those closest to the president are far more reserved and less inclined to want to meet, even off the record, with journalists like myself,” she adds. “And they go to great lengths to socialize away from the spotlight.”\nNed’s opened earlier this year on the top three floors of the Walker Building, a historic, imposing structure that overlooks the White House and the Treasury. The initiation fee is $5,000, with annual dues of $5,000, though government workers pay a discounted $1,000. For elite-level founding members, that cost rises to $125,000, but they receive an additional range of benefits, including an even more exclusive restaurant experience and access to locations in other cities, such as New York, London, and Doha. (And a clarification, should you wonder: \"Ned’s Club\" refers to the private members' spaces. The DC location is only a club with no public hotel, hence it is referred to as \"Ned's Club Washington, DC\" not “The Ned,” as some of the hotel outposts are called.) The interior space is decorated with heavy curtains, dark green walls, and velvety armchairs; there are nooks and libraries, smaller rooms, and bars where one can order chips with caviar ($50), sakura martinis ($23), or a $1,250 bottle of Opus One red wine from Napa Valley. Twenty three dollars seems to be the standard price for a cocktail, with the spicy picante a firm fan favorite. The cost of still hearing the faint strains of political protest on the street 10 floors below: priceless.\n“My feeling is that you go places that you see people you want to see, hang out with people you want to be with,” says Quinn. “The MAGA crowd has found their place there.”\nMost of the Ned’s members I talk to are comfortable with a reporter in the midst, even if they prefer speaking on background—and can recall less enjoyable interactions with journalists. One of the first members I chat with laments how a reporter had managed to get into his inauguration party. He recollects setting up IV drips in his penthouse as a recovery station for the week of raucous partying, and how panic set in as Giuliani was coming up in the elevator with a reporter.\nGareth Banner, the group managing director for Ned’s, who has held several hotel management roles in London, says that at its core, the club is a social one, and that they are proud of the membership community their team has curated. The goal was to “create the most interesting dining room in DC” with high performers who “may not share all the same views.” Banner adds that “it is important to state that just because you can afford to be a member doesn’t mean you get to be—or stay—one.”\nThe club also hosts events, including tennis watch parties, an evening featuring an Emmy-nominated spoken-word poet, and an after-party for Trump’s address on his Artificial Intelligence Plan. Max Bernstein, a 23-year-old member who works in commercial real estate, says he joined to be somewhere that felt removed from the hectic, daily work life and where he could host his friends and meet new people. “You have a lot of political people that go, you also have other captains of industry,” Bernstein says. “They want a safe and relaxed place to eat, have good vibes, and have a good time with people around them.”\nThe Ned’s waitlist is said to be long; the club’s directors want to draw in the top 5% of people across a range of industries, but it is competing with other establishments, such as The Clayton, and more recently, the Executive Branch, the club cofounded by Donald Trump Jr. and Omeed Malik, the president of 1789 Capital. Members of the Executive Branch pay an annual fee of $500,000, with additional yearly dues. Tucked away in the city’s Georgetown district, it sets up as a private oasis for the innermost circle of Trumpworld.\n“DC is without question a very blue city,” Malik tells VF. “What happened is, even if they went to the Ned, a lot of their conversations are being leaked to reporters. There is nowhere they can go where they can have a sense of privacy with their friends.”\nAccording to the Post, the club’s cofounders also include 1789 Capital partner Christopher Buskirk, and Alex and Zach Witkoff, sons of Steve Witkoff, the administration’s special envoy to the Middle East; while members include White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The club had something of a soft launch in the spring, and I’m told is set to reopen in September when many of its high-end clientele return from summer travel.\nBack at Ned’s, it’s 10 p.m. and things are winding down. A younger group, including some junior staffers on the Hill, decides to move over to Butterworth’s, another MAGA hangout, where ex-Breitbart editor Raheem Kassam is an owner. In the elevator down, three older men discuss negotiating for the release of hostages, one of whom says he “has to come home and watch cartoons.” The younger crowd was chatting excitedly about the Epstein files and whether they would make it to a party at their friend’s apartment in the Navy Yard later on, but that all depended on whether Butterworth’s was serving espresso martinis.","summary":"Hostage negotiators, nuke handlers, and captains of industry take refuge at one of the capital’s most exclusive (but still bipartisan) hangouts, as VF takes stock of the shifting social scene in a second Trump term.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/story/a-night-at-neds-with-the-maga-set","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/688bcb1f2018f4dcdc418dfb/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/the-ned-young-maga-crowd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 10:00:00","author":"Olivia Empson","authors":["Olivia Empson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.094},{"id":354060874,"title":"This Issue Could Be Democrats’ Secret Weapon, if They Can Figure Out How to Use It","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAs Democrats gear up for next year’s midterm elections, they have one big gun they’re ready to wield: Opposition to Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill is a massive giveaway to the wealthy, paid for by big cuts to services used by the American working and middle classes, that seems set to plunge the country into economic peril. The OBBBA is indefensible, and it’s a gift to Democrats—assuming they’re able to point their weapon in the right direction.\n\nOver the past several years, that is a task at which they have spectacularly failed. The reality is this: Democratic policies are much more popular than Republican ones, but Democrats lose anyway. Democratic favorability has tumbled to new lows, with just 34 percent of Americans saying they have a positive opinion of the party. While 91 percent of Republicans say they feel favorably about their own party, only 73 percent of Democrats say the same thing about theirs. In other words, even a whole lot of Democrats don’t really like Democrats right now. And party registration shows it: Since the 2024 election less than a year ago, Democrats have hemorrhaged more than 150,000 registered party members, while Republicans have gained more than 200,000—and those are numbers from just 30 states, according to a New York Times analysis. Even more damning: Since 2020, Democrats have lost 2.1 million voters, while Republicans gained 2.4 million. And the future doesn’t look much brighter. While 63 percent of voters who newly registered for a party chose the Democrats in 2018, in 2024, that was less than 48 percent. And most of those new registrants are young people.\n\nDemocrats have all kinds of problems: messaging problems, approval problems, perception problems, vibes problems. Democrats, a whole lot of Americans say, don’t understand their struggles and priorities, which are pretty basic: their money, their health, their home, their sense of safety, their optimism about the future.\n\nThere is no single solution for these problems, but one aspect of the party’s unpopularity feels increasingly obvious to me: Most people actually do seem to feel a sense of autonomy and ownership over their own lives. They believe they are in the driver’s seat, and they want to be in control of their futures. They may see themselves as people facing unfair hurdles or disadvantages, but what they want is the road cleared so that they might succeed. Republicans promise that. Democrats, on the other hand, talk to people as though they’re victims, from now into perpetuity. And while it’s good that Democrats stand up for the weak and the vulnerable, most voters don’t seem to view themselves as weak or vulnerable. While it’s good that Democrats want to fortify the social safety net, many voters assume (often wrongly) that they will never fall into it.\n\nAs Dems press forward with their attacks on the OBBBA, they should keep this in mind: Voters don’t need to exclusively hear that the bill steals from the poor and gives to the rich (even though it does). They need to hear that the bill has stolen what they’ve earned, and that it has mortgaged their futures.\n\nDespite their perception issues, Democrats have a huge advantage: Many of the actual policies they support are much more popular than the Republican positions. A 2024 YouGov poll asked voters about dozens of specific policy proposals; the policies that received more than 50 percent support were overwhelmingly Kamala Harris’, and as support dropped well below 50 percent, they became almost exclusively Donald Trump’s. And while voters generally correctly guessed whose policies were whose, there were some patterns to the exceptions. Where one candidate had taken public ownership of an issue—Trump on immigration, for instance—voters assumed that any immigration restriction was a Trump policy and not a Harris one. And so Harris didn’t get credit for her proposal to fight fentanyl and other drug imports using detection technology—something 90 percent of voters supported, but that 59 percent believed was a Trump idea. The same pattern held for Harris’ proposal to shut down the border if illegal crossings exceeded 5,000 people in a week, and her proposal to increase the burden on asylum-seekers to prove they have a case.\n\nOne problem, then, is that voters don’t always know what Democrats and Republicans actually stand for, suggesting that Democrats could indeed work on basic information penetration. But that problem is a pretty small one; for the most part, voters were able to correctly identify Trump’s policies as Trump’s, and Harris’ as Harris’. And voters generally agreed with Democratic proposals, and more often opposed Republican ones. But Democrats lost the last election anyway. That should tell us that there’s something at play here beyond policy.\n\nOne piece of the puzzle is that not all issues are equally important in voters’ minds. Voters may overwhelmingly agree with, say, imposing harsher consequences on companies that damage the environment, but relatively few are going to decide their vote on that issue alone. Voters see Democrats as prioritizing issues like LGBTQ+ rights or abortion over concerns like inflation, immigration, and health care. And while voters believe basic rights issues are important—abortion, for example, enjoys strong support—they are not central to the everyday lives of most Americans, insofar as they either directly affect a minority group (LGBTQ+ rights), or they could potentially affect a majority (women) but are time-constrained and typically one-off events that most people do not anticipate needing (abortion). On the other hand, the issues voters say Republicans prioritize—the economy, immigration—are those that affect voters every single day, with the economy shaping all of our lives and immigration often a visible reminder of change and distribution of resources. Voters may not like what Republicans do on those issues. But in some perverse logic—voters, I regret to inform you, are not a universally rational bunch—they see a party that recognizes their pain, does something, and changes the status quo as preferable to one that does nothing, even if the changes wind up being bad ones.\n\nDemocrats also do a better job of standing up for the vulnerable, which is more appealing when voters are feeling solid about their own lives and prospects. But when they’re feeling insecure, a Democratic Party that emphasizes special attention on very small groups feels like a distraction at best, especially when most of this attention is purely rhetorical and doesn’t actually translate into tangible benefits for the groups in question. And even many members of the “vulnerable” groups don’t seem to like this rhetoric either, I suspect because most people don’t walk around self-identifying as vulnerable and in need of special protection. Regardless of race, gender, or class, a great many Americans want opportunities and a rightful claim to what should be theirs. That’s one reason means testing is such popular politics, even if in practice—like with the Medicaid cuts in the OBBBA—it’s terribly devastating policy: Most people believe they are among the deserving majority, and that someone else is the lazy grifter who will lose their health care.\n\nThe task for Democrats now is to understand the different audiences they’re speaking to—talking to voters in rural Iowa will require very different messaging than talking to voters in the Bronx—and when they’re talking to local voters, they should focus on what will feel the most universal and resonant in those particular areas. They should use the names for Medicaid-funded state health care programs rather than just “Medicaid,” given that many people don’t seem to realize they’re on Medicaid at all, thinking instead that state programs called Apple Health or TennCare are different. When Democrats are doing national messaging, they should be as expansive as possible, so that just about any American could hear themselves in Democratic rhetoric about the OBBBA. This bill takes health care away from hard-working Americans. It takes food away from hungry children. It increases your student loans. And it will plunge the nation into debt and put our children’s futures in jeopardy, just so the very richest households —households like Donald Trump’s—can get exorbitant tax cuts.\n\nNone of this is to say that Democrats should abandon their commitment to vulnerable groups and minorities. It is to say that the messaging matters, and Democrats need to learn to talk about what Americans deserve without constantly defaulting to special carve-outs. And Democrats need to frame their policies as clearing the way for opportunity, safety, and personal freedom—not just keeping the worst-off afloat, but getting impediments out of the way for more people to thrive.\n\nRepublicans seem to assume a few crucial things: that poor people may not identify as poor, and certainly don’t believe they have to be poor forever; that people find purpose in work and believe hard work to be a moral good; that many people believe in their own moral goodness but are suspicious of others’ actions and motives; that people want more money and opportunity; that people overestimate their potential for success and underestimate their potential to fall on hard times; and that individuals will take credit for their own achievements but blame others for their challenges or failures (a new job is the result of one’s own hard work, not a president whose policies expanded the labor market; a lost job, though, might be blamed on the guy in the White House for his economic policies or immigration policies or trade policies). Republicans are really good at identifying the “others” who might be blamed: immigrants, liberals, Democrats, those who imposed a global trade economy. They have realized that while people may be glad the safety net is there when they need it, few plan to fall in the first place. Instead, they hope to hit the big time.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, tend to emphasize aid for the needy over opportunity. They tend to blame “billionaires” or “the rich” even though Americans are largely indifferent toward the ultrawealthy and often aspire to join their ranks. While Democrats fight the rich, Republicans tell people that they can help them get rich, too.\n\nThis is tricky territory because Democrats should, in fact, strengthen the social safety net. They should battle yawning income inequality and they should fight policies that favor the rich over the rest. There are instances in which making billionaires the chief villains might be both accurate and strategically smart. But when Americans look around at their friends, communities, and neighbors and identify who seems to be getting one over on them, they’re largely not seeing a billionaire next door. What Americans generally want is a pretty tired cliché of a promise: that if they work hard, their lives will get better. Democrats can take this moment to emphasize all of the ways in which this administration is stealing from American workers, and all the ways in which Trump is giving them with the raw end of a deal.\n\nDemocrats are also seen as “out of touch,” “woke,” and “weak,” a party of elites, scolds, and victims, according to a recent poll conducted by a Democratic super PAC. A generation of campaigns and strategy shops run by college-educated millennial liberals who came of age during the Obama years and cut their educational teeth on critical theory imbued the Democratic Party with a language that is alternately unintelligible or eye-roll-inducing to many normal Americans. This does seem to be slightly recalibrating, and Democratic politicians are increasingly speaking like normal adults, but there are clearly still internecine struggles over language and how exactly to demonstrate the party’s values (the 2024 Democratic Party Platform has, as its first page, a land acknowledgment). And, unfortunately for actual Democratic politicians, the public doesn’t judge the party based solely on what its elected officials do. Voters seem to define the Democratic Party by the words and actions of everyone from Nancy Pelosi and Ezra Klein to Rashida Tlaib and Ibram X. Kendi to the socialist activist whose bad tweet went viral and the high school classmate who posts her lefty opinions on Facebook a lot. It doesn’t matter that many of these people are not Democratic officeholders, Democratic operatives, or even Democrats at all. Perceptions of Democrats are, frustratingly, shaped by a great many totally unaccountable and unelected randos. There is not much the party can do about that, other than realize it has a different task than that of the activist or the journalist.\n\nThis same dynamic applies to Republicans, too, except that since Trump the party has adopted a schoolyard bully’s strategy of plausible deniability, insisting that the comments and acts of its most prominent supporters and even many of its members were just jokes. There is enormous daylight between most national Democratic elected officials and the furthest-left social media makers; there is far less between the GOP and even the very far right, some of the most racist and appalling members of which have dined with Trump and been invited to the White House. The Democrats seem to suffer from being a serious party with serious leaders: Voters take Democrats and those they assume to be Democrats seriously. Republicans, on the other hand, have become so deeply unserious that voters can wave away all manner of bad behavior.\n\nAs I’m a college-educated millennial liberal who cut her educational teeth on critical theory and very much supports the use of inclusive language as well as sensible DEI policies and equity initiatives, and who is part of the broader media universe that coalesces in voters’ minds as “the Democrats” or at least “the left,” this is all more than a bit painful for me to write. Movements for gender equality, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ rights are not, in fact, what caused Donald Trump, and it is not the job of these movements to compromise their own values to elect Democrats. “Democrats lost because of wokeness” is too pat and convenient of an explanation.\n\nBut Democrats and those of us who make up these “woke” movements would do well to remember what we came here to do. It’s not to remind each and every American of their relative advantage or disadvantage as if each person must be dropped onto some point of a privilege matrix, or to distill people’s multifaceted lives into simplistic identity categories, or tell a facile story of victims and perpetrators. It’s not even to give the very worst-off the very bare minimum. It’s to make ourselves irrelevant: to make people’s lives significantly better, and the country just and fair, so that everyone can prosper. It’s not to drag the relatively better-off down to the bottom, but to allow more people to pull themselves up.\n\nThe OBBBA puts the Trump administration’s jackboot on the neck of the American people. It makes our health care worse and more expensive, makes our children less healthy, and makes our country less financially stable. These are easy messages for Democrats to craft. But the bigger task at hand, and one that will continue far past the midterms, is for Democrats to fundamentally recalibrate their assumptions about what American citizens want, how they see themselves, and what they need. Democrats must be the ones who give voters more springboards to success, not just a more robust safety net when they fall. They should talk to voters less as “needy” or vulnerable and more as capable and deserving of opportunity but stymied by outside forces, Trump and his Republican Party chief among them. This isn’t exactly a groundbreaking strategy, but it’s nevertheless one Democrats seem to have struggled with over the years. And the easiest part about it is that it treats Americans like capable adults, and it tells them the truth.","summary":"There's something Republicans understand about the American psyche that Democrats don't.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/08/trump-midterms-democrats-2026-big-beautiful-bill-medicaid.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/e36ece1f-e689-4214-b429-02d4e83dd4af.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 09:40:00","author":"Jill Filipovic","authors":["Jill Filipovic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":354066628,"title":"We Are Rising—A Tribute to the Women Who Lead, and a Call to Those Who Will | Opinion","text":"One year ago, Vice President Kamala Harris made history— not quietly, not incrementally, but with the thunderclap of a nation catching up to the truth Black women have long known: We are not just qualified to lead—we already do.Her nomination wasn't just a personal milestone. It was a collective victory, built on generations of resistance, resilience, and rising.When she accepted the 2024 Democratic nomination in Chicago, the crowd was electric, the moment undeniable. A Black woman at the top of the ticket—not as a symbol, but as a leader, trailblazer and stateswoman.Kamala Harris has never needed a road map—she's been busy paving her own. From San Francisco's District Attorney's office to the U.S. Senate floor and to the White House.Harris didn't win in 2024. But she came close enough to leave the door wide open—with the welcome mat out and the porch light on.And Harris didn't rise alone.Behind her were powerful Black women who helped steer the transition from Joe to Kamala—strategizing, organizing, and building trust brick by brick. Their leadership was not just tactical, it was spiritual. They reminded the country what Black women have always done: carried the vision and the burden, steered the moment, and steadied the soul.Harris' story is only the latest verse in a centuries-old chorus. From Harriet Tubman's midnight raids to Coretta Scott King's noonday calls for justice, Black women have been writing this nation's most essential footnotes—often without credit, always with impact.Even in defeat, Harris proved the presidency is not out of reach—just overdue. That same year, Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester joined the U.S. Senate, bringing fresh voices to a body long overdue for both.Today, the Congressional Black Caucus boasts 62 members—and counting. We are in the room. We are at the table. We are building longer tables still. To honor this moment, we must also honor the road we've traveled—and the women who built it.Black heroines like Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth risked everything for liberation. Tubman didn't just lead people to freedom—she led troops into battle. Truth didn't just speak truth to power—she held a mirror up to the nation's soul.Black suffragists like Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper carried dual burdens—fighting racism in suffrage circles and sexism in Black political movements. And still, they pressed forward.During the Civil Rights Movement, Ella Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer, Septima Clark, Diane Nash, and Dorothy Height didn't wait for permission to lead. They organized in basements, spoke on podiums, and turned kitchen tables into war rooms for democracy.Always—in churches and classrooms, at ballot boxes and bus stops—Black women have kept this democracy afloat, even when it tried to throw us overboard.So where do we go from here? What will it take to keep rising?First—Recognition and RepresentationNot just headcounts, but real seats at real tables— preferably with the mic already on.Second—Structural ChangeNot tinkering at the margins—but pulling injustice out at the roots and making equity non-negotiable.Third—CoalitionsBecause Black women have never tried to do it alone— we've just gotten used to the silence when we called for backup. That must change.Fourth—MentorshipPass the mic. Pass the torch. Pass the playbook. Don't just make room—make ready.Fifth—Voting RightsBecause democracy doesn't defend itself—but Black women know how to do that. We've done it before. We're doing it still.And Finally—JoyBecause our fight is not only about what we resist—it's also about what we protect.Joy is not an afterthought—it is the undercurrent. The quiet defiance. The sacred inheritance passed down from grandmothers who laughed even when there was little to laugh about, from church choirs that sang through sorrow, from front porches where stories and sweet tea flowed in equal measure.Joy is a strategy. A spiritual protest. A reminder that even while we're marching, organizing, testifying, and legislating—we are also dancing, praising, loving, and living. Because we know that justice without joy is brittle. And progress without pleasure is unsustainable.So we protect joy like we protect the vote—fiercely and collectively.The torch is not just lit—it's luminous, passed hand to hand with purpose and grace. The path forward is neither straight nor smooth, but it is ours to walk—and widen. The story of American democracy remains unfinished, its next chapter waiting not for perfection, but for participation.So let us rise—not just to honor those who came before, but to become the ones future generations will thank.The moment is calling.Donna Brazile is an ABC News contributor, veteran political strategist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, and the former interim Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).Yolanda H.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published last week, pegged his approval rating at 40% while his disapproval rating stood at 54% (up two points from July). The poll was taken after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska earlier this month, and it found that 54% Americans, including 1-in-5 Republicans, believe he is too closely aligned with Russia.

MAGA'\n\nThe president has turned up the heat in his war against mainstream media, having called for all three major networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - to either lose their licenses or be shut down in the past year, in addition to successfully suing both CBS' 60 Minutes and ABC News. \n\nTrump was clearly tuned into the Sunday news shows, having called for Chris Christie to be investigated for 'criminal acts' following his appearance on ABC News' This Week on Truth Social before he went off on both Disney-owned ABC and Comcast-owned NBC.\n\nHe also asked on Sunday: 'Why is it that ABC and NBC FAKE NEWS, two of the absolute worst and most biased networks anywhere in the World, aren't paying Millions of Dollars a year in LICENSE FEES.'\n\nHe then accused them of not just being biased against himself but the Republican Party as a whole.\n\n'They should lose their Licenses for their unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives , but at a minimum, they should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime!!! Crooked 'journalism' should not be rewarded, it should be terminated!!!'\n\nIt's the second time the president has threatened these two networks in recent months. \n\nThe tirade comes after Trump signed an executive order slashing funding for PBS and NPR. \n\nTrump moved against the publicly funded networks over an alleged bias against conservatives, saying that it was 'wasting billions' on 'atrocious' broadcasting. \n\nBut the president has not been afraid to hold the networks accountable during his second term for what he sees as unfair coverage. \n\nIn mid-July Trump reached a settlement with CBS and Paramount triggered by a 60 Minutes interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nTrump said that Paramount/CBS/60 Minutes paid $16 million in the settlement and anticipated an additional $20 million from the new owners of CBS in advertising, PSAs or similar programming. \n\nTrump famously protested the 60 Minutes interview of Harris with host Bill Whitaker after it was revealed that one of the vice president's lengthy spiraling answers on Israel was edited for the public broadcast. \n\nIn protest, he filed a $20 billion lawsuit to challenge CBS and 60 Minutes, arguing that the show's producers purposefully edited the interview to make Harris look better and sway the presidential election.\n\nCBS argued that their edits were part of the normal editorial process. \n\nAfter Trump won the election and became president the Federal Communications Commission ordered for the original video and transcripts to be made public.\n\nParamount, CBS, and 60 Minutes settled the president's lawsuit out of court, rather than go to trial. \n\nThe settlement concludes as the company Skydance is preparing to purchase Paramount and CBS, which requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nNews of the settlement is expected to grease the wheels for FCC approval of the proposed merger. \n\nThat victory followed a similar win last December, when ABC News agreed to pay $15 million to Donald Trump to settle a lawsuit over assertions made by top anchor George Stephanopoulos that he was found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. \n\nStephanopoulos had questioned Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican Congresswoman, as to why she was supporting a presidential nominee 'who's been found liable for rape.' \n\nTrump had sued Stephanopoulos and the network for defamation soon after the segment aired. \n\nHis lawyers accused Stephanopoulos of making the statements with 'malice' and a disregard for the truth. \n\nA New York jury in May 2023 ordered Trump to pay $5 million in damages for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s, though he was not found liable for rape. \n\nHe was then ordered to pay another $83.3 million for defamation after he publicly denied sexually abusing Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996.\n\nThe settlement stipulates that the network will pay $15 million as a charitable contribution towards Trump's presidential library. \n\nABC also posted a note on its website expressing regret over the claim in a March 10 segment on 'This Week' made by Stephanopoulos. \n\nThey also paid his legal fees as part of the settlement, which have totaled $1 million.\n\nTrump hasn't kept his attempts to hold the media accountable to the courtroom, however, as he has also asked FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to investigate NBC's parent company Comcast's DEI practices. \n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr sent a letter to CEO Brian Roberts revealing the agency's investigation in February, stating its Enforcement Bureau had been directed to investigate at the behest of the Trump administration.\n\n'I expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the commission's broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates,' Carr wrote in the correspondence.\n\nThe recently appointed chairman noted how Comcast’s website promotes DEI initiatives when it comes to hiring, training and programming.\n\nTrump signed a series of executive orders at the start of his second term that have caused federal agencies to dial down DEI programs, laying off thousands in the process.","summary":"The president called the mainstream outlets 'an actual threat to our Democracy,' adding to previous suggestions they either lose their licenses or be shut down.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15030827/Donald-Trump-major-networks-ABC-NBC-licenses-revoked.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/25/06/101515747-0-image-m-54_1756100506679.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 06:23:11","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Further, independent analysts say, population shifts could create as many as 11 new congressional seats in Republican Southern and Western states after the 2030 U.S. Census.\n\nDemocrats enjoyed 40 years of unbroken House control beginning in 1955 and ending in 1995 as conservative Southern Democrats defected to the Republican Party in earnest.\n\nThe current redistricting battle has raised concerns about a new era of gerrymandering, with Republicans and Democrats jockeying for advantage and further dividing an already polarized nation.\n\n“I feel like it’s cheating,” said Adam Kinzinger, a Trump critic and former Republican congressman who lost his Illinois seat to redistricting after the 2020 census. “Every time we break a norm in politics now, that norm never comes back. It’ll be an avalanche of constant redistricting. I worry about that.”\n\nThe Republican-controlled Texas state legislature last week passed a new map meant to provide five more Republican seats. The Democratic-led California legislature responded by proposing a map that would give Democrats five more seats, though the state’s voters will have to approve that move in a November special election.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll this month found that most Americans oppose partisan gerrymandering, to the degree that many worry about American democracy itself being in jeopardy.\n\nNonpartisan election analysts currently rate just three dozen of the nation’s 435 House districts as competitive in the 2026 midterm elections, pushing the real contests to party primaries that select more partisan lawmakers less interested in compromise.\n\n“That would be another way of saying that the will of the voters is not being reflected in the outcome of the election,” said Thomas Kahn, acting director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University.\n\n“If Republicans build institutional advantages, whether through fundraising … or through gerrymandering, then essentially they will be creating a lock on the House. And I don’t think that’s good for democracy,” he added.\n\nDemocratic strongholds including New York and California are already losing population to Florida, Texas, Idaho and other Republican-led states, a trend that many Republicans view as an endorsement of their party’s policies.\n\n“A lot of the voters who are moving from California – the Bay Area – to Austin or Dallas or Boise, Idaho, are the more conservative-leaning folks who want to live in a red state for a variety of reasons: cost of living, laws and regulations, how the state’s run, business environment, stuff like that,” said Will Kiley, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of the House Republicans.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 21% of Republicans and 14% of Democrats have considered moving to a different state where taxes are lower.\n\nThe U.S. Census data that underlies redistricting expectations shows that nearly all of the population growth in states such as Texas and Florida since 2020 has occurred in minority communities.\n\nIn Texas, which is expected to pick up three to four House seats after 2030 according to party redistricting committees, nearly 97% of newcomers are Hispanic, Black or Asian. In Florida, which could add two to four seats, the same groups account for more than three-quarters of the growth, U.S. Census data shows.\n\n“What we know to be true is that growth is almost completely within communities of color. And those are the very communities that these changes are attempting to curtail,” said Kareem Crayton, vice president at New York University’s nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nMinority voters have shifted toward Republicans in recent elections. Trump saw a 14 percentage-point improvement among Hispanic voters from his 2020 performance, though he still lost the demographic group overall to Democratic rival then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe new congressional map unveiled by Texas Republicans at Trump’s behest appears to cater to Hispanic voters. But Democrats say Republicans have eroded the group’s electoral power in some Hispanic-majority districts by minimizing the number of voting-age Latinos and adding high-turnout white conservative communities.\n\nPartisan rancor in Congress has intensified since Trump began his second term in January, driving out moderate Republicans including Representative Don Bacon, who drew Trump’s ire after disagreeing with the administration over proposed funding cuts and security gaps at the Pentagon. Wisconsin Republican Mike Gallagher, once seen as a rising Republican star, left office in early 2024 after a firestorm of criticism for opposing the impeachment of former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\n“We have major issues to solve. We’re not solving them,” said former Representative John Duarte, who was rated the least conservative House Republican by Heritage Action for America before losing his California seat to Democrat Adam Gray last year. “We can do a lot. But right now, everyone’s running away from the ball.”","summary":"WASHINGTON,  (Reuters) &#8211; President Donald Trump&#8217;s push for Republican-led states to redraw their U.S. House of Representatives districts to protect their majority in next year&#8217;s midterm elections could set the stage for Republicans to dominate the chamber in decades to come, political analysts and experts said.\n\n\nThe article Trump&#8217;s redistricting push could bring decades of Republican rule to the US House appeared first on Stabroek News.","url":"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/08/25/news/world/trumps-redistricting-push-could-bring-decades-of-republican-rule-to-the-us-house/","image":"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2025/08/facists.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-25 06:04:22","author":"Stabroek News","authors":["Stabroek News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":353978296,"title":"The Democrats are in deep trouble in the US – and Labour is on the way to joining them | Nesrine Malik","text":"The measure of a political party’s failure lies not in how many agnostics and opponents it fails to convert, but in how many loyalists it fails to preserve. The endorsement of new, unnatural voters – Latinos in the US for Donald Trump, or Tories voting for Labour for the first time – might deliver big electoral swings but is ultimately not sticky. And these votes are only meaningful if the bedrock is solid. That bedrock is the people who consistently show up, no matter what, from generation to generation, for a party. And the Democrats are losing them.\n\nIn extensive research published last week tracking voter registration, the New York Times identified an alarming pattern. The Democratic party has been “haemorrhaging” voters since way before election day. In the states that track voter registration by political party, Democrats lost to Republicans in all of them in the years between 2020 and 2024. By the time Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden, the party had already shed more than 2m votes in those states, and Republicans had gained 2.4m. This is part of a “four-year swing” that amounts to 4.5m votes. In a chilling conclusion, the report states that “few measurements reflect the luster of a political party’s brand more clearly than the choice by voters to identify with it”.\n\nThe signs get worse the more closely you look. It’s not just a decline in new registered voters, but a hacking away of those natural voters who parties can easily rely on. Some of the sharpest declines were among young voters who came out emphatically for Joe Biden in 2020, then swung towards Trump in 2024. An assumption that voters who are young, Black or Latino would register mostly in the Democrats’ favour was no longer safe.\n\nThe most striking thing about these revelations is how long and consistent the turn-off has been: “There is no silver lining or cavalry coming across the hill,” said one voter registration analyst, “this is month after month, year after year.” They show how during the last election, when the Democrats were battling with the damage of a belated handover from Biden to Harris, and a swirl of other challenges, the party was already on the back foot, hostage to a years-long disillusionment. And if you look at some of the reasoning for Democrat abandonment from last year, the same conclusion heaves into view – the Democrats rested on their laurels, and Trump attacked. The vibe contest was between business as usual, and the promise of something different.\n\nThe result is a cratering of Democrat support that cannot be filled in overnight, or even over the next three years, especially with the party seemingly in disarray, and with a lo-fi leadership in Chuck Schumer accused of being “unwilling and unable to meet the moment”. It’s not about the unique, mendacious bewitching of voters by Trump, but something broader. Centre-left parties seem trapped by their inability and unwillingness to articulate values in ways that go beyond just saying the other guys are bad for democracy, by identifying a vision of what and who they are for.\n\nThey are operating in a world where traditional coalitions around class, labour and identity are dissolving, where high barriers to home ownership, social mobility and job stability have been erected, and the relationship between hard work and prosperity, or even viability, has been severed. Combine that with an online and media ecosystem that trades in attention and feeling, and you have a political climate that requires policy intervention and campaigning edge.\n\nInstead, as summed up by Gabriel Winant after Trump’s victory, Kamala Harris had “stretched her coalition into incoherence” in a “grab bag” of policies “sharing no clear thematic unity or coherence”. This is the result of both a lack of direction, and of a party that now houses both the powerful and those at the losing end of that power, which can only mean a lop-sided capture by the former. Or, as chillingly observed by Anton Jäger: “Bankers and warmongers predominate in Democrat ruling circles, the indebted and the marginalised among its rank-and-file.” This reminds me of Keir Starmer’s drive to cast Labour as “pro-business, pro-worker and pro-wealth creation”. You cannot have coherence when the interests you represent, or claim to represent, are by definition antagonistic.\n\nThis brand tension has an analogue in a smaller but no less revealing way in the UK, where students are abandoning Labour. University Labour clubs are disaffiliating from the party, Labour’s youth membership has collapsed, the tail of a longer falling out with Labour leadership over Gaza. But this is a broader confrontation between young voters and a party that has failed to stand for any clear moral principles that appeal to the idealism so necessary to create not only future voters, but activists and campaigners. On Gaza, Labour is anti-starvation, but also anti-protest.\n\nAnd both the Democrats and Labour are positioning themselves antagonistically to those whose sharper expressions of political vision are hugely popular with those who are abandoning them. Senior Democrats might still not endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who is posting stunning polling leads. Labour disciplines MPs for rebelling against benefit cuts, even as hundreds of thousands of people register their support for a new party.\n\nBut as new and future voters are lost, the lion’s share of the windfall goes to those on the right and extreme right who have already mastered the gamification of politics, and the ability to summon fever dreams of threats that must be dealt with and prosperity that is just around the corner. “Elections are won from the centre” goes the old adage, but increasingly the centre itself has changed as the world becomes not a place of wide-tent compromise, but of irreconcilable differences. And I would venture another formulation – elections are won in the past. By the time it becomes apparent that remote and complacent centrist politics is not even managing to convince its own tribes, it will be too late. Some would argue it already is.\n\n Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist","summary":"When millions of once-loyal supporters become disillusioned with a party, there can only be one result: electoral disaster\n\nThe measure of a political party’s failure lies not in how many agnostics and opponents it fails to convert, but in how many loyalists it fails to preserve.

Subscribe here!\n\nIt’s no small crime, and those Trump critics who pretend it is trivial and commonplace have short memories and low ethics.\n\nPulte, a Trump appointee with deep expertise in housing finance, is quite properly focused on cleaning up the industry.\n\n“Mortgage fraud is a serious crime,” Pulte told me, promising it will “be nearly eliminated after we’re done.”\n\nHis crusade to root out fraud, waste and unethical conduct in the housing finance system is to ensure the stability of the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee about half the country’s residential mortgages.\n\nPulte notes that the mortgage fraud case he referred to the DOJ against Lisa Cook is especially significant because “the very person entrusted with setting interest rates should never manipulate them for personal gain.”\n\nIt’s significant in another way too, because it plays into Trump’s power struggle with Jerome Powell.\n\nThe independent Federal Reserve chairman has stubbornly refused to cut interest rates, citing inflation concerns, earning the wrath of President Trump, who points out that the Fed was happy enough to adjust rates to Joe Biden’s political benefit, including by a half percentage point seven weeks before the 2024 election.\n\nFlipping the balance\n\nIf Cook, whose term is not up until 2038, is forced to resign over the mortgage fraud allegations, Trump will be able to appoint a governor of his choice to replace her, thus flipping the balance of the Fed in his favor, 4-3, and putting the heat on Powell. (Another Biden appointee, Adriana Kugler, resigned unexpectedly this month.)\n\nCook, like Schiff and James, denies Pulte’s allegations that she falsified documents to claim two properties — a house in Ann Arbor, Mich., and a condo in Atlanta — both as her primary residence, giving her more favorable mortgage terms.\n\nShe mentions the purchases predate her 2022 appointment to the Fed’s seven-member Board, one of four diversity appointments made by Biden as part of his peculiar obsession with identity politics above all.\n\nThe investigation is understood to include questions over whether she misrepresented her mortgage situation to the board when she was being vetted.\n\nAfter Pulte tweeted a copy of his criminal referral letter about Cook to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Special Attorney Ed Martin last week, Trump took the opportunity on Truth Social to demand that she “resign now!!!”\n\nPulte responded on X that “the President has great cause to fire Lisa Cook” and alleged that Powell might “be complicit with Cook’s alleged fraud.”\n\nIn an extraordinary puff piece over the weekend, The New York Times framed the allegations against Cook as a racist anti-DEI purge against the first black female Fed governor, decrying “attacks [that] focused on her property ownership given that Black Americans were nearly 40 percent less likely than white Americans to own homes.”\n\nThe Times also referred to Cook’s “best-known academic paper [that] showed how lynchings and other violence against Black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries reduced the number of patents they filed.”\n\nThe relevance escapes me.\n\nCook is either guilty or innocent of mortgage fraud, and the color of her skin is irrelevant, just as Schiff and James’s guilt or innocence has nothing to do with how much they hate Trump.\n\nNo mercy from Don\n\nBut the fact is that if high-profile Democrats have been dumb enough or crooked enough or arrogant enough to flout the law, they can hardly expect to find mercy from Trump who, after all, suffered through 91 felony indictments from three Democrat prosecutors, aimed at throwing him in jail and off the ballot, not to mention James’ $500 million civil suit aimed at destroying his company, an absurd penalty which a New York appeals court threw out last week.\n\nThat was just in five months in 2023, during his second presidential campaign, and came on top of a relentless campaign of lies and character assassination, including Russiagate and two impeachments, that crippled his first presidency.\n\nJust to remind us of those travails, Sunday was the second anniversary of Trump’s famously defiant mug shot, when he had to surrender at Fulton County Jail in a Georgia election interference case led by Democrat district attorney Fani Willis — who incidentally ended up being thrown off the case in her own sordid scandal.\n\nTrump has framed the mug shot from the cover of the New York Post and it sits in pride of place at the entrance to the Oval Office, for all to see and marvel at his endurance.\n\nDid Trump’s antagonists never expect a boomerang?\n\nIf they’ve done nothing wrong, they will be exonerated.\n\nBut, as they like to say: “No one is above the law.”\n\nIt never gets old.\n\nIt’s hard to know why James Comer is being coy about subpoenaing Kamala Harris to testify before the House Oversight Committee about Joe Biden’s cognitive state during his presidency.\n\nFew people had a better opportunity to observe Biden’s decline at close hand and behind the scenes than his loyal vice president.\n\nShe joined him for his presidential daily briefing, appeared with him at public events, and at the start of his presidency, she used to have weekly lunches with him in the small dining room off the Oval Office. You’d think she’d have an idea why they petered out,\n\nIt is the vice president’s constitutional duty to step in if the president is unable to fulfill his duties. \n\nFrom what we saw with our own eyes and have learned since his disastrous debate performance last year, Biden was in no shape to be president for at least part of his term, so what went wrong with that failsafe mechanism?\n\nThe American people are owed an explanation about why Harris didn’t invoke the 25th Amendment and whether there was ever any consideration of it by the Cabinet. \n\nChairman Comer is right that it will “haunt” her political career, but he should insist that she testify immediately.","summary":"It’s no small crime, and those Trump critics who pretend it is trivial and commonplace have short memories and low ethics.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/24/opinion/hypocritical-dems-are-flouting-laws-and-blaming-trump-they-are-missing-an-important-point-in-the-process/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/lisa-cook-testifies-senate-banking-109883588-e1756088740839.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/r8GXlRJL-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-25 02:43:44","author":"Miranda Devine","authors":["Miranda Devine"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":354114872,"title":"HALEY KENNINGTON: Meet Democrats’ — And China’s — New Favorite Republican","text":"Whenever liberals start describing a Republican as brave or principled, you can be sure it’s because he or she is stabbing the party in the back.\n\nMeet Democrats’ latest hero Roger Alford.

Trump intelligence officials told the DOJ that they strongly believe an HPE-Juniper deal would help mitigate that exposure by creating a new, larger company that can compete with Huawei globally.\n\nThis is all pretty straightforward. But Alford had other ideas.\n\nIn a speech dripping with holier-than-thou self-importance, he claimed the deal only went through because a “cabal of MAGA-In-Name-Only lobbyists and DOJ officials” were working behind the scenes “to exert and expand their influence and enrich themselves. Never once in his speech did he mention that Trump’s senior intelligence officials urged the DOJ to clear the merger.\n\nClaims like these are catnip for Democrats. Vox gave the speech a glowing write-up. David Dayen, executive editor of the progressive American Prospect, gushed that Alford is a “no-doubt conservative” who is nevertheless “cursed with having a sense of right and wrong.”\n\nSound familiar? It should.\n\nWhen Mitt Romney ran for president, the media absurdly called him a homophobic bully and animal abuser. But when he voted to remove President Trump from office, he suddenly became a genuine profile in courage.\n\nTo this crowd, Dick Cheney was a genocidal war criminal — until he endorsed Kamala Harris.\n\nRobert Mueller was just another Republican insider — until he was tapped to investigate Trump. Then the media slapped his face on prayer candles, and fashion blogs drooled over his Brooks Brothers suits.\n\nIt’s the same tired playbook every time: find a Republican willing to knife Trump or his agenda and turn him into a temporary folk hero.\n\nThe liberal media are desperate to elevate Alford because they want to turn the HPE-Juniper deal into a major headache for the Trump administration. Signalgate fizzled, so now they’re jonesing for a second bite at the apple.\n\nDayen practically salivated over Alford’s use of the word “scandal” to describe the DOJ approval.\n\nUnfortunately for the Dems, the “HPE-Juniper merger scandal” is a giant nothingburger.\n\nAlford can make all the insinuations he wants about shady lobbyists and smoke-filled rooms, but the truth is that senior U.S. intelligence officials have already gone on the record to set things straight.\n\n“In light of significant national security concerns, a settlement [greenlighting the deal] … serves the interests of the United States by strengthening domestic capabilities and is critical to countering Huawei and China,” one official told Axios last month.\n\nThat should be case closed — unless, of course, you’re a disgruntled ex-official chasing headlines.\n\nIn response to Alford’s speech, a DOJ spokesperson called him “the James Comey of antitrust,” a bitter bureaucrat “pursuing blind self-promotion and ego.”\n\nAnd here’s what the media won’t tell you: The Daily Caller reported Wednesday that in 2016, Alford gave a speech at a Chinese university attacking then-candidate Trump’s tough stance toward Beijing.\n\nAccording to a summary of that speech, Alford told his Chinese audience that “Trump fundamentally distrusts basic tenets of free trade.”\n\nWell, of course he does — at least when it comes to China. Anyone who believes in “free trade” with a communist dictatorship that uses currency manipulation, government subsidies, intellectual property theft, and even slave labor is dangerously naïve.\n\nSo let’s be clear: Alford wasn’t just butting heads with Pam Bondi on antitrust. He was actively undercutting Trump’s national security strategy—propping up the same failed globalist playbook that let China steamroll American workers for decades.\n\nAlford’s career as a “principled Republican” media celebrity is probably just getting started. The “scandal” he’s pushing, on the other hand, is dead on arrival. Even Trump’s intelligence officials have already stated that the deal is crucial to outmaneuvering Huawei. That should be the end of the story.\n\nSuppose Roger Alford wants to be MSNBC’s next “principled conservative” contributor, fine. But let’s not pretend he’s putting America first. He’s putting China first — and Democrats couldn’t be happier about it.\n\nHaley Kennington (@LadyKennington) is an investigative journalist and conservative commentator.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and even smug activist David Hogg have been urging their fellow party members to get a grip and start trying to appeal to normal people.\n\nBut they’re all ignoring a two-fold problem: Namely, progressive speech police had the power to bully the politicians into talking this way in the first place — and into the deranged thinking that the crazy talk reflects.\n\nSo many Democrats talk this way because the tiny minority of people who think “chest feeding” must replace “breast feeding” (to cover biological males supposedly doing it!) have convinced them that it’s the only way to be “inclusive.” \n\nThat is, Dems have come to fear the wrath of their progressive censors if they don’t stick to the “correct” terms and the delusions this language represents.\n\nEven if they think they’ve got permission to talk normally now, shifting their policies will still outrage the party’s base. \n\nThird Way is pretending that rhetoric is Democrats’ only problem, not substance: “In reality, most Democrats do not run or govern on wildly out-of-touch social positions,” the memo said.\n\nBUZZZZ. Wrong. \n\nProminent Democrats have loudly and proudly backed gender transition for kids, wide-open borders, no-bail laws that release criminals back onto the streets and countless other harebrained schemes that only appeal to activists and pathologically online progressives.\n\nThird Way’s strategists may not deem this stuff to be “wildly out-of-touch,” but the vast majority of Americans do.\n\nAnd so the Trump campaign last year could accurately point out that Kamala Harris supported mandatory taxpayer-funding of gender-reassignment surgeries for illegal immigrants.\n\nIt wasn’t just the disasters of the Biden-Harris team that doomed her presidential run.\n\nAnd these policies won’t become more palatable to voters if Democrats just start using less-weird words.\n\nIf anything, covering up radical beliefs with sensible-seeming language expose them as dishonest as well as nuts.\n\nAmericans are tired of being talked down to with HR-approved wokeisms, but the words are not the heart of the problem. \n\nIt’s the policies, stupid.","summary":"Democrats face criticism for focusing on woke language over controversial policies.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/24/opinion/democrats-wokeism-is-annoying-but-their-policies-are-the-problem/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/speaks-rising-cost-gasoline-capitol-52408180-e1756084523975.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/r8GXlRJL-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-25 01:35:15","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.421},{"id":353942582,"title":"Gavin Newsom has momentum—but can it take him to the White House?","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nIn some ways, it feels ridiculous to be already gaming out 2028. We haven’t even hit the 2026 midterms yet—an election that could dramatically reshape which Democrats look viable in the first place. But that hasn’t stopped people from speculating. And if you look at the numbers, a name that keeps creeping up is California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nBack in February, Echelon Insights—a Republican polling outfit—asked likely Democratic voters who they’d support if the 2028 primary were happening right now. Former Vice President Kamala Harris led comfortably with 36%. Newsom? He was a blip in fourth place, barely pulling 6%.\n\nFast-forward to today, and the same question got a very different answer. Harris still tops the list, but her support slid ten points, down to 26%. Newsom, meanwhile, more than doubled his share, jumping into second with 13%. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg stayed basically flat (10% to 11%), while New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez nudged up a single point (5% to 6%).\n\nThat wasn’t an outlier. A separate POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab survey of California Democrats found Newsom actually beating Harris head-to-head, 25% to 19%. Even more striking: Three-quarters of Democrats in the state said they were “excited” about Newsom running. Just 67% said the same of Harris.\n\nSo what’s driving the shift? Part of it is obvious. Voters don’t tend to warm up to candidates who’ve already lost, and Harris hasn’t exactly been a dominant presence since the last election. Even she has admitted that she doesn’t “want to go back in the system” right now. Her numbers in early polls may be less about enthusiasm and more about familiarity.\n\nNewsom, by contrast, is everywhere. He’s been front and center in Democrats’ pushback against President Donald Trump’s agenda—fighting gerrymandering in Texas, slamming immigration raids, and railing against Trump’s tariffs. He’s made himself into a foil at a moment when many Democrats seem hesitant to claim the spotlight.\n\n“Newsom is earning his frontrunner status by providing an answer to the question that Democrats across the country have been asking themselves since January: How do we fight back? He has become someone who offers both political courage and tangible roots to resistance,” Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, told Daily Kos.\n\nAnd unlike Harris, the issues that Newsom’s choosing to fight about are widely supported. Look at Trump’s disastrous federal takeover of D.C. policing. A Washington Post-Schar School poll found that about 80% of D.C. residents oppose Trump’s executive order to federalize law enforcement in the nation’s capital, with nearly 70% opposing it “strongly.” The same survey showed that while concerns about crime remain, residents overwhelmingly reject Trump’s heavy-handed approach. In fact, 65% of respondents said that the president’s actions (e.g., ordering the federal government to take control of D.C.’s police, along with the National Guard and the FBI patrolling the city) would not lower violent crime. In comparison, only 20% predicted it would.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, has been one of the loudest voices criticizing the move, calling it an abuse of power. He might also be uniquely positioned to speak on this issue. After all, in June, Trump federalized the California National Guard members and sent them to Los Angeles over Newsom’s objections after protests erupted when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began mass arrests.\n\nIn California, Newsom gained momentum with his redistricting proposal aimed at reclaiming power from GOP gerrymanders elsewhere. Internal polling from Democratic strategist David Binder, obtained by Axios, shows that 57% of Californians support Newsom’s plan to redraw congressional districts, with support increasing as more voters become aware of it. Only 35% oppose. This creates a 22-point lead on an issue that could reshape the map to favor Democrats.\n\nIn short, Trump’s moves are unpopular; Newsom’s are not. That creates an opening—and Newsom is rushing to fill it.\n\n“One lesson here is that Democrats may still be able to succeed by just opposing Trump. He’s been the galvanizing issue of American politics for nine years now, and one of the thoughts among the political class is that Democrats need to stand for more than opposition to Trump, but Newsom’s rise shows that simply opposing the president’s agenda can generate a lot of momentum,” Kousser said.\n\nNewsom’s also borrowing liberally from Trump’s playbook. His team has embraced all-caps tweets, mimicking Trump’s bombast while trying to turn it back on him. It’s performative, sure, but it keeps him in the headlines and positions him as a Democrat willing to go toe-to-toe with the former president on his turf.\n\nAll of this helps explain why Newsom appears to be one of the few Democrats with real momentum right now. With the party still struggling to find an identity, he’s carved out space as a fighter. The problem is that it doesn’t necessarily mean he’s the real deal.\n\nNewsom has a long record of trying to triangulate, and it’s not always a pretty sight. He was once seen as a strong leftist, embracing the idea of a single-payer healthcare system. There was also a time when he was more inclusive with his language, using the gender-neutral reference “LatinX” for people of Latin American descent.\n\nBut Newsom has shifted to the right in many ways, sometimes making fellow Democrats uncomfortable. Regarding the use of the term LatinX, he recently denounced it as an “out-of-touch fixation” by his party-mates. And in the debut episode of his politics podcast in March, he threw cold water on the idea that transgender women and girls should be allowed to compete in sports aligned with their gender identity. This stance put him uncomfortably close to Republican talking points. He has also proposed ending new enrollment for low-income undocumented immigrants in California’s Medi-Cal program starting in 2026, and by 2027, charging $100 per month to those already enrolled. That’s not exactly progressive leadership.\n\nThen there’s the style factor: He can come across as smarmy and often seems more focused on branding himself as the anti-Trump than on articulating a clear vision. For every moment he looks like a principled fighter, there’s another where he seems like a calculating centrist hedging his bets.\n\nDaily Kos has hammered him before for trying too hard to find common ground with Republicans, which can make him look slippery at best and duplicitous at worst. In a Democratic primary, where authenticity matters, that could be a huge liability.\n\nRelated | Gavin Newsom's epic trolling is sending Republicans into fits\n\nSo the question lingers: Is his rise in the polls about genuine leadership—or just about being the loudest Democrat at the right time? Right now, voters seem willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But history suggests he’ll have a hard time keeping that goodwill if his opportunism keeps poking through.\n\nWhat’s undeniable is that Newsom has managed to make himself part of the 2028 conversation in a way that almost no other Democrat has. Harris may still technically lead the pack, but she’s fading. Buttigieg, Ocasio-Cortez, and others are basically treading water. \n\nAnd if that momentum holds, Democrats are going to have to grapple with a new reality: Newsom, for better or worse, might be their frontrunner-in-waiting.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Latino voters were already turning against Trump because of his harsh deportation policies, which have only worsened recently. Now, new polling indicates his economic record is also pushing them away. According to a survey from Data for Progress and Equis, 64% of Latino voters say the current economy is performing “somewhat” or “very” poorly. This sentiment is held by large majorities of registered Latino Democrats (79%) and independents (69%). The outlook remains bleak. Most Latino voters expect the economy to worsen in the next year, with 75% of Democrats, 60% of women, and 57% of independents believing things will “probably” or “definitely” decline.\n\n Could Texas Sen. John Cornyn be making a comeback in the state’s Senate race, where earlier polls showed him trailing scandal-plagued Attorney General Ken Paxton? New polling from Texas Southern University shows Paxton still holding an edge among Republican voters, but the gap is narrowing: Paxton at 44%, Cornyn at 39%, and 17% undecided. Notably, this same poll had Cornyn down nine points just a few months ago. Whichever Republican comes out on top may still face a tough general election in Texas, even in what could be a favorable year for the party. But the tightening numbers indicate that nerves over a Paxton candidacy aren’t limited to party insiders—voters are feeling it too.\n\n It turns out voters aren’t happy about a federal takeover of college campuses. The backlash comes as the Trump administration pressures top universities like Columbia and Harvard to crack down on supposed antisemitism, eliminate DEI programs, and follow federal rules—or risk losing funding. A new poll from The Economist/YouGov shows that 70% of adults believe Washington shouldn’t control university curricula, compared to just 12% who think it’s okay. Even more—77%—oppose the government controlling faculty hiring, with only 10% supporting it. Opposition to federal interference in admissions is also high, with 66% saying it’s not the government’s business. And 58% of respondents oppose entirely cutting off funds as leverage to make schools follow federal policies.\n\nAs of midday Friday, 44.3% of the public approved of Trump, while 52.2% disapproved—a net approval rating of -7.9 points, after rounding, according to election analyst Nate Silver’s polling average.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nIn some ways, it feels ridiculous to be already gaming out 2028.

Trump began. 'He was second to Nolan Ryan in most strike-outs, and he should be in the Baseball Hall of Fame, NOW! \n\n'People think he took drugs, but nothing was proven. He never tested positive, and Roger, from the very beginning, totally denies it. He was just as great before those erroneous charges were leveled at him. That rumor has gone on for years, and there has been no evidence whatsoever that he was a “druggie.” \n\n'This is going to be like Pete Rose where, after over 4,000 Hits, they wouldn’t put him in the Hall of Fame until I spoke to the Commissioner, and he promised to do so, but it was essentially a promise not kept because he only “opened it up” when Pete died and, even then, he said that Pete Rose only got into the mix because of DEATH. \n\n'We are not going to let that happen in the case of Roger Clemens. 354 Wins — Put him in NOW. He and his great family should not be forced to endure this “stupidity” any longer!'\n\nIn March, Trump hit out at MLB, claiming the league needed to 'get off its fat, lazy ass, and elect' Rose posthumously to the Baseball Hall of Fame. \n\nThe late baseball legend was then made Hall of Fame eligible in May when the commissioner altered the policy, consequently lifting the lifetime ban handed down to the 17-time All-Star by then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti in 1989.\n\nAnd Manfred later confessed that the president's outspoken support of Rose - despite the scandals that plagued his career - influenced his decision. \n\n'The President was one of a number of voices that was supportive of the idea that this was the right decision,' he told reporters, via TMZ. 'Obviously, I have respect for the office, and the advice that he gave, I paid attention to.' \n\nHowever, the commissioner did also stress that Trump wasn't the only voice he listened to when weighing up the decision. \n\nRose, a three-time World Series winner, passed away at the age of 83 in September 2024 without ever fulfilling his wish to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile he is considered one of the greatest players in history, the legend was slapped with a lifetime ban for betting on the Cincinnati Reds as both a player and manager of the team in 1989.\n\nYet, Trump has long been an advocate for Rose, saying that he belongs in Cooperstown despite the all-time hit king's issues with gambling, tax fraud, and alleged statutory rape. \n\nMeanwhile, Clemens' legacy in baseball is complicated to say the least.\n\nConsidered by many to be among the greatest pitchers ever, he set a Major League record with the Boston Red Sox by striking out 20 batters in a game in 1986 and did it a decade later to boot. Along the way, the former Texas Longhorns star established himself as one of the game's premier pitchers before moving on to Toronto and New York, winning a pair of World Series titles in the Bronx.\n\nBut Clemens will forever be linked to baseball's steroid era.\n\nHe was named in the infamous Mitchell Report, which was a 20-month investigation into steroid use in baseball. \n\nIn the report, former Yankees trainer Brian McNamee stated he injected Clemens with steroids in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Former teammates Jose Canseco, Andy Pettitte and Jason Grimsley also claimed to know that Clemens used steroids as well.\n\nClemens was ultimately found not guilty of lying to Congress in 2008, when he testified that he did not take steroids.\n\nThe controversy nonetheless tarnishes his reputation as Clemens has been passed repeatedly over for the Hall of Fame, having never received the 75 percent of votes required for induction over his ten years on the ballot. However, he could theoretically be inducted down the road by the Hall's Eras Committees.\n\nHe welcomed Trump's re-election in November, describing the Republican's victory as 'massive for our great country.'\n\nHe also congratulated Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and billionaire backer, Elon Musk.\n\nA native Texan who spent six years with Trump's favorite team, the New York Yankees, Clemens little patience for anyone threatening to flee the United States over Trump's victory over Kamala Harris. \n\n'Who ever said ''I'm leaving America if Trump wins,''' he wrote on X, '… don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.","summary":"Roger Clemens is considered one of the greatest players to take to the mound following his glittering 24-season career in the majors, including

Wes MooreSen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New HampshireRep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-ErianUNICEF executive director Catherine Russell Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.And this week on Face the Nation: The Trump administration builds up the federal presence in the nation's capital to crack down on crime, and the president vows to use similar tactics in other U.S. cities. The number of National Guard troops sent to protect Washington continues to grow, as President Trump praises his own plan to clean up the city.(Begin VT)DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): D.C. was a hellhole, and now it's safe. The numbers were horrible. It was a crime-infested rathole. And they do have a lot of rats. We're getting rid of them too.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: But as Mr. Trump dismissed district leaders' claim of a 30-year low in violent crime, he's vowing a similar surge in Chicago, New York, and other cities. What could that mean for public safety in your community?We will check in with Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore and New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hints at an interest rate cut, and the stock market soars. But he also cautions that the U.S. economy is facing challenging times.(Begin VT)JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: We will get a reality check on Powell's speech on the state of the economy from economist Mohamed El-Erian.Plus: A U.N.-backed group confirms residents of Gaza City are facing catastrophic conditions of famine and warn that it will soon expand to other areas within the Gaza Strip. New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is visiting the region and will join us. We will also talk with UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2,300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside D.C. police forces.And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future?Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned as needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore.And joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic governor, Wes Moore.Thank you for being here.GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Thank you so much for having me.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there – here in D.C., there are Guardsmen from six different states on the street.The mission is – quote – \"beautification duty and support.\" The defense secretary has author – authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but, to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of D.C.Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, there's – there's plenty of reasons.You know, one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're – when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their National Guards to Washington, D.C.So who's going to – who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment. And for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big-government approach in the way they're conducting public safety.The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful.And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the president's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans, is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this.And I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received.When – when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need – where you need a surge of supports for – for traumas and disasters…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: … that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this. And this is a direct deflection that the president is authorizing.MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the president watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing, because he's tweeting about you – or TRUTHing, I guess.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: He says: \"The Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him.\" And he's talking about \"crime-ridden Baltimore.\" It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime.He says it's a bad one. He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby D.C. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it.Is the reality here is you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day. And I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation.So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local – with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history, over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone.MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That – well, no, that came from both federal and state money. And, also, Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges.And the results have been – have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past 2.5 years.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20 percent since I have been the governor. And the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.And so the reason that I have asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, this – these tropes, in these 1980s scare tac – scare tactics.And, you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called We Our Us, who is a violence intervention group. And they say, we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel, because, while the president is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime,.But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States.MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The president's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore has the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis, fourth highest murder rate.To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis. But…GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Correct.And we know we have work to do.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We know – like, if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.MARGARET BRENNAN: But your – the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help. He doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though. He says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF.Do you need more federal help in policing, if your mayor thinks you do?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the president to stop cutting funding, because, if you look at the president's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore, that it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons.Those are actually real, tangible things…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: … that the president of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is – President Trump says so as well – possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: He's spending a lot of time talking about you.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I have been on his mind a lot.(CROSSTALK)MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020, when the, you know, idea was defund the police.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.And, yes, the president spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And, yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected.And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father?And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods, who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work.And we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not presidential timber at all.I imagine you disagree with that assessment?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I have been very clear. I'm not running for president.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it's interesting that – but it's interesting. The president seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people.And that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland.Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You brought up immigration.One of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S.This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and the – what we know is that, you know, and all we're asking for is that the Constitution be followed on this.The Constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues. And when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the president manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the president is using to just – working to exploit the brokenness.And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety, that…(CROSSTALK)MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words, rather than…GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process.I just simply want a court and a judge to decide, what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security, who is – who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor, and executioner inside this case.I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting, or gerrymandering, as some people know it.You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one – one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, I mean, when I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, because. And I think – and I think we have to.MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and I think – and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is, this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the president of the United States, very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes, we're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different.But Democrats redistrict. You know this.,GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: But Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where – where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps.And we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters' voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps…MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent – they have a Republican representative, that they are actively being represented in Maryland?GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think, if you look at maps across the country, less than 10 percent of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature, less than 10 percent.And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30 percent.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: So that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so, yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, we are.MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan.Good morning, Senator.I know we have got a bit of a delay here, so I will launch right in.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-New Hampshire): Good morning, or afternoon here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, exactly.You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed. The Pentagon did not explain why.In addition, the Navy reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed.Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings.And they come on the heels of firings earlier this year of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of naval operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things – one of the strengths of America's military are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks who have the training, the expertise to be able to do the jobs.And what we don't want is political people in those jobs who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So, it's very troubling.MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze. And we're going to try to get that back up if we can. The senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan.So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan.We lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator.Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday this internationally recognized body backed by the U.N., the IPC – it tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a manmade famine under way in Gaza. This is a very rare designation. Only four other times has one been designated.The country you are in, Jordan, called it a shameful failure of humanity, that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three-month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen.One of the – we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is a – funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration.They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in, in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable.Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli prime minister's office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it – quote – \"a modern blood libel spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\"That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate, rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor. And the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it.But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that. They are getting ready to do another – or they have already started planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people.So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in to the people who are starving.MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your criticism right now.I want to ask you a little bit, though, about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former Deputy National Security Adviser for President Biden Joe – Jon Finer just wrote a piece in \"The Atlantic.\"And he said that, while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes: \"We did far too little far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\"Do you agree with him? And do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position.With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in.I think – it's something that I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.But do you agree with this self-criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We should be doing more, and we should have done more, absolutely.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.I want to also ask you…SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think everybody should…MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: … have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense, when it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid, when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck.And they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, who are starving.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And that can be changed.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan.A bit of a delay there.We will be right back.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Congressman Mike Lawler is standing by.So, stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York.Good to have you here, Congressman.There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland. And that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The president encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well.Why do you so strongly oppose this?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. And mine wasn't even one of them. Despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat. I won by six and a half points.So, when you look at the map across the country, the fact is, roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts, they're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and, therefore, they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that, obviously, reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond.But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year. In 2024, at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become speaker –MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting. Despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution.So, now, New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the House.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: So, this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states, trying to get electoral advantage right now.MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the president's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the president of the United States doesn't want it done?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Look, obviously it's going to be a fight. But this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid-decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress, like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974, never held a job outside of elected office, it's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform.So, I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know, there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties because, frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority, period.On the question, though, that we have been – also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The president of the United States has mentioned New York as another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Well, crime has been a major problem in New York for years. And Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime crisis.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but do you want National Guard troops?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized – Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So, that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80 percent of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution. That 80 percent of these individuals are released back out on to the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington, D.C., 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.So, when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate –MARGARET BRENNAN: Well – no, but that's a local – that's a local issue that would need to get changed.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: No, but this –MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the question on the troops, you'd rather troops than –REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: But – but – but, Margaret, this is why the homicide rate is so high.MARGARET BRENNAN: FBI agents or ATF agents or DEAL agents? You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City, you would rather National Guardsmen who have to be trained to police?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I want – I want all of the above. No. No, no, don't – don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above. The FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime.I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation, enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I led that effort. And the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington, D.C., only 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous. And it's exactly why the president is cracking down on crime in major cities.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York state that – that matters. A good amount of money from that chips bill went to New York.On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore. The president wants to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have U.S. taxpayers as a – as a shareholder, own 10 percent.As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Generally speaking, no. I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts –MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the –MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: In the aftermath of the collapse of the market in '08, the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I think what the president is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars –MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel –MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: To manufacture chips.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment.MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to –REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors.MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman –REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That is critical for our foreign policy.MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break.REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I'm going to leave it there.We'll be right back.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the U.S. economy. Mohamed El-Erian is the chief economic adviser at Allianz, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich, Connecticut.Good morning to you.MOHAMED EL-ERIAN (President, Queens College, Cambridge University and Chief Economic Adviser, Allianz): Good morning, Margaret.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we saw the – the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon. But he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So, why then did the financial markets rally?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct, the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability. And the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side and, therefore, an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said, \"significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system.\" \"Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth.\" And there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point. But it's a lot of uncertainty.Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if basically he's saying, throw out your models?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent. And, therefore, he has tended to be late.Look, there is something promising in our future. And that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in A.I., in life sciences, in robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds. And that includes high debt and high deficits.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawler just before you. And that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chipmaker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president of the United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (President Of The United States): He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving up $10 billion for the United States. So, we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10 percent stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so. Margaret, look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing. And that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what the U.S. is saying now is we –MARGARET BRENNAN: Which were paid back.MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back. But at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas.The most important distinction, if I may here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10 percent, but it must not control how this company manages its affairs. Because once we go down that road, that is a really dangerous road, and that will (ph) eat way at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the commerce secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for.I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve chair, which you've nodded to, but the president is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her, without publicly disclosed evidence, of mortgage fraud, and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell encouraging her to be removed.Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, these allegations are unproven. And it's important to stress that.Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So, what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that have resulted in these four resignations.But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. An independence central bank is critical to the well-being of the economy. And there's lots of reasons for that. So, you know, one has to distinguish between the two, I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information and is – is denying wrongdoing here.But just the fact that it is the president directing the attention towards her, doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop, this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I – my fear, and my concern, is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there.We'll be back in a moment.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday by a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing manmade famine and that those conditions will expand soon.UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment.Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us.We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation, so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Well, thank you, Margaret.Let – let me say this. You know, it's – it's been now almost two years since October 7th. And since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for – for months and months and months, which is the terrible famine.You know, we've estimated, at this point, that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who have died from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying, beware, right? This – this famine is just right around the corner and it's – it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know, it's so – it's shocking that it's happened because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising.And what it means really is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image, children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where, you know, suddenly they're – they're – they're all quiet. Children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry. And to see that happen and – especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the U.N. data is flawed. The prime minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice.Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot. Journalists who live inside Gaza. Because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know what you're saying is fact?CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, let me say two things about that. One is, the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people. And they monitor this as they go and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-laden deaths. So, it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate.I would also say, to me, it's – it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, all right. I – I – I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not?First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming. You should see it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absence of that, we're going to have to rely on the – the data that we have, the people who were there. And I can tell you from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean I have spoken to our staff and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived. Many thousands of children who have had amputations and are – you know, I mean just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussions, stop the arguing and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children. Make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a decent future.MARGARET BRENNAN: And – and the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out.On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lieu, and another Mideast envoy, have said the U.N. agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why – why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, I – the – the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, U.N. had 400 places where we – we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, OK. And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food. People are getting shot. It's a – it's a terrible situation. And it doesn't work. It's not working that well.Now, look, I don't – I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our – let us do our work too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say \"we,\" it's not just UNICEF, it's the U.N., it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that gets to the people who need it. And I – you know, do both. I'm fine with that. But at least make sure the humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that. Nobody wants to see that.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. He did indeed.I want to ask you as well about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good. And we need them to step up and do more.Sudan, as you say, it's the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the U.S. really can make a much bigger difference if they try to – to do this work and do it as quickly as possible.MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here when you don't get –CATHERINE RUSSELL: It's horrible.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, first of all, they're not getting food. They are facing horrible sexual violence.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.CATHERINE RUSSELL: I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.CATHERINE RUSSELL: And it's – it's devastating.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.CATHERINE RUSSELL: And the results, as you say, will last for generations.MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that.That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)","summary":"On this \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" broadcast, Maryland Gov.

Mike Lawler on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Aug. 24, 2025","text":"The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime. MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- , REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? [START CROSSTALK]MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local-- REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate-- MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops-- REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen -- REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?[END CROSSTALK]REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back.","summary":"The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep.
