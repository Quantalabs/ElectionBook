We just have to balance our lives there and here. I'm with my family... You know, I missed them a lot. But I miss the US. So we come back and forth.\"Before leaving the country, the couple sold their Connecticut ranch and began their new life in Madrid with their sons Alexander, 6, and James, 4, as well as Silva's son Albert, 11.\n\nThe move occurred after Trump's November victory over Kamala Harris – however, Gere has denied he and his wife's decision to make a major switch was due to Trump, despite the Hollywood star openly bashing the president.\n\nWhile in Spain, Gere has continued to call out the controversial politician, even during his acceptance speech when given the International Goya Award award.'We're in a very dark place in America, where we have a bully, a thug, who's the president of the United States.

Under the two-step deal, Skydance is set to acquire Redstone’s National Amusements holding company, which controls 77.4% of the Paramount Class A common stock outstanding, before merging with the Hollywood studio.\n\nCharles E. Phillips, Jr., who led the board’s special committee that reached the Skydance deal, received $478,009 in total compensation.His package included $266,000 in fees, $198,227 in stock awards and $13,782 reflecting a change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings. Phillips exited the board in October to focus more of his time on Recognize, an investment firm he co-founded and launched back in 2020.\n\nIn addition, four other board members stepped down in the midst of merger talks with Skydance: Frederick Terrell, Nicole Seligman, Dawn Ostroff and Robert Klieger. Terrell received a package of $226,020 in 2024, while Seligman took in $208,000, Ostroff was paid $157,500; and Klieger received $50,039.\n\nThe other remaining board members include Barbara Byrne, who was paid $537,227; Linda Griego, who received $527,077; Judith McHale, who was given $544,738; and Susan Schuman, who was paid $516,227. \n\nThe Skydance deal, which was brokered in July, has been stuck in limbo due to regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses.\n\nSeveral parties have filed petitions to the agency in connection with the deal, including investor Mario Gabelli, who is seeking to pause the review as he investigates “potential fiduciary and/or federal securities violations,” Hollywood’s Teamsters Union, LiveVideoAi.Corp, Fuse Media, conservative law firm The Center for American Rights, which has accused the company of “news distortion,” and Project Rise Partners, which has made an alternative $13.5 billion offer to acquire Paramount. Skydance has asked the FCC to dismiss the objections. It also blasted PRP’s bid as “belated” and “unserious” and said it contains “overwhelming evidence of fraud.”\n\nOther Paramount shareholders who have called out the deal include The Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island, who the Delaware Court ordered the media giant to turn documents over to for a similar investigation into potential corporate wrongdoing, Scott Baker, who has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit arguing the Skydance deal could cost shareholders $1.65 billion in damages, as well as the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), which believes the damages could exceed that figure.\n\nSeparately, President Donald Trump has called for CBS News’ broadcast license to be revoked and is suing the network for $20 billion over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS and Trump are in settlement talks and have reportedly agreed to a mediator.\n\nThe Skydance deal triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close on April 7. \n\nIf the deal is not closed by July 6, the deadline will be automatically pushed another 90 days to Oct. 4. After that, if the deal is still not closed, or if a regulator blocks the merger or one of the parties involved breaches the terms of the agreement, then Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal. \n\nExercising that option would leave Paramount on the hook to pay Skydance a $400 million breakup fee.","summary":"The media giant's board of directors raked in a combined $3.8 million in compensation for the year\n\n\nThe post Paramount&#8217;s Shari Redstone Was Paid $523,000 in 2024 appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/shari-redstone-paramount-2024-salary/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shari-redstone.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:29:13","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":314899152,"title":"Trump's lone GOP-critic in Congress considers shock career move amid Pentagon power struggle","text":"One of the few remaining critics of Donald Trump on the Republican side of Congress is mulling retirement following his current term. \n\nDon Bacon, who was elected in Nebraska's 2nd District on the crest of the wave of Trump's victory in 2016 and served ever since, said Friday that he may be quitting Washington. \n\nBacon, 61, most recently made waves as the first Republican to urge Trump to fire Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth amid the recent chaos at the Pentagon. \n\nMultiple sources told NOTUS Friday that Bacon is seriously considering not running again in 2026.\n\nBacon, who is consistently grilled by representing a swing district he's never won by more than three points, confirmed he's thinking about leaving.\n\n'I'll make any final decisions in late summer. It is a family decision,' Bacon said. \n\nHe would face a tough environment, as Kamala Harris won his district by four points in 2024, while he held on against Democrat opponent Tony Vargas by less than 6,000 votes. \n\nThe Nebraska Congressman has largely voted with Republicans, though he has been critical of Trump and was one of the few members of the GOP to vote to establish the January 6th Commission. \n\nBacon was the first Republican to call for Hegseth's firing on the same day that Trump defended his head of defense on the day of the White House Easter Egg Roll. \n\n'I had concerns from the get-go because Pete Hegseth didn't have a lot of experience,' the Nebraska lawmaker told Politico, becoming the first House Republican to call for Hegseth to go.\n\n'I like him on Fox,' Bacon said of the former cable TV commentator. 'But does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? That's a concern.'\n\nBacon's scalding remarks follow a stunning op-ed in the publication by Hegseth's former Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot. \n\nUllyot, a Marine Corps vet who served as a White House national security spokesman during Trump's first term, announced his resignation from the Pentagon Wednesday.\n\nThe spokesman called himself 'a longtime backer of the secretary,' but went on to write that the Pentagon was in 'a full-blown meltdown' and 'total chaos' amid the Signal chat scandals.\n\nHe said 'the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.' He even went on to predict: 'It's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.'\n\nHe had helped push the MAGA agenda inside the Pentagon by forcing legacy media outlets out of their workspace, then issued confusing comments defending the decision to take down a page honoring the military service of baseball great Jackie Robinson.\n\nTrump brushed off the development Monday at the White House Easter Egg roll, dismissing the criticism by his own former aide. \n\n'It's just fake news, they just bring up stories I guess it sounds like disgruntled employees. You know he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people and that's what he's doing. You don't always have friends when you do that,' Trump said. \n\nAnd Hegseth insisted at the same event that he's 'on the same page' with Trump. \n\nThree senior Pentagon staffers were put on leave over the weekend as part of a leak investigation they claim was fabricated, creating a power vacuum. \n\nThe Pentagon IG said it opened up an inquiry following the first Signal chat controversy, which involved Hegseth sharing information about an attack on the Houthis in Yemen on a group chat created by National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently included on it.\n\nThe newly revealed signal chat, as reported by the New York Times, was created by Hegseth himself.","summary":"One of the few remaining critics of Donald Trump on the Republican side of Congress is mulling retirement following his current term.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14649261/trump-gop-critic-congress-shock-career-pentagon-power-struggle.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/25/23/97707003-0-image-a-5_1745620832143.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/21/8740140327131134528/1024x576_MP4_8740140327131134528.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-25 22:52:56","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

We want you on the show.\"The alleged meeting occurred after Stern was \"pissed\" his audience was \"forgetting about us,\" after years of him dominating the airwaves. He also made it clear if his show did not find success soon and spread, employees would lose their jobs, as he also made an effort to clean up his ways after becoming known for his shocking material.\n\nThe host is also said to have encouraged his employees to reach out to certain celebrities including Brad Pitt and the late Rush Limbaugh in hopes of increasing the same type of buzz he had in his peak.\n\nHowever, radio executive Tim Sabean – who worked with Howard from 2006 to around 2013, thinks he made a bad decision and \"allowed the wrong people to guide his brand and it's a shame.\"Meanwhile, John Melendez, who worked on The Howard Stern Show from 1988 until his exit in 2004, claimed Stern's plea to employees to pretend to be fans was \"a scar in his career.\"\n\nHe explained: \"Howard asking people to make fake Twitter accounts is the most embarrassing thing in his career.\n\n\"Here’s a guy we all thought was about reality, here’s a guy that was supposed to be real and now he’s telling people to make fake Twitter accounts so he can get better guests?\"\"It’s an embarrassment – and I love Howard – but it’s an embarrassment. He should be ashamed to even do that,\" Melendez added.\n\nThe 71-year-old has apparently been struggling for a while with not being the top name in the industry like he once was. In October 2024, Stern is said to have been left raging after rival SiriusXM podcast Call Her Daddy scored an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris before he did.An insider told RadarOnline.com at the time: \"This is the latest sign Howard is losing his grip on his mega-money deal as the face of Sirius.\n\n\"He was raging behind the scenes Kamala did Call Her Daddy first, and he’s now gripped with fear this could be the start of the end of his career.\"\n\nAlex Cooper, the host of Call Her Daddy, rakes in about $42million per year at SiriusXM, making her the highest earner among hosts.","summary":"Howard Stern is being accused of making his employees pretend to be fans of his show with 'fake Twitter accounts' in order to grab the attention of celebrities.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/howard-stern-ordered-staff-members-fake-twitter-accounts/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/JK8RuyX2G/0x0/howard-stern-ordered-staff-members-fake-twitter-accounts1-1745603850573.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 22:45:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":314896878,"title":"The Court’s deportation lunacy, progs are losing — but won’t quit and other commentary","text":"Legal take: The Court’s Deportation Lunacy \n\n“The Supreme Court says illegal aliens” deserve due process “before they are spirited away to their countries of origin,” and “liberal activists are celebrating a fundamental right,” grumbles the Washington Times’ editorial board.\n\nBut liberals’ goals seem more about “perpetuating lawlessness at the border” than justice.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge ruled “President Trump couldn’t reverse President Biden’s unilateral decision” to “parole” over 500,000 illegal immigrants “from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela” into the US.\n\nThe judge insists “that what Mr. Biden accomplished with a stroke of his autopen can’t be undone by Mr. Trump without ‘case-by-case review’ ” — which “would take 350 years” to complete. \n\nYet the law that lets the administration set parole policy “is unambiguous.” The Supreme Court must “apply common sense and curb these judicial interventions.” \n\nCrime beat: Progs Are Losing — but Won’t Quit \n\n“After spikes in homicides and other offenses, which sparked fears of a return to the bloody New York of the 1990s, major crime in New York City has headed toward historic lows,” reports Rafael A. Mangual at The New York Times.\n\nThe failed “progressive policy experiment that kept criminals out of prison and jail” has been replaced “with increased enforcement, concentrated in areas of New York City with the most crime.”\n\nBut progressives still “push to abolish gang databases,” limit “gunshot detection technology” and refuse “modest” tweaks to “the state’s 2019 discovery changes.”\n\nSome seem “more concerned about criminals” than victims. Like the left and right in the 1980s and ’90s, we need to reach a “consensus on crime control” before things go bad. \n\nFree-speech watch: Trump vs. the Censors \n\nTeam Trump “has demonstrated a dogged devotion to dismantling and destroying” the “censorship-industrial complex,” notes Ben Weingarten at The Federalist.\n\nNext up? The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which served as “ ‘nerve center’ of fed-led speech policing.”\n\nTrump “tasked the attorney general and secretary of homeland security with investigating” CISA and “laid off more than 100 CISA staffers,” while cutting “entities involved in 2020 censorship-related efforts.”\n\nYet “to date, no one has faced justice for imposing arguably the greatest censorship regime in U.S. history upon the American people.”\n\nAnd “the legislative branch must codify the administration’s policies to ensure the speech policing apparatus does not once again spring into action under a future president.” \n\nConservative: Social-Media Is Hurting Dems \n\nThanks to social media, “one public school teacher with a TikTok account, green hair, and a septum piercing can hijack a political movement,” quips National Review’s Christian Schneider.\n\nThat fact has “tipped” the Democratic Party “hard toward the loudest and most ideologically rigid participants.”\n\nTake social-media star AOC: She has “the worst approval rating of any Democratic politician measured by a February Gallup poll.”\n\nBut “the overly online left actually believes that the tonic for the losses of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris in the past decade is to run an even less qualified candidate who is significantly further to the left.”\n\n“Democrats can still win elections,” but “the long-term prognosis for a party that is increasingly defined by its most performative wing is not good.” \n\nEnergy desk: An EV ‘Off-Ramp’ for Dems \n\n“Realizing that electric-vehicle mandates are costly and politically unpopular,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore “is doing a U-turn on his state’s EV mandate” by “delaying penalties for manufacturers that don’t meet their EV sales quotas,” cheer The Wall Street Journal’s editors.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin first “unchained his state” from the rules, which would have hurt “Maryland auto dealers and state sales tax revenue,” since “Maryland residents could cross the Potomac to buy the gas-powered car they want.”\n\nMoore claims “Trump forced his hand” with tariffs, but the real problem is EVs aren’t selling.\n\n“Even with subsidies EVs are already too expensive for most middle-class Americans, and their limited range can make them impractical.”\n\nStill, “Moore is showing fellow Democrats an off-ramp from their EV blunder.” \n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Liberals’ goals seem more about “perpetuating lawlessness at the border” than justice, grumbles the Washington Times’ editorial board.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/opinion/the-courts-deportation-lunacy-progs-are-losing-but-wont-quit-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/2025-asked-supreme-court-permit-103226593.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 22:38:48","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":314890446,"title":"Trump blows off Joe Biden's attendance at Pope's funeral: 'It's not high on my list'","text":"President Donald Trump said a meeting with Joe Biden in Rome was ‘not high on my list’ as he shrugged off his former rival attending Pope Francis’ funeral.\n\nHe and first lady Melania Trump had late-night arrival in Rome ahead of Saturday’s state funeral at St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nTrump revealed he hadn’t known that Biden and wife Jill Biden would also be at the basilica for the service.\n\n‘Oh he is? I didn’t know,’ he told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nWhen asked if he would meet with the former president, Trump replied: ‘It’s not high on my list. It’s really not.’\n\nBut the president will have some sit downs, including with Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni.\n\n‘I’m going to be meeting with some people,’ Trump said of his trip, ‘and a little bit quickly. Frankly, it’s a little bit disrespectful to have meetings when you’re at the funeral at the pope.’\n\nHe didn’t address if he’d met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also will be attending the funeral. Trump has been pushing hard for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. His envoy, Steve Wiskoff meet with Vladimir Putin earlier Friday in Moscow.\n\n‘It’s a little tough because we don’t have much time,’ he said. The Trumps are spending less than 24 hours in the Eternal City, coming in specifically to honor the late pontiff.\n\n‘I think we’re going to try and see a couple of people who are important to what we do,’ the president said without getting specific.\n\nAfter the official arrival at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, the first couple headed toward the ambassador’s residence, Villa Taverna, where they’ll be spending the night.\n\nThere the president will take photos with members of the military before getting some sleep. The Trumps are scheduled to fly back to the United States as soon as the funeral is over.\n\nThe president described Pope Francis as a ‘good man. He loved the world actually. He was just a good man. I met him twice. I thought he was a fantastic kind of a guy.’\n\nThe Trumps will join a range of political and cultural figures at the Vatican on Saturday, including Prince William, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Javier Milei, the conservative President of Pope Francis’ native Argentina.\n\nDelegations from about 130 countries, including 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs, will attend the state funeral.\n\nBut the president could find himself seated toward the back of the Basilica for the Catholic mass.\n\nThe Vatican has strict protocols and seating order, which was heavily enforced when Pope John Paul II was buried.\n\nCatholic royalty, such as the Spanish King, get the first row.\n\nNext come non-Catholic royals such as the Prince of Wales, who will attend the funeral on behalf of King Charles III, along with the King and Queen of Sweden and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Norway.\n\nAfter them will be Trump and other world leaders.\n\nThe leaders will be seated alphabetically, according to the name of their country in French as that was the traditional language of diplomacy when the protocols were made.\n\nThe president, dressed casually Friday for the eight-hour flight with his tie off and shirt unbuttoned, told reporters on Air Force One he was attending the service partially because he won Catholic voters in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump won Catholics by more than 120,000 votes when he faced former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIt was Trump’s anti-abortion policies and his appointment of conservative judges onto the Supreme Court – who ultimately overturned Roe vs. Wade – that put the voting bloc in his corner.\n\nIn 2020, the Catholic vote was evenly split between Trump and Biden, who was the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy.\n\nTrump himself identifies as a ‘non-denominational Christian.’ First lady Melania Trump is Catholic.\n\nThe Trumps met Pope Francis during a visit to the Vatican in 2017 during the president’s first term.\n\nAt the time, Melania described it as an experience she would ‘never forget.’\n\nShe brought a pair of rosary beads for the pontiff to bless.\n\nShe is the first Catholic first lady in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nBut most may remember that meeting because of a cute moment involving the pontiff and the first lady, when the pontiff asked her what she feeds the president.\n\n‘Pizza?’ the first lady was heard answering.\n\nBut it may have been a ‘lost in translation’ moment as some think the first lady said potica, which is a traditional sweet nut roll pastry from Eastern Europe.\n\nPresident Trump and Pope Francis also had their differences.\n\nIn 2015, Trump said Francis was too political, and the pontiff later suggested Trump wasn't Christian over his \"build a wall\" rhetoric.\n\nTrump, responded that ‘for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.’\n\nThe trip to Rome marks Trump’s first foreign trip of his second term. He is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia next month.","summary":"Donald Trump made the remark as he landed in Rome ahead of the harrowing ceremony.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14649369/trump-joe-biden-pope-francis-funeral.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/25/22/97707585-0-image-a-8_1745617132812.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 21:56:05","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.034},{"id":314907762,"title":"Peter Dutton was fired up before the election was called – but has the Coalition wilted in the campaign furnace?","text":"It was 12 January – 75 days before the federal election would be called – and Peter Dutton was literally feeling the heat.\n\nAs the opposition leader addressed a Liberal party rally from a stuffy room in the Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visible beads of sweat ran down his forehead.\n\nDutton made it through the 38-minute speech, outlining in broad strokes his vision to “get Australia back on track” while wiping perspiration from his brow with a blue and white checkered handkerchief.\n\nIt was his first public appearance of 2025, a scene-setter for the election year ahead.\n\nThe sight of the hard-edged former Queensland cop sweating under the spotlight would prove a striking analogy for the campaign proper, where Dutton appears to have wilted in the election furnace.\n\nThe campaign has been defined by major shifts on policies, scarce detail on others, outbreaks of ill-discipline, candidate scandals, and signs of a leader sapped of confidence just as his opponent found his. The overall performance has perplexed veteran Coalition strategists, frustrated conservative supporters and deflated some MPs, for whom hopes of forming government after 3 May now appear illusory.\n\n“Perhaps we’ve been kidding ourselves,” one Liberal source has lamented.\n\nLofty expectations\n\nCoalition insiders concede Dutton’s personal ratings have fallen since Anthony Albanese called the election on 28 March. The opposition leader admitted as much at Tuesday night’s leaders’ debate, blaming Labor’s “$20m” negative ad blitz for dragging down his vote.\n\nThe Labor machine has executed a ruthless anti-Dutton campaign, mercilessly peddling claims about $600bn nuclear reactors and shuttered Medicare urgent clinics that the Coalition have rejected as bald-faced lies.\n\nA week out from polling day the Coalition is not losing hope, adamant its internal research paints a rosier picture about its prospects, including in marginal seats, than the increasingly grim numbers in published national polls.\n\nThe proportion of undecided voters is still almost 30%, according to some research, making strategists wary of seat-by-seat predictions.\n\n“It is closer than the national polls are suggesting,” one senior source says.\n\nIn Victoria, the opposition remains confident of winning Aston, Chisholm and McEwen and is growing optimistic about its chances in Goldstein, Hawke and Gorton.\n\nThe Coalition is banking on gaining Bennelong, Gilmore and Paterson in New South Wales and is hopeful in Brisbane in the Queensland capital and Bullwinkel, Tangney and Curtin in WA.\n\nWinning those seats would almost certainly be enough to force Labor into a minority government, an outcome the Coalition might have accepted when Albanese was revelling in an extended political honeymoon after the 2022 election.\n\nBut it would fall short of the lofty expectations that built internally and externally in the 18 months after the voice to parliament referendum, to a point some MPs returned from the Christmas break believing Dutton could defeat a first-term government for the first time since 1931.\n\nThere was a view the global inflation crisis – and 13 interest rate rises domestically – would cruel a lacklustre Albanese government just as it had incumbents around the world, including the US and UK.\n\nThe high-water mark for optimism was in February, when a poll in the Nine newspapers put the Coalition ahead 55-45 on a two-party preferred basis.\n\n Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter\n\nSome Coalition insiders now believe those numbers were “illusionary”, reflective not of rising support for Dutton, or even anger at Albanese, but rather a general reflection of the mood of a fed-up and financially stressed electorate.\n\nThe Coalition might have “stripped a lot of bark” off Labor in the past 18 months, as one veteran conservative strategist put it, but still needed to offer a reason for voters to “walk across the road to their side”.\n\nFlaw in the campaign\n\nJust days after Cyclone Alfred forced Albanese to cancel plans for a 12 April election, internal unrest about the Coalition’s lack of major economic policies spilled out into the public.\n\nDutton and the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, brushed off the “free advice”, which was privately dismissed as the predictable grumbling of agitators with personal agendas.\n\nWhatever the motives, the series of articles – including one in Guardian Australia – exposed the bare-bones nature of the Coalition’s agenda.\n\n“We were told everything was under control. We were told to give them the benefit of the doubt,” one Coalition source said.\n\nAhead of the 25 March budget, the opposition had no centrepiece cost-of-living relief offering; no short-term plan to reduce power prices; no commitment on defence spending.\n\nDutton’s budget reply dealt with two of those missing pieces, committing to a 12-month cut to the fuel excise and an east coast gas reserve.\n\nA one-off income tax offset of up to $1,200, new first home buyer incentives and a commitment to lift defence spending to 2.5% of GDP over the next five years have also been announced during the campaign.\n\nSenior Coalition MPs said the announcements were timed to coincide with voters tuning in to the election debate.\n\nSources confirmed the campaign waited until the past week to pivot to crime and national security because the traditional Coalition strong-suits were unlikely to shift votes.\n\nCritics inside and outside the party argue the policies have come too late to be properly explained and understood, particularly given the campaign has overlapped with the Easter and Anzac long weekends.\n\n“I think the flaw in the Coalition campaign was releasing their policies so late. It just puts a lot of pressure on you to punch through the media cycle,” Tony Barry, a former Liberal strategist now working with RedBridge, told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing.\n\nThe dearth of fully formed policy created a vacuum for Labor’s negative campaign to shape the election narrative from the start.\n\nDutton also made several unforced errors that distracted from his cost-of-living focus, including declaring he would live at Sydney’s Kirribilli House as prime minister and floating, and quickly walking back, referendums on four-year terms, Indigenous recognition and stripping the citizenship of dual nationals.\n\n‘Not ready for government’\n\nJohn Roskam, a senior fellow at rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, is a respected figure in Liberal circles who has the ear of conservative MPs in Canberra.\n\n“The campaign problems can’t be attributed to any one factor, it’s a combination of complacency … a failure to develop strong policies, the absence of a cultural agenda and a feeling that the Coalition has been too willing to play safe when in fact a bold and ambitious agenda was what was required,” Roskam said.\n\nOf the policies that were announced pre-campaign, some haven’t been mentioned (tax deductible lunches), others actively avoided (nuclear power) and others dumped due to their unpopularity.\n\nWithin a fortnight of the shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, announcing a plan to restrict work-from-home options for public servants, colleagues began privately lobbying for changes amid fears it was being misinterpreted as applying to all workplaces.\n\nLabor and its union allies successfully characterised the policy as an attack on working women, a devastating perception for a party attempting to win back female voters.\n\nDutton waited almost five weeks before admitting the policy was a “mistake” and jettisoning it entirely. He also walked back plans to sack 41,000 public servants, confirming the headcount would instead be reduced through natural attrition and hiring freezes.\n\nOn Thursday – with more than 1m votes already cast – Dutton seemingly shifted again, confirming all 41,000 of those positions would come from Canberra.\n\nResponding to the comments, Albanese said publicly what he has been saying privately since the start of the campaign.\n\n“They are showing, Peter Dutton is showing, that they are just not ready for government,” he said.\n\n‘He hasn’t followed his gut’\n\nThe sense of optimism among Coalition MPs was palpable as Donald Trump swept to victory at November’s US presidential election.\n\nTrump had successfully tapped the anger and disillusionment of voters suffering through a cost-of-living crisis, providing what some of Dutton’s colleagues viewed as a template for what could be achieved at the forthcoming Australian election.\n\nTrump’s win over Democrat Kamala Harris was also interpreted as further confirmation of a global rejection of “wokeness” – a cause also disdained by Dutton.\n\nWhen the Liberal leader stood up in parliament to congratulate Trump on his victory, an air of confidence filled the opposition benches.\n\n“We will make sure that President Trump is not somebody to be scared of,” Dutton said, emphasising the final two words. “But somebody that we can work very closely with, and that’s exactly what we will do.”\n\nThe “not somebody to be scared of” remark was a barely concealed reference to Albanese’s 2017 admission that Trump “scares the shit out of me”. Dutton was taunting Albanese, implying that he could not only manage Trump’s return but capitalise on it.\n\nFive months on, Dutton is trying to distance himself from Trump and Elon Musk, so toxic have parallels with the Maga and Doge agendas become for the Liberal brand.\n\nDutton’s remark at the ABC-hosted leaders’ debate that he didn’t “know” Trump was a statement of fact. But for some conservatives, it was a further sign of an uncharacteristic timidness, or an aversion to risk, that has crept into Dutton’s campaign.\n\nSome attribute the safety-first approach to the transfer of power that occurs at each election, where data-led party officials assume greater influence over strategy and messaging.\n\nSeveral sources confirmed reports of friction between Dutton’s inner circle and Liberal HQ, led by Andrew Hirst.\n\nWhatever the cause, some Liberals and conservative campaigners lament that voters haven’t seen “Dutton be Dutton”.\n\nRoskam agrees.\n\n“There is a view [inside the Liberal party] that the public haven’t seen the best of Peter Dutton … that he hasn’t followed his gut.”","summary":"Liberal supporters are worried about policy shifts, outbreaks of ill-discipline and signs of a leader sapped of confidence just as his opponent found his\n\n\nElection 2025 live updates: Australia federal election campaign\nPolls tracker; election guide; full federal election coverage\nAnywhere but Canberra; interactive electorates guide\nListen to the latest episode of our new narrative podcast series: Gina\nGet our afternoon election email, free app or daily news podcastIt was 12 January – 75 days before the federal election would be called – and Peter Dutton was literally feeling the heat.\n\nAs the opposition leader addressed a Liberal party rally from a stuffy room in the Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visible beads of sweat ran down his forehead.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/26/peter-dutton-coalition-liberal-party-australian-federal-election-campaign-2025","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe765f243fc905a43f342e2023f0085e98b15c5/0_381_5711_3427/master/5711.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 21:32:36","author":"Dan Jervis-Bardy","authors":["Dan Jervis-Bardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":314889050,"title":"Florida Democrat changes affiliation, saying his old political party ‘is dead’","text":"Florida State Senate Minority Leader Jason Pizzo announced Thursday he is leaving the Democratic Party, promptly stepping down from his position.\n\nPizzo, who had served as a member of the Florida Senate since 2018, said during a speech on the Senate floor that “the Democratic Party in Florida is dead.” He added that he had mailed in a voter registration form to switch his party affiliation to “no party affiliation.”\n\nThe Miami-area lawmaker claimed that Florida’s political system was similar to “the infighting, power struggles, corruption and decline of civic virtue that pervaded and eventually ushered in the fall of Rome.”\n\n“So, too, are we players, or perhaps props, in the mess that is bottom partisanship,” Pizzo added during his speech. “Our constituents are craving practical leaders, not political hacks.”\n\n“The party my dad volunteered for with JFK when he was 18 years old in 1960 is not the party today,” the senator went on to say, referring to the Democratic Party. “It craves and screams anarchy and then demands amnesty. That is not okay.”\n\nFlorida State Sen. Lori Berman was elected as the Florida Senate’s new minority leader shortly after Pizzo’s announcement, Florida Politics reported.\n\nFlorida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a statement Thursday in response to Pizzo’s announcement that the state party was “more united without him.”\n\n“Jason Pizzo is one of the most ineffective and unpopular Democratic leaders in recent memory, and his resignation is one of the best things to happen to the party in years,” Fried wrote in the statement. “His legacy as leader includes continually disparaging the party base, starting fights with other members, and chasing his own personal ambitions at the expense of Democratic values.”\n\nPizzo’s decision to leave the Democratic Party follows months of speculation that he may launch a gubernatorial bid in 2026 to succeed incumbent Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited from seeking reelection.\n\n“Senator Pizzo didn’t leave the Democratic Party; the party left him,” Evan Power, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, said in a statement Thursday. “Senator Pizzo is the third Florida Democrat to leave the party in the last few months.”\n\nIn December, two Florida state representatives, Hillary Cassel and Susan Valdés, announced they were switching their party affiliations to the GOP, increasing Republicans’ majority in the state House.\n\nWhile Florida was a hotly-contested swing state within the last decade, President Donald Trump won the state in the past three presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won the Sunshine State by less than two points securing 48.6% of the vote in Florida, compared to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 47.4%.\n\nIn 2020, Trump notched 51.2% of the vote in Florida, while former President Joe Biden secured 47.9%.\n\nTrump notably widened his margins in Florida in the 2024 presidential election, receiving 56.1% of the vote to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 43%. The president carried Pizzo’s home county of Miami-Dade by 11 percentage points in 2024 after losing it by seven in 2020 — marking a swing of 18 points and making him the first Republican to win the majority-Hispanic county since 1988.\n\nPizzo did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He criticized Democrats for being “so reticent” in comparison to Republicans. (RELATED: ‘Bunch Of Losers’: Dems’ Emerging 2028 Field May Not Bode Well For Liberals)\n\n“The problem with Democrats — so back in 2020, look, right, I wrote a bunch of ads. I think I was one of the folks — certainly not just me — who kept pushing the other F-word: fascist,” Schechter told Acosta. “Like, we wanted Joe Biden to say it so bad. And finally, he referred to Trump as a semi-fascist. I’m like, I’ll take it, right? We got it out there.”\n\n“Because we’re so reticent to say — I mean, they’re making up lies about abortion after birth,” he added before Acosta cut him off.\n\nTrump claimed during his September debate against former Vice President Kamala Harris that some Democratic states allow infants born after failed abortions to be killed, pointing to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s home state specifically. Walz signed an omnibus bill in 2023 that enabled doctors to refuse life-saving care to infants born following failed abortions.\n\n“There are real world results. People forget a man walked into a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood muttering about baby parts after [Republican Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz and the Republican debate, and they’d been talking about that,” Schechter added. “I mean, stochastic terrorism — I don’t want to do that. But you can’t let them accuse you of these kinds of things and not hit back hard.”\n\n“There should be constant creative responses. And then we even have the individuals — [Democratic Texas Rep.] Jasmine Crockett. I mean, these people that have shown they’re so good at this. Unshackle them,” he said. “Let them go and stop saying, ‘You must stick to this. We have to be cautious. It’s poll-tested.’ As you said, people — I hate to say it, but I think it was [former President] George W. who might have said, ‘People like strong and wrong.’ What about being strong and right?”\n\nIt was former President Bill Clinton who said people prefer “someone who is strong and wrong” when they “are feeling insecure.”\n\nCrockett asserted Saturday that she felt alleged MS-13 member Kilmar Abrego Garcia was “less criminal” than Trump. On top of allegedly being a member of the gang, Abrego Garcia’s wife has also alleged that her husband physically abused her.\n\nSchechter clarified that although he thinks it is important to inspire “passion” and “anger,” he does not want it to reach the point of “violence.”\n\nHarris also said during an October CNN town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist.\n\nHoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson warned during a Thursday podcast that there is a heightening risk of political violence — like the two failed assassination attempts against Trump — as Democrats become increasingly desperate, citing dismal polling for the party and their embrace of alleged violent criminals.\n\n“I’m just watching this and I see that the more impotent they are and the less actual power they wield, and the less the public likes them — if you look at the polls of the Democratic Party, 29%, 27%, one poll I think was 23% approval — they react to that by being crazier and more strident and upping the, you know, not just ‘fascist,’ but the other day Jasmine Crockett said that Trump was like worse than the MS-13 gang member, you know,” he said.\n\n“So, they are lowering the bar on what’s permissible.

Overall, Trump's average approval rating of 45 percent in his first three months back in office has been below all other post-World War II presidents elected in the United States, Gallup said last week.Results also show Americans losing confidence in Trump's ability to handle key issues such as the economy.Voters last year viewed the 78-year-old billionaire as strong on the economy, but his imposition of sweeping tariffs on trade partners this month has rattled global markets. Some 54 percent of Americans now feel the economy is getting worse, compared to 37 percent in January, according to the Economist/YouGov poll. Trump's approval rating is notably lagging on the cost of living, a Reuters/Ipsos survey showed, with just 31 percent of Americans approving of his performance on that issue.Inflation was a hot topic in the November election, with Trump vowing to immediately lower prices as president.He has seen a similar downward trend on immigration –- another typically strong area for Trump, who has led a hardline deportation strategy targeting undocumented migrants which has pitted him in legal battles with the courts.The Economist/YouGov poll found that 45 percent of Americans approve of how Trump is handling immigration, compared with 50 percent two weeks ago.Polls also show a drop in support among some key demographics that helped Trump return to power by picking him over Democratic election rival Kamala Harris.They include Hispanic voters, whose approval score has dropped from 36 percent in early February to 27 percent, according to the Pew poll.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/25/trumps-popularity-with-us-voters-slumps-in-opinion-polls","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-04-25/d9t4tfvp/0632211949838.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 20:45:38","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":314885592,"title":"Alex Soros trashed as ‘impossible’ and ‘wrong person to lead’ dad George’s foundation in magazine profile","text":"A New York Magazine profile on Alex Soros, son of George Soros, who has been chosen to take up his father’s leadership mantle, doesn’t paint the heir in a positive light. \n\n“The real story is that every single person who knows the family knows that Alex was exactly the wrong person to lead the foundation,” the New York Magazine profile on Alex Soros, published Tuesday, reads, quoting an anonymous source “with deep OSF ties.” \n\nGeorge Soros started what the Open Society Foundations (OSF) website calls his “philanthropic network” in the mid-1980s. It eventually became OSF, which has been led by George Soros for decades. In June 2023, he passed the leadership torch to his son, Alex. \n\n“In private he is brooding and cerebral and has a propensity for candor and bursts of hot-temperedness,” the New York Magazine piece, authored by Simon van Zuylen-Wood, says of Alex Soros, who is chair of the board of directors at OSF. \n\n“His halting, Peter Thiel–like baritone is full of ahs and ums, and his sentences can sound like records skipping, as if he were unable to easily put into language what is clear in his mind. This slightly tortured persona has invited comparisons with his elder half-brother Jonathan, who sprang from Harvard Law School and a federal clerkship to work alongside his father in finance and philanthropy.” \n\nVan Zuylen-Wood writes that people, including OSF’s first president, Aryeh Neier, thought that Jonathan Soros, a co-founder and partner of the investment firm, One Madison Group, would be his father’s successor. \n\n“When Soros insiders try to explain the family dynamic, they draw on the standard texts of empire and heredity,” van Zuylen-Wood says. “‘Roman is Alex,’ says a former OSF senior official, referring to Roman Roy, the sardonic failson in Succession. ‘Smart but f**king impossible and not particularly interested in the details.’ Another Soros insider cites not HBO but the Gospel of Luke, casting Alex in the role of the Prodigal Son, who is rewarded with his father’s love despite his wayward years.”\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Alex Soros held a fundraiser at his New York City apartment for vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, and posted photos of the event on X. \n\nThe New York Magazine piece says that Alex Soros “created a PR headache by posting photos from the event on social media, as is his custom after meeting heads of state and elected officials. (As a former OSF higher-up says, Alex likes to collect “shiny objects.”).” \n\nThe piece points out that Alex Soros’ X account is filled with photos of powerful Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Presidents Joe Biden and Bill Clinton, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, the late Pope Francis, and Ukrainian Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak.\n\nPrevious reporting from Fox News highlighting a Media Research Center study on Alex Soros, found that he politicized mass shootings, praised Biden’s “disastrous” 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, supports abolishing the Electoral College, embraced disparaging claims against conservative Supreme Court Justices and supports decriminalizing “sex work.”\n\nSince the 2018 elections, Alex Soros has given more than $5 million to federal political coffers, and records show that his largest contribution was $2 million to the Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC during that time.\n\nWith billions to spend, the New York Magazine profile questions the 39-year-old’s ability to be an effective leader. \n\n“​​Exactly how to push back against the [Trump] madness he leaves unclear,” van Zuylen-Wood wrote. “Nor does he offer any coherent agenda for the Democrats, whose roiling, inconclusive debates can seem personified by Alex himself. He was a regular presence at the Biden White House, one-half of an odd power couple, yet few in the broader political universe have a grasp of how he thinks about the world and plans to spend the wealth at his disposal.\n\n“That money could help determine the fate not only of a rudderless Democratic Party but of a country that every day is disappearing legal residents and immigrants, shaking down universities, defying court orders, and otherwise taking aim at the very open society his father’s global philanthropy exists to uphold.”\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Open Society Foundations for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"A New York Magazine profile on Alex Soros, son of George Soros, who has been chosen to take up his father’s leadership mantle, doesn't paint the heir in a positive light. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/us-news/alex-soros-trashed-as-impossible-and-wrong-person-to-lead-dad-georges-foundation-in-magazine-profile/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103311542.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/E9gQnV4v-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-25 20:45:06","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.114},{"id":314871058,"title":"AOC claims 'We are one' in campaign-style video despite years of invoking race, gender in politics","text":"Rep.

POLLSTER NATE SILVER CALLS OCASIO-CORTEZ MOST LIKELY TO BE 2028 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE During the 2024 presidential campaign, Ocasio-Cortez told The Independent that \"as an elected official, who is a prominent woman of color, I've seen a lot,\" adding that Vice President Kamala Harris has her own experience with misogyny and racism. \"I think we brace ourselves for some of the unfair misogynistic and racial undertones, overtones, explicit attacks on implicit attacks that she may be subjected to, and it's important for us to keep our eyes open for what is fair, but also what is unfair,\" she said. Since Ocasio-Cortez was elected in 2018 to represent parts of Queens and the Bronx in the U.S. House of Representatives, unseating a 10-term incumbent, she has framed her success as shattering barriers to gender and racial justice in the United States. During her victory speech in Queens in November 2018, Ocasio-Cortez noted she was the \"first person of color to ever represent\" New York's 14th Congressional District, which she said was 70% people of color, half of them working class. Then the youngest congresswoman, Ocasio-Cortez said she was mistaken for an intern or a spouse and used the opportunity to spotlight the bias against her, posting on social media, \"Next time try believing women + people of color when they talk about their experiences being a woman or person of color.\"​ Jussie Smollett, a Black and gay actor, falsely claimed in January 2019 that he was attacked by two men at 2 a.m. on a cold Chicago night and said the men yelled he was in \"MAGA country,\" used racist and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an \"unknown substance\" on him. Smollet was sentenced in 2022 for faking a hate crime and lying to the Chicago Police about it. Smollett received support of several Democrats before his allegations were debunked, including Ocasio-Cortez, who said it was \"a racist and homophobic attack,\" while urging Americans to work to change what is \"happening to our country.\" Ocasio-Cortez deleted her pro-Smollett tweet when he was convicted of staging the crime. During a \"60 Minutes\" interview in 2019, Ocasio-Cortez labeled President Donald Trump \"racist.\" Later that year, Ocasio-Cortez accused former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi of unfairly singling out the freshmen progressive \"Squad,\" calling it an \"explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.\"​ She later clarified that she wasn't calling Pelosi racist but maintained that women of color were disproportionately targeted. But Ocasio-Cortez didn't hold back in her racist allegations when Trump said the \"Squad\" should \"go back\" to other countries. \"We don’t leave the things that we love. When we love this country, what that means is we propose the solutions to fix it,\" she said at a press conference. She later said on social media it was the \"hallmark language of white supremacists,\" warning, \"Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism.\" During the pandemic in 2020, Ocasio-Cortez said on social media, \"COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities,\" adding, \"the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions,\" tying health disparities to racial injustice. After the attacks on the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live she \"didn’t even feel safe around other members of Congress\"​ and added that she avoided hiding during the attack where \"there were QAnon and white supremacist sympathizers, and frankly white supremacist members of Congress in that extraction point\"​ And in the aftermath of a shooting at a Buffalo supermarket in a predominately Black neighborhood, she said in a post, \"White supremacy has cost countless lives from El Paso to Mother Emanuel and now Buffalo. Our hearts break for the victims. And we demand accountability.\" In a GQ interview that year, Ocasio-Cortez reiterated that misogyny and racism shaped her experience as a politician. saying, \"I admit to sometimes believing that I live in a country that would never let\" a woman become president. In 2023, Ocasio-Cortez's views on race and gender came to a head during a viral speech on the House floor in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., before the House voted to oust Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee. She said Omar's ouster had nothing to do with \"the condemnation of antisemitic remarks,\" but \"the racism and incitement of violence against women of color in this body.\" \"Don’t tell me this is about objectivity. … This is about targeting women of color in the United States of America,\" Ocasio-Cortez said as she slammed her notebook on a table. Ocasio-Cortez faced pushback from conservatives for claiming \"We are one\" in her video this week while still designating Americans along racial and ethnic lines in the same video. Colin Rugg, a conservative influencer and co-owner of Trending Politics, responded, \"This has to be a joke. \"You capitalized ‘Black’ and ‘Latino’ but not ‘white.’ You guys were always the ones drumming up the race stuff. Everyone was fine,\" Matt Antar, finance chair of the New York Young Republicans Club, added on X among the flood of furious replies from conservatives questioning why \"white\" was lower case in her post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Since 2020, AP Style, the standard for American journalism style preferences, has capitalized \"Black\" to represent the \"shared sense of history, identity and community among people who identify as Black.\" AP Style does not capitalize \"white\" because white people \"generally do not share the same history and culture, or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color,\" according to the Associated Press. Ocasio-Cortez's campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment by deadline.","summary":"Rep.

Since taking office nearly 100 days ago, Trump has been a frequent presence in the sporting arena—literally and figuratively. A week after he became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, Trump was at the “Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing,” leading a lap around the circuit at the Daytona 500. Days later, Trump brokered a meeting at the White House to help resolve a yearslong dispute that has upended professional golf.\nSports have been a major throughline in Trump’s public life, from his tumultuous ownership of a USFL team to his hosting of boxing matches, UFC fights, and golf tournaments at his casinos and clubs. As Trump entered politics, professional athletics became a useful optics tool—a way to draw media attention and warm ovations, a vehicle to drive the culture wars, and a platform to excite his male-dominated base. In Trump 2.0, sports have also served as a barometer for the “vibe shift” that has occurred since his first term in office.\nWe’ve gone from national anthem protests and high-profile spats—like Trump’s with the Eagles, who were disinvited from the White House seven years ago—to a “Trump dance” craze sweeping the NFL. As presidential historian Timothy Naftali told Vanity Fair last year, “No other president or presidential wannabe has been as associated with sports as Donald Trump.” Below is a guide to how sports have animated Trump’s second term—and vice versa—so far.\nGolf diplomacy\nJack Nicklaus once said that Trump “loves the game of golf more than he loves money,” a claim the president has backed up in actions. During his first three months in office, per the website Trump Golf Track, he has spent at least two dozen days golfing. Trump has long been plugged into the professional ranks, regularly playing rounds with some of the best golfers in the world. And it’s clear that the game of golf loves Trump back. “He is, I would argue, one of the best friends golf has,” Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee told Vanity Fair.\nBecause of all that, much of the sport viewed Trump as a potential savior in the dispute between the PGA Tour and its Saudi-funded rival, LIV Golf. The two sides were at odds for years, as LIV poached some of the biggest stars from the PGA Tour, before they announced plans to merge in 2023.\nThe deal attracted both regulatory and political scrutiny, but Trump’s victory in November raised the hopes of both PGA Tour and LIV officials. Since taking office, he has been hands-on in the negotiations, hosting talks at the White House involving PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, LIV Golf chairman and governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund Yasir Al-Rumayyan, and Tiger Woods. Trump appears determined to resolve the schism, prioritizing the matter in the face of other crises. Earlier this month, with global financial markets in turmoil, Trump hosted LIV Golf leaders for dinner at his Miami-area club.\n“Why is the world of golf optimistic that a deal’s going to come together?” Chamblee said. “Well, because President Trump got elected.”\nTiger earns his stripes\nTrump and Woods go way back, having played numerous rounds together over the years. And like most golf diehards, Trump holds Woods in something approaching reverence. In 2019, following Woods’s fairytale win at the Masters, Trump presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nBut the past three months have seen Woods become even more entwined in Trumpworld. Along with his participation in the PGA Tour–LIV negotiations, Woods was also on hand for a reception at the White House in February to commemorate Black History Month.\nAbout a month later, and after days of tabloid speculation, Woods confirmed that he is dating Vanessa Trump, the former daughter-in-law of the president. “Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side! We look forward to our journey through life together,” Woods said in the social media post announcing the relationship. “At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.”\nPresident Trump weighed in on the budding romance last month, recounting a conversation he had with Woods on the matter.\n“He told me about it, and I said, ‘Tiger, that’s good, that’s good.’ I’m very happy for both. Just let them both be happy. Let them both be happy. They’re both great,” Trump said.\nMan in the arena\nTrump has been a frequent presence at live sporting events for decades, appearing ringside (and in-ring) at WWE’s WrestleMania and taking in Yankees and Mets games. In his political career, however, those appearances have become hype sessions for him and his bro-led coalition.\nLast month, on the heels of his cameos at the Super Bowl and Daytona 500, Trump attended the NCAA men’s wrestling championships in Philadelphia, where he was showered with loud cheers and chants of “USA.” Trump, who was accompanied at the event by Elon Musk and conservative sports commentator Clay Travis, is no stranger to the world of combat sports. He previously attended the NCAA wrestling championships in 2023 and has long been a fixture at UFC events, where he also typically draws a hero’s welcome.\nEarlier this month in Miami, Trump, Musk, and a coterie of cabinet members sat ringside at UFC 314. In what has become a familiar ritual, Trump entered the arena to the Kid Rock song “American Bad Ass” and drew a rapturous ovation.\nThe champs are here\nThe Eagles’ celebration on Monday captures the distinct shift in attitudes toward Trump since his first term. During those four years, the traditional White House visits by title teams became a third rail for many players and coaches across the country’s major sports leagues. Following the Eagles’ Super Bowl triumph in 2018, Trump disinvited the team from going to the White House after saying, “Only a small number of players decided to come.”\nBut after hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February, the Eagles signaled that they would be up for a trip to the White House, and Trump promptly extended an invitation. (While the team is expected to attend, star quarterback Jalen Hurts was noncommittal when asked Thursday if he’ll be there.) Meanwhile, Trump also said he plans to invite the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate their Super Bowl win in 2020 “because they missed their turn because of COVID.”\nTwo other reigning champions have gone to the White House since Trump took office in January. Members of the Los Angeles Dodgers were honored there earlier this month to celebrate their World Series victory—including star Mookie Betts, who passed on a trip to Trump’s White House in 2019 as a member of the Boston Red Sox. A week after the Dodgers, it was the Ohio State University football team’s turn to celebrate their national championship, a gathering that will likely be remembered for Vice President JD Vance’s fumble of the Buckeyes’ trophy.\nThe invite and RSVP status of the NBA’s soon-to-be-crowned champion will be one to watch. None of the league’s title-winners visited the White House during Trump’s first four years in office, a period in which he clashed with the likes of LeBron James and Steph Curry. Both players endorsed Kamala Harris in last year’s election, and their teams—James’s Los Angeles Lakers and Curry’s Golden State Warriors—are regarded as contenders to claim this year’s NBA title. Oh, and the Warriors’ coach, Steve Kerr, has never shied away from taking aim at Trump, whom he’s referred to as a “bully.”\nWhere have you gone, Jackie Robinson?\nThe wedge issues that shaped Trump’s campaign quickly manifested into actual policies, some of which have cast ripples throughout the sports world. His oft-repeated pledge to “keep men out of women’s sports” led to an executive order that bore his promise as its title. The Trump campaign’s staunch opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, or “DEI,” gave way to a purge of government websites that included last month’s removal of a story about Jackie Robinson’s military service.\nThe executive order, which was signed in February, bans transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports and empowers the federal government to take punitive measures—including the ability to rescind funding—against schools and other institutions that do not comply. It also directs the Secretary of State’s office to “use all appropriate and available measures” to see that the International Olympic Committee establishes its own transgender policy. In signing the order, Trump declared the “war on women’s sports over,” but the legal battle is just getting underway. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sued the state of Maine for not complying with the order.\nThe removal of the story about Robinson from the Department of Defense’s website was met with near universal condemnation. A Pentagon spokesperson explained at the time that the department’s dismantling of DEI also led to the removal of a story about the Navajo Code Talkers, among others. But after a public outcry, the department restored both the pages for Robinson and the Code Talkers.\nFighting lessons for the feds?\nGolf may be Trump’s favorite, but the lifeblood of his political movement is found in the octagon. His ties to UFC span nearly a quarter-century, dating back to when the company was still a cultural pariah. In 2001, with mixed martial arts banned in New York State, Trump hosted an event at his casino in Atlantic City.\nSince Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago, UFC has become its own planet in the MAGA-verse. He is adored by both fans and fighters—including Conor McGregor, who caused a stir in his native Ireland with critical comments about immigration during a St. Patrick’s Day visit to the White House. The president is also extremely close to UFC CEO and president Dana White, who introduced Trump at last summer’s Republican National Convention. (More recently, White was present at the Kid Rock–brokered dinner between Trump and comedian Bill Maher.)\nSo perhaps it was only a matter of time before UFC began to exert influence on administration policy. In February, FBI Director Kash Patel said on a conference call with agents that he is considering a partnership with UFC to revamp the bureau’s training protocols. Under the program, the FBI would bring in “trainers from the Ultimate Fighting Championship to beef up agents’ martial arts and self-defense skills,” according to Reuters. White later said that Patel, who attended UFC events in March and earlier this month, is “dead serious” about the idea.\nThe World Cup: from unity to disharmony\nTrump’s presidency will coincide with two global sporting events on US soil, beginning next summer with the FIFA World Cup and continuing in 2028 when the Summer Olympics head to Los Angeles. In the case of the World Cup, the United States will be a cohost along with Canada and Mexico, marking the first time the tournament will be held across three different countries. The joint bid for the tournament, in which the first Trump administration played a role, centered on a message of “unity, certainty, and opportunity.”\nBut Trump’s tariff policy and harsh rhetoric toward Canada and Mexico have threatened to unravel the spirit of comity that helped them land the competition. Trump, who has a small replica of the World Cup trophy on display in the Oval Office, doesn’t seem too worried about the intracontinental strife. The tensions between the US, Canada, and Mexico, he said last month, will make the tournament “more exciting.”\n“Tension’s a good thing,” he told reporters. “It makes it much more exciting.”\nWhether it will be an accessible event for the legions of soccer fans around the world planning to attend remains an open question. As part of the lobbying efforts to secure the bid for next year’s World Cup, Trump sent a letter to FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2018 offering assurances that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.”\nBut the administration’s immigration crackdown has cast doubt on that pledge. The Athletic, citing multiple State Department sources, reported that there are “widespread fears that a ‘non-insignificant’ number of people who legitimately acquire tickets for the tournament will be refused visas altogether.”\nLast month, Trump announced the creation of a World Cup task force that will handle logistics and security for the tournament.\nInfantino, who attended Trump’s inauguration in January and was on hand at the White House for the announcement of the task force, has sought to assuage concerns among fans traveling to the World Cup. “America is a welcoming country,” Infantino said earlier this month. “America welcomes the world. Fans from all over the world will come.”\n“They will be welcome here. America welcomes the world,” he added. “That’s how it has been, is and will be.”\nUSA and Canada in a face-off\nRelations between the US and its northern neighbor have turned frosty since Trump returned to office. Following Trump’s tariff threats and his repeated references to Canada as the “51st state,” many a Canuck has engaged in one of the few acts of dissent available to the masses: they booed.\nAt NBA and NHL games held north of the border, the playing of the US national anthem was met with loud jeers in February, bringing an additional layer of spice to the hockey matches between the United States and Canada in the Four Nations Face-Off that month. Ahead of the two sides’ matchup in the championship game, which Canada won in OT, Trump addressed the US players over the phone before they took the ice.\nThe kerfuffle has placed Wayne Gretzky, one of Canada’s preeminent national heroes, in an awkward spot. Some in the country have been miffed that Gretzky, who attended Trump’s election night party in November and an NHL game with Patel this month, has not pushed back against the “51st state” talk. Last month, a bronze statue of Gretzky in downtown Edmonton was smeared with feces, an act of vandalism that many have attributed to his close ties to Trump.\nIn a post on Truth Social last month, Trump addressed Gretzky’s silence on the matter.\n“Wayne is my friend, and he wants to make me happy, and is therefore somewhat ‘low key’ about Canada remaining a separate Country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State, paying much Lower Taxes, a Free and Powerful Military, NO TARIFFS, and having a Booming Economy,” Trump said.\nHe added that he is making Gretzky a “‘free agent,’ because I don’t want anyone in Canada to say anything bad about him.”","summary":"By playing host to champions, doing a lap at the Daytona 500, and targeting transgender athletes, Trump seizes on sports to satisfy his base and cement his brand.

The party has been plagued with infighting and finger pointing following Harris' loss to President Donald Trump.A number of polls have shown Harris, the 2024 presidential nominee, at or near the top of most voters' minds. Other names besides Ocasio-Cortez that have drawn significant interest from include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.What To KnowA survey published Thursday by Quantus Insights, which conducts research and modeling for election forecasting, shows Ocasio-Cortez leading Harris when the 1,000 survey respondents were asked who best reflects the Democratic Party's values.Ocasio-Cortez received 19 percent of respondents' support, compared to 17 percent for Harris. They were followed by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker (12 percent), Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders (10 percent), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (9 percent), and former President Barack Obama (7 percent).However, when asked about the preferred 2028 nominee, 30 percent of respondents who identified as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents selected Harris. Ocasio-Cortez, Buttigieg and Booker each garnered support in the 13–14 percent range.\"The absence of a clear leader—reflected in the 20% who either selected 'none' or were unsure—highlights a perceived leadership vacuum within the Democratic Party,\" Quantus notes in its assessment. \"While AOC and Kamala Harris lead the field, their narrow margins suggest a fragmented coalition.\"This lack of consensus may complicate efforts to project a unified message ahead of 2026 and could weaken voter confidence in the party's strategic direction in the House.\"Jason Corley, co-founder and lead pollster at Quantus Insights, told Newsweek on Friday that the data tells a story \"that's less about collapse\" and more about a postelection leadership identity shift that is often customary after a major electoral loss.He compared what the Democrats are currently enduring to the GOP after the 2012 election, and the dramatic shift in Republican ideology from the days of President George W. Bush and even Mitt Romney, to Trump.\"Unless Democrats coalesce around a clear message and messenger—particularly one who can speak to economic concerns beyond progressive litmus tests—they risk entering the midterms with a fragmented strategy,\" Corley said. \"With [former President Joe] Biden off the ballot and his legacy less remembered by then, there's opportunity to reset—but that vacuum also exposes the party's structural fragility.\"Overall, 65 percent of respondents found the Democratic Party \"very favorable\" (25 percent) or \"somewhat favorable\" (40 percent). About 22 percent find the party \"very unfavorable.\"Another question asked about the party's political and ideological stance, with about 46 percent of respondents saying it's balanced.Another 32 percent said that it is too progressive and/or too far left. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have been top names in that farther-left coalition over the years, including as part of their current Fighting Oligarchy nationwide tour of red and blue states.The future of the party remains in flux. The survey asked Democratic and Democrat-leaning independents which direction the party needs to go, garnering an exact 50-50 split between moving toward the center or moving farther left.\"The immediate challenge for Democrats is messaging discipline,\" Corley said. \"The party is not just ideologically divided, it's strategically split.\"What People Are SayingPatricia Crouse, political scientist in residence at the University of New Haven, to Newsweek: \"I think people see her as the face of the Democratic Party right now because she seems to be the only one (along with Sanders) willing to stand up for the party and stand against Trump,\" Crouse said. \"But many within the party, both members and voters, view her as too progressive or even extreme left.\"Denny Salas, former Washington, D.C., consultant, to Newsweek: \"There's always room for loudmouths with no serious plans to improve the everyday lives of working-class Americans. AOC is currently running the same exact and tired playbook of 'Trump-Hate' some Democrats have been running since 2016. It may win an election here and there, but it is unserious.\"What Happens NextHarris' future political endeavors, as that of the other top Democrats mentioned in 2028 polls, remain unknown.

Joe Manchin (D–W.Va.) raised the hackles of left-wing activists for opposing some trillion-dollar progressive priority during the Biden administration, liberal writer Matt Yglesias would defend the senator on the grounds that he was performing above replacement value.\n\nInstead of comparing Manchin to other progressive senators, Yglesias argued lefties should compare him to his most likely replacement, which would almost certainly be a very conservative West Virginia Republican.\n\nAll things considered, he was the best West Virginia senator progressives could reasonably hope for.\n\nI have a similarly sunny assessment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe looming close of the Trump administration's first 100 days in office, and Elon Musk's announcement that he is stepping away from DOGE, have provoked a lot of critical retrospectives.\n\nThe $1 trillion that Musk claimed DOGE would save has been downgraded to $150 billion, and even this figure might not stand up to closer scrutiny. The many grants and employees terminated by DOGE have been reinstated, at least temporarily, by the courts.\n\nFederal government experts argue that few of its cuts have actually made the government operate more smoothly. As one Reuters headline pointedly declared, \"100 days of DOGE: lots of chaos, not so much efficiency.\"\n\nLibertarians may well feel that the whole DOGE effort has been a massive letdown.\n\nCompared to an ideal effort to shrink the size and scope of the federal government, DOGE has indeed disappointed. However, when one considers the most realistic alternatives to DOGE, its record actually looks pretty good.\n\nThe most obvious point of comparison to DOGE is the Kamala Harris administration that didn't happen.\n\nHarris would most certainly not have launched anything approximating DOGE. If she governed remotely similarly to her predecessor, we could have expected another four years of rapidly expanding government.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, federal spending rose by $4.7 trillion, and $2.5 trillion was added to the deficit, according to an analysis from the Economic Policy Innovation Center. Meanwhile, regulations finalized under former President Joe Biden added an estimated $1.8 trillion in regulatory costs.\n\nThe new spending was obviously done with the consent of Congress. Much of the additional regulatory burden was a result of the Biden White House's \"whole of government\" initiatives whereby agencies were told to go around finding rules that could be tightened in the name of equity, environmental justice, and more.\n\nSo, it's true that DOGE didn't come anywhere close to meeting its $1 trillion savings goal. But the cuts it has made already put it in the black compared to what a Harris administration would have done.\n\nDOGE can also be ranked as a success when compared to what the Trump administration could have done instead on the small government front, which is to say nothing at all.\n\nDonald Trump is not a libertarian. He's not even a remotely small government guy, as his recent actions on trade and immigration demonstrate. He's staffed his administration with fewer traditional free marketers than past Republican presidents.\n\nNevertheless, the president was willing to give Musk a remarkable amount of string to fire federal workers, terminate federal grants, and downsize whole agencies.\n\nMilton Friedman, when asked about the free market reforms undertaken by Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, liked to say that the real miracle in Chile wasn't that those reforms worked but that a military dictatorship was willing to try them in the first place.\n\nSomething similar could be said for DOGE. Its success isn't that it's been super effective at shrinking the government, but rather that Trump let it happen at all.\n\nThe fact that DOGE did happen raised the hopes of small government reformers that we might see a lot of executive energy devoted to a steady, methodical, and congressionally supported effort to shrink the state.\n\nBut that was never in the cards. Steady and methodical is just not how the Trump administration approaches anything.\n\nWitness the utter chaos that's erupted over the administration's tariff policy. Tariffs are one of the few things that Trump himself clearly believes in. His administration is full of similarly committed protectionists.\n\nAnd yet, even on this issue, the administration can't decide how exactly it wants to impose punishing trade barriers, or if it even wants to impose punishing trade barriers at all.\n\nOne couldn't reasonably expect Trump to approach a cause he's clearly not committed to with more care.\n\nFor all the chaos that DOGE has unleashed, it's hewed pretty closely to the initial vision that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy laid out for it in their joint Wall Street Journal op-ed published shortly after the 2024 election.\n\nThe two promised to use executive orders to shrink the federal workforce and rescind agency regulations that should have properly been passed by Congress.\n\nThat's more or less what's happened. The DOGE teams within federal agencies have fired staff en masse. The White House has also issued a steady stream of executive orders instructing agencies to identify and repeal federal regulations not supported by an underlying statute.\n\nOne could argue that all this could have happened without DOGE's characteristic chaos bordering on bungling incompetence.\n\nBut even bungling incompetence has an upside.\n\nMaking the federal government a less secure place to work and a less reliable funding partner means fewer people will want to work for it, and fewer organizations will rely on it for funding.\n\nEncouraging the best and brightest federal workers to leave government employment might not make the government operate more efficiently. But it will make the economy operate more efficiently by shifting talented people from unproductive bureaucratic work to a profit-seeking private sector.\n\nDOGE was not the libertarian moment. One could dream about what a Rand Paul administration could have accomplished with the aid of a Congress stuffed with Justin Amashes and Thomas Massies.\n\nBut the country didn't elect Rand Paul as president. It elected Donald Trump.\n\nThe relevant benchmark for DOGE's performance isn't how much a highly competent effort to shrink government could have accomplished. Rather, it's what the most likely alternatives to the DOGE would have accomplished.\n\nEvery plausible alternative would have resulted in more government than what we got with DOGE. On that metric, it's been a smashing success.","summary":"When compared to the most likely alternatives, DOGE has cut as much government as one could hope for.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/25/doge-has-been-a-smashing-success/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/04/reason-trumpmusk-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 17:45:53","author":"C.j.

He talked about the platform as the new digital town square. He said social media companies’ moderation policies should be no more restrictive than national laws. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote after agreeing to a $44 billion takeover. In the three years since making the deal, Musk has continued to cloak himself in the armor of a free speech warrior, out there fighting for the rest of us. “Turns out free speech is very expensive,” he said a year ago, urging all of us to support this bedrock principle by … subscribing to X Premium.\n\nIt’s been a lot of sizzle and the opposite of steak. Musk unbanned a bunch of right-wing (and even some left-of-center) accounts, pitching that as an anti-censorship move. (He allowed back some legit Nazis, but also the Krassenstein brothers. Fair is fair.) But he also banned and suspended accounts, like the one that did nothing more than share public information about his own private jet usage. He tried to restrict people’s linking to other social media platforms, only bailing from that effort after a heartwarmingly cross-ideological backlash. He has sued researchers who have reached damning conclusions about Nazism on X. He has juiced the platform’s algorithm to send ideologically friendly posts soaring, while throttling posts with links to outside information. Few people have ever done less to promote the free and open exchange of information on the internet.\n\nSo it’s notable that lawmakers in Minnesota—Democratic ones, at that—have given Musk an opening to sell himself as a free speech guy in a manner that is not just a fugazi. Through his company, X, Musk filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in federal district court that puts him on the free-speechier side of a debate. These lawmakers have created a double whammy: a law that could genuinely curtail free expression online and a public relations coup for Musk, whose own interests intersect with a free speech argument.\n\nOne can see the idea behind Minnesota statute 609.771 (“USE OF DEEP FAKE TECHNOLOGY TO INFLUENCE AN ELECTION”). A.I. deepfakes could bork our information ecosystem even worse than it is already borked, making it so that people can sparsely tell what is real online and what is not. Minnesota lawmakers have been rightfully concerned about deepfakes in two contexts: sex and politics. The state’s statute against nonconsensual sexual deepfakes has not generated as much controversy. Most people agree, or at least don’t fight the idea, that there is no social utility in letting people indulge their creative urge to ruin other people’s lives with A.I.-created sexual imagery.\n\nThe state’s statute about deepfakes and elections—first signed into law by Tim Walz in 2023 and updated in 2024—is thornier. The whole thing is just a few paragraphs and list points. The law sets out a detailed, noncontroversial definition of a deepfake, and then states that “a person who disseminates a deep fake or enters into a contract or other agreement to disseminate a deep fake is guilty of a crime” under certain circumstances. In Minnesota, it’s a crime if the person knows (or “acts with reckless disregard” in not knowing) that a deepfake isn’t real and shares it during an election season “without the consent of the depicted individual” and “with the intent to injure a candidate” or influence an election. Punishments range from small fines to up to five years in prison. (Candidates for state or local office are barred from office if they’re convicted of this crime.) The state attorney general, Keith Ellison, is nominally supposed to enforce this law, and so he is the named defendant in Musk’s lawsuit.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the Minnesota law is that if you CTRL-F your way through it (and again, it’s not long), you will not find the words parody or satire or any collection of words pointing in that direction. Now, I do not personally have a great problem with simply banning all deepfakes out of hand. I find that deepfakes, even ones that are supposed to be funny, are almost never funny. They strike me as a waste of electricity and a piss-poor substitute for more thought-intensive forms of art. If a constitutional amendment were on the table to make all deepfakes of any intention punishable by up to 10 years of watching an awful A.I.-generated Harry Potter spinoff on a loop, I would support that amendment.\n\nBut in the world we have now, criminalizing political deepfakes without a satire exemption is like fighting gravity. No, it’s not essential to democracy that you be able to look at a sloppy deepfake of FBI agents hauling Donald Trump into custody. No, the American experiment does not rest on your ability to see a made-up image of Kamala Harris and Barack Obama carrying on an affair. But criminalizing parody opens up enough dangerous doors that even the most self-interested people who oppose it are onto something, and it sure does seem like this law could criminalize parody. It doesn’t carve out permission for people to share obvious fakes in service of some larger political point. In this way, it differs from California’s similar law, which does exempt parody but is still in jeopardy of going down in the courts.\n\nEnter Musk, who is not the first person to sue over Minnesota’s law but knows a layup when he sees one. Musk brings the suit through X. He has a business case for being involved, arguing that the law turns the government into a social media moderator and imposes unfair liability on sites like Musk’s. In the filing, X’s lawyers share just the kind of deepfakes I described—these ones, of Trump’s imaginary and violent arrest in the streets—and makes the case that because the deepfake exists on its platform, it is “disseminating” it and could be in big trouble under the text of the Minnesota statute. The lawsuit only spends a little time on satire and, given Musk’s position, more on his platform’s liability.\n\nWell … he’s right! He’s just right. You may not be particularly concerned with the liability of a social media platform controlled by the right-wing billionaire whose free speech maneuvering has not been on the level for years. But in this case, Musk isn’t the only theoretically liable party. So is any creatively challenged dork who believes they’ve got a hilarious parody deepfake in the hopper that they absolutely must share during a political campaign. If you post one of these deepfakes, your friends should make fun of you until you cry. You should be cyberbullied, even. But jailed? Maybe for a few days, if the deepfake is especially cringe. But generally not. Some problems are best confronted with social sanctions rather than criminal.\n\nMusk’s lawyers use some overcooked language that may remind you who they are working for. They claim that the law will create “blanket censorship,” a line that may make your eyes roll out of the back of your head when you remember that Musk now co-runs the executive branch with someone who sues media companies over coverage he disfavors and muses about making it easier for public figures to prove libel. You do not, in general, have to hand it to the man. But that’s exactly why it’s such a gift that Minnesota has given Musk this opportunity to fight for free speech, rather than “free speech.”\n\nX demands a jury trial. It wants the court to declare that the law violates the First and 14th amendments and is null and void, and it wants an injunction that would prevent the state AG from enforcing the law. Musk, as always, has a self-interest. It seems unlikely that Ellison has the time to drink from the firehose of political deepfakes on the internet and do a bunch of prosecutions of individuals every election season. There may very well be a way that he can devote time and resources to coming after a social media company like X, though, and Musk and his lawyers would like to preempt that possibility.\n\nThe Venn diagram of what advantages Musk and what advantages the free flow of ideas in a democracy has historically just been two circles that have nothing to do with each other. But here, the diagram has the tiniest overlapping section in the middle. You just have to squint at it for a minute.","summary":"For once, the billionaire’s first amendment crusade isn’t total nonsense.

Will John James?”\n\nBoth individuals are early key players in the 2026 election. \n\nJames, a U.S. House representative for Michigan and a Shelby Township Republican, announced his bid for the governor seat earlier this month. With no incumbent in the race — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cannot seek another term — the seat is in play for the GOP in 2026, Borquez said.\n\nRogers, a former Republican congressman and a close runner-up in the state’s 2024 U.S. Senate race, this month announced he will mount a second campaign for the Senate during next year’s elections. With no incumbent in the race — Democrat Gary Peters announced he will retire after this term — Republicans have a shot at clinching one of the state’s two U.S. Senate positions, Borquez said.\n\n“It might be too early for Trump to give an outright endorsement, but certainly, being on a stage with him would help them with fundraising,” Borquez said. “And it kind of gives the signal that, ‘Rogers is the Trump guy’ and ‘James is the Trump guy.’”\n\nIt’s unclear if either Rogers or James will attend the Tuesday event, but both were regulars at Trump rallies in the state last year. And both Michigan politicians received endorsements from Trump for their respective 2024 campaigns.\n\nJames’ Congressional district includes Macomb County, the host of Trump’s Tuesday visit.\n\nTrump promoting his agenda and claiming policy victories in the state also could serve the purpose of rallying Michigan support behind Republicans at a time when polls show his approval ratings in decline, experts say.\n\nRallying that support now in Michigan could help the president boost the GOP profile for the 2026 U.S. House races, said Andrea LaFontaine, Central Michigan University’s Griffin Endowed Chair in American Government.\n\n“Those margins are tight in the House right now,” LaFontaine said of the 119th Congress, where 220 Republicans and 213 Democrats serve today. “(The Trump administration is) in that kind of protect-and-retain-the-seats-they-have kind of mode.”\n\nThere are 13 U.S. House members representing Michigan today, with the GOP earning a 7-6 advantage over Democrats after last year’s election for the 2-year seats.\n\nIt’s unclear how many of those representatives will seek re-election next year, but at least two seats will not feature incumbents. James and Democrat Haley Stevens announced their 2026 campaigns for the governor and U.S. Senate races, respectively.\n\nTrump’s decision to host the 100-day “celebration” in Macomb County could also be part of a 2026 U.S. House election strategy. Along with James, Republican Lisa McClain represents a congressional district that encompasses the southeast Michigan county.\n\nWhile McClain bested her 2024 Democratic opponent by nearly 40 percentage points, voters in James’ district offered a tighter margin of victory for Republicans. James defeated his Democratic competition by 6 percentage points. \n\nIn the 2022 election, the margin was even smaller for James: 0.5 percentage points.\n\nNo Republican has yet to declare a 2026 campaign for James’ district.\n\nBorquez said Trump’s choice of Macomb County for Tuesday’s event also could relate to a significant piece of real estate there: Selfridge Air National Guard Base.\n\nTrump earlier this month referenced the base, which officials in recent years have said holds an uncertain future. Trump, though, floated the idea of transporting new jets there.\n\n“We’ve got some good feedback from Pete Hegseth at the Department of Defense. They’re talking about F-16s, they’re talking about F-35s and, you know, et cetera,” Trump said earlier this month. “It’s a great piece of property, it’s a great location, and it’s a great state.”\n\nTrump has said he planned to work with Michigan leaders to keep Selfridge Air National Guard Base open. Whitmer and Republican state House Speaker Matt Hall met with Trump’s cabinet this month in the Oval Office, where they discussed the base’s future.\n\nBorquez said the Tuesday event may give Trump an opportunity to take credit for injecting optimism about the base’s future.\n\n“He could talk up his role with Selfridge and, you know, maybe take a little credit away from from Gov. Whitmer in the process, which I’m sure is in the back of his mind somewhere,” Borquez said. “That’s standard political gamesmanship, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he talks about it.”\n\nBoth Borquez and LaFontaine said the Tuesday event likely will be distinctive in other ways. Neither political science expert could recall a U.S. president before Trump hosting an event advertised as a “celebration” of their first 100 days in office.\n\nTypically, the 100-day milestone is noted by media pundits and acknowledged by presidents more discretely.\n\nBut Tuesday — technically, the 99th day of the Trump presidency — would mark Trump’s second time hosting an event sold as a celebration of such a milestone.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term — on April 29, 2017 — the president hosted a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to commemorate 100 days in the White House.\n\nThe event featured Trump reiterating 2016 campaign promises involving immigration, health care, border security, and trade policy. He also spent much of the session criticizing the media for its coverage of his first administration.\n\n“We know he’s like a showman, and that’s one of his appeals as president,” LaFontaine said, explaining the uniqueness of Trump hosting such an event. “Why is he choosing Michigan for this? I think he realizes Michigan matters.”\n\nTrump in November 2024 won Michigan’s 15 electoral college votes, flipping the battleground state again in a victory over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump in 2016 was the first Republican to win Michigan’s vote since 1988. With his victory last year, he added to that bragging right.\n\nTrump’s favor in Michigan has wavered over the years, but his supporters have kept the vote counts close. He defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 10,704 Michigan votes in 2016 and then lost to Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 154,188 Michigan votes four years later.\n\nTrump defeated Harris by 80,103 Michigan votes last November.\n\nIn the nearly 100 days since he returned to the White House, Trump has signed a series of executive orders and outlined other policy initiatives that immediately impacted Americans.\n\nThe president’s activity seemingly has not slowed since then, with each week delivering new issues and new understandings of how Trump’s administration influences American law and culture, including in Michigan.\n\nWhile voters favored him in the battleground state last year, Michigan residents also have joined in the growing number of protests expressing opposition to his policies, on issues ranging from the economy to immigration.\n\nClick here to follow MLive’s complete coverage of President Trump’s impact on Michigan.","summary":"Political scientists say the president's return to the battleground state signals his understanding of Michigan's importance for Republican control in Washington, D.C.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/04/why-trumps-100th-day-celebration-in-michigan-has-political-experts-raising-eyebrows.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/TPNHVVXAIRH2BFVBBX47VAEJYM.jpg?auth=4264aea9beb2e2e8bd473e66fc784855631196299b213073768a2f9d4af642cd&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 16:43:59","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":314805844,"title":"Meghan McCain's Prediction About Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and 2028 Election","text":"Conservative political commentator Meghan McCain predicted on Thursday that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, will run for president in 2028, writing in a social media post that the congresswoman's economic message is \"more powerful than people are giving her credit for.\"McCain, whose father John McCain was the Republican nominee for president in 2008, cast doubt on a potential 2028 presidential run by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg due to his low polling among Black Americans.Newsweek has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's and McCain's press teams via email on Friday.Why It MattersOcasio-Cortez has emerged as a prominent figure within the Democratic Party, particularly among progressive circles. Her nationwide \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour with independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has drawn substantial crowds across red and blue states, including 36,000 attendees in Los Angeles. Early polling indicates she is among the top contenders for the Democratic nomination in 2028, though some within the party express concerns about her nationwide appeal.McCain's comments reflect murmurings among conservatives regarding Ocasio-Cortez's potential candidacy. In November, former Treasury Department official Monica Crowley, who served in President Donald Trump's first administration, warned Republicans not to underestimate the congresswoman, stating, \"She's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive,\" and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, also indicated he believes she may run. Pollster Nate Silver recently signaled Ocasio-Cortez's as the likely leader of the Democratic ticket in 2028.In November, Trump secured a presidential election victory over then-Vice President Kamala Harris, receiving 312 electoral votes to his Democratic rival's 226 and also winning the popular vote for the first time. The Republican Party also flipped the Senate and held onto a House majority.The scale of Trump's triumph has sparked widespread soul-searching within the Democratic Party over what went wrong and how to rebuild. Democratic leaders have come under criticism from within the party, highlighting divisions among Democrats.What To Know On Thursday, McCain reshared a video on X, formerly Twitter, from Ocasio-Cortez's campaign page, Team AOC, with clips of the representative speaking at recent mass rallies alongside Sanders. Accompanying the video, McCain wrote: \"She's going to run and her message of economic populism is more powerful than people are giving her credit for.\"Ocasio-Cortez, a fourth-term congresswoman, has become one of the most recognizable faces of her party since defeating 20-year Democratic lawmaker Joe Crowley in 2019. She's become synonymous with progressive ideals and policies, such as the \"Green New Deal,\" that have been maligned by Republicans over the years.Hours later, McCain shared another X post regarding Buttigieg's potential run, writing, \"He polls at 0% with black voters...,\" indicating his unlikeliness to perform well in a national election.Recent polls suggest a competitive field for the 2028 Democratic nomination. A Quantus Insights poll of 1,000 registered voters from April 21 to 23 found Harris is leading the primary field with 30 percent, followed by Ocasio-Cortez at 14 percent, Buttigieg at 13 percent, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey at 13 percent, and Sanders at 6 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.An Echelon Insights poll of 457 likely voters conducted from March 10 to 13 showed Harris leading with 33 percent, followed by Buttigieg at 10 percent, and Ocasio-Cortez and California Governor Gavin Newsom tied at 7 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.Buttigieg's decision not to run for Michigan's Senate seat has fueled speculation about a future presidential bid. In a Substack post last month, he wrote, \"While my own plans don't include running for office in 2026, I am intensely focused on consolidating, communicating, and supporting this kind of vision.\"Some conservatives have expressed their distaste with a potential Ocasio-Cortez run, such as conservative host Tomi Lahren, who replied to McCain's X post, writing, \"She's dumb as a rock. She makes Kamala look like Albert Einstein.\"McCain responded on Friday morning: \"So was [former President Joe] Biden...Dumb people get elected president.\"What People Are Saying Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Las Vegas rally in March: \"This isn't just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too. But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand up for the working class.\"Denver resident Mary Ann Bennett, who attended Ocasio-Cortez's Denver rally with Senator Bernie Sanders, previously told Newsweek: \"The Democratic Party has not been taking strong actions for the working class. Bernie and AOC acknowledged this, which is step one, and then laid out their plans for action which were met with strong cheers from the 30,000 people who showed up. Those moments were when I felt the most empowered and ready to fight for my neighbors.\"Denny Salas, former Washington, D.C., consultant and field organizer during former President Barack Obama's first term, told Newsweek earlier this week: \"There's always room for loudmouths with no serious plans to improve the everyday lives of working-class Americans. AOC is currently running the same exact and tired playbook of 'Trump-Hate' some Democrats have been running since 2016. It may win an election here and there, but it is unserious.\"What Happens Next?Official announcements for the 2028 Democratic primary are not expected until closer to the election and will serve as a time to potentially rebrand the Democratic Party which had huge losses across 2024 elections.Ocasio-Cortez's current terms ends on January 3, 2027. She has not indicated whether a presidential run is in her future.","summary":"McCain suggested that the Democratic congresswoman will be running for the 2028 presidential election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/meghan-mccains-prediction-about-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-2028-election-2064176","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2633288/meghan-mccain-aoc.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 16:13:58","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.363},{"id":314882058,"title":"Closing The Hope Gap: How Communications Can Drive Social Acceptance","text":"(MENAFN- PRovoke)\nAt a time when the promise of a more inclusive future seems at odds with the current state of social progress and political policy, a new report from The Unmistakables – titled The Hope Gap – highlights the crucial role of communications professionals in bridging the divide. This gap, as defined by the report, represents the space between what society hopes for in terms of social acceptance, and the reality of what we are experiencing today.\n\nThe Hope Gap examines societal challenges and is also a call to action for businesses, marketers, and media outlets to step up and drive tangible change. The report emphasises that the forces preventing social progress – systemic inequality, divisive media narratives, and corporate inaction – must be addressed holistically.\n\nExplaining the use of“acceptance”, the report states:“A lot of people talk about tolerance, respect, or even celebration when it comes to living amongst people of different backgrounds. We use the term 'acceptance' to refer to a society where people are welcomed as they are regardless of their identity characteristics.”\n\nFocusing on three sectors – business, marketing, and media – the report identifies 10 practical actions (see below) that professionals in each field can take to close the gap between hope and reality.\n\nThe report argues that business, marketing and media not only shape societal narratives but also hold the power to influence culture and drive social progress. One particularly pressing issue it tackles is the tension between inclusivity and the campaign models that dominate the PR and marketing industries.\n\nSpeaking to PRovoke Media, The Unmistakables founder Asad Dhunna explained how the report came about:“Last summer we were looking at the political horizon and Project 2025 – there were indications that DEI would be under more scrutiny. We were looking at how to continue to have impact and what really works – a lot of that is not a sexy story, it's about process design and leadership. We felt that in general people are feeling a lot less hopeful – look at the riots in the UK after the general election last summer, then the hope of Kamala Harris in the run up to the US election, and then the actual result – so we wanted to do something around the notion of hope.”\n\nThe Unmistakables looked at media and brand sentiment analysis, and put together a roundtable with clients and others, including leaders from agencies such as Golin, Hope&Glory and Omnicom, media outlets such as ITV and Contagious, brands such as Burberry and Unilever, and organisations such as More in Common.\n\n“We looked at three areas of where we see hope existing,” Dhunna said.“First, around business, focused on systems, polices, process and leadership; second around marketing and what marketers can do to communicate positive stories; and third, the media, and how stories are put out in the media around inclusion. We went into a lot of depth and co-created this report with our clients.”\n\nHe said one of the problems for bridging that gap in the communications industry is that it operates in an“attention economy” where the rush to capture attention often results in superficial or performative acts; the real challenge is creating media that does more than just grab attention – it should foster understanding and drive change.\n\n“Comms needs to get more gravitas around the place of earned media in culture. We want to create thumb-stopping content, but is that the right outcome, or is there something higher-ordered than that? Do we want to create change in how people are discussing a certain subject, or create real change?”\n\nHe added:“People aren't finding space to discuss this. We need places and space to remove the anxiety of what we're feeling, reading and scrolling through. Everyone should be talking about it, but it's not easy to talk about, because it's fundamentally linked to politics and beliefs. The report was validation that for our industry and agencies to move forward, that is going to take systemic change. How do we role model good behaviour as leaders, set standards, and push back against clients? We need to collaborate.”\n\nThe Hope Gap challenges corporate leaders to move beyond diversity statements and initiatives that are often seen as performative. Instead, companies are encouraged to adopt long-term strategies that integrate DEI into their core operations and processes. As the report emphasises, businesses have an opportunity to shape social acceptance by implementing systemic changes. This could involve rethinking hiring processes, pay gaps, and leadership representation, and a move beyond simply“reporting” on diversity to making it an embedded part of culture.\n\nDhunna said:“It became clear to us that for businesses to move forward, systemic change is needed. How do we role-model good behaviour as leaders? How do we set standards and push back against clients? It's about collaboration and creating space for those tough conversations.”\n\nThe report also addresses the challenge of leadership accountability in driving inclusion. It stresses that leaders need to model inclusive behaviours actively, ensuring that DEI is not just a responsibility of HR or a diversity officer but is embraced at the highest levels of the organisation.\n\nAnother persistent issue in the marketing and communications industry identified in the report is a tendency towards tokenism, where companies feature diverse individuals or causes without truly reflecting diversity within their teams or organisations. Marketers are urged to embrace authenticity and to ensure that DEI is integrated into every stage of the campaign process, from concept to execution.\n\n“A lot of marketers have learned to showcase diversity in their campaigns, but this is often a reaction to external pressure,” it states.“What is often missing is the true internal commitment to diversity, which reflects in the creative output.”\n\nFor communications professionals, this means recognising that diverse voices must be present not only in the content but in the creation process itself. Having a truly diverse team in place is crucial for ensuring that campaigns resonate with diverse audiences and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nAs Dhunna points out, marketers must ask themselves whether they are creating short-term buzz or long-term cultural change:“We operate in the attention economy, so it's about understanding those dynamics. Are you trying to grab attention or create real understanding? We want to create thumb-stopping content, but is that the right outcome, or is there something higher-ordered than that?”\n\nThe report also provides an in-depth examination of how the media plays a central role in shaping public perceptions of inclusion. By examining how marginalised communities are portrayed in mainstream media, The Hope Gap highlights the risks of perpetuating negative stereotypes that undermine progress.\n\nIn particular, it stresses the importance of moving away from the sensationalism that dominates the media landscape, and calls for journalists and communicators to focus on“holistic storytelling”– narratives that represent the full spectrum of human experiences and highlight the agency and strength of marginalised groups, rather than focusing on victimhood.\n\n“The media has a responsibility to amplify positive portrayals of marginalized communities,” the report states.“This is not just about creating more inclusive content, but about shifting the narrative towards empowerment and shared humanity.”\n\nDhunna said the conversations that led to the report left him“70% hopeful” for the future:“People were connected, and suddenly we had new partnerships and potential. We need more conversation, dialogue and debate.”\n\n The 10 Key Actions \n Question what people know and respond accordingly . Many businesses and organisations operate under assumptions that may not hold true in today's rapidly evolving cultural landscape. Professionals are encouraged to regularly assess and challenge these assumptions to ensure that their actions are aligned with the needs of their diverse audiences.\n Know what it takes to be proactive . While responding to crises is important, businesses must shift towards proactive efforts. This means being prepared to drive change and embed diversity, equity, and inclusion into everyday practices rather than reacting only when forced by external pressures.\n Create long-term strategic frameworks . A sustainable approach to inclusion requires strategic planning. Businesses are advised to develop long-term frameworks that prioritise DEI across all operations, from product design to marketing and employee policies.\n Address the marketing industry's reputation issue . The marketing sector has been criticised for tokenism and superficial engagement with DEI. The report urges marketers to move beyond performative gestures and focus on creating campaigns that are authentic and resonate with diverse audiences.\n Develop client-agency standards and charters . By setting clear expectations and standards around DEI, agencies and clients can ensure that diversity and inclusion are embedded in every aspect of their work, from creative ideation to campaign execution.\n Role model inclusive behaviours at leadership levels . Leaders within organisations must set the tone for inclusive behaviours. This includes actively advocating for DEI, holding others accountable, and creating environments where marginalised voices are heard and valued.\n Bespoke the onboarding process . A diverse workforce needs an onboarding process that is tailored to ensure all new employees feel supported and empowered. This includes addressing implicit norms and fostering an inclusive company culture from day one.\n Reassess the 'attention' business model . The attention economy often leads to sensationalism and oversimplification. Communications professionals are encouraged to focus on creating meaningful dialogue that goes beyond capturing attention and instead fosters genuine understanding.\n Take a closer look at the norms and power holders . The report emphasises the need for a closer examination of power structures within organisations and society. Changing the norms that have long upheld inequality is essential for creating lasting social progress.\n Amplify positive portrayals to drown out the negativity . The media and advertising industries must take responsibility for the stories they tell. By shifting the focus towards positive, multifaceted portrayals of marginalised groups, the narrative around inclusion can evolve from one of victimhood to one of empowerment.","summary":"(MENAFN - PRovoke)\nAt a time when the promise of a more inclusive future seems at odds with the current state of social progress and political policy, a new report from The Unmistakables – titled ...","url":"https://menafn.com/1109474119/Closing-The-Hope-Gap-How-Communications-Can-Drive-Social-Acceptance","image":"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-04/25/P_001deimage_story.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 15:16:09","author":"Date,MENAFN","authors":["Date","MENAFN"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jo","sentiment":0.176},{"id":314777742,"title":"Donald Trump’s trip to Pope Francis’ funeral puts a sharper focus on their clashes over the years","text":"By PETER SMITH and MICHELLE L.

Trump declared that free speech mattered.\n\nTrump issued the Executive Order Restoring Free Speech and Ending Federal Censorship on March 21, 2019. In it, he expressed the importance of free inquiry and open debate to education and directed federal officials to use the federal government's funding of higher education to ensure that universities promote free inquiry.\n\nChanneling free-speech champions Benjamin Franklin and James Madison, Trump wrote that \"free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation's democracy.\"\n\nAs a professor of constitutional, criminal and comparative law, and as a citizen who enjoys his liberty, I agree.\n\nFree speech is fundamental to human progress. Scientific, medical, technological and social advancements all rely on the free flow of information. Robust discussion and disagreement are equally important to maintaining a healthy constitutional republic. \n\nIn the words of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, \"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\"\n\nThe First Amendment's free speech and press clauses protect all forms of expression -- oral, print, digital and artistic -- from governmental interference or punishment.\n\nOf the many types of speech, political speech is the most protected.\n\nOn the first day of his second term in office, Trump issued another free speech executive order. It affirms the administration's commitment to free speech, directs that tax money is not used to abridge free speech and instructs federal employees to \"identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.\"\n\nIn a vacuum, Trump's orders appear to bode well for free speech.\n\nBut what is important is free speech reality, not rhetoric. Three months into his second term, where does Trump stand?\n\nThe many interconnected orders, letters, statements and actions of Trump's White House make an assessment of any positive effects difficult. On the other hand, the Trump administration has clearly violated and chilled free speech on many occasions.\n\n At his second inauguration, Donald Trump promised to 'stop all government censorship' and 'bring back free speech.'\n\n Repression and retaliation\n\nAttempts to silence the president's adversaries are developing as a pattern.\n\nLaw firms and attorneys who have sued or prosecuted Trump, or represented his adversaries, have been targeted for retribution and concessions.\n\nIt began with an executive order on March 6, directed at the U.S.-based global law firm Perkins Coie, which had once represented Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton.\n\nA second order was issued on March 14, against Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison because it once employed an attorney who investigated Trump. Subsequently, at least six other prominent law firms were also targeted. \n\nSeveral law firms acceded to the president's demands, agreeing to accept clients without regard to political beliefs, to eliminate DEI practices and to perform pro bono work valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars for causes Trump supports.\n\nThe firms that didn't accede to the president's demands had their security clearances removed, access to federal buildings restricted, and working for federal agencies banned. A few of the firms that didn't relent have won temporary injunctions barring the administration's actions against them.\n\nThe nonpartisan free speech advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression decried the orders as threatening the foundations of justice and free speech. In one of several challenges to these orders, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote on March 12 that Trump's order appeared motivated by \"retaliatory animus\" and concluded that it \"runs head on into the wall of First Amendment protections.\" Two other federal courts reached similar conclusions.\n\nIn the first three months of his second term, Trump withdrew Secret Service protection of several prominent critics who are former federal government officials, including John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and former high-level health official Anthony Fauci also lost their security protection.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that these decisions won't have a profoundly chilling effect on potential critics of the president, especially since the revocations were publicly announced and each individual has been the subject of credible threats resulting from their governmental service.\n\nTargeting the press\n\nA similar pattern exists for journalists, where Trump is using his power to punish organizations whose reporting he doesn't like.\n\nAssociated Press journalists were banned from the White House and Air Force One on Feb. 11 for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the new name Trump had ordered for the body of water. On April 9, this ban was found to violate the First Amendment by a judge nominated by Trump during his first term.\n\nDenouncing CNN and MSNBC as \"illegal\" and claiming they are paid political operatives, Trump suggested they should be investigated during a speech at the U.S. Department of Justice. \n\nTrump effectively closed Voice of America after 83 years of continuous broadcasting for being \"anti-Trump\" and radical in its views. By charter, the broadcaster represents \"America, not any single segment of American society,\" with \"accurate, objective and comprehensive\" news and \"a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions\" through television, radio, internet, social media and satellite broadcasts to people around the world.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has initiated regulatory actions against the licenses of several television stations for broadcasts that have been accused by the president of being anti-Trump or biased in favor of Kamala Harris. Early in the process, the outcomes of these actions are to be determined.\n\nOther administration actions, I believe, raise serious free speech issues.\n\nHarvard not the only university feeling pressure\n\nThe administration is threatening to withhold federal money from universities as a way to coerce many of them to comply with administration policies in ways that implicate free speech and in some instances violate legal processes for the withholding of federal support.\n\nSome of the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement efforts have targeted international students who are in the United States lawfully, but who participated in Palestinian rights protests and disagreed with Israel's actions during the war in Gaza.\n\nThe administration claims that some students whose visas have been revoked were either Hamas supporters or violated criminal laws. The administration has also said that many students are being deported under broad authority the secretary of state has to deport those deemed a danger to national security.\n\nDemocracy and free speech\n\nIn the past decade, the United States has fallen in press freedom, rule of law and democratic governance, resulting in the classification of a \"flawed democracy\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a democratic watchdog. Unsurprisingly, there has been a simultaneous rise in public support for authoritarianism. These changes make support for free speech increasingly important.\n\nOn March 4, Trump declared in a speech before a joint session of Congress that he \"stopped all government censorship and brought free speech back to America.\"\n\nThe record doesn't support this claim.\n\nDaniel Hall is a professor of justice and community studies & political science at Miami University.

While the panelists appeared to believe China, Ungar-Sargon said their trust in a foreign adversary is “insane” and an embarrassment.\n\n“We don’t know if China’s lying or not, but I’m just saying that there’s no doubt that there’s a different story coming out of China,” former NewsNation host Dan Abrams said.\n\n“Why are you guys on China’s side in this? It’s insane!” Ungar-Sargon said.\n\nSiriusXM host John Fugelsang then asked how the public can trust Trump to tell the truth. (RELATED: Karoline Leavitt Says There Will Be ‘No Unilateral Reduction In Tariffs’ Against China)\n\n“How can you not trust China but trust Donald Trump?” Fugelsang asked.\n\n“Are you kidding me? I think that’s very sad that you trust our greatest adversary over the President of the United States who was elected by over 80 million of your fellow Americans,” Ungar-Sargon said. “That’s pathetic.”\n\n“Excuse me, the majority of people who showed up to vote against him in 2016, 2020, and 2024. There’s no mandate to speak of. I don’t trust China, but there is no reason … I’m telling you that the majority of folks who showed up to vote in all three elections voted against him,” Fugelsang said.\n\nTrump became the first Republican to win the popular vote since 2004 against former Vice President Kamala Harris. His approval ratings have also remained higher than they were during his first term.\n\nFugelsang claimed that no countries will trust Trump or want to make deals with the U.S. because he is not trustworthy. Ungar-Sargon pointed out that over 100 countries are communicating with the Trump administration to make negotiations on the reciprocal tariffs.\n\n“Are you not embarrassed to give preference to China over the United States?” Ungar-Sargon asked.\n\n“Why should I believe that Donald Trump is telling the truth about anything at this point? How can our allies believe it at this point? Who is going to make a deal with us after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris Accord? We can’t even get tourists to come anymore. People are deciding, you know what? This year I’ll try North Korea. Tourists aren’t even coming here anymore. But he wants to be in business with us because of this. He’s not an honest man.”\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that the U.S. intends to ease tariffs on China “substantially,” though they will not be eliminated completely. After Trump’s initial tariff announcement on April 2, the U.S. entered a trade war with China as the country imposed steep tariffs of its own in retaliation.\n\nBy April 9, Trump said he would raise the tariffs on China from 104% to 125% after he had implemented a 90-day pause on every other country to leave room for negotiations. The next day, Trump announced that the tariff rate would rise to a minimum of 145% on all Chinese tariffs, according to The New York Times.\n\nChina currently faces tariffs of up to 245% as a result of its retaliatory actions, the White House said on April 15.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a Tuesday speech that he expects a “de-escalation” in the tariff war between the U.S. and China, according to The Associated Press.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

However, there were questions about if the Eagles would follow the tradition and meet with President Donald Trump after they declined a visit following their Super Bowl win in 2018 during Trump's first term.\n\n The team formally accepted the offer in March. ESPN reported that the visit is scheduled for April 28.\n\n While attending the TIME100 Gala on Thursday, April 24, Hurts was asked by TIME if he was joining his other teammates.\n\n \"Umm,\" he replied, looking away from the camera with an uncomfortable expression, mixed with a hesitant smile. He didn't have anything else to say, prompting the reporter to reply, \"Got it. Thank you so much\" before the NFL star appeared to walk away.\n\n The decades-old tradition of Super Bowl-winning teams visiting the White House to meet with the current president started in 1980. In 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs met with former President Joe Biden in late May after their second consecutive Super Bowl victory.\n\n In 2018, members of the Philadelphia Eagles boycotted a White House appearance after winning the Super Bowl that year. This led Trump to revoke the invitation.\n\n At the time, Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney responded to Trump's move by calling him a “fragile egomaniac.”\n\n “The Eagles call the birthplace of our democracy home, so it’s no surprise that this team embodies everything that makes our country and our city great. Their athletic accomplishments on the field led to an historic victory this year. Fans all across the country rallied behind them because we like to root for the underdog and we feel joy when we see the underdogs finally win. I’m equally proud of the Eagles’ activism off the field. These are players who stand up for the causes they believe in and who contribute in meaningful ways to their community. They represent the diversity of our nation — a nation in which we are free to express our opinions,” he said in a statement.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Hurts was named MVP after the 2025 win, a fact that he reflected on during a February appearance on Good Morning America.\n\n “For 364 days of the year, you work day-in and day-out — blood, sweat and tears — just for one moment and that's to hold that trophy,” he said. “When I saw myself in that reflection, it was something I have never seen before so that's an amazing feeling.”\n\n On the field, he celebrated the exciting accomplishment by sharing a kiss with his love Bryonna \"Bry\" Burrows. At the time, they were only engaged. However, he recently revealed that they said \"I do\" during an interview with Men's Health.\n\n The happy couple continued the post-Super Bowl celebrations with another tradition — a visit to Disney World.\n\n Trump attended the 2025 Super Bowl, something that no other sitting president has ever done. Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce said that it was \"a great honor\" to have him at the game during a press event.\n\n \"I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there — it's the best country in the world — and that's pretty cool.\"\n\n His remarks came after Trump insulted Kelce's longtime girlfriend Taylor Swift, who endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n Despite the Chiefs loss at the game, Kelce's teammate Harrison Butker did visit the White House in February.","summary":"The Philadelphia Eagles formally accepted an offer to visit the White House after winning the 2025 Super Bowl","url":"https://people.com/jalen-hurts-awkward-red-carpet-moment-white-house-visit-11721907","image":"https://people.com/thmb/fzZ9ZhLxPcD2LmatCya0-coKhmk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(773x540:775x542)/Jalen-Hurts-White-House-042525-2-2abff4be24054dc0b8f2b40f788c9cd5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 13:49:03","author":"Michael Nied","authors":["Michael Nied"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.124},{"id":314759426,"title":"Dem-voting federal bureaucrats confirm they would defy legal presidential orders, poll shows","text":"A new poll found that a majority of federal employees who previously voted Democrat are geared up to act against the interest of their elected boss, President Donald Trump.\n\nThe data, released Thursday by the Napolitan Institute, shows that 76% of voters for former Vice President Kamala Harris working under Trump say they will “resist” his plans, while 75% say they would hypothetically disobey, or “do what [they] thought was best,” when given a legal order that they disagreed with. The Napolitan Institute said the numbers show a “deep partisan divide in the Administrative State” as Trump moves to bring the numerous halls of government in alignment with his agenda.\n\n“Our research confirms that the Administrative State is not composed of thoughtful, nonpartisan experts who are making neutral decisions for voters,” Napolitan Institute founder Scott Rasmussen said in a press release. “The deep partisan divide within the federal bureaucracy and the shifting public opinion present significant challenges for the current administration.”\n\nThe survey asked respondents to “imagine that you were the head of a federal government agency” and “President Trump gave you an order that was legal but you believed was bad policy.”\n\n“Would you follow the president’s order or do what you thought was best?” The questionnaire asked.\n\nThe results showed that 75% of bureaucrats who voted for Harris for president would “do what [they] thought was best,” in regards to Trump’s orders, while 9% were unsure and the rest would obey him. This contrasted with 80% of Trump-voting officials who said they would follow the president despite their disagreements, with 2% saying they were unsure and 18% saying they would not.\n\nHarris supporters in the government also said their own “political efforts” will be to either “strongly resist” or “somewhat resist” Trump’s agenda by 56% and 16% said they would “neither support nor resist,” the Napolitan Institute found.\n\nThe group surveyed 500 officials “living in the National Capitol Region and earning at least $75,000 annually,” noting a margin of error of 4 percent.\n\nTrump’s efforts to bring the bureaucracy to heel included a day-one hiring freeze “throughout the executive branch,” payouts for federal workers, funding cuts for left-wing priorities like transgender ideology as well as the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has cleaned house at several agencies.\n\n“The silver lining is that with such high levels of chaos in this bureaucratic ‘civil war’, there may be an opening for the common sense voice of the American people to rise above the political noise and once again become the shaping force of the nation’s dialogue,” said Rasmussen.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and twice for Barack Obama. President Donald Trump has won Florida three times in a row, most recently winning the 2024 election in all but six of Florida’s 67 counties. \n\nThe main battleground since 2000 has been the I-4 Corridor, which connects Tampa, Orlando and Daytona. In 2000, President George W. Bush won the corridor by 4,400 votes. Since Bush only won Florida by 537 votes, and thus the presidency, the area became a top priority for both political parties.\n\nSome Democrats have said Florida’s political evolution happened gradually and then all at once. \n\nIn 2012, there were almost 1.5 million more registered Democratic voters than Republicans in Florida. In 2020, Democrats’ advantage dropped to about 97,000. And by September 2024, there were almost 1 million more registered Republicans than Democrats. \n\nSteve Schale, the head of Obama’s 2008 campaign in Florida, argues that this shift happened because the Democratic Party lost the support of some white voters. \n\nRepublicans have also actively courted Hispanic voters, while Democrats falsely believed that young Hispanics would inherently lean toward their party. \n\nThis assumption has hurt the Democratic cause because, for example, some Hispanic voters in Florida, like many Cuban Americans, have long favored Republican. In fact, Trump performed so well with Hispanics in Florida in 2024 that it was the only state in which he received more of the Hispanic vote than Kamala Harris. \n\nState-level conservative success\n\nFlorida has also had a Republican governor since 1998, a state Senate Republican majority since 1995 and a state House majority since 1997. This Republican dominance has only grown since Trump’s 2016 election. \n\nIn 2018, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis received Trump’s endorsement and went from being relatively unknown in the gubernatorial primaries to the Republican nominee. He ultimately assumed office in 2019.\n\nSince then, DeSantis has successfully passed a slew of laws and policies reflecting the conservative values of what he saw as the new Floridian electorate. \n\nFor example, DeSantis passed a six-week abortion ban measure into law in 2023. \n\nWith DeSantis’ approval, Florida’s state Legislature also blocked diversity, equity and inclusion programs in state colleges in 2023 and banned lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity for public grade school students that same year. \n\nIn 2023, the Florida governor also signed a law that allowed people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. \n\nThe pandemic factor\n\nSome conservative political pundits and DeSantis supporters say that the governor’s COVID-19 policies are among the factors that have attracted newcomers to the state. \n\nAlmost 300,000 people moved from out of state to Florida between April 2020 and April 2021, equal to roughly 903 people relocating to the state each day.\n\nThe governor ordered Floridians to stay at home during April 2020, but many of his restrictions were lifted at the end of the month. \n\nDeSantis did not enforce mask mandates, vaccine requirements and other measures that were common in other states. \n\nDuring my fieldwork in Florida from 2022 through 2024, I met multiple people who moved to rural parts of the state because they did not want their lives to be severely restricted during the pandemic. \n\nOne man in his early 50s stated, “During COVID my wife and I realized how screwed we were if things got really bad. We hated the lockdowns and got scared about not having enough food. If things got really bad, we didn’t want to trust other people, we wanted to be self-sufficient. So, we decided to get a place in the middle of the woods, on our own property, that we could go to if everything went to hell.” \n\nThis couple settled on moving from out of state to a rural area of Florida, where they thought they had the best chance of avoiding future lockdown restrictions. \n\nDeSantis’ policy successes and his “freedom first” response to the pandemic have been celebrated by conservatives nationally. \n\nFlorida’s home for the alt-right\n\nAs Florida lawmakers have continued to push conservative policies since the pandemic, Florida-based activist groups like Moms for Liberty have mobilized to support and expand them. \n\nMoms for Liberty was founded in 2021 by three Florida former school board members who opposed COVID-19 regulations during the pandemic. \n\nMoms for Liberty is headquartered in Melbourne, Florida, and is focused on reshaping public school curriculum to exclude what its members see as “woke” themes, like sexual orientation. \n\nThe group lobbied for the 2022 Parental Rights in Education Act and the Stop-Woke Act, referred to by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” law. This law restricts Florida classrooms from teaching kids in kindergarten through third grade about sexual orientation and gender identity, and also limits instruction on these subjects in higher grades.\n\nFlorida has increasingly become a stronghold for other kinds of political activists, some of whom were instrumental in the Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021. Florida was home to 11.5% of the 716 people who were initially charged with participating in the Capitol riots. \n\nThe most notable of these Jan. 6 arrests is Enrique Tarrio, a Miami native who has served as the symbolic leader of the Proud Boys, an alt-right “Western chauvinist” group. \n\nAlt-right activists are a minority of Florida’s conservative population. In my fieldwork, I have spoken to many Florida conservatives who did not identify with the Proud Boys or other alt-right groups – but were still sympathetic to many of their populist and conservative causes.\n\nNo longer in play?\n\nFlorida is now a major Republican stronghold with Floridians becoming increasingly prominent in national politics. Trump’s Cabinet has 23 people – 16 of them are connected to Florida. \n\nThese include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who served as a senator in Florida, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, who served as Florida’s state attorney general.\n\nThough some Democrats may feel optimistic about the special election results, they have lost the Sunshine State, at least for now.","summary":"The growth of alt-right activist groups and the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic are two factors that help explain Florida’s politics.","url":"https://theconversation.com/florida-once-considered-a-swing-state-is-firmly-republican-a-social-anthropologist-explains-what-caused-this-shift-253905","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/663609/original/file-20250423-56-tpkg5z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C1046%2C6300%2C3150&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 12:54:29","author":"Alexander Lowie,Postdoctoral associate in Classical and Civic Education,University of Florida","authors":["Alexander Lowie","Postdoctoral associate in Classical and Civic Education","University of Florida"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":314809566,"title":"Megyn Kelly Hits Back at George Clooney Attacking Her Journalism Credentials: 'Not Fooling Anyone'","text":"“I’ve at least been to Darfur and Sudan and the Congo and been shot at to try to get stories out.

We literally just go, ‘These are your words.’”\n\nKelly shot back at Clooney in a recent episode of The Megyn Kelly Show, mainly attacking him for his infamous oped calling for Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race.\n\n“He’s starring in a play about Edward R. Murrow because Clooney fancies himself a journalist, you see, and has lots of thoughts on how journalists need to do journalism,” she said. “He does it mainly by stumbling upon the biggest story of the decade, that a sitting president is mentally infirm and ought to be 25th Amendment’ed right out of office, and then burying it, saying absolutely nothing for weeks on end, and then only after that president humiliates himself on the national stage at a Presidential debate, and then refuses to step down as the entire Democrat Party watches its electoral chances up and down the ticket go swirling down the toilet.”\n\n“Finally he decides to write an op-ed in The New York Times saying Joe Biden is not up for the job. That’s not journalism, George — it’s cowardice and naked partisanship,” she continued. “You’re not fooling anyone. So now he’s starring in his Broadway show … by the way, what’s the matter, George? Are the Hollywood roles getting a little hard to come by as you age and get decidedly more smug and self congratulatory? I’m just asking!”\n\nThe actor engendered severe backlash after Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the election, with Democrats squarely placing the blame on him for encouraging former President Joe Biden to drop from the race. Reports later indicated that the actor felt he was being used as a “scapegoat.” Speaking with Jake Tapper of CNN this week, the actor defended his decision once again.\n\n“Well, I don’t know if it was brave,” Clooney told Tapper. “It was a civic duty.”\n\nClooney admitted in his op-ed that he noticed signs of Biden’s cognitive decline prior to his debate with President Trump, when the two met for a fundraiser with former President Barack Obama. For some reason, he did not call for Biden to step down until after he bombed on live television in his first debate with Trump. Clooney told Tapper that he wrote the op-ed to finally tell the truth.\n\n“When I saw people on my side of the street, not telling the truth, I thought that was time,” he said\n\nClooney also admitted that some people are still “mad” at him for writing the op-ed, considering that Vice President Kamala Harris not only lost the Electoral College but also the popular vote to Trump.\n\n“Some people, sure,” he responded. “It’s okay. You know, listen, the idea of freedom of speech, you know, the specific idea of it is, you know – you can’t demand freedom of speech and then say, but don’t say bad things about me. Well, that’s the deal. You have to take a stand if you believe in it, take a stance, stand for it, and then deal with the consequences. That’s the rules.”\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube or Tubi. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.

It eventually became OSF, which has been led by George Soros for decades. In June 2023, he passed the leadership torch to his son, Alex. ALEX SOROS FUMES AT LEFT-WING CLIMATE GROUP OVER 'PALESTINE’ OBSESSION: ‘WHAT THE HELL’ \"In private he is brooding and cerebral and has a propensity for candor and bursts of hot-temperedness,\" the New York Magazine piece, authored by Simon van Zuylen-Wood, says of Alex Soros, who is chair of the board of directors at OSF. \"His halting, Peter Thiel–like baritone is full of ahs and ums, and his sentences can sound like records skipping, as if he were unable to easily put into language what is clear in his mind. This slightly tortured persona has invited comparisons with his elder half-brother Jonathan, who sprang from Harvard Law School and a federal clerkship to work alongside his father in finance and philanthropy.\" Van Zuylen-Wood writes that people, including OSF’s first president, Aryeh Neier, thought that Jonathan Soros, a co-founder and partner of the investment firm, One Madison Group, would be his father’s successor. \"When Soros insiders try to explain the family dynamic, they draw on the standard texts of empire and heredity,\" van Zuylen-Wood says. \"‘Roman is Alex,’ says a former OSF senior official, referring to Roman Roy, the sardonic failson in Succession. ‘Smart but f**king impossible and not particularly interested in the details.’ Another Soros insider cites not HBO but the Gospel of Luke, casting Alex in the role of the Prodigal Son, who is rewarded with his father’s love despite his wayward years.\" During the 2024 presidential campaign, Alex Soros held a fundraiser at his New York City apartment for vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, and posted photos of the event on X. The New York Magazine piece says that Alex Soros \"created a PR headache by posting photos from the event on social media, as is his custom after meeting heads of state and elected officials. (As a former OSF higher-up says, Alex likes to collect \"shiny objects.\").\" The piece points out that Alex Soros' X account is filled with photos of powerful Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Presidents Joe Biden and Bill Clinton, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, the late Pope Francis, and Ukrainian Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak. ALEX SOROS AND HUMA ABEDIN HOLD STAR-STUDDED ENGAGEMENT PARTY AT ANNA WINTOUR’S HOME: PHOTOS Previous reporting from Fox News highlighting a Media Research Center study on Alex Soros, found that he politicized mass shootings, praised Biden’s \"disastrous\" 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, supports abolishing the Electoral College, embraced disparaging claims against conservative Supreme Court Justices and supports decriminalizing \"sex work.\" Since the 2018 elections, Alex Soros has given more than $5 million to federal political coffers, and records show that his largest contribution was $2 million to the Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC during that time. With billions to spend, the New York Magazine profile questions the 39-year-old’s ability to be an effective leader. \"​​Exactly how to push back against the [Trump] madness he leaves unclear,\" van Zuylen-Wood wrote. \"Nor does he offer any coherent agenda for the Democrats, whose roiling, inconclusive debates can seem personified by Alex himself. He was a regular presence at the Biden White House, one-half of an odd power couple, yet few in the broader political universe have a grasp of how he thinks about the world and plans to spend the wealth at his disposal. \"That money could help determine the fate not only of a rudderless Democratic Party but of a country that every day is disappearing legal residents and immigrants, shaking down universities, defying court orders, and otherwise taking aim at the very open society his father’s global philanthropy exists to uphold.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to the Open Society Foundations for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"A New York Magazine profile piece on George Soros&apos; son Alex calls the 39-year-old &quot;exactly the wrong person to lead&quot; his father&apos;s megadonor foundation.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/alex-soros-trashed-difficult-wrong-person-lead-megadonor-foundation-ny-mag-profile","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/931/523/GettyImages-1240878604-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 11:00:16","author":"Rachel Del Guidice","authors":["Rachel Del Guidice"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.092},{"id":314726104,"title":"'Trump has been lying': CNN fact-checker busts president’s 'fictions' about economy","text":"During the 2024 presidential race, Donald Trump hammered then-President Joe Biden and then-Vice President Kamala Harris relentlessly on the economy and blamed them for inflation.

It is very possible that these retail egg prices have come down in April. We'll see when those numbers come out next month, but anybody who has shopped for groceries this month can tell you they're certainly not down 93 percent from Trump's Inauguration Day, because if they were down that much, eggs were currently be selling for less than 38 cents a dozen. they clearly are not.\"\n\nDale added, \"Now, the White House has been pointing to wholesale egg prices. Those prices are way down since trump's inauguration, about 52 percent. That's big. But again, those aren't the prices actually paid by consumers. And of course, 52 percent isn't 87 or 93 percent.\"\n\nThe CNN fact-checker also debunked Trump's claims about gas prices.\n\n\"Gas, eggs and groceries — President Trump has been lying about the price of all of them,\" Dale noted. \"Trump has been trying to play down widespread concerns that his tariffs will fuel inflation.

Now, it's true the president didn't say he was talking about average prices. So you might think, ' Well, maybe he meant there were a bunch of individual gas stations selling $1.98 gas.' That isn't true either. Gas Buddy, a company that tracks tens of thousands of stations nationwide, told me it found zero stations anywhere in the country, selling at even close to $1.98 on either day.

Yet many have come away from the events, which they describe as attended by overwhelmingly middle-aged white people, wondering why more Black protesters haven’t shown up.\n\n“I felt like I was at a Rolling Stones concert. The crowd was virtually all white and mostly older people like myself,” said Cliff Questel, 62, a white resident of the Irving Park neighborhood, after attending the April 5 Hands Off! protest rally and march at downtown’s Daley Plaza.\n\nOn April 19, another large protest rally and march took place in Chicago and other cities, this time as part of the 50501 movement, which stands for “50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement.” While protesters came out for a variety of reasons, the crowd again was overwhelmingly white and middle-aged.\n\n In Chicago, a city of 2.6 million that is 29% Black and 12% interracial, and which 77% voted for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, some pundits have questioned what they see as a lack of a Black presence at the protests. \n\nBlack activists, however, caution against assuming that the Black community isn’t taking action.\n\n“I think there’s a false narrative that because they don’t see us in the street means we aren’t working. That’s not the case,” said Atlanta-based activist LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Votes Matter and board member at the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation.\n\nChannyn Lynne Parker, CEO of the Brave Space Alliance, a Hyde Park-based Black and trans-led LGBTQ center, has attended three anti-Trump events in the last couple of months and agreed that the crowds were mostly white.\n\nBut like Brown, Parker said that just because Black people haven’t been marching en masse does not mean they aren’t taking action to fight the Trump administration.\n\n“I think it’s a part of strategy,” Parker said. “Our resistance doesn’t always look like marching downtown. Right now you’ll find us leading mutual aid drives, building community defense hubs or running voter outreach. I think that’s where our strategies have gone, more so than doing the very virtuous work of the actual protests and marches.”\n\n While anecdotal evidence suggests lower Black participation at the rallies against Trump, there has been protest action by Black people.\n\nActivist Ja’Mal Green, who has waged unsuccessful bids for Chicago mayor, says the focus of many in the Black community has shifted to addressing economic issues.\n\n“For many years Black people have focused on social justice and not enough on economics. Right now is the time where folks are talking about how to build sustainable businesses and communities so that when things like a Trump era happens, where things can be pulled away from us — we are able to sustain ourselves,” Green said.\n\n Several Black-led groups launched a boycott of Target after the Minneapolis-based retailer announced on Jan. 24 that it was ending a program it started after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 aimed at helping Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers, and promote Black-owned businesses.\n\nTarget stock has plummeted since earlier this year, before the first boycott against the retailer. On Jan. 31, shares closed at $137.91. On April 16, they were at $90.46, down 34.4%, which suggests that Black people have not been sitting on the sidelines in the fight against Trump and his policies, according to Tamar Manasseh, the founder of Mothers Against Senseless Killings (MASK), an organization she founded in 2016 in response to a murder in Englewood.\n\n “Spend in the Black,” an event billed as a collective protest against the corporate retreats from diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), took place at 75th and King Drive on April 19. Organized by the Rev. Charlie Dates, pastor of Progressive Baptist and Salem Baptist Churches and Ald. William Hall, (6th), the event featured more than 100 Black-owned businesses and was attended by Mayor Brandon Johnson and several hundred residents.\n\n“African Americans are focused on solutions and not the distractions of Donald Trump,” Hall said. “When we are ready to organize a mass march in collaboration with others, you will see that, but right now our focus is sustained on our communities and bettering the lives of Black people.” \n\nOne Black Chicagoan who was at the 50501 protest April 19, John Lofton, 38, said while he was not surprised at the low turnout from the Black community, some may be staying away because of fear of being targeted by police if the protests get rowdy.\n\n“I can’t speak for everyone but they also know if they show up, there will be people who try to incite arrests,” Lofton said while at the protest. “You’ll notice there’s not an increased police presence here. That’s a direct correlation.”\n\nThe fear of being targeted is one of the reasons some Black influencers on TikTok have also advised Black people not to take part in the mass events, according to Black media outlet, The Root.\n\nIt was a call on TikTok for Black people to stay away from the protests that kept members of Chicago Activist Coalition for Justice away, according to group founder Rabbi Michael Ben Yosef. \n\n“There was a push on TikTok for Blacks not to participate because we did our part to get (Trump) out. Now, we’re like this is your fight, we don’t want to do anything,” Yosef said. \n\nMike Miccioli, a University of Chicago graduate student and a member of Students for Justice in Palestine, said many of the younger protesters who took part in the protests for Palestinian causes on campuses aren’t participating in the larger events against Trump because of ideological differences.\n\n“The Hands Off event on April 5 was more aligned with the Democratic Party. For example, one of their demands on their website said hands off NATO. NATO of course is a U.S.-backed military alliance that projects U.S. imperial power across the globe and SPJ would never support a demand of maintaining the NATO alliance,” Miccioli said.\n\nHe added that there was a small contingent protesting for Palestinian rights at the 50501 event on April 19 because there was no mention of NATO at that event. \n\nJames Johnson, 73, a Black retired attorney at the 50501 protest, said he thinks younger people may be staying away from recent protests because they have yet to feel any impact from Trump’s policies on their lives.\n\n“Once they feel a negative impact, they will probably come out,” Johnson said.\n\n Brown says the fact that white people are protesting against Trump is a positive development.\n\n“I think it’s a good thing that we’re seeing older, white people take a stand,” Brown said. “We’ve been leading on that front, but America is not our problem to solve.”\n\nWhile Black people may be choosing alternate methods of protests against Trump for now, Johnson said he expects traditional protests against Trump to grow in frequency and size, and expects more people of all races on both sides of the aisle to grow frustrated with the president’s policies.\n\n“When these events start to be nonpartisan,” Johnson said, “that’s when they will be interesting.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/04/25/anti-donald-trump-protests-black-participation","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2a1420/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5975x3411+0+286/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2Fde%2Fb697ce174724a6370decebcbcf17%2Ftrum","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 10:30:00","author":"Bob Chiarito | For the Sun-Times","authors":["Bob Chiarito | For the Sun-Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":314740654,"title":"More say US should bring back Abrego Garcia, mixed on other deportation issues: POLL","text":"Americans hold mixed views on President Donald Trump's immigration policies, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.\n\nVoters are divided on sending migrants living in the United States lacking legal status who are accused of gang membership to an El Salvador prison without a court hearing but mainly oppose deporting international students who criticize U.S. policy in the Middle East, according to the poll.\n\nIn the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant who was deported to El Salvador despite a court order prohibiting it, more respondents said he should be returned to the U.S. rather than remain imprisoned in El Salvador, 42-26%. There's room for movement; 3 in 10 in an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released Friday said they don't know enough about the case to say.\n\nOverall, 46% said they approve of the way Trump is handling immigration, while 53% said they disapprove. On one hand, that's a 4-point drop in approval from a Washington Post/Ipsos poll in February. On the other, it's Trump's best rating across seven issues tested in this survey, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos.\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\nThere's about an even division, moreover, on Trump's efforts to deport undocumented immigrants in general. Forty-eight percent said Trump is \"going too far\" in this regard, while 50% said he's either handling it about right (34%) or not going far enough (16%).\n\nThere's also a close split on the deportation of suspected gang members to an El Salvador prison without a court hearing: Forty-seven percent said they support this action, while 51% said they opposed.\n\nThat result underscores animosity toward undocumented immigrants, as seen in contrast to views on deporting international students who have criticized U.S. policy in the Middle East: In this case, support for deportation drops to 39%, with 59% opposed.\n\nPartisanship is a strong factor.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 Republicans said they approve of Trump's handling of immigration, while 1 in 10 Democrats said they approved. Among independents, 45% said they approve.\n\nTrump also wins approval on immigration from 93% of his 2024 voters, compared with 8% of those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, he falls well short among those who didn't vote for president in the 2024 elections, who disapprove of Trump on immigration by 59%-40%.\n\nIn another broad partisan gap, 85% of Democrats said they think Trump is \"going too far\" with deportations. Sixty percent of Republicans said they think he's handling this about right -- and 27% said he's not going far enough. Independents again fall in between.\n\nRepublicans' attitudes are not monolithic. Eighty-two percent said they support sending suspected gang members to a prison in El Salvador without court hearings. Fewer, but still 70%, said they support deporting international college students who are critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Fewer still, 53%, said Abrego Garcia should remain in El Salvador, though just 14% said they favor his return, with the rest unsure.\n\nHispanic people said they disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration overall, by 67%-32%. Men divided about evenly on the issue, while most women said they disapprove, 58%-41%. Approval on the issue ranges from 65% of people in rural areas to 45% in suburbs and 36% in cities, with sizable rural and suburban gender gaps.\n\nAnd there's a gap by age: Fifty-nine percent of those younger than 40 said disapprove of Trump on immigration, while 48% of those age 50 and older said they disapprove.\n\nMethodology: This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® April 18-22, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,464 adults.

Look to Latin America | Greg Grandin","text":"Inspiration on how to beat back authoritarianism is in short supply, but those searching for hope in these dark times might consider Latin America.\n\nIt’s not the first place that comes to mind when thinking about democracy, associated as it is with coups, death squads, dictatorships, inequality, drug violence and now a country, El Salvador, offering itself up to Donald Trump as an offshore prison colony for deportees.\n\nIt is a bleak place in many ways, especially for the jobless and the poor who flee their home countries in search of a better life somewhere else, often in the United States. The bleakness, though, only highlights the paradox: for all its maladies, for all its rightwing dictators and leftwing caudillos, for all its failings when it comes to democratic institutions, the region’s democratic spirit is surprisingly vital.\n\nOther areas of the world emerged broken from the cold war, roiled by resource conflicts, religious fundamentalism and ethnic hatreds. Think of the bloody Balkans of the 1990s or 1994’s Rwandan genocide.\n\nNot Latin America, where, by the time the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, most of its anti-communist dictatorships had given way to constitutional rule. With the jackboot off their necks, reformers went on the offensive, seeking to redeem not just democracy but social democracy.\n\nToday, in the United States at least, the concept of democracy is generally defined minimally, as comprising regularly held elections, a commitment to due process to protect individual rights, and institutional stability. But earlier, in the middle of the last century, a more robust vision that included economic rights prevailed – that indeed the second world war was fought not just against fascism but for social democracy. “Necessitous men are not free men,” Franklin Delano Roosevelt liked to say. Reporting from Europe in late 1945, William Shirer described a groundswell demand for social democracy, in an article headlined: Germany is finished, communists distrusted, majority wants socialism.\n\nLatin America joined in the demand, and by 1945 nearly every country understood citizenship as entailing both individual and social rights. Latin Americans broadened classical liberalism’s “right to life” to mean a right to a healthy life, which obligated the state to provide healthcare. “Democracy, political as well as social and economic,” wrote Hernán Santa Cruz, a childhood friend of Salvador Allende and a Chilean UN delegate who helped Eleanor Roosevelt draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “comprises, in my mind, an indivisible whole”.\n\nThat whole was shattered to pieces by the death-squad terror of the cold war, much of it patronized by Washington, followed by the free-market neoliberal economics pushed on Latin America during that war.\n\nYet once the repression abated and citizens were free to vote their preference, they began to elect social democrats as presidents, men and women who represented a variety of historical social movements: feminists, trade unionists, peasant organizers, Indigenous rights campaigners, heterodox economists, environmentalists and liberation theologians. Today, a large majority of Latin Americans live in countries governed by the center left. Despite the best efforts of Friedrich von Hayek and his libertarian followers in the region to convince them otherwise, most Latin Americans do not believe that welfare turns citizens into serfs.\n\nPankaj Mishra, in his survey of the horrors inflicted on Palestinians, has written about the “profound rupture” in the “moral history of the world” since 1945. No region has done more to heal that rupture than Latin America.\n\nAnd no region has had as much experience beating back fascists, long after the second world had ended, than Latin America. Rightwing authoritarians, gripped by the same obsessions that move Trump supporters in the United States, have some momentum, though they haven’t been able to escalate occasional electoral victories, including in Argentina and Ecuador, into a full-on continental kulturkampf.\n\nCenter-left democrats hold the right at bay by putting forth an expansive social-democratic agenda, one flexible enough to include demands for sexual and racial equality. As the US rolls back abortion rights, momentum in Latin America moves in the other direction – Argentina, Mexico and Colombia either decriminalizing or legalizing abortion. Gay marriage and same-sex civil unions have been recognized in 11 countries.\n\nSpasms of ethnonationalist rage gripped much of the world the 1990s – Indonesia’s 1998 anti-Chinese rampage, for example. In contrast, Indigenous peoples in countries including Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Guatemala burst into politics as the best bearers of the social democratic tradition, adding environmentalism and cultural rights to the standard menu of economic demands. Today, many countries have retreated behind an aggrieved nationalism. For the most part, Latin Americans have not. Their reaction to the depredations of corporate globalization is rarely expressed in xenophobic, antisemitic or conspiratorial tropes, as a struggle against “globalists”. Nationalism in Latin America has long been understood as a gateway to universalism.\n\nFrontline activists stand unbowed before police batons and paramilitary guns. In 2022, Latin America clocked the world’s highest murder rate of environmental activists. Unionists, students, journalists, and women’s and peasant rights activists are assassinated at a regular clip. Yet organizing continues. In Brazil during the four-year presidency of the Trump-like Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2023), the Landless Workers’ Movement, already the largest social movement in the world, grew even larger.\n\nWhen it comes to interstate relations, Latin America is one of the most peaceful regions. There is no nuclear competition, thanks to one of the most successful arms control treaties in history, the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nIn 1945, Latin American diplomats drew on their long history in opposing Washington’s interventionism to play a key role in founding the liberal multilateral order, the global system of governance now upended by Trump. Most importantly, the region’s leaders insisted that nations should be organized around the premise of cooperation, not competition, that diplomacy should be used to settle differences, and that war should be a last resort. Their post-cold war counterparts have loudly defended these principles, first against George W Bush during the war on terror, and more recently against Joe Biden and Trump, insisting that the art of diplomacy must be relearned. “Brazil has no enemies,” the country’s defense minister once said, notable considering that the Pentagon has marked out the entire globe as a battlefield.\n\nBrazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, among others, have criticized the return to power politics and balance-of-power diplomacy. If the past teaches anything, they say, it is that opening a belligerent multi-front balance of power – with the United States pushing against China, pushing against Russia, with all countries, everywhere, angling for dominance – will lead to more confrontation, more war. As with the United States’s shapeshifting, amorphous domestic culture war, there is no clear endgame to this new era of militarized economic competition, of war by proxy and privateer, which only increases the odds of conflict spinning out of control.\n\nOne need not romanticize Latin America. To recognize the strength of the social democratic ideal in Latin America does not require one to celebrate all those who call themselves socialists, in Nicaragua and Venezuela, for example. And even those we might celebrate, such as Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum or Chile’s Gabriel Boric, preside over states loaded with significant amount of repressive power, often directed at some of their country’s most vulnerable, such as Mapuche activists in southern Chile.\n\nBut there is no other region of the world that so persistently continues to insist on taking the Enlightenment at its word, whose leftwing politicians and social movements win by advancing a program of universal humanism. Trump has transformed the United States government into a predator-state, a tormenter of citizens and non-citizens alike. Latin American social democrats – Lula in Brazil and Mexico’s Sheinbaum, Uruguay’s Yamandú Orsi, and Petro in Colombia, among others – do what they can to use state power to fulfill an obligation: the ideal that all people should live in dignity.\n\nThe forcefulness in which Latin American leaders such as Lula and Sheinbaum defend social rights contrasts with the timidity of the Democratic party. Biden did pass legislation suggesting it was breaking with the old neoliberal order. But Biden’s team couldn’t find its voice, unable to link a reinvestment in national industry with a renewed commitment to social citizenship. Democrats are shrill in denouncing Trump’s extremism even as they are timid in offering an alternative.\n\nConfronted with a existential crisis that people feel in their bones, the Democratic party puts forth weak-tea fixes in an enervating technocratic jargon, its counselors saying the lesson of Kamala Harris’s loss is that the party has to think even smaller, has to shake off its activist constituencies and move to the center.\n\nA recent op-ed in the New York Times urged Democrats to lay out their own Project 2029, to counter the conservative thinktank Heritage Foundation’s influential Project 2025. What did the author of the op-ed believe should be in this new project? A call for national healthcare? No. Affordable housing? No. Paid vacations, universal childcare or an increase in the minimum wage? None of that. He suggested that the Democrats promise to streamline regulations and improve “the quality” of “customer-service interactions”.\n\nWoodrow Wilson imagined a world without war. FDR imagined a world without fear or want. Today’s would-be governing liberals in the United States imagine noting. They treat the promise of a humane future – or of any future at all – like a weight from the past, hard to bear, easy to toss aside.\n\nDemocrats in the United States can’t simply mimic social democrats in Latin America; they operate in vastly different political contexts. But Latin America is a useful mirror, reflecting the considerable distance Democrats in the US have drifted from New Deal values. They might want to read Roosevelt’s Faith of the Americas speech, where he said that the best way to defuse extremism was to use government action to ensure “a more abundant life to the peoples of the whole world”.\n\nLatin America social democrats today – and not the Democratic party in the United States – are the true heirs of FDR’s vision. They know that if democracy is to be something more than a heraldic device, it must confront entrenched power. Latin American reformers know that the way to beat today’s new fascists is the same as it was in the 1930s and 1940s: by welding liberalism to a forceful agenda of social rights, by promising, in a voice simple, clear and sure, to improve the material conditions of people’s lives.\n\n“People have to have hope again,” as Lula put it in his most recent successful run for re-election, “and a full belly, with morning coffee and lunch and dinner”.\n\nWhat’s giving me hope now\n\nWhat gives me hope is that in a place like Latin America, where the forces of reaction are so fierce, social movements led by feminists, peasants, first peoples, and gay and trans activists continue to fight back against fierce repression with enormous courage. Political theorists like to measure “democracy” according to institutional stability and free elections, and by that standard, many places in Latin America come up short. But if we measure democracy by courage, by a tenacity to continue to fight for universal, humane values, for a more sustainable, more equal, more human world, then Latin America carries forward the democratic ideal.\n\n Greg Grandin, the C Vann Woodward professor of history at Yale, is the author of a number of prize-winning books, including The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America, which won the Pulitzer prize for non-fiction","summary":"The region has grappled with dictatorships, coups and inequality.

They were his picks, after all.\n\nAnd another candidate to be shown the door, Howard Lutnick, is an old-school billionaire who worships Trump, and they went back a long way. Sycophancy will do that.\n\nBut the tech titans who lined up alongside the president at his inauguration on January 20 are newcomers to the party. And this week they found out the hard way what that means.\n\nWhen ratings begin to fall, every reality show veteran knows what comes next. Heads must fall. Theirs.\n\nElon Musk and his Silicon Valley friends had been good value for the president, but the time had come to pay the price.\n\nThat price has already been heavy for the wealthiest men on the planet. Earlier this month, it was estimated that the companies launched or run by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had lost a total of $1.8 trillion since before they lined up behind the president at his inauguration.\n\nThe imposition of whopping tariffs on China and the threats of punitive levies being resumed on other Asian countries have taxed the supply lines of the tech giants perhaps more than any other business. No favors there, then.\n\nTrump needed the tech tycoons when his election campaign was trailing way behind Kamala Harris in fundraising, when he was raising a record amount of cash for his inauguration, and when he was enjoying the courtship of this new band of financial buccaneers.\n\nBut this week it became clear that they have jumped the shark. Even the irrepressible Musk.\n\nThe world’s richest man already had a foot out of the door after enjoying unprecedented access to the White House—and the entire federal system—with his Tesla brand suffering both financially and in popularity because of his controversial work with the Department of Government Efficiency and his close relationship with the president. \n\nTesla’s disastrous quarterly results this week were a clear signal that the Musk rocket ship was no longer going up and that there might not be giant chopsticks to catch it.\n\nMusk wasn’t so popular in MAGA world, either, clashing with the likes of conservative rabble–rouser Steve Bannon, and allegedly arguing with Rubio and Bessent in the White House. \n\nMusk was slowly phased out of the spotlight after being ever-present in the White House; on Wednesday Trump referred to him in the past tense. “He was a tremendous help, both in the campaign and in what he’s done with DOGE,” Trump said from the Resolute Desk. “He really helped the country. Saved us a lot of money.” Musk, however, did not save money; by Bloomberg’s calculus, his net worth has gone from $450 billion to hovering around $300 billion.\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s approach to Trump seemed clearer. He was worried enough about the future of his Meta company to cosy up to Trump to try to prevent it breaking up under the pressure of a federal antitrust case. He hoped that Trump would intervene and dismiss charges that the accumulation of Instagram and WhatsApp was part of a monopoly power grab.\n\nTrump was happy to take $1 million from Zuckerberg for his inauguration fund. But he left the Facebook founder to fend for himself in court. \n\nThe fate of Meta is still in the balance, and Zuckerberg could yet beat the charges, but it won’t be any thanks to Trump.\n\nIn the same E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, D.C., Sundar Pichar’s Google is also mired in a long antitrust battle with the Department of Justice. Pichar was at the inauguration, and Google kicked in another $1 million for the event. The court battle is expected to last longer than Trump.\n\nAs for Jeff Bezos, he wreaked havoc on the independent reputation of the Washington Post by denying his editors the age-old tradition of endorsing a presidential nominee and by overhauling the newspaper’s opinion pages to exclude opposing viewpoints. \n\nHe also paid $1 million for Trump’s inauguration and visited Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe joke went that he was then stolen from the front door of the Palm Beach mansion. It is certainly the case that he’s been largely absent from the Washington scene since Trump got to work. A neighbor told Politico that he only spends four or five days a year at his converted $23 million museum home in DC’s plushest suburb over the past year.\n\nApple boss Tim Cook is credited with playing Trump most effectively. But he had to pledge a $500 billion manufacturing investment, and Apple’s stocks fell with everyone else’s in the stock market chaos.\n\nThere’s no longer a procession of earnest men in turtlenecks or t-shirts making their way to the White House or Mar-a-Lago. \n\nThey tried to save their companies. Now they need to rescue their dignity.\n\nStill, Trump will have no shortage of friends telling him what he wants to hear.\n\nThis show’s over. But the new season is going to run and run.","summary":"Getty ImagesThe TV producer in Donald Trump would have told him it was time to fire somebody.\n\nBut this week, after a breathtaking start to his presidency, the turmoil in the money markets has stalled progress, and the polls have turned against him in the one measure he cared about the most: the economy.\n\nHe can’t—right now—fire Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, his Wall Street whisperer who has calmed jittery investors.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-94-day-humbling-of-elon-musk-and-the-tech-titans/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/ZELG6MNQIVCBLDAYXHO743NDEE.gif?smart=true&auth=79a93d8b8293e392806d7bb9d67ae0c85ca0e971c11fae3290f9d477f777b8f2&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 10:00:01","author":"David Gardner","authors":["David Gardner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":314704078,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: How George and Amal Clooney Are 'Careering Toward' a $ 500Million Divorce Crisis","text":"George Clooney may be careening toward a $500 million divorce after wife Amal skipped his much-heralded Broadway debut, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe human rights attorney, 47, was a no-show for her man's big moment in Good Night, and Good Luck on New York City's Great White Way.\"Everyone expected her to be there for his first night.

Beyond Pritzker and Newsom, other possible contenders include Govs. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), Josh Shapiro (D-PA), Wes Moore (D-MD), Tim Walz (D-MN), and Andy Beshear (D-KY), as well as former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nAmong these contenders, Pritzker and Newsom have captured headlines for their contrasting approaches to Trump. Pritzker has positioned himself as a leading critic, implementing bold policies and making high-profile appearances to challenge Trump’s agenda. In contrast, Newsom has adopted a more conciliatory tone, engaging with Trump-aligned voices and signaling a willingness to find common ground.\n\n“I think it plays to larger strategies that perhaps both governors are looking at. If it’s a base election, then Pritzker’s all-out resistance to Trump might be the more successful strategy, which is what he may be banking on,” said Robin Johnson, an adjunct professor at Monmouth College.\n\n“I think Newsom is looking more at perhaps reaching voters in the middle, depending on how big a pool of independent voters there may be in 2028. It’s really just rolling the dice at this point,” he added.\n\nPritzker is working to expand his reach beyond Illinois, headlining major Democratic fundraisers in key states such as New Hampshire and Michigan. Through his nonprofit group, Think Big America, he’s funneled money into progressive ballot measures,including abortion access initiatives in nine states, with wins in seven so far. \n\nAn heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, Pritzker has poured millions of dollars into Democratic causes nationwide, including a $1.5 million contribution to the winning liberal candidate in Wisconsin’s high-profile Supreme Court race. \n\nAs governor, he’s become a leading figure in the party’s resistance to Trump, leveraging both policy and rhetoric to challenge the administration. He recently ordered a review of Illinois’s financial ties with El Salvador over the controversial deportation of an illegal migrant, opening the door to a potential boycott, and paused a major federal infrastructure project over concerns tied to Trump-era funding. He’s also sharply criticized what he views as threats to constitutional norms, further cementing his role in the national Democratic pushback.\n\n“I think Pritzker sees himself perhaps filling that lane of being the resistance lane – being a way to get ahead of other potential challengers in advance of the shaping of the presidential primary,” Johnson explained. \n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Pritzker positioned himself as a vocal member of the Democratic opposition. He expanded abortion access in Illinois in 2019, presenting it as a counter to federal efforts to restrict abortion access. Pritzker also limited cooperation with ICE by declaring Illinois a “welcoming state” and frequently clashed with the Trump administration during the COVID-19 crisis, accusing it of spreading misinformation. \n\n“Pritzker is willing to stand alone, and that’s not an easy thing to do right now. He’s shown he’s willing to do it,” said Michael Hardaway, a political strategist who advises business leaders and politicians.\n\n“I think that’s also combined with the idea that he probably sees an opportunity in the White House in three years. He’s positioning himself, which is a smart thing to do, because it’s wide open,” Hardaway added.\n\nAfter Trump’s 2024 victory, Newsom initially struck a defiant tone, calling a special legislative session to “Trump-proof” the state and by allocating funds for legal challenges against anticipated federal policies. He also traveled to the nation’s capital to meet with lawmakers and former President Joe Biden, aiming to secure support for California’s priorities.\n\nBut his posture has shifted in 2025. Amid devastating wildfires, Newsom met with Trump in Los Angeles, praised the administration’s disaster response, and described the talks as “productive.”\n\nThe California governor has also launched a podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, where he interviewed conservative figures such as Steve Bannon, Charlie Kirk, and Michael Savage, framing it as an attempt to better understand the MAGA movement. His ex-wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a key Trump ally, has reportedly helped book some of the guests.\n\nHe drew backlash from LGBT advocates and fellow Democrats after calling biological males’ participation in girls’ sports “deeply unfair” during a podcast appearance, prompting accusations of echoing Republican rhetoric.\n\n“He’s doing this little canoe ride of pedal on the left pedal on the right and trying not to put the funds at risk for the state, but also trying to show to Democrats that he’s standing up to him,” said Steve Maviglio, a Democratic strategist based in California. \n\nMaviglio believes Newsom’s effort to find middle ground with Trump and his supporters may benefit the state, but politically, it risks alienating Democratic primary voters who are firmly anti-Trump. \n\n“Democrats, active Democrats who vote in presidential primaries are vehemently anti-Trump and to show any kind of common ground with his supporters and him is shooting yourself in the foot when it comes to politics,” he said. “It’s not good Democratic politics to show any kind of love for Trump.” \n\n“Anything you say and do will be used against you,” he added. “So, you know, political opponents might highlight the cooperation part when running against Newsom, if it’s Pritzker or AOC, or whoever it might be, saying, ‘I stood up to Trump, I didn’t try to play footsie with him’.”\n\nNewsom appears to be playing a long game—prioritizing a strategy aimed at broad general election appeal, even if it risks complicating his path through a Democratic primary. \n\n“There’s winning the primaries and then winning the generals. And I think Newsom is looking ahead, perhaps thinking that his strategy may be better to win a general election if he can get through the primary,” Johnson said.\n\nWith the 2028 race still a long way off, Democrats are still experimenting with their messaging, and strategists say it’s too early to know which approach will resonate — or who, ultimately, will break through.\n\n“The reality is, this next election, like the last one, will be decided by a thin sliver of voters in seven states, and the key will be, where are those voters going to be and what’s the best way to reach them?” Johnson asked rhetorically. \n\nNEWSOM SLAMS DEMOCRATS FOR NOT DOING AUTOPSY OF WHAT ‘WENT WRONG’ IN 2024 ELECTION\n\nJon Reinish, a Democratic strategist based in New York, said the party can’t rely on anti-Trump messaging alone, warning that voters want to hear clear solutions—not just criticism—especially with Trump no longer on the ballot in 2028.\n\n“Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris’s messaging was regarded as very anti-Trump. How’d they do? The criticism of Democrats has long been that they’re solely anti-Trump or anti-Republican – but we’ve heard so many times, ‘we know what you’re against, but what are you for?’ – they’ll need, finally, to address that,” Reinish said.\n\nMarisa Schultz contributed to this report.","summary":"As Democrats scramble to counter President Donald Trump’s tightening grip on power, Gov.

A decade from now, Mansour predicts that if his company’s current trajectory continues, it could be one of the largest financial markets on the planet.\n\n“And I think prediction markets would rival the stock market in terms of engagement, activity, volume, and so on,” he said.\n\nPrediction markets such as Kalshi began getting big attention during the 2024 elections, during which President Donald Trump bested then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Many pollsters predicted that Harris had the edge or that it would be an exceedingly close contest, with some calling the race a coin flip.\n\nKalshi users, on the other hand, were implying notably higher odds of a Trump win than many pollsters were. And the prediction became reality after Trump strongly overperformed, secured a decisive victory, and won every major swing state.\n\n“The election was a slap in the face, because people saw there was a big spread. Like we were saying 62, 63%, but the polls were saying 50-50, that it was much, much closer,” Mansour said.\n\nThe idea behind Kalshi and other prediction markets is relatively simple: Users can buy shares in possible outcomes for various events. Using the example of the presidential race, one share on that market would represent a “yes” for Trump winning, and another a “no.” The price of a yes share goes up when more people buy it, so the expected odds of that outcome happening rise as well. If a yes share in that market was worth 60 cents, it implies a 60% chance that Trump would win, for instance.\n\nWhen the event happens, the shares for the correct outcome, say Trump winning, pay out at $1 each, while incorrect shares become worthless. So, users could pay 60 cents per share and then make a 40-cent profit if they are correct.\n\nThe idea behind Kalshi was sort of a reaction to the shortcomings of traditional markets. Mansour started Kalshi in 2018 alongside co-founder Luana Lopes Lara, whom he met while attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMansour said that while interning at Goldman Sachs in 2016, he noticed a lot of interest in getting exposure to events.\n\n“So it wasn’t like, ‘Hey, I think this stock is mispriced, or this option, I want to trade it in a certain way,’ it was like, ‘I want to get exposure to Brexit or hedge against Brexit, I want to get exposure to Trump winning the election, or hedge against Trump winning the election,’” Mansour said.\n\nTo deliver exposure on events such as those, Mansour explained, the firm would structure bundles and advise clients to buy certain sets of options or stocks that should move with the desired position.\n\nBut those bundles were merely proxies for the events. He said that one way people were betting on a Trump victory was by taking on a complicated options structure to short the S&P 500 — betting that if Trump, who was not expected to win, ended up beating Harris, the stock market would drop and those investors would make money.\n\n“The problem was like, Trump won, so a lot of these people were right about the bet they wanted to take, but they lost money because the S&P actually rallied when Trump won,” Mansour said, pointing out that often with events such as elections, it isn’t always clear what the market reaction will be.\n\nMansour said that sparked the interest in building Kalshi.\n\n“What if you build a financial market where the underlying is an event? There’s a simple question about the future,” he said. “It’s not a stock, it’s not a bond, it’s not like a currency or a commodity. It’s actually just a simple question about the future that has economic or social utility.”\n\nSo Mansour and Lopes Lara decided to create Kalshi. In 2019, Kalshi joined the Y Combinator, a venture capital firm and startup accelerator, and launched a beta version of the platform. Then, in 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued the company regulatory approval, making it the first fully regulated financial exchange for event contracts.\n\nBut when the company tried to list a market on the election, regulators stepped in and blocked it. So, Mansour said Kalshi made the “difficult decision” to sue the CFTC. Kalshi ended up winning that lawsuit last year, just a few months ahead of the 2024 elections.\n\nThe victory lined Kalshi up to become a closely watched gauge of election-year politics. Mansour said some 500 million unique visitors were checking Kalshi’s website on the day of the election.\n\n“So 500 million people came to Kalshi on Election Day, like 7% of the world population,” Mansour said. “It was huge.”\n\nAnd the attention that Kalshi and other prediction markets received was in part because of their accuracy. While Mansour said Kalshi is not a crystal ball, it’s as close as it gets to one. That is because the people making predictions on the platform are doing so with the weight of their wallets.\n\n“When you’re putting money behind your opinion or your view, you don’t lie,” he said. “People just don’t lie when it comes to money. Whereas in polls, people get asked and … sometimes they say whatever, sometimes they lie.”\n\n“Markets provide skin in the game to be truthful,” he added.\n\nAnd since the election, Kalshi has been growing. For instance, this year, Kalshi launched sports event contracts. Right now, the company has about 55 or 60 employees, but Mansour expects that number will grow to 100 by the end of the year.\n\nVisitors to the Kalshi website are greeted with a menu of questions that they can put money on, such as who the Democratic presidential nominee will be in 2028, whether Jerome Powell will still be chairman of the Federal Reserve by the end of the year, and what the musical genre of Beyonce’s next album might be.\n\nTRILLIONS IN SPENDING CUTS? WHAT TO KNOW AS GOP STARTS WRITING HUGE TAX BILL\n\nMansour said the company will continue to grow to new heights in the coming years.\n\n“We’ve kind of experienced close to unprecedented growth in any financial market that has been built in the U.S.,” Mansour said. “And I would say we’ve gone pretty mainstream now, it’s become sort of a reasonably known household brand.”","summary":"The CEO of Kalshi has a grand vision for the future of his company and the once-niche prediction market space, which exploded in popularity during last year’s elections.

After reclaiming the White House with a 2024 election win, following his first term that began in 2016, he became only the second president in U.S. history to serve nonconsecutive terms. Under the Constitution, this second term is expected to be his last.\n\nBut the 78-year-old hasn’t ruled out the idea of a third. In a March 30 interview with NBC News, Trump said, “A lot of people want me to do it.” When asked directly if he’d consider running again, he responded, “I like working. I’m not joking.”\n\nJust weeks later, on April 24, his team began selling “Trump 2028” hats—$50 red caps boldly embroidered with the year—on the Trump Store website, encouraging supporters to “make a statement.”\n\nFind out below if it’s possible for Trump to run again in 2028.\n\nCan Trump Serve a 3rd Term?\n\nEarlier, in January 2025, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow President Trump to serve a third term. Ogles’ proposed amendment states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nThe 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits a president to two terms in office, including non-consecutive terms. As a result, the next four years should be the final time Trump can hold the nation’s highest office.\n\nAccording to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, George Washington, the first U.S. president, set the precedent by stepping down after two terms. This unofficial limit was observed by every president after Washington, until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms from 1932 to 1944.\n\nIn response to Roosevelt’s unprecedented tenure, a proposal to limit presidents to two terms was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1947, two years after his death. After revisions by the Senate, the amendment was approved and ratified by the states on February 27, 1951.\n\nIn March 2025, when asked if he had been presented with plans to seek a third term, Trump said, “There are methods which you could do it.” One method mentioned was for Vice President JD Vance to run for office and then pass the role to Trump.\n\nIs Trump Planning for a Third Term or More?\n\nBefore Election Day, Trump stated he wouldn’t run again in 2028 if he lost in the 2024 race. In an interview with Sinclair Media Group, he was asked if he could envision another run if he lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris. “No, I don’t. I think… that will be it,” Trump said. “I don’t see that at all.” He added, “But hopefully, we’re going to be very successful.”\n\nSince then, Trump has made several remarks about term limits and his time in office since being elected for a second term. It was unclear whether he was speaking seriously, but in March 2025, he clarified that he was not joking. When asked if he wanted another term during a phone interview with NBC, Trump responded, “I like working. I’m not joking.”\n\nIn July 2024, he told attendees at a conservative Christian event that they wouldn’t “have to vote anymore” if he was elected to office in 2024. “Christians, get out and vote. Just this time,” he said during a speech at the Believers’ Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action. “You won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It’ll be fixed. It’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.”","summary":"Image Credit: POOL/AFP via Getty Images Donald Trump is now serving as the 47th President of the United States.

Bush.\n\nTo understand the obstacles the Democrats face in the future, we have to see how they got here. How did victory escape them in 2024?\n\nHarris greatly benefited from a press corps that appeared rejuvenated after her ascension to the nomination following a party revolt against then-President Joe Biden. It took one debate for Democrats to reckon with their duplicity in assuring the public that Biden was perfectly fine and not suffering from the impact of trying to run the country and a presidential campaign at 81 years old.\n\nThe “joy” factor was off the charts, as evidenced by the headlines of news outlets that often read like press releases, and the money poured in fast, reaching $1 billion by early October. Unlike Biden, Harris got under Trump’s skin in their one debate, with Trump at one point yelling, “They’re eating the dogs! They’re eating the cats!” It was a reference to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. It became a viral social media meme, with some creators setting it to music.\n\nHarris made one significant miscalculation that, while not necessarily costing her the election, revealed how much pull the progressive Left has on the Democratic Party. There was ample reason for Harris to choose Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) as her running mate. Shapiro, a centrist within the contours of the modern Democratic Party, was the sitting governor of a crucial battleground state, where he had also been attorney general and was previously in the state legislature.\n\nHe’s also Jewish. And while no Democrat will admit that it was a factor in why he was passed over, it defies all common sense and logic to deny it. The conflict in Gaza over Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, became a source of conflict within the Democratic Party, with a sizable portion of elected officials and party activists protesting against Israel despite the slaughter of more than 1,000 innocent people.\n\nInstead, Harris chose Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), the 60-year-old (who looked closer to 70) progressive who immediately faced scrutiny for a resume padded like that of a desperate college graduate looking for their first job. Democratic pundits and talking heads thought Walz was a brilliant choice since he hunted and wore flannel shirts. Surely, he’d connect with working-class voters. The façade did not hold.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem for any Democrat who wants to run in 2028. It is not clear that in the Trump era, Democrats who have tried to move to the center will appeal to the party’s base. But most voters reject the ideology of the progressive Left that hyperfocuses on divisive issues it thinks have broad appeal. Whether it is anti-Israel activism, transgenderism and gender identity, racial intersectionality, abortion, or immigration, their stances are far outside the mainstream of the electorate. Anyone looking to get the 2028 nomination must walk a fine line.\n\nEnter Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). If there were ever a politician who better defined ambition and the ability to sidestep his or her own blundering, one would be hard-pressed to name him or her. Newsom is the personification of the Peter principle, a theory that says people will rise until they reach their level of incompetence. Newsom’s first foray into politics was volunteering for Willie Brown’s run for San Francisco mayor. Newsom’s reward following Brown’s win was an appointment to the Parking and Traffic Commission, which he later chaired. That was followed by being the San Francisco mayor, lieutenant governor, and then governor.\n\nAn example of the extent of Newsom’s singular focus on his political future is that he launched a new podcast while many residents in Los Angeles were sifting through the ashes of their homes, which were destroyed by wildfires. His first guest? Charlie Kirk, of Turning Point USA. During that show, Newsom said he agreed that biologically male athletes should not compete with girls in sports, calling it “deeply unfair.”\n\nThe reaction from LGBT activists was swift.\n\nAdvocates for Trans Equality Chief Strategic Programs Officer Anya Marino said, “Governor Newsom’s statements only further fuel the far-right’s campaign to dehumanize trans people.”\n\nKelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBT advocacy group, told the New York Times, “Our message to Governor Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn’t paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities.”\n\nHowever, Newsom knows the issue is not a winner for Democrats. Polling says that a large majority of people agree with him. In January, a New York Times-Ipsos poll found that 79% of Americans, including 67% of Democrats, said biological men identifying as transgender female athletes should not be allowed to play in women’s sports.\n\nNewsom’s next two guests were conservative radio talk show host Michael Savage and former White House chief strategist and War Room host Steve Bannon. The show also featured Walz, but Democrats have been bewildered as to why Newsom would entertain having MAGA figures on the show. A recent story in the New Yorker called the show “embarrassing.” Former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a star in the anti-Trump world, said on X, “Many of us on the right sacrificed careers to fight Bannon, and Newsom is trying to make a career and a presidential run by building him up. Unforgivable and insane.”\n\nIt’s not as if Newsom is about to embrace the MAGA movement. Still, clearly, he sees Harris’s significant loss to Trump as a means of finding a path for another California Democrat to get the nomination in 2028.\n\nOne possible 2028 Democratic contender who fared better than Newsom in a recent Morning Consult poll of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents is former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg took the 2020 presidential primary by storm despite only his experience as a midsize city mayor in South Bend, Indiana, and he outraised governors and senators on his way to an Iowa caucus victory in 2020. His campaign fizzled after losses in New Hampshire and Nevada. His inability to gain Latino and black voters cost him in South Carolina, and he dropped out of the race after finishing fourth.\n\nButtigieg’s political career was boosted when Biden tapped him to lead the Transportation Department. As much as he tries to gloss it over, his tenure was not one for the books. Air and rail supply chain problems, a derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, a Southwest Airlines meltdown that caused thousands of flight delays and cancellations, and close calls on runways often left him scrambling. His decision to take two months of parental leave in 2021 didn’t sit well with congressional Republicans, especially since it was never announced, and the administration never named an acting secretary at the time.\n\nButtigieg’s strength is that he is not averse to going on Fox News and scrapping with hosts, making him a favorite on social media and among the activist class of the Democratic Party. He recently turned down an opportunity to run for the Senate in Michigan despite the announced retirement of senior Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI).\n\nHe obviously sees a path to the presidential nomination. He has the capability to raise a lot of money, and nary a day goes by when he is not out front, criticizing the Trump administration, whatever the issue. He’s also the quintessential Washington, D.C., “class president” type whom pundits and talking heads enjoy obsessing over when discussing presidential contenders. High school valedictorian, winner of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum’s Profiles in Courage essay contest. Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar.\n\nDespite his pedigree and willingness to spar with conservatives on X and Fox News, Buttigieg still has a significant mountain to climb. While he was ahead of Newsom in the recent Morning Consult poll, Harris is the clear favorite by far. She received 36% in that poll. Buttigieg was 10%, and Newsom was 5% with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Walz.\n\nHarris, like Newsom, has a history of moving her career upward without much in the way of accomplishments to show for it. Some people bristle at the notion that her romantic relationship with Brown, the former speaker of the California Assembly and San Francisco mayor, boosted her career. But Brown, who is 30 years Harris’s senior, appointed her to the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and later to the California Medical Assistance Commission in 1994.\n\nShe parlayed that and her connection with Brown to get elected as the San Francisco district attorney. That role gave her statewide name recognition, propelling her to state attorney general. When longtime California Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris jumped into the race, beating Loretta Sanchez for the job. After only two years in the Senate, she announced her presidential run.\n\nThat presidential campaign was a failure. Harris gained momentum briefly when, in the second Democratic debate, she attacked her future running mate and boss, Biden, for his record on forced busing to promote school integration and “working with segregationists” in the Senate to pass legislation. Outside of that, however, her campaign was a dud, and she dropped out in 2019 before a single vote was cast.\n\nHarris becoming Biden’s running mate was a matter of circumstance more than anything else. Following the death of George Floyd, the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the corresponding violence and riots in cities across the United States, Biden was under tremendous pressure (though he later denied it) to choose not only a black running mate but also a female black running mate. Harris won out.\n\nDEMOCRATS DON’T WANT KAMALA HARRIS \n\nWhile Harris leads the way right now, the last sitting vice president to run for the top spot, lose, and return to win the White House in a later election was Richard Nixon. If Democrats expect to win in 2028, it’s difficult to see how the party will succeed with three left-wing prospects currently leading among Democratic voters. The fact that Ocasio-Cortez has the same level of support as Newsom is telling in a way that suggests primary voters currently don’t want a true centrist. Additionally, some suggest a “star” candidate, such as billionaire Mark Cuban or even television personality Stephen A. Smith, could be the ticket back to the White House. After all, if a former reality show host who decided whether Andrew Dice Clay or Dennis Rodman would better run a fictional company could do it, why couldn’t they have their turn?\n\nWhen asked, voters always prioritize the economy. In early 2027, when Democrats begin to announce their candidacies, if the economy is stable — prices are down, interest rates are lower, housing and rental markets are stabilized, and unemployment is low — the argument for change from progressive candidates will fall flat. They might have to start to practice saying, “President JD Vance.” \n\nAndrea Ruth is a contributor to the Washington Examiner magazine.","summary":"The 2028 election seems as if it is a lifetime away.

It came to light in hearings before the Senate Watergate Committee in June 1973, where White House Counsel John Dean disclosed a memorandum entitled \"Dealing with our Political Enemies\": \"This memorandum addresses the matter of how we can maximize the fact of our incumbency in dealing with persons known to be active in their opposition to our Administration; stated a bit more bluntly – how we can use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.\" SEN SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: THE EPA'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION ROLLBACK PUTS AMERICANS LAST The list was wide-ranging, including celebrities, journalists, newspapers, unions, advocacy groups, academics, senators, congressmen, representatives, businesses, and organizations who had voiced opposition to Nixon and his administration, or promoted ideas and causes the president didn't like. And Dean's suggested methods for dealing with these \"enemies\" included limiting the availability of grants and federal contracts, as well as litigation and prosecution. Stop me if any of this begins to sound familiar. In the three months since his inauguration, President Trump and his administration have issued executive orders against individuals perceived as disloyal, stripped security clearances and protective details from former officials who incurred his wrath, and targeted law firms for having defended the \"wrong\" causes or clients. He has also issued ultimatums to universities like Columbia and Harvard, demanding that they conform to his administration's ideological preferences or risk losing billions of dollars in federal contracts and grants. Trump has also personally filed frivolous lawsuits against his perceived political opponents. This includes the Des Moines Register and Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer, for incorrectly suggesting that. Kamala Harris was leading in Iowa right before the 2024 presidential election, and CBS for how 60 Minutes edited its Kamala Harris interview. For the Trump administration, no grievance is too petty to escape outsized retribution. After the White House limited access by the Associated Press for refusing to relabel the body of water between Florida and Mexico the \"Gulf of America,\" federal courts ruled that this act of viewpoint-based retaliation was a violation of the First Amendment. The administration defied that order until April 15, when an AP journalist was allowed into a White House event for the first time since February. Even this, however, seems to be short-lived. The next day, the White House announced a new media policy which would once again restrict journalists at their own discretion – a move which the Associated Press argues is an attempt to evade the court order. The list of egregious and unconscionable behavior goes on. In a few short weeks, it seems Trump has already out-Nixoned Nixon. But there's a stark difference between then and now: When Nixon's enemies list was revealed, it became a national scandal and a profound embarrassment – including to Nixon himself. The scandal helped confirm that the president had obliterated his credibility and reputation, and he resigned in disgrace in August 1974. It's impossible to imagine Donald Trump resigning over anything – let alone public awareness of his abuses of power. For one thing, there's no embarrassing secret to reveal. Trump's behavior hasn't been the kind of thing you have to drag out of people through sworn testimony at congressional hearings. On the contrary, the president boasts about his actions on social media and holds executive order ceremonies to celebrate them. What was once covert is now overt – shamelessly so. What's more, these actions are leavened with head-spinning hypocrisy. An administration that promised to end \"lawfare\" has made it not just official policy, but its political brand. This administration has managed to combine and magnify the abuses of the first Red Scare, the McCarthy Era, and Watergate, all in the space of three months. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The only thing worse is the fanfare with which this behavior is greeted. During a 1977 interview with David Frost, former President Nixon proclaimed that \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\" This was a showstopping moment, revealing that Nixon had crossed a Constitutional line – one that dashed his hopes for a political comeback. Not long ago, Trump posted a similarly egregious and chilling quote from Napoleon, which read\" He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\" The response from his base? Applause.

State Senator Mallory McMorrow announced before El-Sayed, and Representative Haley Stevens of Michigan's 11th District threw her hat into the ring on Tuesday. Former Michigan state House Speaker Joe Tate is also expected to run.As for El-Sayed and his campaign, he plans to focus on the economic issues and pain many Americans are feeling. Similar to Sanders, he's taking aim at the billionaires and \"oligarchs,\" while elevating the issues facing American workers.\"We have to see people's pain, understand it, and then help them to believe that it can get better and then make it better,\" El-Sayed, former director of Wayne County's Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, told Newsweek this week. \"That's a tough thing to do. But it starts with being able to see that pain.\"Having previously run unsuccessfully to become Michigan's governor in 2018, El-Sayed, 40, is familiar with voters' concerns across the Midwestern state. In particular, he sees young men as a key constituency Democrats need to work to win back, after they were seen gravitating toward President Donald Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election.\"They're disaffected for a lot of reasons. I think we have an epidemic right now of feeling like you don't belong, and I think that hits young men hardest,\" he said.El-Sayed spoke with Newsweek for an exclusive interview about his campaign via Zoom on Tuesday. The interview transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity.Newsweek: As you're starting this new campaign, what is the main reason that you're running now? And what's the main message that you're trying to promote for Michigan voters?Abdul El-Sayed: It just shouldn't be this hard to get by in the richest, most powerful country in the world. I started a conversation with Michigan voters a decade ago when I started my career in public service. When you talk to them, they're talking about feeling like they are stuck on the outer edge of an economy that they're about to get kicked out of. They're worried about whether or not they're able to afford groceries, whether or not their kid's school is preparing them for a future that they want. Whether or not they can afford health care and not get smacked in the face with a huge debt simply because they went and saw a doctor when they got sick. That has caused so much pain in our state, and the people who've exploited that pain to get elected, people like Donald Trump and Elon Musk who came in on his coattails, they've just made it worse. They're exploiting that pain to deliver for people like them: billionaires, oligarchs, corporate CEOs.They're doing it in ways that are just brazen. Whether it's tanking the global economy to pass stock tips to your billionaire buddies—billionaires made $300 billion off of the most recent downturn of the economy while people are watching their 401(k)s turn into dust. You're watching as they are literally gutting parts of our government that are some of the best things government does, [such as] funding cancer research. There are literally people who are going to die in the future because research didn't get done that would have cured their cancer. Or it's the fact that they're literally gutting things like the VA [Veteran Affairs Department], a solemn promise that we made to our veterans.When I ran in 2018, I said something that people weren't quite ready to hear. I said that Donald Trump wasn't the disease—he was just the worst symptom of the disease. And the disease was a politics that was corrupted by the most powerful in our society: billionaires and oligarchs and corporate CEOs. We're watching as that symptom has just come back even worse.We need somebody who can fight back against Trump and Musk, but also who can build out of the ashes they're gonna leave behind. And I feel like that is the promise that I've been making to Michiganders since I started in public service. And it's a promise that I hope to be able to fulfill as their next senator.Michigan is kind of an interesting swing state. In 2016, it went for Trump, then in 2020 for Biden, and then in the 2022 midterms, Democrats did incredibly well. And then Trump won in 2024. So what do you think made the difference in 2024? Why did Trump make a comeback in the state?If you look at his voters, he, of course, won the MAGA heads and he won over a large proportion of country club Republicans. But there's a group of people that he won over that I think all of us who believe in an America where we can come together and build something that's greater than the sum of its parts should be really alarmed at, which is young men.They're disaffected for a lot of reasons. I think we have an epidemic right now of feeling like you don't belong, and I think that hits young men hardest. There has been a whole cadre of people who have emerged to try and blame other people for why so many young men feel like they don't belong in their societies.I think that we have an opportunity to bring them back. I don't want to raise my two daughters in an America where their brothers think that their lives are worse because people like my daughters do better. As a young man who's felt somewhat disaffected in our politics for a long time, I'm hoping that I can have a conversation with young men, right? What is strength about? What does it mean to be strong?To me, I think being strong means that you provide, it means that you protect, it means that you promote. You look at Trump and you look at Musk and they have this very fragile sense of what strength is. Strength is beating up on people who are weaker than you. I don't think we want to live that way. And I don't think we have to. My hope is to be able to inspire them back off the brink of this sort of politics of cynicism and hate to a politics of hope and aspiration and investment in oneself and one's community.I think if we do that, not only will we have won an election, but more importantly, I think we'll have done something really important for our society. Because we will have addressed some of what's worst in this moment and how people are taking pain and compounding it.I saw your recent comments about [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer and how you wouldn't necessarily rule out backing him as leader. I'm just curious, how did you actually assess Schumer's recent decision, which led to so much backlash, to support the GOP funding bill moving forward? And if you were in the Senate, how would you have handled that moment differently?Let me be clear. I deeply disagree with the idea of supporting the CR [continuing resolution]. I think one of the challenges that we have in our politics is when people get elected, they mistake the leadership part of the job for the procedural part of job. I think obviously when you're a senator or a congressperson or a governor or a mayor, you think about the things that you uniquely can do because of that role and they become the most obvious things. So being able to vote on a CR is something a senator can uniquely do. But this is a moment for leadership and people elect you because you are part of a broader conversation about who we are and who we wanna be.I think right now, as we're watching Trump and Musk and frankly Republicans in Congress, just completely decimate some of the greatest values that we hold dear, this is a time for courage, it's a time for leadership. Even if the procedural decision-making looks one way, I think it is time to step up and lead. I will support anybody who can help to address the challenges and the pain that Michiganders feel. I'm very clear about the fact that I want an economy that works for working people, meaning where we step up for workers' rights, meaning where we make this the best single place to build and grow a small business.I believe in guaranteeing health care through Medicare for All. I literally wrote the book on it. I believe, in protecting our air and water rather than watching our Earth get desecrated by corporations who are trying to make a buck off of them. And I know that that's what Michiganders believe. So I'm going to vote for any leader who is going to give me a plan to achieve those outcomes for the people who elected me.The only point that I'm trying to make is this. To me, a vote is a choice between two or more options. And if you don't know what the other options are, unilaterally saying I'm not gonna support this one just seems to me to be a bit unnuanced. So I'm not defending anyone's choices. I vehemently disagree with them. I disagreed with them the day they were made. But I am saying that as we think about the next step, we need to make sure that the alternative isn't worse.You touched a bit in that answer on the economy and workers. When it comes to tariffs, Governor Whitmer recently got into a bit of hot water because she went to the White House and spoke somewhat favorably about the idea of some tariffs. Of course, Michigan is a big union state. A lot of union leaders are supportive of the tariffs. What is your perspective on that issue?I'm in Michigan. I was raised here, and I remember when the Buick plant in Flint, where my parents worked, not at the plant, but in the city, when that shut down. I watched as every time we drive in, the state of the city just got worse and worse. Free trade has hollowed out Michigan towns. It robbed so many families of their dreams. It has been a cancer on our economy in Michigan and across this country.The thing about cancer is that usually you treat it with chemotherapy. And chemotherapy is poison. But it's poison that you use systematically because it's more likely to kill the cancer than it is to kill a patient. And to use it very sparingly in specific ways. So when it comes to the idea of tariffs, I think of tariffs as being chemotherapy for the poison of free trade. So I'm not categorically against them. But I do think that when you use chemo, you have to be extremely careful and extremely focused on the outcome that you want.The tough part is that, you know, when you put chemo in the hands of Donald Trump, characteristically, everything he does is ham-handed, it's self-serving and it's chaotic. That's exactly what he did. So what he basically did is, he said, \"OK, I have diagnosed a cancer, so I'm just going to give my patient, the U.S. economy, all the chemo at the same time.\" Which any doctor will tell you will just kill your patient. Unfortunately, that's exactly what he did.My sense is that it wasn't about actually returning jobs to places like Michigan. It was about creating leverage against corporate CEOs who then come to him groveling, which is exactly what's happened. But if you were serious about re-shoring, if you're serious about building the future of manufacturing in places like Michigan, what you would do is you'd bring unions to the table from the jump. You would start investing in the most promising early stage technologies and you would invest in their ability to manufacture. In communities like Michigan with great union jobs and benefits. And then you would let folks know that you were going to tariff against these particular industries in very particular ways on a very particular schedule so everybody understood what was happening and why. And over time, as those industries grew and developed, you would expect that they would be able to compete on the global market. Over time, you would start to dial that down.I worry that because of what Trump's done, he's almost foreclosed on the option of using tariffs in a smart way to build the future industries and manufacturing in places like Michigan like we deserve.The two big issues in this past election were the economy and immigration. Now, Trump's approval on the economy has collapsed somewhat. But the one area where polling suggests he's still above water is on immigration. How do you think Democrats should be messaging on that issue?We need to secure our border. At the same time, the whole conversation about the border has been weaponized by Trump and his acolytes to demagogue the idea of immigration in the first place. Now, my parents immigrated to this country and I tell you, I know many immigrants. None of them come here to take. They come here to build. They wanna build in this country. We wanna build futures for their kids. They want to build opportunity. They come because they love this place and wanna contribute here.What we've seen under this administration is an attempt to weaponize the idea of immigration around trying to create the semblance of an America where people like me, people like so many others in this place, don't belong. And you're seeing that in a way where they're using the arms of the state to run roughshod, to like literally tear up our Constitution, to disobey court orders, to disappear people because they signed their name to an op-ed. To fearmonger people from coming here.One of the things America has done really well is it has made itself the destination of choice for the best and brightest all over the world to come here, to learn, to build and to grow amazing industries that we take for granted. I worry that when you look at this place, like my dad, who was a really promising graduate back in the '70s, he wanted to be a mechanical engineer. He said, 'You know what? The best single place to do that is in Detroit, Michigan.' And that's where he came and he has patents and he's built businesses and he's written books and he taught students. I worry that if he was making that same decision in 2025, that he might choose to go somewhere else and we would all be the worse off for it. And so let's not mistake the need to secure our border with the great benefit that immigration has had for us from the jump.I worry that Democrats are so afraid of this issue, because we have this awful dependency on this terrible advice that we get from the consulting class that tells us we have to triangulate a position so it's perfectly inoffensive, but then we have to say it with a lot of enthusiasm. And if you're not saying anything of meaning with a lot of enthusiasm, you look absolutely ridiculous, which unfortunately is how we often look, and we're losing votes because of it. I think we have a responsibility to step up and articulate a very clear, affirmative approach to what we believe the world ought to look like.I believe America is at its best when people from all over the world want to come here. Where, yes, we secure our borders and we protect those borders. But at the same time, we recognize that immigration has been a net benefit to our country and that we deserve in this country to continue to be that place. Where everybody can come and try to build something for themselves and for our country. And that's better for us. And we have to be willing to say that rather than try and run away from the issue.Bernie Sanders has been a longtime supporter of yours, and he endorsed you right out of the gate in this campaign as well. I assume you must have had some conversations with him before launching the campaign. I'm curious, did he give you some advice? What did he tell you about running for this seat?Bernie is somebody who has been full-throatedly working for the well-being of working people in our country for decades and decades, since before I was born. His commitment to the working class, his commitment to the kinds of values of fairness that I think all of us believe in is sacrosanct. Even at 83 years old, there is nobody who is more full-throated on these issues than he is. So I'm really grateful for his support, and that I was able to earn his trust.So much of what I've wanted to do in my work is about serving at the leading edge of government, the place where the rubber, so to speak, hits the road. And I've tried to take a lot of the values that Senator Sanders articulates and turn them into programs, whether it's erasing $700 million in medical debt, it's putting Narcan all over the place, or giving people access to air quality data so they can stand up to the polluters who are affecting the air that their kids breathe every day. I was grateful that he saw that work and decided to come behind this campaign.What the senator told me that I'll never forget, he said, 'Listen, young people ...' this is a guy who's 83 years old, '... young people have the greatest stake in our democracy because they're gonna live the longest time. And you really have to keep close to what young people tell you.'One of the things I know keeps him up at night is this challenge with young men, why there has been this cynicism and this turn against the values of hope that we can actually use a government of the people for the people and by the people to deliver for people. He and I have had a lot of conversations about what it means to have an honest conversation with young men in particular in this country. And as a father of two daughters, right? I think it's just so important that we get that conversation right.Then the other thing he told me is, 'Don't lose sight of the big picture.' I think public service is about the public and too often we get caught up in these things that we think make it so complicated. I've studied complicated things. I went to medical school. This one's not that complicated. If you do the work of listening to people and then articulating in very clear points, policy that could solve their problems, that's kinda it. And then go out and tell folks that. Listen and talk, listen, think and talk. And it starts with listening.Right now, it definitely seems like the energy on the left is with Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at these rallies they're holding across the country. At the same time, we've seen that energy around Sanders in 2016, and then again in 2020, but it seems that the moderate wing of the party, or the establishment as some say, wins anyway. Do you think that this moment is different, and if so, how?I think there's an open question about what this party should stand for. I don't really love labels because, again, I trained as a scientist and one of the first things they teach you is that you should use words that mean the same thing to people saying them as people hearing them. I think these labels, they've been twisted and turned in 15 different ways. I'm a student of history, and I remember when the Democratic Party, right, in the time of FDR [former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], in a time of LBJ [former President Lyndon B. Johnson], was about some very basic things. It was about delivering for working people in ways that made sense and were clear. It was about empowering working people, it was about empowering local forms of capitalism, meaning empowering small business and helping it scale and helping distribute wealth back to its local community. It was about guaranteeing health to people and health care in ways that the government can do in the richest, most powerful country in the world. It was about protecting air and water.Since then, the party has grown quite a bit because of pressure from folks like Martin Luther King Jr. to remind us those promises had to extend to everybody. Too often, they left people of color behind. I just think that if we're serious about our values, those seem to me to be commonsense values. Those are what we should focus on. We've got opportunities to win the future here and it's not gonna happen because we have poll-tested numbers that win a small proportion of Republicans who realize that Donald Trump is like patently insane. We're gonna win because we are listening to people, we're speaking truth to their pain, and we are taking on the power of the most powerful in a way that is taking our government back in delivering for working people.I don't know where that sits on the ideological frame and how that's gonna work within intraparty politics, but that's what I'm gonna be about for the next 15 months.I'm sure there are going to be some folks within the Democratic Party who say, 'Look, a Bernie Sanders-backed candidate can't win in a swing state like Michigan, especially after Trump just won there.' What would be your response to that criticism?I think it's a different time, and I remember when they said a guy named Barack Hussein Obama couldn't win. I remember they said that a guy called Donald Trump couldn't. So I just don't trust the pundits to call the shots.Also, to say the thing that sometimes people are too polite to say, obviously my name is Abdul, and that is, we'll just say, not the best name for politics on a ballot. I got a lot of faith in my fellow Michiganders and I got a lot faith in the fellow Michiganders because I've been named Abdul in Michigan my whole life. I was named Abdul when I was elected captain of my high school football team and awarded a coaches leadership award by my coaches for my leadership of people who didn't look like me or have names like mine. I was named Abdul when I walked into patients' rooms in medical school and asked what's wrong and how can I help. I'm named Abdul and I rebuilt Detroit's health department and delivered a debt cancellation of upward of $700 million to folks across Wayne County. I've spent my whole career and most of my life in this state, born and raised, and Michiganders are good people. And they see past a name and they see past these labels.They're asking, number one, \"Do you care about me?\" And number two, \"What are you going to do to try and help me?\" I trained as a doctor, and those are the two questions that people ask of their doctors. So, I've learned a lot about how to see through people's pain, to help work with them to get past the cynicism of that pain. You gotta get people to hope and to believe that the things that we can do together can address the pain and make it better.I think right now, what Trump and his acolytes in Congress have done, is tell us that it's only ever going to get worse, and that they at least understand that there's pain. So it frees them up to do whatever they want that just makes the pain worse. I think the lift for us is a lot harder. We have to see people's pain, understand it, and then help them to believe that it can get better and then make it better. That's a tough thing to do. But it starts with being able to see that pain.I worry that too often, the Democratic message is, 'No, actually things are perfectly good. If you take the average of income across this country, our economy was great.' Well, unfortunately, it just wasn't working for the majority of people. There's a lot of good statistical reasons as to why. So you've got to be honest with people about, 'No, this is a painful situation. I see your pain. But what can we do to make it better?' Rather than what will you let them do to make it worse.You were part of the 'Uncommitted' movement in this past election. Could you just speak a bit to why you thought that was a particularly important thing to do? And how do you think the issue of the ongoing Gaza war resonates with Michigan voters, broadly speaking across the state?I endorsed Kamala Harris in the general election. I want to be absolutely clear about that. And I spent most of election season trying to convince as many people as possible that whatever you thought of Harris, she was so much better than Donald Trump.'Uncommitted' was about a choice in the Democratic primary, which of course was no choice at all. I think people were asking us to unilaterally support a guy who clearly did not have what it took, to run for president again. That decision became obvious during the debate. I think a lot of the folks in the 'Uncommitted' movement saw that early when it came to the disastrous handling of what was happening in Gaza.Now, you asked me very specifically about Gaza, but let me just be clear. I'm not asking people to have an opinion about what's happening over there. I'm asking people to look at their kids' school and ask whether or not it makes sense to send tens of billions of dollars abroad to a foreign military in a very rich country so that they can bomb other kids' schools, when we could be spending that money on your kids' school. I think when you think about it that way, it's an obvious thing that we shouldn't be in the business of funding foreign militaries anywhere, whether it's Gaza or Egypt or Saudi Arabia.We've got a lot of issues to take on here at home, and I think we've got a responsibility to take them on. At the same time, I want to think bigger picture about foreign policy. We talk about a rules-based international order and the principal violator of those rules too often ends up being us. We spent a lot of time after World War II trying to create multinational organizations that would create and uplift and enforce those rules of that rules-based international order. And when we follow those rules, as in Ukraine against a despot who is trying to take over another country or in Serbia, for example, back in the '90s, we do well. When we violate that rules-based international order, as in Iraq, as Vietnam before that, that's when we make terrible decisions.I'm just asking us to be sensible about how we want the world to be. I think we need to be leaders in the world, but leaders lead toward a particular set of values. I believe you say, 'Here's what our values are, we support democracy, we are willing to work with our allies when the purpose is just,' and then you obey your own rules.If you were to win the Democratic Party's nomination, you'd actually only be the second-ever Muslim to be nominated for a major party. The first was Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022 by Republicans in Pennsylvania. And if you won, you would be the first Muslim senator. Do you think much about the potentially historic nature of this campaign in that respect?I'm not running to be the first anything. I'm running to the best senator for the state of Michigan and to deliver for working people.Do you have anything else that you think is important to share before we let you go?I just want to double-click here on this point on pain. I just think we are so used to things getting worse. It's so tough when your message is that things can be better. I really want this campaign to invite people to believe that it actually can be, and it should be, and that we deserve better. It does not have to be this hard. There are choices that we've allowed the richest, most powerful actors in the country to make for us. Corporations, billionaires, oligarchs—so that they get richer and it just gets harder for us, we get monetized at every turn. You get monetized when you want to go see a doctor, you get monetized when you reach into your phone and a trillion dollar corporation spends billions of dollars to make sure that you can't look up from it. We get monetized by the collusion of oligarchs when we go and shop at grocery stores and our prices are just that much higher.It doesn't have to be that way. We have to believe that it can be better, not just that it's always going to get worse. And I hope that this campaign can be one of healing and one of hope, and I hope that folks will get involved.","summary":"\"We have an epidemic right now of feeling like you don't belong,\" the Michigan U.S. Senate candidate told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-endorsed-abdul-el-sayed-sees-opportunity-young-men-2063878","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2632464/abdul-el-sayed-running-senate.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 09:00:03","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":314678136,"title":"5 takeaways from the week — from a softer approach on trade to Hegseth in hot water","text":"We'll be recapping what you need to know every Friday morning for the first 100 days of the Trump administration. Get more updates and analysis in the NPR Politics newsletter.\n\nAfter weeks of volatility because of Trump's trade war, the stock markets this week responded positively to Trump softening his tone toward China and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, has been wading in hot water; Trump looks to live up to the dealmaker reputation he has sought to project, trying for a nuclear deal with Iran, while also growing irritated with the inability to get a peace plan agreed to between Russia and Ukraine; and he continues to mix politics and money.\n\nHere are five takeaways from week 14 in our continued look at Trump's first 100 days in office:\n\n1. A softening toward China and Powell. \n\nTrump doesn't need to focus on public opinion because he's constitutionally barred from running for a third term — even though several polls this week showed his approval ratings on the decline and vulnerable congressional Republicans might wish he took their findings to heart.\n\nBut one thing he has always reacted to is investors. The stock market was on track for its worst performance at the beginning of a presidency since the Great Depression. But then Trump ditched the hot rhetoric toward China and the Fed chair. He said 145% tariffs remain in place toward China but that the White House and China are in talks to find a different, reasonable number. On Monday, Trump on social media called Powell a \"major loser.\"\n\nBut a day later, he said he had \"no intention\" of firing Powell. As a result, the markets are up. But it has been a bumpy ride since the beginning of the month — and the uncertainty hasn't been cleared up, not just for Wall Street, but small businesses and farmers, who operate on very slim margins.\n\n2. Hegseth in hot water.\n\nThe number of stories in the past week about problems in Hegseth's Defense Department has been extraordinary. Here's a look at some:\n\nThe New York Times reports on Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details of the U.S. strikes on Yemen in a message group with his wife, brother and personal lawyer.A former Pentagon spokesman, John Ullyot — someone who was close with Hegseth and worked in the first Trump administration, too — writes an op-ed the same day in Politico describing \"a month of total chaos\" and predicts Trump will fire Hegseth. The next day, at the White House Easter Egg Roll, Hegseth blasts the media for using \"anonymous sources\" from \"disgruntled, former employees\" in its reporting about him. NPR and others report on Tuesday that Hegseth was cutting and pasting information from a secure channel sent by the head of U.S. Central Command, Erik Kurilla, to the Signal chat groups.\n\nCBS News reports on Wednesday that Hegseth had a makeup studio installed at the Pentagon. CNN reports that Jennifer Hegseth, his wife, put in papers for a security clearance despite not having a job in the Pentagon. \n\nFew Republicans have been critical or have been willing to speak out. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she fears \"retaliation.\" Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., did raise concerns, saying if he were president he wouldn't \"tolerate\" Hegseth's behavior. \"He's acting like he's above the law,\" he said, \"and that shows an amateur person.\"\n\nBut Murkowski and Bacon are unique figures. Murkowski has a famous last name in her state and has been tested before, winning a statewide write-in campaign after conservatives tried to oust her. Bacon is one of the few Republicans in a district that Democrat Kamala Harris won. There has been a decreasing number of swing districts, only a few dozen now.\n\nSo for most other Republicans, there's no incentive for them to speak out because of the power Trump has with the base and risk of a primary challenge.\n\nThat insulates Hegseth to an extent because often divisions within a president's party are leading indicators for a Cabinet member's ouster. At the end of the day, few people last in Cabinet positions for the entirety of a president's term, but dismissing one this early would be highly unusual. Only 13 Cabinet members in history have served less than 100 days. Trump's is coming up on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said it is firmly behind Hegseth, contending that the \"entire\" Pentagon is resisting him. NPR reported that the White House is, however, looking at potential replacements if the president changes his mind — or things get even worse.\n\n3. Trump really wants to make international deals, but so far, they've been elusive.\n\nThe man, who wrote The Art of the Deal and considers himself the dealmaker of all dealmakers, really wants them made to end the Russia-Ukraine war and with Iran over its nuclear program.\n\nBut it hasn't proved to be so easy.\n\nTrump has promised to quickly put an end to the war in Ukraine — 24 hours, in fact. But, this week, Trump lashed out at Ukraine's president — again — saying he was harder to deal with than Russia and accused him of derailing negotiations. The U.S. wants Ukraine to officially cede Crimea and to pledge never to join NATO. Trump was critical of Russia's Vladimir Putin on social media for continuing to bombard Ukraine, but there have been no concessions the Trump administration has publicly asked of Russia.\n\nVice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have threatened that the U.S. would walk away from the table if a deal isn't reached.\n\nAsked whether the U.S. would, indeed, walk away, Trump said to ask the question again in \"two weeks.\"\n\nAs for an Iran deal, Trump said Thursday it was \"well on its way.\" Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran deal struck under President Obama, which he called at the time \"the worst deal ever.\" But it's not clear if that's the case, and it's easy to forget that Trump promised to forge one with Iran during his first term — one that looked similar to the original Obama deal.\n\n4. The commodification of politics.\n\nUnlike any past president, Trump is mixing money and the White House. He sold lots of tchotchkes during the campaign, from boots to Bibles, gold sneakers, victory medallions, NFTs and more.\n\nThat's continued into his presidency. He had billionaire CEOs on the dais at his inauguration. He raised a record amount of money for the inauguration, more than $200 million. There's a \"Trump Store\" website, where people can also buy any number of Trump-branded products, from hats, including one for Trump 2028, to luggage tags to golf apparel, even candles.\n\nThis week, he held the White House Easter Egg Roll, which, for the first time, included corporate sponsors other than the American Egg Board, which has traditionally backed the event. He was also promoting his crypto meme coin with a contest for the top 220 holders of it to win a dinner with the president next month. The top 25 would get \"VIP access.\" His meme coin's value jumped after the contest announcement.\n\nIt's just the latest example of Trump doing something that is far outside the norm for president. — and raises all kinds of questions about conflicts of interest and ethics.\n\nHere's a day-by-day look at what happened in the past week:\n\nFriday, April 18:\n\nThe State Department has changed what it defines as human rights. Despite decades of bipartisan agreement on American values, the State Department removed, according to NPR reporting, \"longstanding critiques of abuses such as harsh prison conditions, government corruption and restrictions on participation in the political process.\"Secretary of State Rubio says the U.S. could pause its Russia-Ukraine peace deal efforts. \"So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks,\" Rubio said after talks Thursday with European and Ukrainian officials. \"If it is, we're in. If it's not, then we have other priorities to focus on.\"The U.S. strikes a Houthi oil port overnight, killing more than 70 people.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski says she fears retribution from the Trump administration for speaking out. \"We are all afraid,\" Murkowski said, taking a long pause. \"It's quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. And I'll tell ya, I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that's not right.\"\n\nThe White House is soliciting corporate sponsorship for the White House Easter Egg Roll for the first time. There were more anti-Trump protests across the country. The Washington Post reports that cuts at Health and Human Services are impacting \"programs that help people compare IVF clinics, monitor safety in fertility and make sense of health data. … in a move some maternal health experts predict will have an enduring effect on women and children.\"Is the country in a constitutional crisis? NPR's Nina Totenberg writes, \"Think of the country right now as the pot on a stove. A week ago, one might have said that the flame controlling the temperature was on medium. But in the days since then, the pot has been inching closer to high, and a full-on clash between the Supreme Court and the president.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports the U.S. is waiting on Ukraine for its response to a peace plan with Russia. It includes Ukraine's recognition of the annexation of Crimea and that Ukraine will never join NATO. Reuters reports that Ukraine reported almost 3,000 violations during Russia's own Easter \"ceasefire.\"El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, proposes sending imprisoned U.S.-deported Venezuelans to Venezuela for a prisoner swap.The New York Times reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details of the U.S. strikes on Yemen in a message group with his wife, brother and personal lawyer.

The White House says Trump still backs Hegseth and that the \"entire Pentagon\" is resisting him. At the White House Easter Egg Roll, Hegseth blasts the media. \"This is what the media does,\" he says. \"They take anonymous sources from disgruntled, former employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. Not gonna work with me. Because we're changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters and anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn't matter.\" The former Pentagon spokesman, who wrote his opinion piece in Politico was not anonymous, and he had previously been close to Hegseth.The Education Department says it will resume collections of student loans of those who have defaulted.

Trump signs executive orders on education and says too many schools are focused on \"diversity\" instead of \"discipline.\" The U.S. is sending signals that it's ready to negotiate with China. \"China isn't doing any business\" in the U.S., Trump contends and says he didn't bring down the 145% tariff. But he adds that there will hopefully be a deal and a fair number agreed to soon, but if there isn't, \"that's OK.\"Treasury Secretary Bessent takes a softer tone toward China in a speech, saying the U.S. wants to help China rebalance trade rather than be reliant on exports. Trump also softens his tone toward Fed Chair Powell. He was critical of rates being too high, but without fiery rhetoric.CNN reports that Jennifer Hegseth, Pete Hegseth's wife, put in papers for a security clearance despite not having a job in the Pentagon. Trump says there's a deal with Russia but not with Ukraine. \"I thought it would be easier to deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump says, \"but so far, it's been harder, but that's OK.\" He adds that because oil prices are down, Russia might want a deal. CBS News reports that Hegseth had a makeup studio installed at the Pentagon. Vice President Vance says that the U.S. issued a \"very explicit proposal\" to Ukraine and Russia, that the U.S. has been \"trying to understand both sides' perspective\" and that it's \"time to say yes.\" If not, the U.S. will walk away from the process, he says.Politico reports that the White House is debating lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets and a key oil pipeline with Trump Special Envoy Steve Witkoff advocating for the idea and Secretary of State Marco Rubio against it. Rubio, however, says that it is \"unequivocally false\" and that there have been no discussions of lifting those sanctions.\n\nSeveral polls find Trump's approval ratings in decline, including Fox News, Reuters/Ipsos, the Pew Research Center and AP/NORCA YouGov/Economist finds by a 50%-28% margin say Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be returned to the United States. The Wall Street Journal editorial page criticizes Trump's proposed Ukraine deal: \"Mr. Trump's current offer looks more like an ultimatum than grounds for a durable piece.\" It adds that Trump \"has applied pressure only on Ukraine.\" And: \"[T]he current 'final' settlement offer looks like it would set up Mr. Putin to win the war now or later. The world's rogues will notice, and Mr. Trump's headaches will have only begun.\"Later in the day, in an Oval Office meeting that included Norway's prime minister, Trump says he will solve the Russia-Ukraine war \"in two weeks.\" He also says he invited Norway to the White House because he likes the country, the government, and, \"I like your king. He's very well respected.\"Trump also disputes the idea that he isn't pressuring Russia. \"You have no idea what pressure we're putting on Russia,\" he says in the Oval Office. Asked what concessions he's asking for from Russia, he says: \"Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concession.\"Trump on Truth Social says, \"Vladimir, STOP!\" and that he is not happy with the continued Russian bombings on Ukraine. Asked if he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize if he gets a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, he said, \"Maybe for the Abraham Accords.\"Trump also calls an Iran deal \"well on its way.\"Trump contends \"I did\" get prices down. He pointed to oil and also groceries, specifically eggs.Politico reports that Trump will host a dinner with \"top owners\" of Trump's crypto meme coin May 22. The invitation describes it as \"The most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World. Only for the TOP 220$TRUMP Meme Coin Holders.\" Politico notes: \"The top 25 will meet the president at a private VIP reception and 'Special VIP' tour.\" CNBC reports that after Trump's invite went out, his meme coin went up 50%. The coin had lost 70% of its value since its peak in January.The controversial former Hegseth chief of staff will no longer transition to another position inside the Defense Department, but be a special adviser.Trump issues executive orders.

Pope Francis took his last breath on Easter Monday. Pope Francis and Trump have differences over ideology. For example, just a day before he died, in his final public address, on the occasion of Easter Sunday, Pope Francis expressed a message of unity and an appeal for the marginalized and migrants.He proclaimed, \"All of us are children of God!\" In contrast, President Donald Trump issued an insulting post wishing a happy Easter to his opponents, including \"Radical Left Lunatics,\" \"Weak and Ineffective Judges and Law Enforcement Officials,\" and former President Joe Biden, \"our Worst and most Incompetent President.\"Some of the fundamental differences between the US president and the late pope will come into sharper focus as Trump travels to Rome on Friday for Francis' funeral, scheduled to be held Saturday morning in St Peter's Square.David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University in New York, called the relationship of Trump and Francis as a ‘fraught relationship’. The relationship eroded: Things hadn’t been great between Trump and the pope during Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2021. However, Gibson cites, \"Trump 2.0 was even worse with the Vatican because of how much more aggressive it has been on every level, against migrants, against international aid.\"The Argentine pontiff and the American president had contradicting views on immigration issue. In 2016, Francis, indirectly referencing then Republican candidate Trump, called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants is \" not Christian.\" Trump called the comment \"disgraceful.\"Despite Pope Francis’ emphasis on humility, inclusivity and progressive stances on issues like immigration and climate change – Trump has managed to garner increasing support among American Catholics. This support is strong especially amongst conservative Catholics. Trump identifies himself as a \"non-denominational Christian,\" meaning he doesn't align with established church institutions and emphasizes a direct relationship with God. His policies on abortion—including appointing three of the five U.S. Supreme Court justices who contributed to overturning national abortion rights—have deepened his support among Christians, particularly conservative Catholics.The Republican president sincerely requested Catholics last year to vote for him. In October, when he addressed the Al Smith charity dinner in New York, which raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities, Trump appealed: \"You gotta get out and vote. And Catholics, you gotta vote for me.\"In the 2024 elections, Trump won the Catholic vote, according to AP VoteCast, which carried out survey of more than 120,000 voters. In 2020, the Catholic vote was evenly split between Joe Biden, but in 2024, 54 per cent of Catholic voters supported Trump and 44 per cent supported Kamala Harris.Despite Catholic support, Trump failed to garner Pope Francis’ approval: Trump may have secured the Catholic vote; however, he failed to win over Pope Francis. Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic, who met briefly with Francis the day before he died, dismissed the pontiff's disagreements with the administration, telling reporters this week that the pope was \"a much broader figure\" than American politics - a man who led a church with 1.4 billion members worldwide.\"I'm aware that he had some disagreements with some of the policies of our administration,\" he added.\"He also had a lot of agreements with some of the policies of our administration. I'm not going to soil the man's legacy by talking about politics.\"Although Trump and Pope Francis had an amicable meeting at the Vatican in 2017, yet their disagreements persisted. In February, 2025, Francis sent a letter to US bishops expressing his disagreement with the recent mass deportation carried out by the Trump administration. He noted that in the Bible, the infant Jesus and his family were themselves refugees in Egypt, fleeing a threat to their lives.Some leading bishops did applaud some of the new Trump administration initiatives on \"school choice\" and policies defining gender as determined at birth. Francis, while upholding church teachings on sexuality, took a more tolerant stance toward LGBTQ+ people.Other prominent bishops, appointed by Francis, are more sympathetic with his priorities. They include the new archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Robert McElroy.Although they have a difference, Trump still chose to pay his tribute to Pope Francis in Rome. Trump's policies resonate with conservative Catholics, contrasting with Pope Francis's progressive agenda: John Fea, a professor of history at Messiah University in Pennsylvania, noted that many conservative Catholics, despite respecting the pontiff, \"didn't like his progressive views\" on immigrants and his authorizing of blessings for same-sex couples.\"The views of many conservative American Catholics line-up with Trump's brand of populism: strong borders, pro-life on abortion, concern about critical race theory in schools, etc.,\" Fea, author of \"Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump,\" said via email.In addition to migration, the pope and Trump held opposing views on environmental issues. While the pope advocated for immediate action on climate change, Trump was eager to revive the fossil fuel industry. Francis also staunchly opposed the death penalty, a policy Trump supported.Steven Millies, director of the Bernadin Centre at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago noted that Trump and Francis did share some policy goals on issues such as abortion and religious freedom. \"But the alignments were at the diplomatic level more than at the personal or political level, of course,\" he said. \"They were profoundly different people - one who'd been formed by Jesuit spirituality and lived his life in deepening faith that he shared with the world, the other who mangles Scripture quotations, sells Bibles for personal profit, and uses Christian faith like a brand identity in a market competition.\"","summary":"Despite ideological clashes, Donald Trump will attend Pope Francis's funeral, highlighting their contrasting views on immigration, climate change, and social issues. While Pope Francis championed inclusivity and aid for migrants, Trump pursued stricter policies, yet garnered support from conservative Catholics due to his stance on abortion and religious freedom. Their complex relationship reflects deeper divisions within the Catholic community.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-donald-trump-to-pay-tribute-to-pope-francis-funeral-despite-ideological-differences/articleshow/120612803.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-120613049/120613049.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 08:30:09","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":314690166,"title":"Trump says he's defending free speech — but his aggressive actions say quite the opposite","text":"“Defendants’ actions are unlawful,” Harvard’s lawsuit states. “The First Amendment does not permit the Government to ‘interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.’” \n\nYet in his first term, President Donald J. Trump declared that free speech mattered.\n\nTrump issued the “Executive Order Restoring Free Speech and Ending Federal Censorship” on March 21, 2019. In it, he expressed the importance of free inquiry and open debate to education and directed federal officials to use the federal government’s funding of higher education to ensure that universities promote free inquiry. \n\nChanneling free-speech champions Benjamin Franklin and James Madison, Trump wrote that “free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation’s democracy.” \n\nAs a professor of constitutional, criminal and comparative law, and as a citizen who enjoys his liberty, I agree. \n\nFree speech is fundamental to human progress. Scientific, medical, technological and social advancements all rely on the free flow of information. Robust discussion and disagreement are equally important to maintaining a healthy constitutional republic. \n\nIn the words of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” \n\nThe First Amendment’s free speech and press clauses protect all forms of expression – oral, print, digital and artistic – from governmental interference or punishment. \n\nOf the many types of speech, political speech is the most protected. \n\nOn the first day of his second term in office, Trump issued another free speech executive order. It affirms the administration’s commitment to free speech, directs that tax money is not used to abridge free speech and instructs federal employees to “identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.”\n\nIn a vacuum, Trump’s orders appear to bode well for free speech. \n\nBut what is important is free speech reality, not rhetoric. Three months into his second term, where does Trump stand?\n\nThe many interconnected orders, letters, statements and actions of Trump’s White House make an assessment of any positive effects difficult. On the other hand, the Trump administration has clearly violated and chilled free speech on many occasions.\n\nAt his second inauguration, Donald Trump promised to ‘stop all government censorship’ and ‘bring back free speech.’\n\nRepression and retaliation\n\nAttempts to silence the president’s adversaries are developing as a pattern. \n\nLaw firms and attorneys who have sued or prosecuted Trump, or represented his adversaries, have been targeted for retribution and concessions. It began with an executive order on March 6, 2025, directed at the U.S.-based global law firm Perkins Coie, which had once represented Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton. A second order was issued on March 14, 2025, against Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison because it once employed an attorney who investigated Trump. Subsequently, at least six other prominent law firms were also targeted. \n\nSeveral law firms acceded to the president’s demands, agreeing to accept clients without regard to political beliefs, to eliminate DEI practices, and to perform pro bono work valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars for causes Trump supports. \n\nThe firms that didn’t accede to the president’s demands had their security clearances removed, access to federal buildings restricted, and were banned from working for federal agencies. A few of the firms that didn’t relent have won temporary injunctions barring the administration’s actions against them. \n\nThe nonpartisan free speech advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression decried the orders as threatening the foundations of justice and free speech. In one of several challenges to these orders, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote on March 12, 2025, that Trump’s order appeared motivated by “retaliatory animus” and concluded that it “runs head on into the wall of First Amendment protections.” Two other federal courts reached similar conclusions.\n\nIn the first three months of his second term, Trump withdrew Secret Service protection of several prominent critics who are former federal government officials, including John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and former high-level health official Anthony Fauci also lost their security protection. \n\nIt is hard to imagine that these decisions won’t have a profoundly chilling effect on potential critics of the president, especially since the revocations were publicly announced and each individual has been the subject of credible threats resulting from their governmental service. \n\nTargeting the press\n\nA similar pattern exists for journalists, where Trump is using his power to punish organizations whose reporting he doesn’t like.\n\nAP journalists were banned from the White House and Air Force One on Feb. 11, 2025, for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the new name Trump had ordered for the body of water. On April 9, 2025, this ban was found to violate the First Amendment by a judge nominated by Trump during his first term. \n\nDenouncing CNN and MSNBC as “illegal” and claiming they are paid political operatives, Trump suggested they should be investigated during a speech at the U.S. Department of Justice. \n\nTrump effectively closed Voice of America, after 83 years of continuous broadcasting, for being “anti-Trump” and radical in its views. By charter, the broadcaster represents “America, not any single segment of American society,” with “accurate, objective, and comprehensive” news and “a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions” through television, radio, internet, social media and satellite broadcasts to peoples around the world.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has initiated regulatory actions against the licenses of several television stations for broadcasts that have been accused by the President of being anti-Trump or biased in favor of Kamala Harris. Early in the process, the outcomes of these actions are to be determined. \n\nProtesters in Somerville, Mass., on March 26, 2025, demand the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, whose recent arrest by federal agents is seen as an assault on free speech.\n\nAP Photo/Michael Casey\n\nPressuring universities and students\n\nOther administration actions, I believe, raise serious free speech issues. \n\nHarvard isn’t the only university feeling pressure. \n\nThe administration is threatening to withhold federal money from universities as a way to coerce many of them to comply with administration policies in ways that implicate free speech and in some instances violate legal processes for the withholding of federal support. \n\nSome of the Trump administration’s recent immigration enforcement efforts have targeted international students who are in the U.S. lawfully but who participated in Palestinian rights protests and disagreed with Israel’s actions during the war in Gaza. \n\nThe administration claims that some students whose visas have been revoked were either Hamas supporters or violated criminal laws. The administration has also said that many students are being deported under broad authority the secretary of state has to deport those deemed a danger to national security. \n\nDemocracy and free speech\n\nIn the past decade, the U.S. has fallen in press freedom, rule of law and democratic governance, resulting in the classification of a “flawed democracy” by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a democratic watchdog. Unsurprisingly, there has been a simultaneous rise in public support for authoritarianism. These changes make support for free speech increasingly important. \n\nOn March 4, 2025, Trump declared in a speech before a joint session of Congress that he “stopped all government censorship and brought free speech back to America.” \n\nThe record doesn’t support this claim.\n\nDaniel Hall, Professor of Justice and Community Studies & Political Science, Miami University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The Trump Administration is changing the basic mission of the (DOJ) Civil Rights Division, the way it's operated since it was founded in 1957, to help uphold the voting rights of African-Americans. And this is happening in two main ways. One, the DOJ has pushed out nearly all the career civil servants in management positions.

Many of them were reassigned to jobs unrelated to their expertise.\"\n\nDilanian continued, \"And second, the department's leader issued a series of memos last week that essentially abandoned the division's longstanding priorities of enforcing laws prohibiting discrimination against minority groups — and instead, the memo says the division will now seek to enforce President Trump's executive orders, many of which focus on, frankly, protecting white Christians.\"\n\nWhen Díaz-Balart noted that this radical restructuring of the DOJ goes way beyond actions taken during the first Trump Administration, he got no argument from McQuade.\n\nMcQuade told Díaz-Balart and Dilanian, \"I think the thing that's most distressing is that the Civil Rights Division has long been regarded as the crown jewel of the Department of Justice — a place where the Justice Department works to achieve the promise of America.

Earlier this month, he signed memorandums ordering criminal investigations into two officials who had defied him during his first term. One of the officials, Chris Krebs, was targeted for dismissing Trump's false claims that the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden was stolen from him through widespread voter fraud.'Silencing grassroots donors'Trump was also berated by Democrats for a number of executive orders penalizing specific law firms that had taken on work to which he objected. Republican interest in ActBlue intensified during the 2020 election, amid an avalanche of personal contributions and polls showing voters were fed up with dark money and corporate influence in politics.Three House committees -- judiciary, administration and oversight -- released a report on April 2 claiming \"extensive fraud... including from foreign sources\" on ActBlue and accusing the platform of lowering its prevention efforts.The probe contained no significant new examples of wrongdoing but said almost 500 pages of internal ActBlue documents released alongside its report \"demonstrate a lack of commitment to stopping fraud and paint a picture of complacency.\"Some Democrats, including Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, raced to urge donations from supporters \"while we still can\" as others took to social media to accuse Trump of abusing his office.\"His approval rating is tanking, and he's panicking about the midterms,\" Democratic strategist Mike Nellis, a former top aide to 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris, posted on X.\"This is about letting his billionaire buddies buy more elections while silencing grassroots donors and tearing down the Dems' infrastructure.\"Fellow Democratic strategist and consultant Sawyer Hackett said the move could be \"Trump's most authoritarian action yet.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"ActBlue was used by Democrats to process donations to election campaigns and other causes online.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-orders-probe-into-democrats-fundraising-platform-actblue-8252020","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/2ij8qjlk_donald-trump-_625x300_25_April_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 07:57:57","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.659}]}
