Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was attacked by a Trump supporter during a town hall on Tuesday. The assailant’s social media profile showed racial animosity toward Omar, who is a Black woman, echoing rhetoric from President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\nTrump followed up the attack by continuing to smear Omar while also promoting the conspiracy theory that the event had been staged.\n\nThe episode was just the latest in a series of attacks that Trump has leveled against prominent Black women during his time as a national political figure.\n\nFor instance, as part of his longstanding feud with Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas—who has frequently called out his racism and authoritarianism—Trump has insisted that she has a “low IQ.” \n\nRacists have historically asserted that Black people have lower IQs than whites.\n\nIn another episode, Trump tried to get his Justice Department to pursue a criminal case against New York Attorney General Leticia James. Trump has had a chip on his shoulder since James successfully pursued him in court, securing a guilty verdict on 34 felonies.\n\nBut the right’s attacks on Black women are not confined to just Trump.\n\nKamala Harris, who was the first woman and the first Black and Asian person to serve as vice president, was frequently the target of attacks from the right. During her presidential campaign, Trump’s propagandists at Fox News fumed that she used the word “holistic,” describing it as “Kamala Harris’ ‘Holistic’ Word Salad.”\n\nSimilarly, the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as part of his legacy of racist remarks, went after Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson—the first Black woman to serve on the court. After she was nominated by former President Joe Biden, Kirk said that she was a “recipient of affirmative action” and that she was “unqualified.”\n\nRelated | Republicans struggle to defend Trump's latest racist stunt\n\nIn a memorable moment of mass hysterics, the conservative movement pilloried Michelle Obama, the first Black first lady, because she had the nerve to advocate for healthy diets and exercise for children.\n\nThe modern conservative movement has its roots in racial animosity, particularly directed at Black people. But that animus goes into overdrive when the target is Black women.\n\nMuch of this likely stems from the central role that Black women play in the progressive movement, particularly the political strength of the Democratic Party. Without the support and organization of Black women voters, Democrats would likely not be a viable party.\n\nBlack women are the most reliable voting bloc for the party and have been the demographic most likely to support winning presidential candidates like Biden and Barack Obama. But even when Democratic candidates have lost, they have had the unwavering support of Black women.\n\nFor instance, when Trump defeated Harris in 2024, Black women voted for Harris by a margin of 92% to 7%. Similarly, when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016, she received 94% of Black women’s votes while Trump received 4%.\n\nThe demographic has historically shown little to no interest in Republican candidates, which no doubt has been a source of frustration.\n\nRight-wing politics has historically centered the concerns of conservative white men over everyone else, and the party’s embrace of faux masculinity has set up a dynamic of subordination to white men. Often, as displayed by politicians like Trump, this animosity is expressed by targeting Black women.\n\nIt isn’t just the politicians who make this choice. Conservative media, most notably Fox News, serves a key role in portraying Black women as the villain in conservative morality plays. Politicians like Trump then play into this narrative, targeting leaders like Omar and Crockett to keep up support among his base.\n\nIn light of this institutional hostility and the clear consensus that Democrats are more open to their concerns, it is unlikely that Black women will join the Republican camp anytime soon. \n\nSo while Republicans continue to bash and demonize them, Black women will use their power at the ballot box.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep.

Ilhan Omar, whom he called a “scammer,” and Gov. Tim Walz, whom he labeled either corrupt or incompetent.\n\n“The Theft and Fraud in Minnesota is far greater than the 19 Billion Dollars originally projected,” Trump wrote in an early-morning Truth Social post. \n\n“The Biden Administration knew this FRAUD was happening, and did absolutely nothing about it.”\n\nTrump then zeroed in on Omar and Walz, whom he has clashed with repeatedly over the years.\n\n“‘Scammer’ Ilhan Omar and her absolutely terrible friends from Somalia should all be in jail right now or, far worse, send them back to Somalia,” Trump wrote.\n\n“‘Governor’ Waltz [sic] is either the most CORRUPT government official in history, or the most INCOMPETENT.

This preening void of a film offers nothing interesting, let alone meaningful, and has no apparent purpose beyond making people appreciate the US First Lady a little more in all her faux, wannabe-royal glory. The ungrateful peasants.\n\nEven in that, its most basic and cynical aim, it faceplants.\n\nThis film insults us, the audience, by wasting our time. It somehow also manages to insult Melania herself, making her seem almost impossibly vacuous, as though the sentence “there’s no there, there” has taken human form and gained an approximation of sentience.\n\nMelania begins with an assertion, made by the First Lady herself in a voiceover, that “everyone wants to know” more about her. Let’s grant that dubious premise.\n\nWhat more might we like to know about this woman? Here was my question going in, and I think it’s a natural one, based on how little she gives away in her public appearances: is there a person of substance there, underneath the mechanical, well-practised model’s smile?\n\nThere must be. Surely there must be. No human is an empty vessel, drifting through life with neither passion nor any discernible motive.\n\nMelania’s terminal sin is not its failure to answer that question, but to even ask it. Never before now have I seen a documentary that is so fundamentally incurious about its subject. It’s one of the laziest examples of its genre ever made.\n\nA sample of my notes, from 40 minutes in: “I have learned nothing about this woman yet, and am starting to suspect there is nothing to learn.”\n\nWhat a catastrophic impression to get from any documentary. Or any person, for that matter.\n\nMelania is like a horror film with nothing scary in it, or a crime thriller with no twists, or an action film with no fighting. It is a documentary with no interest in exploring its central figure beneath her most superficial level. It is incomprehensibly empty.\n\nI should tell you what actually is in the movie.\n\nA film crew followed Melania around for twenty days leading up to the inauguration, in January of last year, and ... actually there is no “and”. That’s it. They trotted along behind the First Lady, capturing what mostly amounted to either silence or inane chitchat, cut it into 104 minutes, and apparently felt the job was done.\n\nI cannot stress enough: that really is it. No work has gone into this. It is half-arsed, incomplete, the filmmaking equivalent of you showing up to work, hiding in the loo and scrolling TikTok for eight hours, then expecting plaudits and a corner office.\n\nWhy isn’t there a proper sitdown interview with Melania? Why doesn’t she field a single challenging or even vaguely probing question? I’m not asking for a Jeremy Paxman grilling here; just any attempt to seek information would have been nice.\n\nHow is it even possible to spend three weeks with someone and not ask them a single interesting question? I have more riveting conversations with the wall of my shower each morning than anything you’ll witness on screen here.\n\nAmazon threw money at the Trump family, by the way, tens of millions of US dollars, to get the rights to this documentary. They doubled that spend to market it. Preposterous sums for a film of this genre, giving it little chance of making a profit, or of being seen as anything more than a vehicle for Jeff Bezos to suck up to the Trumps.\n\nAnd what, Melania couldn’t put aside 40 minutes, as thanks? Did the creators even ask?\n\nVery, very few of the words you hear from her in this film are recorded organically. They instead come in the form of voiceovers, read woodenly from a script that often sounds like it was written by an undergraduate intern.\n\nThink: world’s longest press release turned into a self-narrated audiobook. Where is the value in that? What do we learn from that? Bugger all, is what. Halfway through the film Melania’s stream of disembodied platitudes fades into white noise.\n\nAnd speaking of voices, why aren’t there more of them?\n\nCould the creators seriously not be bothered to find, I dunno, three or four people who know Melania well, and could provide genuine insight into her personality? No no, too much work.\n\nAgain I have failed to tell you much about what actually is on screen, and I’ll explain why. When it comes to Melania the film and indeed, it seems, Melania the person, what is there is less interesting than what isn’t there.\n\nBrett Ratner and his team have offered so little to the audience that it’s more interesting to discuss what is missing.\n\nAnd Melania Trump is a figure we occasionally find interesting, from afar, not because of her personality but because she appears not to have one.\n\nHow many times can a person be expected to sit through footage of the woman exiting a car, boarding a plane, flying for a bit, disembarking, entering another vehicle, and getting dropped off at one of her mansions, all of it done near-wordlessly, save for the occasional “hello”, before the boredom calcifies?\n\nIt’s the aesthetic, the wealth porn of Succession – rich people being ferried between expensive properties on private planes – with none of the show’s dialogue or wit.\n\nBeing wealthy is not a personality. It is set dressing. The things that you own tell me nothing about who you are. Every moment of this film that reads as a Succession cosplay is wasted.\n\nWhat meaning are we to draw from multiple scenes of Melania, with her high-priced fashion team, trying on dresses in her New York City penthouse?\n\n“We did two different shoulders for you,” a stylist says.\n\n“Well, I will try it,” she replies.\n\nSpellbinding cinema.\n\nMeanwhile behind her, through the gilded window, way wayyyy below, we see Central Park, and the Upper West Side, and the Bronx far off in the distance. Down there are people living lives of real struggle and, to borrow Melania’s new favourite word, “purpose”.\n\nGive one of them a documentary and $40 million. I guarantee it will be more compelling than watching a fabulously rich person play dress-up.\n\nWhat else can I complain about?\n\nHow many times can we observe Melania and her husband walking through some corridors, sharing no conversation of any substance, as though they’re distant acquaintances rather than spouses, before we conclude their relationship is actually quite dull?\n\nAt the back end of the movie, we see them attend three consecutive inauguration day balls.\n\nIt’s almost the same footage, three times in a row: Donald and Melania wait backstage, they’re announced to the audience as the President and First Lady, then they dance for a bit. Almost five minutes of that!\n\nTheir marriage does however provide the singular amusing moment, across all 104 minutes. I can’t believe the creators included it, to be honest, as it makes Donald sound like a child in a septuagenarian’s body, but that is on them.\n\n“I won every swing state!” Donald boasts to his wife over the phone, the night after Congress certified his election win over Kamala Harris, with the energy of a kid who just got an A+ on his book report.\n\n“That’s a big deal! OK talk to you soon, bye,” comes Melania’s hilariously patronising reply.\n\nYou can find some other sparse morsels of levity, if you try, again thanks to some curious editing decisions.\n\n“During my last term, I restored the Rose Garden,” Melania recalls. She’s palpably proud of it. Of course a few months after the quote was recorded, her husband dug up the garden and replaced it with a concrete patio.\n\nShe spends some time praising the White House’s East Wing, and recruiting staff for it. Donald has now demolished it to build a ballroom.\n\n“Never take individual rights for granted. Because in the end, wherever we come from, we are bound by the same humanity,” Melania says in one voiceover, apparently blissfully ignorant of the way her husband has been speaking about other human beings for his entire life. Did you know he’s been calling a whole nationality of people “garbage” lately? \n\nWhy would they include these little ironies? No idea. But I clung to them as small brushstrokes of colour on an otherwise bafflingly blank canvas.\n\nDo not go into Melania expecting a Trumpy version of Meghan Markle’s intolerable Netflix show With Love, Meghan. That is the comparison I expected to draw heading in, to be honest, but it doesn’t work, because even that ordeal possesses something this film lacks.\n\n(Meghan fans, maybe skip a couple of paragraphs here, but I promise I’m making a point.)\n\nWith Love is a bottomless font of empty, insincere Californian whimsy, and self-absorption masquerading as humility. It seems to exist purely so Meghan can soak in the praise of other celebrities on camera.\n\nBut. Meghan does have a sort of negative charisma that makes her hatewatchable. There’s stuff going on behind her eyes that is not being shared with the viewer; it’s palpable. So even when she’s doing blatant self-promotion, you have intrigue. There is something there, something to parse and interpret.\n\nYou can’t say the same of Melania Trump. You watch her here, for nearly two hours, and at no point does the mask slip. Perhaps there is actually nothing beneath it. More likely, though, is that she’s been failed catastrophically by the creators of this documentary.\n\nThe almost tragic irony is that, in attempting to deliver a glowing, triumphant puff piece, they have actually managed to make her look bad.\n\nTheir own sloth and disinterest reflect back on her. So Melania comes off as chronically vacuous, clicking from meaningless event to equally meaningless event in her heels as though on autopilot, speaking polite greetings, never offending, but never saying anything worth hearing either.\n\nIt is the job, of a documentary-maker, to break through the surface and show us what lies underneath. To bring that mask down, no matter how stubbornly it has been affixed. To probe, challenge, illuminate and inform.\n\nYou could give David Attenborough a film crew, tell him to go and look at some random species of jellyfish that lives in the Aegean Sea for two days, and he would come back with something interesting.\n\nHow is it possible then, how did these people manage, to spend so much time with one of the world’s most powerful women and come back with nothing of value?\n\nMelania: 0.5/5 stars. A pointless film that achieves nothing, insults the person it is trying to celebrate, and bores you while doing it. I considered giving it zero.\n\nIf you want to see this one on a big screen, do it now. It’s not playing in many Australian theatres, and based on the limited session times and limp ticket sales, it will not have a long run.\n\nAlternatively, wait for it to come to streaming, then pop it on while you do the dishes. The washing up will be a nice distraction from the film.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/movie-reviews/melania-review-a-lazy-bafflingly-incurious-documentary-that-insults-the-person-it-is-trying-to-celebrate/news-story/207ac95a056d5c1745628a1ed5c4dc1f","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/729f852bf32cf4d3b2245d76ea182d40","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 22:55:00","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":398114710,"title":"New 'Melania' documentary blends unprecedented access with subtle, profound message","text":"There are films that chronicle history, and then there are films that expose the private architecture behind it. “Melania,” the historic new feature film, belongs to the latter category. It is not a campaign film or a political gloss. It is a deeply human account of transition, responsibility, and resolve, told during the most compressed and emotionally demanding stretch of Melania Trump’s life, as she prepared to assume her second term as first lady of the United States.\n\nThe film shows the complexity of moving from private life back into one of the most scrutinized public roles in the world.\n\nThe film focuses on a narrow but consequential window from January 1 through January 20, 2025, a period that is usually flattened into ceremony and symbolism. Instead, “Melania” lingers in the quiet moments that precede power. It shows a woman balancing the private obligations of motherhood and family with the public demands of leadership. Navigating grief within her own family while preparing to re-enter a national spotlight that rarely affords empathy.\n\nWhat distinguishes the film immediately is its intimacy. The camera follows Melania Trump through the ordinary and the extraordinary: checking in on her son, caring for her father after the loss of his wife, and preparing to return to public life after years away from the East Wing. These scenes are not dramatized. They are observed. The result is a portrayal that feels restrained, grounded, and unmistakably human.\n\n“Melania” also offers access that has never before been granted to a media project. Viewers are brought into high-level meetings with the Secret Service, detailed White House walk-throughs, and internal discussions about staffing, security, and protocol. The level of access surpasses any prior film or documentary involving the modern presidency, and it does so without compromising the seriousness of the subject.\n\nThe film captures the lingering tension in Washington following the failed Kamala Harris presidential campaign. Without editorializing, it documents the complicated interpersonal dynamics and unspoken friction that accompany transitions of power. These moments are subtle, conveyed through body language and silence rather than confrontation, lending the film an unusual credibility.\n\nInternational diplomacy threads its way into the story as well, most notably through an appearance by Queen Rania of Jordan. Their interaction reflects Melania Trump’s long-standing engagement with global humanitarian issues and underscores the often unseen role first ladies play in shaping state relationships\n\nAt its core, “Melania” is about transition. It chronicles how Melania Trump rebuilt her East Wing operation from scratch, assembling a team and setting a tone that was disciplined and intentional. The film shows the complexity of moving from private life back into one of the most scrutinized public roles in the world.\n\nThat same precision defined how the film itself came to life.\n\nFrom the moment the project was introduced to the entertainment industry, it triggered a highly competitive bidding war. Netflix, MGM, Disney, and Paramount all pursued the project intensely, recognizing the rarity of the access and the global interest surrounding Melania Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nNavigating that landscape was Marc Beckman, who has served as Melania Trump’s senior adviser for 25 years. For decades, he has worked closely with her to secure major commercial deals, advance humanitarian initiatives, and shape her public voice. His understanding of media, culture, and negotiation proved critical in steering the project through a crowded field without compromising its integrity.\n\nBeckman brought a long-term, cross-sector perspective to the process. His experience executing campaigns for major global brands and institutions gave him the leverage and insight necessary to evaluate the various competing offers. Together, Beckman and Melania Trump prioritized control, authenticity, and global reach over spectacle.\n\nRELATED: Matt Damon: Netflix dumbs down movies for attention-impaired phone addicts\n\n Photo by Arturo Holmes/WireImage\n\nUltimately, Amazon was selected as the studio partner. The deal was not the result of any back-channel negotiations involving Donald Trump or Jeff Bezos. It was a strategic choice by a first lady determined to protect her story and ensure that it reached a worldwide audience on her terms.\n\nWhile “Melania” remains focused on the human dimensions of leadership, it arrives at a time when the first lady has increasingly asserted herself as a force within the East Wing. Her recent efforts to encourage America’s children to pursue curiosity and ambition, including through responsible engagement with emerging technologies like AI, reflect the broader leadership philosophy that underpins the film.\n\nA two-part docuseries, set for release this summer, will expand on the filmmaking process itself, offering behind-the-scenes insight into how unprecedented access was negotiated and maintained and how a project of this magnitude was executed without losing its soul.\n\nIn an era of political noise and cultural oversaturation, “Melania” stands apart. It is quiet without being passive and powerful without being performative. More than a film, it is a record of how leadership looks before the world is watching — and why that unseen work matters.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/columns/opinion/new-melania-documentary-blends-unprecedented-access-with-subtle-profound-message","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/new-melania-documentary-blends-unprecedented-access-with-subtle-profound-message.jpg?id=63527581&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 20:00:00","author":"Julio Rivera","authors":["Julio Rivera"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.38},{"id":398100308,"title":"Trump claims Minnesota fraud exceeds $19B, faults Biden administration","text":"President Donald Trump on Saturday ripped Democratic leaders over the massive welfare and daycare fraud scandal in Minnesota, escalating his long-running feuds with Rep.

He told the audience, if he had more time to think about the question, “my answer would be exactly the same.” The studio erupted in applause as Maher mocked the controversy with a blunt summary: “ICE, thugs, pins—stupid.”\n\nMaher briefly acknowledged that Good’s death “shouldn’t have happened.”\n\nHe quickly pivoted to shifting blame, claiming that if people “didn’t act like such thugs, it wouldn’t have had to happen.” From there, he returned to his real target: celebrities who turned the tragedy into what he sees as performative resistance. “I don’t need to wear a pin about it,” he said flatly.\n\nMaher seemed genuinely baffled that the moment sparked outrage at all. Recounting how his phone lit up afterward, he joked that when he finally checked why people were telling him to “stay strong,” his reaction was: “Holy f—, is this what you people are so worked up about?”\n\nThe flare-up is hardly an outlier for Maher, who has previosly crticized the “woke left”—especially its wealthiest spokespeople. He has repeatedly framed celebrity activism as a net negative for Democrats, insisting that Hollywood’s loudest voices do more harm than good.\n\nMaher mocked stars who wore Ukrainian flags last year, dismissing them as “virtue-signaling body ornaments.” “They’re just crucifixes for liberals,” he said.\n\nHe also took direct aim at celebrities who backed Kamala Harris during her failed 2024 presidential run, name-checking figures like George Clooney, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift. Their involvement, Maher argued, didn’t elevate Harris—it reinforced the perception that Democrats are out of touch with ordinary voters. Celebrity endorsements, he said, are not political assets but liabilities.\n\nWhile he now insists celebrities should stick to distracting us from world issues, he has previously praised famous figures as a “force for good” capable of advancing social change. \n\nMaher leaned fully into the latter framing on Friday, arguing that wealth and privilege fundamentally disqualify stars from speaking credibly about most political issues. \n\n“Celebrities don’t strike people as relatable,” he said. “What their activism mostly activates is eye rolls—because stars, they’re not just like us. They’re just not.”\n\nTo drive the point home, Maher rattled off examples of what he sees as Hollywood excess: Gwyneth Paltrow’s vagina-scented candles, Johnny Depp buying entire towns, Tyler Perry and Shakira purchasing private islands, and Holly Madison insuring her breasts for $1 million. \n\nThese are not voices of the working class, Maher said, but rather “insulated divas” gorging themselves on luxury while lecturing voters about morality.","summary":"Noam Galai / Getty ImagesBill Maher is once again taking up the mantle of being Hollywood’s anti-woke crusader—this time unloading on celebrity activism, which he says is handing elections to Republicans.\n\nOn Friday’s episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, the 70-year-old host took aim at what he calls “poser” politics, ripping celebrities who use awards shows, red carpets, and social media to signal political values. \n\nAccording to Maher, the spectacle doesn’t inspire voters—it repels them. “Read the room, Democrats,” he warned, arguing that celebrity political posturing mostly activates eye rolls, not turnout. “You’re making independents vote Republican,” Maher said.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/bill-maher-torches-celebrity-activism-for-pushing-americans-to-maga/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/OCCZM5ZO3FCXLJQA7RTFCWBJOM.jpg?smart=true&auth=b94b10518ec6663f4efa05ead61f6015955b14bcf96d4447f3521b2d373c96ad&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 17:33:25","author":"Tamilore Oshikanlu","authors":["Tamilore Oshikanlu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":398091362,"title":"Lady Gaga faces backlash after anti-ICE rant during Tokyo concert","text":"Lady Gaga faced mixed reactions online this week after a video surfaced of her pausing a concert in Tokyo, Japan, to condemn ICE enforcement operations. \"I want to take a second to talk about something that is extremely important to me, something important to people all over the world, and especially in America right now,\" the 39-year-old singer said in the middle of her Mayhem Ball concert on Thursday. \"In a couple of days, I'm going to be heading home, and my heart is aching thinking about the people, the children, the families all over America who are being mercilessly targeted by ICE.

And now those chickens have come home to roost. People who insisted on punishing Democrats—even though Harris was demonstrably better than Trump on Gaza—are discovering that “worse” was not an abstraction. There are real-world consequences.\n\nA Facebook post by a Florida woman, which surfaced in the r/LeopardsAteMyFace subreddit, is indicative of that crowd. The subreddit is named after the meme in which people are shocked that the policies or politicians they supported ended up personally harming them—voting for the leopards, then acting stunned when your face gets eaten.\n\nI voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. I was one of his staunchest defenders. By 2024, I was aware of his immoral-and frankly insane-perspective on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and my morals would not allow me to vote for him. But I did believe he was the better option between him and Kamala, considering her cabinet was actively funding a genocide.\n\nShe thought Trump was “insane” on her biggest issue and said that she couldn’t vote for him. Fair enough. \n\nBut, as so often happens with people trying to square their past Trump support, that admission is immediately followed by “but Kamala would’ve been worse.” Worse how, exactly, is rarely explained—especially since Harris’ nonexistent, entirely imagined Cabinet was supposedly “actively funding” something that the GOP-controlled Congress also funded.\n\nI believed Trump's ego would be too powerful to allow Netanyahu to humiliate him in front of the American public, and I thought he couldn't be bought. I was wrong.\n\nImagine thinking that Trump couldn’t be bought. \n\nIn his first month in office, his so-called \"budget cuts\" resulted in my husband losing his job providing home modifications for the disabled, our family losing our health insurance, and the complete dismantling of my son's special education department.\n\nHer husband works with disabled people. Seems pretty woke. It also seems like her son has some sort of learning disability—and she’s been voting Republican? \n\nPut Gaza aside for a moment. This is someone whose family literally depends on government programs and funding to survive, and yet she says she used to be among Trump’s “staunchest defenders.” It’s a compounding series of catastrophically bad judgments, each one maximizing the harm to her own family.\n\nMeanwhile, he rewarded his donors with billions and pardoned his white-collar friends who caused such immense suffering and loss.\n\nTrump did that during his first term, and she still voted for him again in 2020. You know who didn’t reward their donors with billions and pardon their white-collar friends? Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and so on. Harris would have governed with the same ethical baseline.\n\nHe, along with his carnival sideshow of appointees, has humiliated us on the world stage. He's threatened our allies. He's intensified our financial crisis while convincing Americans that other poor people are the cause of their suffering. I've watched Americans abducted off the streets for exercising their First Amendment rights. Even more frightening, I've watched Americans perform mental gymnastics to explain why the First Amendment is not a right. The same is now happening with the Second Amendment as we speak-all while he entertains bi-monthly slumber parties with a wanted war criminal.\n\nSo I want to be snarky here, but it’s actually impressive to see someone who used to be enmeshed in the MAGA cult emerge and see reality for the first time. \n\nIn 2026, basic empathy is shamed because he's normalized cruelty. I am convinced this administration could curb-stomp a baby on live television and people would still make excuses for it. Your patriotism has become loyalism. This is not unique in history. We know how this ends. It's not too late-but it's pretty fucking close.\n\nIf only there had been warning signs that Trump could, say, “shoot someone on 5th Avenue” and not lose voters. \n\nOkay, I admit it: It’s hard to resist the instinct to scream “I told you so!” repeatedly. But unlike many people who sour on Trump while still insisting Harris would’ve been worse, this woman appears to be genuinely rethinking things. Her mostly private Facebook page now includes a video of Democrats grilling Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, tagged with #firenoem.\n\nThat matters, because she lives in a swing county outside of Tampa—exactly the kind of place where marginal shifts decide elections. One person changing their mind isn’t just a personal journey. In a county like that, it ripples outward to friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors who are far more likely to trust someone they know than a politician they don’t.\n\nI can’t hide my frustration that what was obvious to 75,017,613 of us who voted for Harris somehow eluded so many. But it’s worth remembering how close this country actually is. \n\nLast year, Republicans held a narrow 46–45% partisan advantage, according to Pew Research. The year before that, Democrats led 49–48%. We are, for all intents and purposes, a 50–50 nation.\n\nShift that balance by just 5 points and suddenly it’s 55–45—an advantage that’s durable, resilient, and resistant to the small electoral shifts that elected Trump twice. That’s how you build an enduring governing majority.\n\nSo yes, it’s tempting to throw up our hands in exasperation. But the path forward runs straight through moments like this—people opening their eyes to the reality of Trump’s America, then having the courage to say so out loud to a circle of likely Republican voters. That’s how change actually happens.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

Contrary to the president’s claims, there are no sold-out screenings or lines around the block. There are no viral clips, no TikTok reactions from red hat superfans and no manufactured outrage that turns into free publicity. The film is opening to near-empty theaters not because critics hate it, or because liberals are boycotting it, but because MAGA voters simply do not care.\n\nJeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon, appears to have believed that overpaying wildly for a lavish documentary about Melania Trump, promoting it aggressively and rolling out the black carpet at the Kennedy Center would curry favor with Trumpworld. (To be fair, after sitting on the dais at the president’s inauguration in January 2025 and donating a million dollars to the festivities, his company secured a billion-dollar cloud computing contract with the administration.) But MAGA is not moved by “cinematic viewing.” It only shows up for grievance theater. \n\nMelania’s defining characteristic is absence — and it’s done nothing to cultivate a sense of mystique for the first lady. So when a documentary arrives asking audiences to take her seriously as a subject — as a person with insight, depth or meaning — it runs into a problem that money cannot solve: There is no demand. The movie offers no liberal villain to boo. No immigrant, protester or bureaucrat to blame. Just a carefully curated exercise in nothingness, presented as importance.\n\nWhatever MAGA imagines Melania to be — “classy” and “Jackie Kennedy-like” — it’s not relatable. Trump rallies work because they are loud, ugly, combative and fueled by a sense of shared resentment. Right-wing media succeeds when it feeds that anger. Melania offers none of it. She has never been a participant in the MAGA movement. She does not speak its language. She barely appears alongside her husband, and when she does, her body language often reads as reluctant at best, contemptuous at worst. That’s why, in over a decade, MAGA has never developed emotional attachment to Melania as a cultural figure.\n\nNormally, I would say there is a special kind of failure reserved for political vanity projects that can’t even succeed as a joke, but the Trump years have exhausted irony. The idea of watching a carefully lit, heavily scored portrait of Melania in a movie theater feels less like satire and more like homework about decaying empires. \n\nThe promotional tour for the film was the first clue it was going to be a box office dud. It started with Saturday’s screening at the White House, which took place as a major snowstorm hit much of the nation and as Minneapolis erupted in violence after the ICE shooting of Veterans Affairs nurse Alex Pretti. Instead of celebrities, the invited guests included corporate honchos like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon Studios chief Mike Hopkins and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. The first lady then went on a limited run across the Fox News network, bizarrely revealing that her vision of Making America Great Again — ”unity” — apparently means the country coming together to support her husband and his ambition to gobble up as much power as possible. \n\nIn a softball appearance on “The Five” the first lady claimed her husband is a unifier. “He’s unifier not just here in United States, but around the world. He stopped many wars,” she explained. “Here in United States, it’s a lot of opposition, and that’s the problem, right? So the people not agreeing with everything that he does, and you know, they just need to come on the same page and see that he wants to make America only safer and better.”\n\nThe next day, on Fox Business News’ “Mornings with Maria Baritoromo,” Melania elaborated further when asked about the advice she offers her president, arguing that domestic opposition is the real issue and appeared to suggest that critics just need to agree with whatever her husband says. “Well, you know it is very hard no matter what he says, they don’t like to listen.”\n\n“What’s going on in our country now,” the first lady said, “is a lot of pushback. And I hope it stops.”\n\nMelania gives nothing and expects the world. Her solution to political division is simply submission to her husband. But MAGA voters know it’s not that simple. The MAGA creed depends on the idea that Trump is fighting corrupt elites on behalf of ordinary people. Watching his family collect a payday equivalent to decades of presidential salary from one of the richest men on Earth punctures that story. The involvement of director Brett Ratner, who has faced multiple accounts of sexual harassment and assault, doesn’t help. Even for MAGA, there is little thrill in watching the powerful protect the disgraced. \n\nWant more sharp takes on politics?

MAGA has been conditioned to be deeply suspicious of anything that smells like elite approval. Right-wing media has spent years training its followers to believe that documentaries are propaganda — unless they come from explicitly partisan outlets. \n\nBut there is little concern that Bezos is worried about a return on his investment. The spectacle perfectly captures the rot at the intersection of wealth, power and media. The Wall Street Journal reported that Melania Trump herself pocketed more than 70% of the $40 million rights fee, over $28 million, for participating in this hagiography. \n\nTed Hope, a former Amazon film executive, told the New York Times that the movie has to be the “most expensive documentary ever made that didn’t involve music licensing.” He added, “How can it not be equated with currying favor or an outright bribe? How can that not be the case?”\n\nMeanwhile, at the Washington Post, the newspaper Bezos purchased in 2013 with promises to safeguard its democratic mission, the newsroom has bled talent for months. Star political reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer all fled to other publications. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after the Post declined to publish a satirical cartoon critical of Bezos himself. More than a dozen columnists, like 39-year veteran Marc Fisher, were shown the door. “Democracy Dies in Darkness” became the paper’s motto in 2017, during Trump’s first term, when Bezos appeared to back aggressive accountability journalism. Now the paper’s owner is turning out the lights himself.\n\nThis is happening at the same institution that hemorrhaged more than 250,000 subscribers after the mogul blocked the editorial board from endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. That decision alone, transparently timed to curry favor with a Trump administration Bezos anticipated would return to power, sparked a credibility crisis in addition to the mass cancellations. \n\nThe message was unmistakable: Bezos would prioritize his business interests over journalistic integrity. The subsequent talent exodus confirmed what many had long suspected. This is not just cowardice, it’s collaboration.","summary":"Jeff Bezos' big gamble to impress Trump isn't paying off with fans","url":"https://www.salon.com/2026/01/31/why-maga-wont-rally-for-melania-documentary/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2026/01/Melania-Trump-2258386942-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 15:45:00","author":"Sophia Tesfaye","authors":["Sophia Tesfaye"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":398054408,"title":"GOP panics as election-rigging schemes threaten backfire: 'What the hell is going on?'","text":"GOP reversals in this year’s elections, especially in some urban and immigrant communities, are setting off alarm bells for Republicans using redistricting to try to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterms.\n\nRedistricting plans demanded by President Donald Trump in states such as Texas and Missouri — meant to capitalize on his stronger showing among certain urban voters in the 2024 election — could backfire, as cities in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia returned to Democratic voting patterns in off-year elections this past November.\n\nExperts see the shift as a sign of possible souring on the administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, combined with disappointment in economic conditions.\n\nPaul Brace, an emeritus political science professor of legal studies at Rice University in Houston, said Texas Republicans are likely to gain less than they imagine from new maps designed to pick up five additional seats for the party. He said minority voters’ interest in Trump was “temporary” and that he had underperformed on the economy.\n\n“Trump’s redistricting efforts are facing headwinds and, even in Texas, may not yield all he had hoped,” Brace said.\n\nRedistricting efforts in Texas spawned a retaliatory plan in California aimed at getting five more Democratic seats. Other states have leapt into the fray, with Republicans claiming an overall edge of three potential seats in proposed maps.\n\nCuban-born Jose Arango, chair of the Hudson County Republican Party in New Jersey, said immigration enforcement has gone too far and caused a backlash at the polls.\n\n“There are people in the administration who frankly don’t know what the hell is going on,” Arango said. “If you arrest criminals, God bless you. We don’t want criminals in our streets. But then you deport people who have been here 30 years, 20 years, and have contributed to society, have been good people for the United States. You go into any business in agriculture, the hospitality business, even the guy who cuts the grass — they’re all undocumented. Who’s going to pick our tomatoes?”\n\nAs immigration arrests increase this year, a growing share of those detained have no criminal convictions.\n\nNew Jersey’s 9th Congressional District, which includes urban Paterson, went from a surprising Trump win last year to a lopsided victory this year for Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. Trump won the district last year by 3 percentage points and Sherrill won by 16 points. The district is majority-minority and 39% immigrant.\n\nThere was a similar turnaround in Miami, a majority-immigrant city that elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in almost 30 years. Parts of immigrant-rich Northern Virginia also shifted in the governor’s race there.\n\nIn the New Jersey district, Billy Prempeh, a Republican whose parents emigrated from Ghana, lost a surprisingly close 2024 race for U.S. House to Democrat Nellie Pou, of Puerto Rican descent, who became the first Latina from New Jersey to serve in Congress.\n\nPrempeh this year launched another campaign for the seat, but withdrew after Sherrill won the governor’s race, telling Stateline that any Republican who runs for that seat “is going to get slaughtered.”\n\nPrempeh doesn’t blame Trump or more aggressive immigration enforcement for the shift. He said his parents and their family waited years to get here legally, and he objects to people being allowed to stay for court dates after they crossed the border with Mexico.\n\n“We aren’t deporting enough people. Not everybody agrees with me on that,” Prempeh said.\n\nParts of Virginia saw similar voting pattern changes. Prince William County, south of Washington, D.C., saw support for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger jump to 67% compared with 57% for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last year. The county is about 26% immigrant and 27% Hispanic.\n\nAsian American and Hispanic voters shifted more Democratic this year in both New Jersey and Virginia, said J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, expanding on a November post on the subject.\n\nHowever, some of those Virginia voters might have sat out the governor’s race, Coleman said.\n\n“I do think there is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year,” Coleman said. “There were many heavily Asian and Hispanic precincts in Northern Virginia that saw this huge percentage swing from Harris to Spanberger, but also saw relatively weak turnout.”\n\nThe pattern is “hard to extrapolate” to Texas or other states with new maps, Coleman said, “but Democrats are probably liking what they saw in this year’s elections.”\n\nHe said one of the redrawn districts in Texas is now likely to go to Democrats: the majority-Hispanic 28th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and South Texas. And the nearby 34th Congressional District is now a tossup instead of leaning Republican, according to new Center for Politics projections.\n\nThe pattern in New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District this year was consistent in Hispanic areas statewide, according to an analysis provided to Stateline by Michael Foley, elections coordinator of State Navigate, a Virginia-based nonprofit that analyzes state election data.\n\nNew Jersey Hispanic precincts “swung heavily” toward Sherrill compared with their 2024 vote for Harris, Foley said in an email. He noted that New Jersey and Florida Hispanic populations are largely from the Caribbean and may not reflect patterns elsewhere, such as Texas where the Hispanic population is heavily Mexican American.\n\nPou, who won the New Jersey seat, said economics played a part in this year’s electoral shift.\n\n“The President made a promise to my constituents that he’d lower costs and instead he’s made the problem worse with his tariffs that raised costs across the board,” Pou said in a statement to Stateline.\n\nMicah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said immigration and pocketbook issues both played a role in places like the 9th District, as did an influx of Democratic campaign money.\n\n“The biggest reason is a sense of letdown in President Trump,” Rasmussen said. “There were many urban voters who decided they liked what Trump was saying, they liked the Hispanic outreach, they bought into his economic message. And just one year later, they’re equally disillusioned.”\n\nStateline reporter Tim Henderson can be reached at thenderson@stateline.org.","url":"https://www.rawstory.com/gop-panics-as-election-rigging-schemes-threaten-backfire-what-the-hell-is-going-on/","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/stand-up-and-fight-gop-moderate-94-gerrymandered-by-dems-warns-of-texas-push.jpg?id=61474261&width=1200&height=1200&coordinates=912%2C0%2C912%2C0","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 14:29:12","author":"Tim Henderson","authors":["Tim Henderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":398015906,"title":"Trump and his fellow 'macho men' rule Washington","text":"I was sitting in the waiting room of the hospital reading the newspaper while my wife, Marianne, was having a routine outpatient procedure.\n\nWhen a nurse finally came in to tell me the procedure was over and that we would soon be free to leave, she smiled and added, “Nice purse you have there.”\n\nThe purse was turquoise with dark blue, swirly images of palm trees, which was, I admit, appealing.\n\nShe, of course, was proffering a well-worn joke about a man and a purse, which, by custom in our country, is exclusive to women. It was Marianne’s, and I didn’t give a thought to holding it for her, a fact the nurse likely registered from my equanimous smile.\n\nI have no anxiety about manhood or how I am perceived based on superficial manifestations, whether it’s a colorful purse or a pink suitcase, which I do happen to use since pink was the American Tourister selection discounted 40% on Amazon.\n\nI also must confess to having taken pleasure, in my 20s, in upsetting stereotypes held by friends on the right about liberal, socially conscious English teachers, when I bested them in football and softball, and then afterward in the sports bar at arm wrestling.\n\nI wasn’t always so confident.

From adding 19 new commentators, including some drawn from The Free Press ranks, to introducing new podcasts, newsletters and live events, employees were variously energized or skeptical of the ideas presented by CBS' new boss. Weiss' notions about how to thrive in a post-Walter Cronkite era struck some as in conflict with the stated mission of doing great journalism, according to seven current and former CBS News employees and industry insiders. In her presentation, Weiss also envisioned a galaxy of cross-platform stars, like New York Times columnist and CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin, whom she highlighted with a meme: \"Sorkining.\" The Dealbook founder is the author of several business books, executive producer of the Showtime series \"Billions,\" and maestro of the New York Times premiere live event, and a Davos fixture. \"It's like saying 'Hey, Hollywood. Why can't you just be like Leonardo DiCaprio?' If people knew how to bottle that magic and make someone a star, they would do it,\" said a former CBS employee. An industry veteran said the idea suggested a lack of appreciation for the power of television, which has been making stars for generations: among them \"CBS Evening News\" anchors Dan Rather, Connie Chung, Walter Cronkite and Katie Couric. The 41-year-old Weiss, who has no broadcast experience and has been described as a distant leader by six current and former CBS News sources, now has to deliver on her promise of capturing new and younger viewers - including political independents who don't see themselves reflected in mainstream media. It is a daunting undertaking that has hobbled executives across broadcast and cable, including former CNN chief Chris Licht, ousted in June 2023. One supporter sees the charismatic Weiss as a modern-day Katharine Graham, the legendary publisher of the Washington Post, who was undermined by underlings when she took over in 1963. Graham transformed the paper and led it through its Watergate-era heyday, and generally left editorial decisions to Executive Editor Ben Bradlee. A current staffer, speaking on background, said, \"People are saying, 'Let's give her a chance' ... I want to see her succeed. If she succeeds, we all succeed.\" CBS News and Weiss did not immediately respond to requests for comment. PRIORITIES FOR CBS NEWS Weiss, a former opinion journalist and media entrepreneur, joined CBS after parent Paramount owner David Ellison bought her five-year-old media company, The Free Press, for $150 million in October. Some see Weiss' playbook of expanding CBS's journalism ranks with commentators as conflicting with other initiatives including breaking news and landing deep investigative stories, according to three current and former CBS News staffers and an industry veteran. \"There's nothing wrong with that,\" said the former employee. \"But is that what a news division is or are they craving something completely different? That's fine but don't pretend it's a news division.\" Another current CBS News staffer talked about past failures to capitalize on new ways of reaching the audience, such as leveraging the power of the Paramount+ streaming service to promote news shows, observing, \"We have done a wretched job of being on the internet.\" Weiss is also attempting to change the news network's political orientation, appealing to a wider cross-section of Americans, according to her remarks Tuesday. Weiss said she wants CBS News to reflect the friction animating the national conversation. In broadening its perspective to include more diverse viewpoints, CBS News could ultimately lay claim to the uncharted ground for a center-right broadcaster, said Integrated Media Chief Executive Jonathan Miller, a veteran media executive who has held senior positions at News Corp and AOL. \"We need to commission and greenlight stories that will surprise and provoke - including inside our own newsroom,\" Weiss said in her address to employees. \"We also have to widen the aperture of the stories we tell.\" On that front, CBS has had mixed results so far. Earlier this month, \"CBS Evening News\" broadcast a widely panned segment featuring U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in various meme-like situations, saluting him as \"the ultimate Florida man.\" EARLY SUCCESSES It has also seen successes, including Lesley Stahl's interview with Trump son-in-law and Middle East advisor Jared Kushner and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, within a week of brokering a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, and Norah O'Donnell's \"60 Minutes\" interview with Trump. Paramount paid Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over its editing of an interview with his White House rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris. It landed journalistic scoops, including interviewing the man who charged one of two gunmen who attacked a Jewish community gathering in Sydney, and exclusive video of Alex Pretti, the man killed by Border Patrol in Minneapolis, reading a tribute to a veteran who died in 2024. Weiss announced that the network would bring in contributors with expertise in politics, health, happiness, food and culture, whom she encouraged staffers to use on-air. The roster includes Free Press columnist Niall Ferguson of the conservative Hoover Institution, as well as Casey Lewis, a former Teen Vogue and MTV editor who writes about youth culture. \"It's great to have younger people, a diverse demographic and diverse ideology represented,\" said Kathy Kiely, the chair in Free-Press Studies at the Missouri School of Journalism. \"Newsrooms can't do a good job unless we have that diversity in our ranks. What worries me is the emphasis on opinion over primary-sourced, reported facts.\" Weiss emphasized making content available online before it airs on TV to reach more viewers. CBS has long been in third place behind rivals ABC and NBC and, like most mainstream media, is struggling with audience declines as consumers migrate to social platforms. Pew Research estimates about one-third of all adults get at least some news from podcasts. CBS News does not appear among Spotify's or Apple's rankings of the top 50 news podcasts. One former employee expects the digital-first goal to be complicated because CBS hasn't devoted sufficient resources to helping correspondents or anchors curate their social media presence or re-edit television interviews for YouTube or streaming. Weiss encouraged staffers to think of the news organization as the best-capitalized media startup in the world. \"We are in a position, with the support of all of the leadership of this company, to really make the change we need.\" (Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; editing by Jennifer Saba, Ken Li, Michael Learmonth and Nick Zieminski) By Dawn Chmielewski and Helen Coster","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/cbs-news-chief-weiss-touts-commentator-push-draws-mixed-reaction-in-newsroom-ce7e5bddd881f320","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0//images/reuters/2025-10/2025-10-06T123844Z_1_LYNXNPEL950JR_RTROPTP_4_MILKEN-CONFERENCE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 11:01:18","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.242},{"id":398012080,"title":"House GOP majority on the brink as all-Democrat Texas special congressional election underway","text":"Republicans are clinging to a razor-thin 218-213 House majority. And the GOP's margin will shrink even further after a special congressional election this weekend to fill the seat in a Democrat-dominated district which has been vacant for nearly a year. That's because the two candidates in Saturday's runoff election in Texas' 18th Congressional District are both Democrats. Voters in the district, which is anchored by downtown Houston and surrounding areas, head to the polls to choose a successor to fill the seat left vacant when Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner died last March. Sylvester, a former longtime state lawmaker, served two terms as Houston mayor before winning election to Congress in 2024, succeeding the late longtime Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. DEMOCRATIC TAKEOVER FEARS SOAR AS HOUSE REPUBLICANS CLING TO FRAGILE MAJORITY Democrats Christian Menefee, a former attorney for Houston's Harris County, and former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards are facing off in the special election. They were the top two finishers in a field of 16 candidates that faced off in an initial election in November. While Texas has redrawn its congressional maps for the 2026 midterms, as part of the high-stakes redistricting battle between President Donald Trump and Republicans versus Democrats, the special election will use the state's current district lines. CASH SURGE: HOUSE GOP SPOTLIGHTS RECORD FUNDRAISING AHEAD OF MIDTERM CLASH The winner of the special election will give the Democrats one additional House member, giving Republican leadership further headaches. \"They'd better be here,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson recently said of his members. \"I told everybody, and not in jest, I said, no adventure sports, no risk-taking, take your vitamins. Stay healthy and be here.\" And House Majority Whip Tom Emmer’s office confirmed it is advising members that \"outside of life-and-death circumstances,\" they expect Republican lawmakers to be on Capitol Hill. Three other special congressional elections are on tap this year. Eleven candidates are running in the Feb. 5 Democratic Party primary in New Jersey's 11th Congressional District. The seat was left vacant after now New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill stepped down after winning November's gubernatorial election in the Garden State. The winner of the Democratic primary will face off with Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway, the only Republican to file for the special election, which will be held on April 16. The suburban district in northern New Jersey leans to the left, with Sherrill winning re-election in 2024 by 15 points, the same margin she carried the district in November's gubernatorial showdown. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: HOUSE EXODUS THREATENS JOHNSON'S GRIP ON POWER AS OVER 40 MEMBERS HEAD FOR EXIT But then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by just eight points in the 2024 presidential election, giving the GOP some hopes of possibly flipping the seat. A whopping 22 candidates, including 17 Republicans, are running in a special election in Georgia's 14th Congressional District, in the race to succeed former GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The MAGA firebrand and one-time top Trump House ally four weeks ago stepped down from Congress a year before her term ended. According to Georgia state law, all the candidates will run on the same ballot. If no contender tops 50% of the vote, a runoff election between the top two finishers will take place on April 7. The district in northwestern Georgia is solidly Republican, with Greene winning re-election in 2024 by nearly 30 points and Trump carrying the district by 37 points. Primary Day in California for the 2026 elections is scheduled for June 2, and this year it will also include a primary for the special election in the state's 1st Congressional District, in the race to fill a seat left vacant following the recent unexpected death of Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa. The general election will be held on Aug. 4. The district, in northeastern California, is solidly Republican. Similar to Texas, California is also altering its congressional maps as part of the redistricting wars, but the special election will be held under the current district lines. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The White House and congressional Republicans criticized the decision by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to not hold a special election to fill LaMalfa's seat until August, six months after the late congressman's death. But Democrats similarly complained about Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas not scheduling the special election to fill Turner's seat until eight months after the late lawmaker died.

In a message dated April 1, 2003, he expressed to Maxwell, “Where are you, I miss you. I will be in NYC for 4 days starting April 22… can we book that massage now?”\n\nTwo days later, Maxwell, now 64, responded with playful banter, asking, “All that rubbing – are you sure you can take it?”\n\nShe further teased, “There are a few spots that apparently drive a man wild – I suppose I could practice them on you and you could let me know if they work or not?”\n\nDuring this exchange of suggestive emails and plans for a massage, Wasserman’s wife was eight months pregnant with their son. The Daily Mail has sought a response from Wasserman regarding these revelations.\n\nWasserman is a major figure in Hollywood as a top music and movie agency chief behind such music greats as Coldplay and Ed Sheeran. He also brought Billie Eilish into his roster by acquiring music agency Paradigm in 2021.\n\nVIP guests to his 600-person 50th birthday bash in Santa Monica in June 2024 included former president Bill Clinton, ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris’s husband Doug Emhoff.\n\nAbsent – and behind bars for grooming, trafficking, and abusing minors with Epstein – was Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell signed off many of her messages to him with ‘Kisses’, and he with ‘xoxo’, the emails released by the DOJ reveal.\n\nWhen Wasserman described LA’s often overcast June weather in one 2003 email, Maxwell replied with a raunchy response.\n\n‘What foggy enough so that you can float naked down the beach and no one can see you unless they are close up?’ she wrote in the April 7, 2003 email, adding: ‘Or something like that…’\n\nOn April 6, 2003, Maxwell wrote him: ‘Thought you might like to know I am now in Paris – can I bring you back anything from Here?’\n\nHe replied: ‘The only thing that i want from paris is you.’\n\nThe next day Maxwell was discussing combinations of edible treats she could bring him from her trip to London.\n\n‘Ok, so that combo did not do it for you, what combo would then?’ She asked. ‘You, me, and not else much…’ he replied.\n\nOther emails show Maxwell arranging a trip from Los Angeles to New York on his jet.\n\nThe Daily Mail previously obtained an undated photo of a younger Wasserman with Epstein and Maxwell in front of a private plane.\n\nFlight logs from Epstein’s jet show Wasserman and his then-wife flew with Epstein, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker to Africa for an HIV charity event in 2002.\n\nThere is no suggestion Wasserman took part in any of Epstein’s crimes, and the Africa trip took place before the criminal investigation into his sex trafficking began.\n\nThe highly flirtatious messages may prove embarrassing for the LA28 chief, who has already had to contend with allegations of repeated romantic affairs with his own staffers that allegedly occurred throughout his marriage.\n\nEleven sources – including some of his alleged mistresses – provided information to the Daily Mail in 2024 about his alleged womanizing over the years.\n\nWasserman reportedly ‘love bombed’ potential conquests, showered them with Louboutin shoes, La Perla lingerie, handbags, and even Range Rovers – but when his interest waned he callously dropped them like a hot potato, sources claimed.\n\nHe was accused of a string of romantic relationships with his employees – including his secretary Patricia Feau who now works in a $350,000 salary job on the LA28 Olympic nonprofit, his former private jet flight attendant Jenny Chandler, who is his current girlfriend, and another flight attendant whose clients include the Playboy publisher.\n\nFeau denied the affair when contacted by the Daily Mail. Wasserman did not respond, but later dismissed the allegations as gossip.\n\n‘If The Daily Mail qualifies as reporting, then I guess we’re all in trouble,’ Wasserman told CNBC in September 2024. ‘But we live in a day and age where people can say whatever they want without facts, without cooperation, without sources, and it’s the world we live in.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe head of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, a prominent figure in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Controversial Emails Revealed: LA Olympics Chair&#8217;s Flirty Correspondence with Epstein Uncovered first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/controversial-emails-revealed-la-olympics-chairs-flirty-correspondence-with-epstein-uncovered/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LA-Olympics-chairs-VERY-flirty-emails-exposed-in-Epstein-files.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 09:32:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.021},{"id":398005888,"title":"David M. Drucker: Democrats have to stop dodging trans rights","text":"Some of the prominent Democrats interested in pursuing the presidency appear confused about what it takes to win the White House.\n\nHow else to explain their ducking and dissembling on the politically charged issue of transgender rights, helpfully reported by the \"Axios 2028\" newsletter. Reporters Alex Thompson and Holly Otterbein asked roughly 20 prominent Democrats the following: Should transgender girls be allowed to participate in girls' sports? Should transgender minors receive puberty blockers and hormones? Can a man become a woman? Several, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, declined to comment or did not respond.\n\nDemocrats may view these queries as \"gotcha\" questions. Maybe they are. It doesn't matter.\n\nTransgender rights, especially as they relate to girls' athletics, continue to be a major flashpoint at all levels of government. And even if you believe it's a wedge that Republicans invented to divide Democrats, it's one of those topics on which voters expect politicians to have an opinion. Candidates who regularly hide from tough questions tend to lose competitive campaigns.\n\nLiam Kerr, cofounder of Welcome PAC, a Democratic-aligned group pushing the party to embrace mainstream positions on key issues, told Axios that adhering to best practices for successful candidates requires having a \"clear answer, whatever it is,\" to questions about transgender rights. I asked Kerr to elaborate. \"Delegitimizing the question is unsustainable,\" he told me. \"It's hard to convince neutral observers that questions repeatedly asked by trusted nonpartisan pollsters, like the Pew Research Center, Gallup and KFF, are somehow beyond the pale for journalists to ask presidential candidates.\"\n\nDemocrats who have firm convictions one way or the other - for or against - should say so. They'd get points for candor, at least. President Donald Trump has certainly proven that voters are willing to support candidates they disagree with-if politicians are authentic and confident.\n\nTo be sure, a clear answer would spark some disagreement. No doubt the Democratic base would take issue with a presidential primary candidate who, for instance, opposed transgender girls competing in women's sports. Progressives tend to be strong supporters of expansive transgender rights, especially as related to health care and workplace discrimination, in addition to the issue of sports participation.\n\nBut the broader electorate would approve. Transgender rights are one of those \"70/30\" issues, as political professionals tend to describe them, and that's where the Democratic nominee should aim to be, explained Lanae Erickson, senior vice president for social policy, education and politics at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank in Washington. \"You obviously want to be somewhere in the realm of where voters are,\" she said.\n\nThird Way's political guidance is based on 30-plus rounds of polling, focus groups and other research into voter sentiment on transgender rights and related issues. On the issue of transgender girls participating in female athletics, the winning position is one that accepts inherent biological differences between the sexes, validates voters' concerns about fairness and supports rules to preserve competitiveness - but locally and case-by-case rather than through blanket government bans.\n\nThe think tank's research has firmly established that rules restricting transgender girls' participation in girls' sports, on fairness grounds, are popular with voters and viewed as commonsensical. In other words, the politics of this issue has not changed since the 2024 election and the devastating impact of a Trump campaign advertisement that declared Vice President Kamala Harris \"is for they/them.\"\n\nThat this particular ad so damaged Harris's campaign raises another red flag for Democrats hoping to sidestep questions about transgender rights.\n\nThe former vice president was vulnerable to this attack because of comments she made during her short-lived 2020 White House bid, during which she affirmed support for gender-transition health care for inmates in the federal prison system. That campaign unfolded in a political environment that saw the Democratic Party embrace far-reaching policies on transgender rights that were unpopular with the public writ large. Harris could have saved herself a lot of grief four years later if she had dared to tell the progressive base \"no.\"\n\nIronically, telling the base \"no,\" even amid a competitive primary, can be the surest path to the nomination - and the Oval Office. Why is that?\n\nHere's what Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's first White House chief of staff and a potential 2028 contender, had to say on the matter when I interviewed him for The Dispatch late last month. \"People, to project you in the Oval, they've got to see that you have strength,\" he said. \"If you're willing to tell a member of the family: ‘Shut the f-k up'-it's not what you pick that counts, it's that you willingly have balls to do it.\"\n\nAfter November's midterm elections, the race for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination is going to get underway in earnest. By then, Democratic contenders will need to have better answers to the question What's your position on transgender rights? Otherwise, this and other contested cultural issues could stand between Democrats and the White House - no matter how unpopular Trump gets.\n\nThis column reflects the personal views of the author and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nDavid M.

The whole Sanctuary state program has been a disaster,“ Blakeman, who currently serves as the chief executive of Nassau County, said in an exclusive interview at Newsweek's Manhattan office on Tuesday. In 2017, former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order that restricted state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration agents. Cuomo, in 2018, made another executive order stating that federal immigration agents can only make civil arrests at state facilities if they have a judicial warrant or order. New York City implemented similar sanctuary policies as early as 1989. “I would cooperate with ICE and I would sign an executive order the first day I get into office that we are no longer a sanctuary state,“ Blakeman said. Beyond immigration, Blakeman is sounding the alarm on the high cost of living in New York, lamenting the fact that New Yorkers are leaving the state for more affordable places to live. He believes his record in Nassau County demonstrates a record of creating economic success, while he blames Democratic policies for causing the current problems. “There's reasons why hundreds of thousands of people have left the state and gone to South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, and Florida because they've gone to places where their families can live a better life, a more affordable life,“ he said. Republican Bruce Blakeman announces his run for New York governor on Fox & Friends at Fox News Channel Studios on December 9, 2025, in New York City. Blakeman's entrance into the 2026 governor's race caused a stir among New York Republicans, who were largely aligning behind Representative Elise Stefanik. Trump had seen Stefanik as a close ally in Congress, while he had long been close with Blakeman as well. When asked about the developing primary between the two in mid-December, Trump described Stefanik and Blakeman as “two fantastic people,“ declining to throw full support behind either. Stefanik dropped out days later, citing her young son and saying she wanted to spend more time with her family. She also said she didn't think it was good for Republicans to have an “unnecessary and protracted“ primary. Many interpreted the decision as frustration with Trump for not endorsing her campaign. “I think she'll have a very bright future if she wants to get back into politics,“ Blakeman said when asked about her decision. He also described the congresswoman as “very effective“ in Congress and as “very bright, very articulate.“ While Trump endorsed Blakeman after Stefanik dropped out in December and the county executive appears all but certain to be the Republican nominee for governor, the general election in which he is expected to run against incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul will be an uphill battle. The last Republican to win the governorship in New York was George Pataki, who left office 20 years ago in 2006. Republicans, however, have made substantial gains in New York in recent election cycles. Trump lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris by 12.6 points in 2024, whereas former President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had both beaten him by about 23 points in 2020 and 2016, respectively. Republicans have also managed to flip and hold several formerly Democratic House districts in recent cycles. Blakeman notes that he also has won multiple times in a Democratic-leaning county. “I just won re-election in a county with 110,000 more Democrats than Republicans. And my county is basically a mirror image of the state. Our demographics are almost exactly the same,“ he said, adding that he “won in landslide“ because his constituents like his “policies.“ Whether he can translate that success to the state level will be determined in November. Blakeman laid out more about his plans for New York's economy, immigration concerns and his thoughts on Trump's policies in a wide-ranging interview with Newsweek. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Bruce Blakeman Interview Transcript Newsweek: First off, we've just had this big storm in New York. How's your county doing? And also, what's your perspective on the Governor Hochul's response to the situation? Bruce Blakeman: My county's doing very well. This was a problematic storm because of the frigid weather before the storm and after the storm, which makes the pavement very cold, and it's harder to get down to where the pavement's dry. But we're doing a great job. We've been out salting. We've plowed all the roads a number of times, and every road is open. People should just take a little extra time, not only driving, but when they're walking. The sidewalks are still slippery. So just be careful. The frigid weathers are not helping us out at all. Usually by now, it would be pretty dry all over. But it's doing well. As far as Governor Hochul's concerned, I think she made a terrible mistake not accepting the aid from President Trump and from the federal government. She mentioned ICE. I don't know what ICE has to do unless she's talking about the ice that's on the pavement. I don't know what that has to do with storm management and accepting federal funds. So I just think that she's very polarizing, and she doesn't understand that the citizens come first. We have to take care of our people, make sure that they are safe and secure, and that includes making sure that we have the funds necessary, so it's not a burden on the taxpayers when we have to have cleanups like this in a blizzard. It's been about two decades since New York had a Republican governor. Why do you think you're going to be the candidate that will change that trend? That's a very good question. So, I just won re-election in a county with 110,000 more Democrats than Republicans. And my county is basically a mirror image of the state. Our demographics are almost exactly the same. We have the same percentages of Hispanic Americans and Latinos. We have same percentage of African Americans. We have a same percentage of Asian Americans. So we are a snapshot pretty much of the State. And I won in landslide because people like my policies. We are the safest county in America, according to one of your competitors. We are a place where it's affordable to live because people are making more money because we invite business in, we create jobs, we want to create prosperity. The best way to make things affordable is to put more money in people's pockets so they can make the choices on how they want to spend money. So we have a very prosperous county because we're very business-friendly. And I haven't raised taxes in four years, not one penny. Even though inflation was at 6 percent to 8 percent a year, we didn'traise taxes at all. We hired more cops, we hired more corrections officers, and we're not only safe and secure, we're prosperous and we are affordable. And that's what I want to do in New York State. There's more Democrats in New York State than Republicans, but I believe a large number of Democrats are going to cross over and vote for me. And also, I've got a majority in my last election of independent voters, both women and men voted in the majority towards me. I believe I'll be able to do that in the state. So I'm very confident that I will be the next governor of the state of New York. You mentioned Democrats, and of course, to win statewide, you're gonna likely need some of them to vote for you. How specifically do you plan to reach out to those voters? I'm going to do it the same way I did as county executive. You know, when you're talking to people, sometimes you have disagreements. They may disagree with one policy I have or another policy that I have, but what I try to do with people is focus on where we can agree. What do you need for your community? What do we need to make your community better, more affordable, safer? And that's what I did. I reached out to communities. I went to places where traditional Republicans don't go, and I went there and listened to people, and I materially made their lives better, whether it was improving a museum, whether it was improve a roadway, whether was creating a brand new park. Those are things that I did, and I was able to garner a lot of support. So I don't think that politics should be polarizing, and I think elected officials really need to concentrate. On being the elected official for everybody, Republican, Democrat, independent. And that's what I've done. That's why I get a majority of independent voters and a fair number of Democrats.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) I'm sure that there are some Democrats who are frustrated with some of the progressive and socialist policies going on in Albany and here in New York City. But then they might see an R next to your name, and they might be concerned about LGBTQ+ rights and abortion. What would you say to those concerns that some might have? First of all, I'm a pro-choice Republican. So the governor likes to talk about abortion when she runs against Republicans. She's not going to be able to do that with me because I am a pro-choice Republican. I believe that in the early terms of pregnancy, it's a woman's body, it's her right to choose, and she should make the decisions, along with her physician, on whether or not she wants to have a child. With respect to the other issues, again, when you're the governor, your job is to create an affordable economy. You do that by creating jobs and economic prosperity. We are the highest taxed and highest regulated state in the United States. And therefore, businesses have been leaving in droves, taking good jobs, jobs that pay a lot of money and pay good benefits. I wanna bring those jobs back. I wanna nurture the businesses that are here. Again, there are policies like cashless bail that many Democrats, and I call them common-sense Democrats, they don't agree with that. They're against that. So I think they're gonna look at me as an individual and not just as a Republican. They're gonna look at me and my record—my record of achievement. I've gotten seven bond upgrades from Wall Street on my budgets. So that's unprecedented; it's never happened. I did it without raising taxes, so I think people like that. You've talked about economic issues and taxes. How specifically are you going to address affordability concerns in New York? I have a different philosophy than Kathy Hochul. Kathy Hochul is driving businesses out of New York State because we're over-taxed and we're over-regulated, we're not business friendly. There's a reason why the stock exchange is moving offices to Dallas, Texas, from New York City. And the reason they're doing that is because it's more affordable and it's business-friendly. There's reasons why hundreds of thousands of people have left the state and gone to South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, and Florida because they've gone to places where their families can live a better life, a more affordable life. My programs are designed to create jobs and to create prosperity. I want higher-paying jobs in New York State. I want more jobs. The more jobs there are, the more selective people can be, especially young people, on what type of job they want to spend the rest of their career in. I think economic prosperity is the way to make the state more affordable by putting more money in people's pockets. We have a poverty rate that's just unconscionable in New York state. Our poverty rate is 15 percent; 15 percent of all of our residents live below the poverty level. I find that to be really a national disgrace. One of the policies that Governor Hochul and Mayor Zohran Mamdani put forward is extending free childcare to 2-year-olds. What do you think about that proposal, and how would you help New Yorkers worried about childcare? First of all, they only did it for New York City. So that's eminently unfair to the rest of the state. That's number one. Number two, Mamdani wants to give free child care to illegal migrants. More money that should go to the taxpayers is now going to illegal immigrants. We've spent $5 billion in New York State, $7 billion in New York City, giving it to illegal migrants who've been here for 15 minutes. They're undocumented. We don't know where they came from. A lot of them are involved in criminal activity, and that's taxpayer dollars that are being spent on people who haven't earned it. Free transportation, free phones, free lodging. It doesn't make sense. What I believe in is—I believe tax credits for child care. That way, you know it's not going to be used for a fraudulent program. The people who need the help are going to get it. People who are gainfully employed will be able to get tax credits. For child care because child care is an important issue in New York State. There are families where both the husband and the wife are working, and they need child care for their child, and it's getting very, very expensive. But again, I differ from Hochul and Mamdani because I don't believe the city or the state should choose what child care you want to send your kids to. I believe it should be your choice, private institution, faith-based institutions. I don't think it should be city-run. I don't think it should be run by the state because they do a terrible job running everything. President Trump actually had a very positive meeting with Mamdani a few weeks back. He spoke very favorably of him. What did you make of that meeting? And did you disagree with Trump? President Trump has a record of meeting with a lot of different people that he philosophically agrees with, disagrees with, I should say. And Zohran Mamdani and President Trump could not be more diametrically opposed in their philosophies, their ideology, and their programs and policies. That being said, I think President Trump wanted to open up the door to find common ground and find a basis to have a working relationship for the betterment of all of New York City. And I think that's good for New York City. I don't think there's anything wrong. I have not had any conversations with Zohran Mamdani as of yet. And I'm very concerned on some of the things that he's done. I'm deeply concerned that he signed an executive order that basically took the definition of anti-Semitism that was approved by the Holocaust Memorial Council. And he completely rejected that after [former Mayor] Eric Adams instituted that. I was very curious as to why did you do that the first week you're in office? Of all the things that you had to be concerned with, a blizzard, transportation, housing, security and law enforcement, you chose that. It's very troubling to me. In addition, when I listened to his speech at his inauguration, he basically denigrated individualism. Individualism created this great economy in New York City. He talks about collectivism. Collectivism is a code word for communism. And basically what it means is if you're really hard working and you're very bright, you have ingenuity, and you've built a lot of money, and you built a good business, and made a nice life for yourself, he's going to take that money and give it to lazy people. I don't agree with that philosophy. It's never worked anywhere. Winston Churchill said, socialism is shared misery. And basically, a lot of people in New York State are miserable because of the policies of Governor Hochul. And it looks to me like Zohran Mamdani wants to make them more miserable. As governor, I won't let him do that. I won't let him destroy the economy of the city of New York. And I won't let them destroy the police department, the NYPD, which is a great law enforcement agency. I will fight to make sure that New Yorkers are safe, secure, and that they have an economy where people can prosper.

(Photo by Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) You've been endorsed by President Trump. What's your assessment of his first year in office? I think he's had an amazing first year. Let's take a look at it. He passed a big, beautiful bill, which had a tremendous amount of tax cuts. It had scholarship money that you could, if you made a contribution for a scholarship for education, you could deduct that from your taxes. Kathy Hochul didn't opt into that. It was free money for the people of the state of New York. And because she doesn't like President Trump, she didn't opt into it. So she's hurting the residents of the state of New York, and she's hurting their chances to be better educated. I like the fact that he's very proactive with the Middle East and that he has built a situation now where there is peace in the Middle East and that you have Arab governments talking with the state with Israel. I think the action that he took against Iran was absolutely essential. He needed to do that because Iran is a terrorist country. That is a threat to America, it's a threat to the state of Israel, it is a threat to peace, and as we're seeing right now, there's protests that are very, very, very, active right now in Iran. I think the people are rising up now, and they're saying they want to throw these people out. They've been a totalitarian government that's been oppressive to the people, and I think that they were a threat to everybody. If they got nuclear capability, it would be a threat to the whole world, so. I'm very happy that he took affirmative action there. And I like his war on drugs. I think the fact that he got Maduro and the fact he's intercepting these boats that carry poison that infect our communities and kill our children is very positive. So I think that basically he has been doing a good job. One Trump policy that's gotten a lot of criticism—and probably from business leaders across New York—is the tariffs. What's your perspective on the tariff policy? Would you encourage them to change it? President Trump is the ultimate negotiator, and he's using the tariffs to negotiate better deals, which ultimately will be better for the men and women who work each and every day in our country and in our state. And the fact is that we've been getting ripped off by these countries for far too long, where our goods, we sell them over in their countries, and we get these very high tariffs. They sell goods here at very low tariffs. So it's ruined our manufacturing base. It's taken away union jobs. It's taking away jobs in communities that are suffering now throughout New York State. Great cities like Buffalo and Rochester and Syracuse, they used to be manufacturing capitals of the world. Now they're just a shell of their former existence. And I believe that what we need to do is build up manufacturing, bring in new businesses. And if tariffs will help do it, I'm all for it. You mentioned Kathy Hochul's response to the storm, mentioning ICE. That's a huge news story in the country right now, the ICE situation in Minnesota specifically, but also across the country. I believe you previously suggested that you thought the shooting of Renee Goode appeared to be justified. Is that still your view? And I'm also curious, what are your thoughts on the more recent killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota? So both shootings are unfortunate, but they are the product of a governor and a mayor out of control in the state of Minnesota and the city of Minneapolis. Basically, the streets have been taken over by these paid professional thugs. None of them are Hispanic and Latino. They're all white people who obviously are being paid or they'vebeen brainwashed to interfere with law enforcement. I don't think it's right. For people to interfere with the law enforcement agencies that are trying to protect communities. Sure, you wanna protest, you can protest. Free speech is very important in our country, but they're going beyond that. They're engaging the ICE agents. They've committed acts of violence. They've thrown bottles and rocks at ICE agents; it's gotta stop. And we don't have that lawlessness in Nassau County because I wouldn't tolerate it, not for one minute. Look what happened here in New York City with the lawlessness by taking over Columbia University, blocking bridges, all by paid pro-Palestinian protesters; these are the same type of people, and they're probably paid by the same source of funding. These are people who have anti-American values. They're trying to change our culture, and I think that basically it has nothing to do with protecting immigrants. I think they want people in our country that don't share our American values. They want people in our country that want to hand out so they'lldeplete the resources of our country. And I'm 100 percent against that. As governor, I'll spend money on New Yorkers, not on people who've been here for 15 minutes. The whole Sanctuary State program has been a disaster. Billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, people who work hard for this money, could have been used for tax cuts, could have used for new schools, could have been used for hospitals, couldn't be used for infrastructure, could have been used to create jobs, and Kathy Hochul spent $5 billion of state funds and she's now going to subsidize the city to the tune of another $7 billion. It's absolutely a disgrace, and I think it has to stop immediately. Given that New York has a large immigrant population and a lot of anti-ICE demonstrations as well, and also the sentiments are widespread, especially in New York City, how would you approach that as governor? You're not seeing it in Hispanic and Latino communities. They're not protesting. I went to the Hispanic and Latino communities in my county, and I explained to the people in those communities why I was doing what I was doing. I was it to keep them safer. It's their kids that would be recruited into gang activity. It's their streets that would have homelessness, homeless people on their streets. It's their schools that would be overcrowded. This is a policy that's completely misguided. Quite frankly, there haven't been a lot of protests because you can get Hispanic and Latinos who came here legally. They don't want to fund illegal migrants. They earned everything that they got the people under this migrant program with Biden-Harris they came here under false pretenses claiming asylum and they're not entitled to what Kathy Hochul has been giving them. It's a disgrace that she's using our money to fund people who don't deserve it. They haven't been here; they don't even have American values. They come here, take, take. They don't love America. The immigrants that came here before, they loved America. I'm all for immigration. I think we should have a guest worker program. I think that we should a program for people who've been here 10 years and maybe overstayed visa. And they have a family here and they're law-abiding and they gainfully employed. I'm for that. I'm pro-immigration, but the right way. Would you anticipate more cooperation with DHS and ICE at the state level and more ICE raids, more ice activity, in New York State under your leadership? There are no ICE raids going on; that is a fiction. What is happening is they have individuals who are here illegally and they have a criminal record and they are picking them up like you would expect them to pick up. Only these people who engage in violent acts against ICE, they are subversive, they want to stop that, for what reason? How is that going to make for safer communities? Better neighborhoods. And they're completely wrong and misguided. And yes, I would cooperate with ICE, and I would sign an executive order the first day I get into office that we are no longer a sanctuary state because we're not gonna spend billions of dollars on people who came here from other countries and haven't earned a thing. And they've been here, like I said, for 15 minutes and you wanna give them free everything? We don't do that with our citizens. Why should we do it for them?

Santiago/Getty Images) Another issue, the ACA subsidies, these Obamacare subsidies, are expiring, and there's about 450,000 estimated New Yorkers that are going to be affected by that. Do you think that's something that Congress should work in a bipartisan way to extend, or do you think it's appropriate that they've expired? I think we're at the point now where there has to be compromise in Congress. Both sides have to give a little. That's the way I'll govern as governor. I realize there's a lot of Democrats in this state, and I'm going to have to deal with them. And I've always found that if you sit down and you negotiate in good faith, you may not get everything you want, but as my parents told me when I was young, a half a loaf is better than none. So, I think that both sides are going to have to work that out. Because we don't want people walking around that don't have adequate health care. That's not good for the health of the community. That's not good for our economy. That's bad for America. So I do think that they have to get together and find common ground. I think that the Republicans are now willing to work. We'll see with the Democrats. The Democrats so far have been just against anything that's proposed by the Republicans. They just put it off to the side and say, 'We're not going to deal with the Republicans.' I think that's a big mistake. I think both sides should deal together. People are tired of seeing Republicans and Democrats fight. They want to see them get things done. Shortly after you announced that you were running, Congresswoman Stefanik dropped out of the race. That was seen as her feeling slighted by Donald Trump. Have you talked to her? Do you anticipate her support in your campaign? I've let her have her privacy. She indicated that she wanted to take a pause in public life. Public life is a rough life, especially if you have a young child. She has a young son. And she made a decision that she wanted to spend more time with the family, pursue other endeavors. And I wish her the best. She was a very, very effective member of Congress. She's very bright, very articulate. I think she'll have a very bright future if she wants to get back into politics, but for now, she's taking a pause, and I completely respect that.","summary":"&quot;I&#039;ll spend money on New Yorkers, not on people who&#039;ve been here for 15 minutes,&quot; the GOP governor candidate told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bruce-blakeman-republican-ice-new-york-sanctuary-11444728","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2250964835.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 09:00:00","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":397970364,"title":"MICHELLE GOLDBERG: Two comedians told the truth about Jasmine Crockett’s campaign","text":"This month, some of the worst elements of 2020-style online progressive politics made a brief return, thanks to a controversy involving a couple of comedians and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. It merits attention, despite its seeming triviality, because the underlying issue could cost Democrats the Senate this fall.\n\nThe contretemps started with an offhand comment on \"Las Culturistas,\" a podcast hosted by actors and comedians Bowen Yang, until recently a star on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and Matt Rogers. Rogers was dunking on Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, arguing that Democrats need genuinely populist leaders, not those who simply excel at trolling Donald Trump. From there, he dismissed Crockett's campaign to move up to the Senate.\n\n\"Anytime a politician is making it too obviously about themselves, I'm already done,\" he said. \"And don't waste your money sending to Jasmine Crockett. Do not do it.\" Yang added, \"I must agree.\"\n\nOnline, there was a backlash from Crockett fans, many of whom accused the \"Las Culturistas\" hosts of racism and misogyny. The reaction was intense enough that both Rogers and Yang issued abject apologies.\n\nBut Rogers and Yang were right to be skeptical of Crockett, who almost certainly cannot win a general election in Texas. Those who disagree have every right to criticize them, and me. But progressives shouldn't let a retrograde style of Internet discourse inhibit them from pointing out the obvious.\n\nIt can be tricky to discuss electability concerns about Black female candidates. It's not always easy to draw the line between analyzing the voters' putative prejudices and reifying them. If liberals decide in advance that Black women are at an electoral disadvantage, they risk making that disadvantage real. But it's not race and gender that make Crockett a bad candidate, though both obviously shape perceptions of her. The problem with Crockett is that her theory about how Democrats can win Texas is wrong.\n\nI understand why lots of Democrats adore Crockett. She's charismatic and often funny and knows how to command attention. \"I think that we have to take a page or two, or three or four, out of Donald Trump's book,\" she told Vanity Fair in 2024. Some of her insults are in bad taste--she has called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, \"Hot Wheels\"--but it's easy to see why Democrats who feel brutalized by Trump want champions willing to go low.\n\nStill, Democrats cannot win Texas, a state where Trump beat Kamala Harris by almost 14 percentage points, without flipping at least some Republican voters. James Talarico, Crockett's opponent in the Democratic primary, showed that he could do that in his 2018 election to the Texas House, turning a red seat blue and winning a district that was also carried by Abbott. Crockett, by contrast, has always represented a deep blue district and has never had to run a seriously contested general election campaign.\n\nShe has been openly contemptuous not just of Trump but also of the Texans who cast their ballots for him. In that Vanity Fair interview, she described Latino voters who agreed with Trump's pitch on immigration--a demographic where Democrats need to make inroads--as having a \"slave mentality.\"\n\nRather than focusing on peeling off Trump voters, Crockett is staking her candidacy on a promise to motivate Texans who rarely if ever go to the polls. \"The theory of my case has always been that we could expand the electorate,\" she told a Texas news station last month. \"We could get people that normally don't participate in politics to be excited about getting involved.\"\n\nThis theory is dubious. In a detailed article last month, Texas Monthly called the idea that Democrats can prevail in the state simply by juicing turnout \"the biggest lie in Texas politics.\"\n\nSome candidates have succeeded in part by inspiring low-propensity voters, most notably Trump and New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. Both were outsider candidates who were able to motivate people who distrust conventional politicians. Crockett, however, isn't offering an alternative to the Democratic Party's status quo.\n\nIn Vanity Fair, she described Harris as a \"perfect candidate\" who \"did everything right\" and whose main flaw was a failure to get her message across. The video announcing Crockett's candidacy featured a close-up of her face with audio of Trump insulting her. Trump's disdain is indeed a badge of honor, but it is probably not enough to activate voters who couldn't be bothered to vote against him when he was on the ballot.\n\nSpeaking to The Washington Post this week, Crockett seemed to suggest that the race was such a long shot that Democrats could afford to take chances. Addressing her critics, she said: \"If you think it's a losing cause, then who cares? But at least you could say we tried something new and we learned something from this experience.\"\n\nThis gets things backward. Texas is not a lost cause, and Democrats cannot afford to treat it like one, given that they must flip four Republican seats if they are to retake the Senate.\n\nMichelle Goldberg is a New York Times columnist.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2026/jan/31/michelle-goldberg-two-comedians-told-the-truth/","image":"https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.arkansasonline.com_default.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 08:31:00","author":"Michelle Goldberg The","authors":["Michelle Goldberg The"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":398041528,"title":"Bill Maher launches unfiltered attack on Hollywood as he blasts 'poser' celebs for wearing anti-ICE pins at the Golden Globes: 'Sorry it didn't go with my Keffiyeh'","text":"Bill Maher has blasted 'poser' Hollywood celebrities for engaging in 'Golden Globes activism' after a stream of A-listers wore anti-ICE pins at the ceremony earlier this month.\n\nThe comedian also skewered the mainstream media reaction to his questioning of entertainers who wore the pins in the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.\n\nDuring his 'New Rules' segment on his HBO show Real Time, Maher repeated his words from the red carpet: 'It was a terrible thing that happened and it shouldn't have happened, and if they didn't act like such thugs it wouldn't have had to happen. But I don't need to wear a pin about it.' \n\nHe then mocked the supposed offense he caused by joking that if he'd 'had the chance to think about it, my answer would be... exactly the same! Yes, the same: ICE thugs, pins stupid.' \n\nMaher then revealed that fellow celebrities and friends sent him 'supporting texts' defending what he said on the red carpet, and added that he doesn't care about the internet dissecting his words. \n\nHe read out headlines that portrayed him as 'laughing at' or 'mocking' what the media called 'Golden Globes activism' by not wearing the emblem. \n\n'You mean the activism of fixing a f***ing pin to my suit? I'm sorry, it clashed with my Keffiyeh,' he cracked, adding a photoshopped image of himself wearing the Palestinian scarf.\n\nMaher then labeled celebrities 'f***ing posers' for jumping from cause to cause and wearing pins for all of them, arguing that doing so does nothing to solve any of the problems they aim to fix.\n\n'Get out of here with your virtue-signaling body ornaments. They're just crucifixes for liberals, because every time I see one, I think \"Jesus Christ\",' he quipped.\n\nHe then pivoted to asking celebrities to simply stay out of politics, arguing that it was hurting the causes liberal Hollywood claims to care about. \n\n'Its having the opposite effect of what you want. Every big name in showbusiness came out for Kamala Harris... and she lost every swing state,' he pointed out.\n\nMaher noted that the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Taylor Swift and George Clooney had all endorsed Harris, often making people less excited about the Democrat candidate. \n\n'Read the room, Democrats! Celebrities aren't helping and why would they? In a country where the big issue now is affordability, outside of, I don't know, [Bruce] Springsteen and a few others, celebrities don't strike people as relatable or in touch,' he said to applause. \n\nHe noted various examples of celebrity behavior, from outlandish baby names to flying private and having multiple houses to buying 'castles, towns and islands.'\n\n'Insulated divas whose talents allow them to pig out on the finer things in life, because we all need something to aspire to,' he described them as.\n\nMaher then pointed out that being talented is not the same as 'knowing things' and doesn't allow them the credibility to comment on politics. \n\nHe reignited his feud with fellow comic Dave Chappelle, who in his last special said 'F*** Bill Maher' and called Maher's opinions: 'Smug, cracker-a** commentary.' \n\nThey were in disagreement over Chappelle's view that it was easier to speak freely in Saudi Arabia than in America. \n\n'I was right, what he said was stupid. America has many problems, including free speech issues on both left in right. But we're real different than Saudi Arabia and if you don't believe me, try opening a lesbian art gallery there.'\n\nMaher finally pivoted to the Democrat Party and told them to ditch their embrace of celebrity. \n\n'Democrats, it's great you have all the big celebs but people see them as an arm of the Democratic Party, which they already see as lacking common sense.'\n\nOnce more, he addressed Hollywood, saying: 'I know it's important to you that you're making a difference. You are, it's making independents vote Republican.'\n\nMultiple celebrities, including Wicked stars Ariana Grande, Mark Ruffalo and Natasha Lyonne, along with Hacks actress Jean Smart, wore the anti-ICE pins to the awards show. \n\nThe host Wanda Sykes - who used one of her speeches at the Los Angeles show to mock Maher - also donned the badge on the lapel of her glittery silver suit.\n\nShe roasted Maher at the show by saying he should 'try less'. Maher didn't join in the laughter, and he initially looked puzzled before displaying a stony-faced expression. \n\nSykes told Variety she wore the pin 'for the mother who was murdered by an ICE agent' when a reporter asked her about the accessory. \n\n'I know people were out marching and all today. And we need to speak up,' the comedian added. \n\n'We need to be out there and shut this rogue government down,' Sykes said, 'because it's just awful what they're doing to people.' \n\nGood, 37, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan 'Jon' Ross in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 7.","summary":"Bill Maher took shots at Hollywood liberals and reignited his feud with Dave Chappelle over celebrity activism, arguing that 'having talent' doesn't equate to 'knowing things.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15515001/Bill-Maher-launches-unfiltered-attack-Hollywood-blasts-poser-celebs-wearing-anti-ICE-pins-Golden-Globes-Sorry-didnt-Keffiyeh.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/31/06/105988039-0-image-a-34_1769839618335.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2026/01/12/6270367900124493780/1024x576_MP4_6270367900124493780.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-31 08:19:40","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Trapped in smaller and smaller enclaves, they are surrounded by enemies and have no means of escape.\n\nTrump is as dismissive about their fate as he is about that of the Palestinians. “They were paid tremendous amounts of money, were given oil and other things,” he says, inaccurately. “So they were doing it for themselves more so than they were doing it for us.” He vaguely said that the US might protect the Kurds, but he left no doubt that the US has abandoned its old allies.\n\n Tom Barrack, the US Special Envoy for Syria, put it brutally, saying that the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – the mainly Kurdish armed force of which 11,000 were killed fighting Isis over a decade – were no longer the “primary anti-Isis force on the ground”, and their usefulness had “largely expired” because the new pro-American Syrian government has taken over security responsibility.\n\nBeginning in 2014, when the US Air Force helped the Kurds defend the besieged city of Kobani, on the border with Turkey, against ferocious assault by Isis, the alliance went from strength to strength until Isis was defeated by 2018. Yet today Kobani is besieged once again, this time by the Syrian army and Turkish-backed Arab militias.\n\nIts water and electricity are cut off and there is a shortage of bread. A UN convoy of 24 trucks was able to deliver supplies in the last few days during a ceasefire, but few Kurds expect this to last. \n\nAccounts that have been provided to The i Paper might all have come from Gaza during its bombardment by Israel. Mustafa Osman Kajo, from the village of Kharab Ashq near Kobani, has grim experience of the fragility of ceasefires. With his family, he had gone to stay with relatives in another village he believed to be safer.\n\n“This was about 10 days ago, but when we heard that there was a ceasefire agreement, we returned to our house,” he said. \n\nKajo went into Kobani to buy some goods, but when there, he heard shelling and returned to find that his house had been hit. “My entire family was sleeping in one room, which was completely demolished: under the rubble were my daughter, my son’s wife and her two children, my wife Jamila, and another woman.\n\n“I came and stood on the rubble and I could hear my daughter’s voice from under the rubble and she was moaning with difficulty and saying, ‘Please, I want some water, I am suffocating and I cannot breathe.’\n\n“There was a warplane or drone flying above us. I was trying to hide behind a half-demolished wall. Where to go? I don’t know. Yes, yes, I think they were drones though I wasn’t even strong enough to look up.”\n\nLater, he and some young men from the village broke through the concrete ceiling that had collapsed on his family using a sledgehammer. \n\n“We pulled out my injured daughter and took her here to the hospital,” he says. “A relative who was staying with us lost her legs. Five died and four were wounded and are in hospital, but their condition is not good.”\n\nTerrible scenes like this are being re-enacted everywhere in the long strip of territory heavily populated by Kurds to the south of the Syrian-Turkish border. The Syrian civil war between 2011 and 2024 was always more of an ethnic and sectarian civil war than the outside world recognised. President Bashar al-Assad’s regime was drawn primarily from the Alawites, a Shia sect, with support from the other minorities. The anti-government resistance was drawn from the Sunni Arab community, a majority of the Syrian population, while the Kurds balanced nervously between the two sides.\n\nThe Kurds took over north-east Syria with the help of US airpower, but they were always frightened of what would happen when the war ended and they would be faced with a victor determined to control the whole of Syria.\n\nThe Kurds, large minorities of whom live in Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran, are properly cynical about the trustworthiness of foreign powers supporting them. But even they are shocked by the speed of their betrayal by the Trump administration. Whole Kurdish communities have been on the move in the last three weeks. The UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says the number of displaced people arriving in the largely Kurdish province of al-Hasakeh has jumped from 6,000 to 146,000 in a couple of weeks. This is only a small part of the mass flight as the remaining Kurdish enclaves fill with terrified people.\n\nAnother ceasefire was announced on Friday – with the SDF integrated into the Syrian army and Syrian security forces from the Interior Ministry deployed into Kurdish cities – but this will not assuage the terror.\n\nRefugees seldom expected more than grudging sympathy and support from the international community, but even this is now on the ebb. At the core of Trumpian appeal is anti-immigrant racism accusing migrant communities of being criminals and terrorists. US support for UN humanitarian aid is planned to drop from $17bn to $2bn a year, and the UK is cutting its foreign aid budget by 40 per cent.\n\nGaza, where 71,000 Palestinians died, set a new low bar on what governments can get away with in inflicting civilian casualties. International attention is currently focused on Trump’s headline-grabbing threats to go to war with Iran – and very little attention on the impending destruction of the Kurdish community in Syria.\n\nI visited Kurdish-controlled Syria many times during the war against Isis. In the heart of the shattered city of Raqqa, once the Isis capital, I saw the iron railings of a roundabout which had been used as spikes on which Isis displayed the severed heads of its victims. In Kobani, I saw the grave of three-year old Alan Kurdi, photographs of whose drowned body lying on a beach in Turkey – his family were trying to get to Greece on a boat – had led to worldwide outrage back in 2015. A decade later, such sympathy for a dead foreign child is certainly not the zeitgeist of a Trumpian world determined to demonise migrants.\n\nMuslem Bozan, an economic administrator in Kobani, says that within the city “morale is collapsing”. Ten years after the last siege was broken with American support, they are under attack with no help from anybody in sight. \n\nThey believe “the Kurds in Kobani will be exterminated… [Our jihadi enemies] gloat over our killing, they dig up the graves of our martyrs…”\n\nAlan Kurdi has a rather grand marble memorial for such a small boy. But it may not survive the coming months.\n\nFurther Thoughts\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s poll ratings turned negative early in his first term in the White House and never recovered. A turning point was the chaotic US withdrawal from Kabul in August 2021, but the long term cause was US public perception that he was too old for the job. \n\nBy March 2024, 73 per cent of registered voters believed this to be the case and felt he should not be seeking a second term. When he lapsed into incoherence during a TV debate with Donald Trump a few months later, it was already too late to select a suitable candidate capable of defeating Trump. The Democrats have been blaming each other for this self-inflicted but mortal electoral wound – of trying to elect a visibly senile candidate – ever since.\n\nIn the case of Sir Keir Starmer, public belief that he is yet another dud prime minister is not rooted in any diminished mental powers, but a conviction that he does not know what to do or how to do it. There is much in this, but he is also the lightning rod for a broader disappointment that Labour is doing no better than the Tories.\n\nYet the political consequences for the Labour Party may be much the same as Biden’s candidacy for the Democrats. They now generally admit their mistake, saying they might have stopped Biden running for a second term. They could have allowed the primary process to produce a more credible candidate than vice president Kamala Harris, tainted by her association with Biden.\n\nThis ominous precedent should worry the Labour Party more than it does. Barring a war or some such emergency, such as the Falklands conflict which rescued Margaret Thatcher from deep unpopularity in 1982, voters are unlikely to change their minds about Starmer.\n\nThe degree of detestation with which this rather bland establishment figure is regarded by so much of the public is puzzling. As a politician he may be peculiarly inept, but so too were his five predecessors. The obvious course change was for Labour to choose Andy Burnham, who could credibly claim to be different in style and substance. As vice president, Kamala Harris could never distance herself sufficiently from Biden. Health Secretary Wes Streeting would have the same problem.\n\nBurnham also stands the best chance of building a progressive coalition capable of defeating Reform. A crushing defeat in the Gorton and Denton by-election on 26 February will concentrate the minds of Labour MPs who will see such a loss as foreshadowing their own electoral demise. This is the traditional death knell for British prime ministers.\n\nBeneath the Radar\n\nDuring the siege of Gaza over two years, broadcasters like the BBC would preface any reference to the number of dead in Gaza with the phrase that “the Hamas-run Health Ministry says…” The implication was that the figures might be exaggerated. Television viewers could see the broken bodies of children being taken from the rubble night after night so perhaps the timorous phrase damaged the BBC more than the Palestinians. \n\nNow the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have accepted the Health Ministry figure of 71,000 Palestinians killed by the Israeli bombardment, which does not include the missing, still buried under the ruins of Gaza. At least 492 Palestinians and four Israeli soldiers have been killed since the supposed ceasefire on 10 October 2025.\n\nCockburn’s Picks\n\nAs with Biden, the media is coy about saying clearly that Trump is subsiding into highly visible senility, much like his predecessor four years ago. \n\nJeffrey St Clair of Counterpunch remarks on this in an eloquent passage: “During his nearly incoherent speech at the World Economic Forum, Trump looked morose and sounded peevish. The words slurred, the fraying sentences trailing off into the ether. His insults lacked fire and punch. He rambled aimlessly. His cognitive decline, never a fall from alpine heights to begin with, was on full public display.”","url":"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-unleashed-new-war-not-one-you-think-4190380","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SEI_282588863.jpg?crop=246px%2C152px%2C708px%2C399px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 07:00:00","author":"Patrick Cockburn","authors":["Patrick Cockburn"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.732},{"id":398018394,"title":"Trump has unleashed a new war - but not the one you think","text":"This is Dispatches with Patrick Cockburn, a subscriber-only newsletter from The i Paper.

I’m sorry, it clashed with my Keffiyeh,’ he cracked, adding a photoshopped image of himself wearing the Palestinian scarf.\n\nMaher then labeled celebrities ‘f***ing posers’ for jumping from cause to cause and wearing pins for all of them, arguing that doing so does nothing to solve any of the problems they aim to fix.\n\n‘Get out of here with your virtue-signaling body ornaments. They’re just crucifixes for liberals, because every time I see one, I think “Jesus Christ”,’ he quipped.\n\nHe then pivoted to asking celebrities to simply stay out of politics, arguing that it was hurting the causes liberal Hollywood claims to care about. \n\n‘Its having the opposite effect of what you want. Every big name in showbusiness came out for Kamala Harris… and she lost every swing state,’ he pointed out.\n\nMaher noted that the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Taylor Swift and George Clooney had all endorsed Harris, often making people less excited about the Democrat candidate. \n\n‘Read the room, Democrats! Celebrities aren’t helping and why would they? In a country where the big issue now is affordability, outside of, I don’t know, [Bruce] Springsteen and a few others, celebrities don’t strike people as relatable or in touch,’ he said to applause. \n\nHe noted various examples of celebrity behavior, from outlandish baby names to flying private and having multiple houses to buying ‘castles, towns and islands.’\n\n‘Insulated divas whose talents allow them to pig out on the finer things in life, because we all need something to aspire to,’ he described them as.\n\nMaher then pointed out that being talented is not the same as ‘knowing things’ and doesn’t allow them the credibility to comment on politics. \n\nHe reignited his feud with fellow comic Dave Chappelle, who in his last special said ‘F*** Bill Maher’ and called Maher’s opinions: ‘Smug, cracker-a** commentary.’ \n\nThey were in disagreement over Chappelle’s view that it was easier to speak freely in Saudi Arabia than in America. \n\n‘I was right, what he said was stupid. America has many problems, including free speech issues on both left in right. But we’re real different than Saudi Arabia and if you don’t believe me, try opening a lesbian art gallery there.’\n\nMaher finally pivoted to the Democrat Party and told them to ditch their embrace of celebrity. \n\n‘Democrats, it’s great you have all the big celebs but people see them as an arm of the Democratic Party, which they already see as lacking common sense.’\n\nOnce more, he addressed Hollywood, saying: ‘I know it’s important to you that you’re making a difference. You are, it’s making independents vote Republican.’\n\nMultiple celebrities, including Wicked stars Ariana Grande, Mark Ruffalo and Natasha Lyonne, along with Hacks actress Jean Smart, wore the anti-ICE pins to the awards show. \n\nThe host Wanda Sykes – who used one of her speeches at the Los Angeles show to mock Maher – also donned the badge on the lapel of her glittery silver suit.\n\nShe roasted Maher at the show by saying he should ‘try less’. Maher didn’t join in the laughter, and he initially looked puzzled before displaying a stony-faced expression. \n\nSykes told Variety she wore the pin ‘for the mother who was murdered by an ICE agent’ when a reporter asked her about the accessory. \n\n‘I know people were out marching and all today. And we need to speak up,’ the comedian added. \n\n‘We need to be out there and shut this rogue government down,’ Sykes said, ‘because it’s just awful what they’re doing to people.’ \n\nGood, 37, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan ‘Jon’ Ross in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 7.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBill Maher took a strong stance against what he termed &#8216;poser&#8217; celebrities&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Bill Maher Criticizes Celebrities for &#8216;Poser&#8217; Behavior with Pin-Wearing at Golden Globes first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/bill-maher-criticizes-celebrities-for-poser-behavior-with-pin-wearing-at-golden-globes/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bill-Maher-blasts-poser-celebs-for-wearing-pins-at-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 06:59:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":397909730,"title":"LA Olympics chair's VERY flirty messages to Ghislaine Maxwell while wife was pregnant exposed in new Epstein files released by DOJ","text":"The Hollywood mogul in charge of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics wrote raunchy emails discussing 'massages', 'rubbing' and naked beach frolics with Jeffrey Epstein's partner in crime Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe 2003 emails from LA talent agency chief and 2028 Olympic Committee Chair Casey Wasserman were revealed in the latest giant tranche of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on Friday morning.\n\nWasserman, 51, was less than two years into his marriage to then-wife Laura Ziffren when he swapped highly flirtatious messages with Maxwell, asking her on April 1, 2003: 'Where are you, I miss you. I will be in NYC for 4 days starting april 22… can we book that massage now?'\n\nAmid a flurry of messages two days later Maxwell, 64, wrote 'all that rubbing - are you sure you can take it?'\n\n'There are a few spots that apparently drive a man wild - I suppose I could practise them on you and you could let me know if they work or not?' she added.\n\nWhile the two were trading the risqué messages and arranging the sensual massage, his wife was eight months pregnant with their son. The Daily Mail has reached out to Wasserman for comment.\n\nWasserman is a major figure in Hollywood as a top music and movie agency chief behind such music greats as Coldplay and Ed Sheeran. He also brought Billie Eilish into his roster by acquiring music agency Paradigm in 2021.\n\nVIP guests to his 600-person 50th birthday bash in Santa Monica in June 2024 included former president Bill Clinton, ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris's husband Doug Emhoff.\n\nAbsent – and behind bars for grooming, trafficking, and abusing minors with Epstein – was Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell signed off many of her messages to him with 'Kisses', and he with 'xoxo', the emails released by the DOJ reveal.\n\nWhen Wasserman described LA's often overcast June weather in one 2003 email, Maxwell replied with a raunchy response.\n\n'What foggy enough so that you can float naked down the beach and no one can see you unless they are close up?' she wrote in the April 7, 2003 email, adding: 'Or something like that…'\n\nOn April 6, 2003, Maxwell wrote him: 'Thought you might like to know I am now in Paris - can I bring you back anything from Here?'\n\nHe replied: 'The only thing that i want from paris is you.'\n\nThe next day Maxwell was discussing combinations of edible treats she could bring him from her trip to London.\n\n'Ok, so that combo did not do it for you, what combo would then?' She asked.

Lemon's own videos show that he took part in the planning to force entry into the church in violation of the FACE Act. He also participated in the invasion and intimidation, and then later justified it on camera by saying real protests should generate fear. That may not be enough to get a star-struck jury to convict, but it's more than enough for probable cause. \n\nJim Treacher: The only people whose First Amendment rights have been infringed here are the congregants at the church Don Lemon invaded. He was part of the planning, he trespassed and refused to leave, and he called those churchgoers “white supremacists.” To make matters worse, he’s even profiting from his crimes.

The Biden Regency and Merrick Garland's DoJ prosecuted FACE Act cases for far less than this set of circumstances. Ask Mark Houck, and the women that Trump had to pardon after taking office. Those FACE Act prosecutions were absurd, and yet none of the people outraged by Lemon's indictment said a word in protest at the time. \n\nNote, If a raging mob, led by a conservative reporter, crashed a mosque, intimidated Muslims, petrified their kids to tears, and called them racists, this dude and his pals in the media would be demanding their head, much less arrest for violations of the FACE act. https://t.co/0rYxwUh19o— John Ondrasik (@johnondrasik) January 30, 2026\n\nEd: Exactly.

In 1979, Paul Volcker took over the central bank and dramatically reoriented its approach to inflation. Alan Greenspan took over from Volcker in 1987, and he and every chair since has emphasized continuity with his or her predecessor. Warsh has promised a clear rupture—a wholesale rethinking of the Fed’s asset holdings, policy framework, role in the economy, and relationship with the executive branch.\n\nFormer colleagues of Warsh’s say his rhetoric shouldn’t be mistaken for rigidity. “He’s not an ideologue,” said Randall Kroszner, who served on the Fed’s board with Warsh from 2006 to 2009. “Since I’ve known him, he was someone who tried to get things done. His approach is, ‘Let’s articulate goals as clearly as we can, and then find the best path to get as close to those goals as we can.’” ...\n\nWarsh warned in 2021, presciently, that the Fed was sowing the seeds of a bigger inflation problem by continuing to buy large quantities of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.\n\nEd: I didn't write about this today, not because it wasn't significant, but because I don't know how much change this really represents. Warsh was up for the post in 2017, but Trump picked Powell as a moderate choice. I'll wait and see what happens, but it is a bit surprising to see Trump pass over Hassett, who looked like a lock a few weeks ago. \n\n2025 Census data is in:North Carolina leads with +84,000 new residents, South Carolina +67,000.The South continues to grow, Florida’s surge slows, and the Midwest sees its first net domestic gain since 1991. pic.twitter.com/5U5V6O2eBs— Stephen Moore (@StephenMoore) January 29, 2026\n\nEd: I'm not sure why Moore overlooked Texas. The stars at night are big and bright, pal! More seriously, the entire top 10 destination states are all red, and the bottom ten are bluer-than-blue except for Louisiana. That may be less a deliberate and primary choice by relocating Americans, and more a symptom of failing economic and policy environments in the blue states. \n\nPolitico: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has conceded she may have gotten some information wrong in her initial response to Border Patrol’s killing of Alex Pretti, the Minneapolis ICU nurse she labeled a domestic terrorist.\n\nNoem also dodged questions about her leadership of DHS amid widespread outrage, even among some Republicans, about the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good during an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis.\n\nNoem, who said Pretti committed an “act of domestic terrorism” against immigration agents despite videos showing otherwise, told Fox News on Thursday that the situation immediately following the killing was “very chaotic,” and the details she presented to reporters came from initial reports from Customs and Border Protection agents in Minneapolis.\n\n“We were being relayed information from on the ground from CBP agents and officers that were there,” Noem said. “We were using the best information we had at the time.”\n\nEd: This tells me that Noem will likely survive the crisis, although she may not like it much. Tom Homan is almost certainly going to remain in charge of DHS operations in crisis states after this, reporting over Noem's head to Trump. Even if that's not officially the case, any clashes that result in other hard-line sanctuary jurisdictions will likely have Trump asking for Homan's intervention. \n\nSteve Forbes, chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes, says Ilhan Omar and her husband are running a money laundering operation🚨 Ilhan Omar’s husbands investment firm was looked into, THERE IS NO RECORDS OF THEM MANAGING MONEY, “NO CLIENTS”“His investment firm — It’s DC… pic.twitter.com/NPhJWb4bZ5— Wall Street Apes (@WallStreetApes) January 30, 2026\n\n“His investment firm — It’s DC headquarters appear to share office space at a WeWork.

There's no SEC registrations for them as investment advisers. What is going on here? This increasingly looks sketchy, both the winery and his investment firm.

Is there a money laundering operation here — something is not right”“That $30 million came from sources that are illegal, period”\n\nEd: I wonder how much of the sudden and mysterious wealth came from the fraud in Omar's district, and how much of it came through USAID programs. The DoJ needs to get all of its forensic accountants to dig deeply into all of these areas, but with a special focus on Omar's ridiculous wealth escalation. \n\nLA Times: A man falsely claiming to be an FBI agent showed up to a federal jail in New York City on Wednesday night and told officers he had a court order to release Luigi Mangione, authorities said.\n\nMark Anderson, 36, of Mankato, Minn., was arrested and charged with impersonating an FBI agent in connection with a foiled bid to free Mangione from the Metropolitan Detention Center, the notorious Brooklyn lockup where he is held while awaiting state and federal murder trials in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. ...\n\nWhen the officers asked for his federal credentials, Anderson showed them a Minnesota driver’s license, threw numerous documents at them and claimed to have weapons, the criminal complaint said. Officers searched Anderson’s bag and found a barbecue fork and a circular steel blade, the complaint said. In a photo included in the complaint, the blade appeared to be a small pizza cutter wheel.\n\nEd: Mangione didn't have anything to do with this, apparently. Anderson is just a nut who's immersed himself in radical Leftist causes, but the issue seems more to do with his status as a nut, as we see here ...\n\nAnderson also filed a pro se complaint against the FBI yesterday -- the day he was arrested -- claiming \"unlawful inducement by Iran and the Satanic Church.\" pic.twitter.com/9y6I3Lwqc9— Erik Uebelacker (@Uebey) January 29, 2026\n\nEd: Aaaaaaaaallll-righty then. \n\nAndrew C. McCarthy at NRO: In a hopeful sign that a semblance of order is being restored, the Trump Justice Department announced today that the probe of Alex Pretti’s death is being conducted by the FBI and that it is a civil rights investigation.\n\nI’ve been something of a broken record on this (see here and here) — specifically, on the contentions that (a) it is essential that the DOJ conduct the standard investigation that occurs when a person dies in an encounter with federal law enforcement and there is any potential that excessive force was the cause; and (b) the lead agency should be the FBI — not Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe implication of these contentions is not that the agents involved in Pretti’s death (and, for that matter, in the death of Renee Good) are guilty of civil rights crimes or actionable homicide. It just means that a credible investigation must be conducted if the agents are to be cleared.\n\nEd: Agreed. Let's have an honest investigation into the circumstances of the shooting, and then take action if warranted. I suspect this may be a result of Homan's intervention in Minnesota as a trade-off for cooperation, but even if it is, it is a salutary step to restoring proper order. \n\nIn Starfleet Academy Jay-Den is from a polyamorous Klingon family where both of his Fathers abandoned him. pic.twitter.com/HE7olrTLxP— Nerdrotic (@Nerdrotics) January 29, 2026\n\nEd: Klingon polycules?

Even loyal Republicans were recoiling at the excesses of a poorly trained paramilitary force, unaccountable and out of control.\n\nParty grandees, already reconciled to losing the House in November’s mid-term elections, began to worry about losing the Senate too.\n\nCalls to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), purveyors of the shoot-to-kill approach, hitherto emanating only from the activist Left, became more widespread. Trump’s hard line on illegal migrants, which had helped re-elect him in November 2024, had suddenly become a liability.\n\nThe President had only himself to blame for the predicament he now found himself in. He had unleashed the dogs of war, revelling in a use of force which was now repelling a clear majority of Americans.\n\nMoreover he had surrounded himself with out-of-their-depth lickspittles – Kristi Noem at Homeland Security, Kash Patel at the FBI, Greg Bordino at Border Control, Stephen Miller at the heart of the White House – who thought the way to curry his favour was to be even more Trump than Trump.\n\nSo they smeared those who had been fatally shot (and any witnesses who dared contradict their version of events) as ‘domestic terrorists’ and ‘assassins’ out to ‘massacre’ federal agents. Without, of course, a shred of evidence – and no concern about pre-empting official inquiries in which they’d be crucial participants.\n\nBut then they had no intention of allowing state or local law enforcement to investigate the behaviour of ICE, whose agents had been assured by them that they enjoyed ‘absolute immunity’ to act with impunity, even down to defying court orders. Nor did they have much regard for the Constitution.\n\nIndeed Americans saw it was being assailed on all sides. Depicting demonstrators and those who witnessed the protests as criminals undermined their first amendment rights to free speech. Searching homes without a warrant, which ICE is prone to do, breaches the fourth amendment’s protection against random incursions into people’s homes.\n\nIronically, for an administration which fetishises gun ownership, even the second amendment’s right to bear arms was under threat.\n\nThe nurse killed by ICE carried a concealed gun. He had a licence for it, never tried to reach for it in his fatal scuffle with ICE and had been disarmed before he was shot ten times.\n\nBut Trump officials claimed, wrongly, he had no right to carry a gun to a protest (pro-MAGA protesters have often carried not just handguns but semi-automatic assault rifles). Cue the Trump administration, bizarrely, on the wrong side of the powerful gun lobby.\n\nTrump watched all this and read the runes. Wiser heads in the White House, such as his chief of staff Susie Wiles, urged a change of tack.\n\nTrump had caught the knack of retreating the week before when he backed off from his threats to annex Greenland, an issue on which he’d overplayed his hand.\n\nNow he back-pedalled in Minneapolis, where he’d also overplayed his hand.\n\nNoem and Bordino were sidelined, told matters in Minnesota’s biggest city were no longer their concern.\n\nBridges were rebuilt with the state’s governor (Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’s rather useless running mate in the 2024 presidential election) and even the city’s Left-wing mayor.\n\nTom Homan, the experienced border tsar who served under Barack Obama, was sent to Minneapolis to dampen things down and restore a degree of professionalism to federal operations there. ICE agents are being withdrawn as the round up of illegal immigrants is de-escalated. The killings are to be properly investigated.\n\nHoman has promised to concentrate on removing only ‘the worst of the worst’. This was the original plan. It is a sign of the random, cavalier nature of ICE’s activities that only 5 per cent of those detained have been convicted of violent crimes (for whose deportation there is widespread support).\n\nThe Left, which was increasingly well-organised in countering ICE in Minneapolis, naturally regards Trump’s withdrawal as a victory. Some fear it is no more than a tactical retreat, that Trump still hankers after imposing paramilitary force on recalcitrant Democratic states and cities that refuse to bow to his will.\n\nThis is a fear that goes well beyond the Trump-hating Left. Ordinary, not particularly political Americans who I speak to are genuinely worried that rights they’ve always taken for granted are now in jeopardy.\n\nThe indiscriminate mass removal of migrants has instilled concern among law-abiding Americans that they are at risk of being swept up in a general descent into more autocratic ways, as Trump lives out his strongman fantasies.\n\nForeigners sense it as much as Americans, which is why fewer are going to America. Flying regularly back and forth across the Atlantic last year I noticed more empty seats than usual. The figures bear this out.\n\nForeign visitors to the US fell 6 per cent last year on 2024, a trend which is gaining momentum: advance bookings in the second half of the year were down 12 per cent from Germany, 9 per cent from Spain and only a little less from the UK.\n\nTravellers are nervous about American unrest on their TV screens and fear unpredictable treatment at US passport control. Maybe the World Cup will force America to be more welcoming again.\n\nThese fears – at home and abroad – may be overblown but they are no less real. They mark something of a watershed in Trump’s second term. A clear majority of Americans – 55 per cent – have turned against him and his government. He is polarising public opinion more than ever.\n\nBut in between the Trump haters and the MAGA zealots he is losing independents, moderate Republicans and Hispanics – the coalition of voters that returned him to the Oval Office for a second term.\n\nEven MAGA is disillusioned with his penchant for foreign adventures. It all suggests that, in terms of public approval, we are past peak Trump. The administration looks that bit more cowed, more humbled than it ever has.\n\nA wise President would proceed from now on with more caution when it comes to domestic affairs, as he is now in Minneapolis. But that is probably not Trump’s way. The bigger risk is that he becomes an old man in a hurry (and he has seemed frailer these past months), anxious to have his way, settle scores and wreak revenge on his supposed enemies before he loses control of Congress in November.\n\nEven as his forces were retreating from Minnesota this week he was calling for the arrest of Obama, spreading baseless accusations of the former president being involved in espionage and even a coup to reverse Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016.\n\nNor has he forgotten how he was supposedly ‘cheated’ out of victory just over five years ago.\n\nHe’s tasked Tulsi Gabbard, his national intelligence director and a notable nutjob in an administration overpopulated with them, with rooting out the voter fraud he still claims, against all the evidence, cost him the 2020 election.\n\nIt was also revealed that Trump has filed a $10billion lawsuit against his own Treasury department and tax collectors over the leaking of his tax returns in 2020. ‘Highly unusual’ was how one White House aide put it to me yesterday. ‘No President has ever tried to extract $10billion from US taxpayers for his personal gain.’\n\nIt is this Trumpian politics of bread-and-circuses that detracts from more important matters that could rebound to his credit.\n\nThe US economy is going gangbusters, with growth accelerating in every quarter of last year and reaching an annual rate of over 5 per cent by the last quarter — growth which European leaders can only dream about. Productivity growth is booming way above European levels too.\n\nYet Trump gets little credit, partly because he doesn’t talk about it enough (and when he does he exaggerates) and partly because he gives short shrift to voters’ legitimate concerns about the cost of living.\n\nLikewise, crime is dropping dramatically. The latest figures from the country’s 40 biggest cities show all categories of major crimes – murders, violent assaults, burglaries, carjackings – down by double digits. It is expected that the latest homicide rate will be four in 100,000, making it the lowest since records began in 1900.\n\nBut, again, Trump gets little credit, partly because he’s too busy depicting Democrat-run big cities as cesspits of crime and lawlessness for most folk to be even aware of the wider picture.\n\nIt’s not even clear Trump is that interested in domestic politics any more. Like many presidents into their second term, he seems more absorbed by foreign affairs.\n\nFresh from removing Venezuela’s dictator (only to replace him with another dictator prepared to do Trump’s bidding), the President has now assembled a large armada and other military assets within striking distance of Iran.\n\nExactly why is not quite clear. During the recent unrest Trump warned the tyrants of Tehran he would strike them hard if they violently repressed the demonstrators. The tyrants proceeded to massacre their own people on an unprecedented scale. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, were killed, many others remain incarcerated and tortured in barbaric prisons. Trump did nothing, largely because he didn’t have the military assets in place to carry out his threat.\n\nNow he has. But the cities of Iran are quiet again, cowed by the brutality of the repression.\n\nIt is far from certain that US attacks on regime leaders and assets would rekindle rebellion. Trump has also changed tack. His latest statement makes no mention of demonstrators but says US attacks can be avoided if the regime negotiates away its nuclear bomb capabilities. Which is strange since Trump has consistently claimed US bombers destroyed them last June.\n\nWashington cynics ruefully remark that it suits Trump to replace headlines about federal executions in Minneapolis with bombing the mullahs in Iran. Yesterday more Epstein files were rushed out, a useful diversion. I would not go as far as to claim a US armada is now parked within striking distance of Iran for the same reason. But as one source close to Trump said to me this week: ‘It’s certainly convenient.’\n\nAs would be the fall of communism in Cuba – and that is on the cards. ‘Cuba will be falling pretty soon,’ predicted the President on Tuesday. To hasten its fall Trump has threatened penal tariffs on any country exporting oil to Cuba. That essentially means Mexico, since Trump has already turned off the Venezuelan oil tap.\n\nCuba needs 100,000 barrels of oil a day to keep the lights on and its industry powered. It produces 40,000 barrels per day from its own resources. The 40,000 barrels it got from Venezuela is no more. The 20,000 from Mexico is already down to 3,000 even before Trump’s latest threat. It will run out of enough oil next month.\n\nCuba is hurtling towards economic collapse. The communist dictatorship has never looked more vulnerable. Its demise would allow Trump to claim he’s succeeded where every president since John F Kennedy has failed. What follows in Havana, of course, is another matter. If Venezuela is the Trump template then it could be another dictatorship.\n\nThere are those who think Trump should be more worried about unrest closer to home. The prospect of another US civil war is routinely raised, often by the extremes of Left and Right who would seem to relish it, and just as routinely it never happens. Nor will it. America has been through much worse and survived: 2026 is not 1861 (when the American Civil War broke out).\n\nICE are amateurs compared to the police violence routinely meted out in the segregated South for 100 years after the Civil War, which only lessened after the civil rights acts of the mid-1960s. Violence was much worse in the race riots of the 1960s than anything we’ve seen in Minneapolis.\n\nIn August 1965, 34 were killed when the Watts area of Los Angeles exploded in unrest. Two years later 43 died in the Detroit riots.\n\nThis is not to deny that America is a troubled country with much to be troubled about. But it’s always darkest before dawn.\n\nThe decline of the Trump presidency is probably already under way. If it ends with a whimper and disappointment rather than a celebratory bang that will embolden more moderate Republicans to reassert themselves, which in turn will encourage the Democrats to remain in the mainstream rather than strike out to the Left.\n\nA return to the American politics we knew before Trump is not on the cards. But America need not be condemned indefinitely to the current craziness. The rot is setting in for Trump and MAGA. Mainstream Republicans and Democrats need to be on hand with fresh and compelling ideas to replace them.\n\nAmid all the patriotic outpourings that will greet America’s 250th anniversary this year, that is the real task at hand.","summary":"President Trump peered over the brink at the mayhem in Minneapolis this week - and quickly pulled back.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15514293/ANDREW-NEIL-believe-past-peak-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/30/21/105981029-0-image-a-50_1769806863964.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 01:50:46","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":398125830,"title":"Tim Walz Says He Will 'Never' Launch Another Campaign, Doesn't Rule Out Appointment to Klobuchar's Senate Seat","text":"Disgraced Minnesota Gov.

But, like so many of us, I’m concerned about the future of our democracy,” he wrote in his letter on Friday.\n\nHe went on to misrepresent the protests in Minnesota and the two incidents where violent protesters were killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.\n\n“We’ve now seen the violent murder of American citizens, killed in cold blood in broad daylight by masked ICE agents,” he continued. “These were our neighbors, their lives ended by armed militias entering our communities with impunity. They were denied due process in life and dignity in death by an administration who refuted the reality the world saw, shifting blame to the victims and creating false narratives about their lives and those fateful days.”\n\nThe two activists shot by ICE were far from mere innocent Americans speaking their mind about the actions of the federal government. Both were radicalized and violent, one attempting to use her car to run ICE officers down and the second brought a loaded gun to a protest and resisted arrest when confronted.\n\nStiller continued his attack with vague notions about “checks and balances” in government.\n\n“The Framers of our Constitution believed in checks and balances to power, adding the Bill of Rights specifically to protect individual liberties from potential government overreach. And yet here we are, Innocent people are being harassed, separated from their families, and in some cases killed,” the Night at the Museum star wrote.\n\nHe next seemed to claim that the weeks of property damage, obstruction, and violence committed by anti-ICE gangs has been “peaceful protest.”\n\n“Peaceful protest is a constitutionally protected form of free speech that is essential to our existence as a democracy,” he said. “We have the right to disagree with the actions of the government we elect. The First Amendment also names and protects the freedom of the press. And yet journalists and political commentators have been arrested. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said ‘Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.'”\n\n“Our elected representatives, from the President and members of Congress to the people they appoint and approve, have a responsibility to act with integrity and honesty. To uphold our ideals and values as a nation. To not lie to us, in the face of plain facts,” He wrote.\n\n“We must demand that they represent the expressed will of the people they serve, including removing ICE from our streets; We must demand justice and an end to this lethal chaos,” Stiller wrote without acknowledging that Donald Trump was elected by more than 77 million voters to do exactly what he is now doing with his immigration policy.\n\nHe concluded, writing, “I believe we can reverse this slide toward division and hate. Facing this moment with a return to empathy and love for one another might sound naive, but it’s ultimately what will move our country forward and out of this.”\n\nThis is the same “empathetic” Ben Stiller who in 2021 came out in favor of big tech banning Trump and conservatives from social media to shut down their right to free speech on the Internet. And he is just another one of those Hollywood celebrities who has been heard comparing people to Nazis for disagreeing with his politics.\n\nStiller was also among the many Hollywood celebrities who campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris during the recent election.\n\nHe even appeared in a pro-abortion video alongside Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nStiller also participated in a number of entertainment industry-related fundraising events for Harris.","summary":"Actor and director Ben Stiller has posted a letter to his social media accusing federal immigration officers of being an \"armed militia\" who are guilty of \"murdering American citizens.\"\n\n\nThe post Judge and Jury: Hollywood Celebrity Ben Stiller Declares ICE an &#8216;Armed Militia&#8217; Guilty of &#8216;Violent Murder&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/01/30/judge-and-jury-hollywood-celebrity-ben-stiller-declares-ice-an-armed-militia-guilty-of-violent-murder/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Simple-Jack-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 23:50:23","author":"Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.063},{"id":397877178,"title":"The Most Surprising Moments from Melania Trump's Documentary: Barron's Safety Concerns, Kamala's Sigh and a Michael Jackson Singalong","text":"First lady Melania Trump's new film opened on Friday, Jan. 30, marking a rare global theatrical release for a documentary.\n\n Melania was reportedly purchased by Amazon MGM Studios for a stunning $40 million — 70% of which may have gone directly into the first lady's pocket, The Wall Street Journal claims — and had a $35 million marketing budget that included putting Melania's face on the Las Vegas Sphere.\n\n The first lady hosted an exclusive first viewing at the White House on Saturday, Jan. 24, in the midst of unrest in Minneapolis over the fatal shooting of American citizen Alex Pretti, calling the screening a \"historic moment.\"\n\n The official Melania premiere, which took over the Kennedy Center on Thursday, Jan. 29, was limited to invited guests of the first family, with a politics-heavy black carpet beforehand that saw prominent Republican lawmakers and Cabinet members answering questions about foreign policy, immigration and budget negotiations on Capitol Hill.\n\n The documentary, which Melania described at her premiere as \"beautiful,\" \"emotional,\" \"fashionable,\" and \"cinematic,\" took an untraditional format, forgoing talking head interviews and instead leaning heavily into voiceovers by the first lady.\n\n Directed by controversial Hollywood filmmaker Brett Ratner, the film offers viewers a selective glimpse at the weeks leading up to the Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration, as Melania does fittings for her inaugural outfits, plots her East Wing agenda with other political spouses and attends the numerous events surrounding her husband's second swearing-in ceremony.\n\n Here are the most notable moments from Melania.\n\n The music choices, including a lot of Michael Jackson \n\n Melania suggested that she picked the music carefully while teasing her documentary at the New York Stock Exchange before its premiere, saying, \"Visual storytelling and beautiful music create memories for a lifetime. What do you remember when you hear Rolling Stones? Michael Jackson? Films bring families and friends together, sitting side by side, sharing a collective moment.\"\n\n Her musical references lacked context at the time, but are now understood to play a significant role in setting the tone of her documentary right at the beginning, with \"Gimme Shelter\" by the Rolling Stones — a band who previously delivered a cease-and-desist to President Donald Trump — kicking off the opening scene, followed quickly by Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" as she travels from Mar-a-Lago to Manhattan to begin inauguration prep.\n\n Jackson, as the movie reveals, is her favorite musical artist, and \"Billie Jean\" her favorite song by him. Partway through the film, she recalls meeting Jackson with her husband once, adding, \"He was very sweet. Very nice.\" Then \"Billie Jean\" plays again, and she quietly sings along to it in the car.\n\n Several other hits get their moment in the spotlight during the film, including Aretha Franklin's \"Amazing Grace,\" Boney M.'s \"Sunny,\" The Crystals' \"Then He Kissed Me,\" and Tears for Fears' \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World,\" the last of which plays when she and Donald make their final voyage to Washington before the inauguration.\n\n Fine-tuning the inauguration hat \n\n The film documents Melania's back and forth with designers about her various outfits for inauguration weekend, showing her providing mostly positive feedback at fittings. When she sees her black-and-white inaugural ball outfit, for example, she says, \"Very my colors, black and white. Very me.\"\n\n It also shows the behind-the-scenes conversations surrounding her unforgettable inauguration hat. The wide-brimmed accessory, which she wore for the first half of Inauguration Day, immediately turned into an internet meme when she was pictured at formal events throughout the morning with her face almost entirely covered, and her husband was caught struggling to kiss her on the cheek before taking the oath of office.\n\n The documentary reveals that the hat had potential to be even bigger. When her designer pulled it out at a fitting to seek her approval, she looked at it and said, \"What do you think if we do not so wide?\"\n\n Insights about Barron \n\n Little is revealed about Barron Trump, the only child that Donald and Melania share, in the first lady's movie, though she delivers plenty of quotes about her pride in her son. Eighteen at the time of filming, Barron is only briefly mentioned or shown until the latter part of the film when inauguration weekend arrives.\n\n Melania describes him as a \"confident man\" in voiceover audio and at one point reminisces about him taking swim lessons at Mar-a-Lago with her father, Viktor Knavs, before later taking tennis lessons with her. She later chuckles on camera when she hears Jake Tapper comment on his height while watching live CNN coverage of Inauguration Day.\n\n The most telling moment about how Barron handled the turbulent events of 2024, while he was beginning his freshman year of college, comes as she discusses security for the inauguration alongside Donald, sharing that she has safety concerns after the assassination attempts toward Donald and noting that Barron would not feel comfortable getting out of a vehicle in public view. \"I respect that,\" she says. \"It's his decision.\"\n\n Barron's voice — which became an unexpected point of curiosity on the internet after a childhood video of him with a Slovenian accent resurfaced — is notably omitted from the film, with only one brief bit of audio captured on camera that comes out muffled.\n\n Melania does not interact with any of Donald's other children \n\n Donald's four older children with Ivana Trump and Marla Maples appear in the documentary at various events along with their own families, though Melania is never shown interacting with any family members outside of her husband, her father and her son.\n\n The $40 million Amazon deal gets addressed \n\n Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has worked to rebuild his relationship with Donald since his 2024 election victory and donated generously to his inaugural fund, raising questions about Amazon MGM Studios' decision to buy the rights to Melania for $40 million, which The Wall Street Journal claimed is the most the company has ever spent on a documentary.\n\n Seemingly anticipating criticism surrounding the $40 million price tag, the film briefly addressed the negotiations. In one scene, an aide for Melania gets a phone call where she is warned that a journalist at Puck is asking questions about how the deal came to be. The aide hangs up the phone and suggests in front of the camera that she's not interested in dealing with the reporter to try and defend it.\n\n Marc Beckman, Melania's senior adviser and agent, recently pushed back on the idea that the deal involved politics in a statement to PEOPLE, saying, \"I negotiated the $40 million dollar deal on behalf of Melania Trump. My negotiation included several key players in Hollywood, such as Amazon MGM, Disney, Paramount, and Netflix.\"\n\n \"Although record-breaking, our decision was equally motivated by Amazon MGM’s best-in-class team, its ability to launch in theaters worldwide, plus the docuseries, and its commitment to support a massive global marketing campaign,\" Beckman added.\n\n WSJ reported that Netflix and Apple declined to bid for the documentary, and that Paramount only bid $4 million. The outlet says the second-highest bid was from Disney, who offered $14 million.\n\n Jimmy Carter's funeral \n\n The documentary spends a surprising amount of time on President Jimmy Carter's funeral on Jan. 9, 2025, though primarily because of the date's significance in Melania's personal life: Her mother, Amalija Knavs, died one year earlier on the same day.\n\n After the funeral service in Washington, during which she said she was caught up thinking about her mother, she returned to N.Y.C. and brought the documentary crew into St. Patrick's Cathedral to show her lighting a candle in Amalija's honor.\n\n Asking powerful political wives for guidance \n\n While preparing her first lady initiatives in January 2025, Melania revealed in the documentary that she called on a couple of notable political wives for advice on how they've approached advocacy in their roles.\n\n She takes a video call with French first lady Brigitte Macron in Trump Tower, asking her how she has made progress tackling cyberbullying among children. As Macron talks about France's guidance that children should not have smartphones younger than 11 years old, Melania jots down on a blank pad of paper, \"No phones until 11.\"\n\n She later invites Queen Rania of Jordan for a meeting to throw ideas around.\n\n Donald's reaction to realizing he has to ride with the Bidens \n\n During a briefing on the Inauguration Day schedule with Donald and Melania, the couple were filmed learning that they would have some forced quality time with outgoing first couple Joe and Jill Biden. After the Bidens hosted them for a morning tea at the White House before the swearing-in ceremony, the Trumps were to join them in the same vehicle to ride over to the U.S. Capitol.\n\n \"That's interesting,\" Donald reacts with skepticism. \"That'll be an interesting drive.\"\n\n Though the documentary didn't capture the Trumps saying anything negative about the Bidens behind their backs on Inauguration Day, Donald was open about his dissatisfaction with Biden to the outgoing president's face during his public inauguration speech, portraying the Democrat as incompetent and saying, \"From this moment on, America's decline is over.\"\n\n Kamala Harris' sigh before the transition \n\n Moments before President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were welcomed into the Capitol Rotunda to watch the transition of power to the incoming administration, Melania's documentary crew captured them backstage, appearing distraught by the moments to come.\n\n Two months earlier, Donald had defeated Harris in the presidential election, earning 312 Electoral College votes to her 226.\n\n Harris, in particular, looks agitated, and just before walking through the curtains to take her place on stage, lets out a heavy sigh.","summary":"'Melania' premiered globally in theaters on Friday, Jan. 30, sharing selective glimpses of the first lady's transition back to the White House","url":"https://people.com/most-surprising-moments-from-melania-trump-documentary-barron-safety-concerns-kamala-sigh-and-michael-jackson-singalong-11896456","image":"https://people.com/thmb/c95CEEUmSfPT7eSShDT23JvbUqo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(712x288:714x290)/melania-trump-inaugural-parade-022125-1-11eafb998f804664947494d8e35ab9b4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 23:40:06","author":"Kyler Alvord","authors":["Kyler Alvord"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.443},{"id":397868500,"title":"Where Were You When Don Lemon Was Arrested (and Democracy Died)?","text":"With all due respect to Don McLean and his masterpiece “American Pie,” his song has resonated with me all day as I’ve been beside myself now that Don Lemon has been arrested. Someday, this day will be known as the day democracy and journalism died. Just like that day when the music died. \n\nI can't remember if I cried,When I read about his widowed bride,But something touched me deep inside,The day the music died.\n\nBear with me while I cope, but if I may, I can’t remember if I cried / When I heard about his prison ride / But something touched me deep inside / The day the news biz died.

Or that Walz-Trump negotiation that somehow enabled the Minneapolis Police to actually do their jobs, and the bonus news that it looks like Walz is ruling out public office forever? (If you can believe him.) \n\nThe lemon icing on the cake, however, is the conniptions the left is having over the arrest of Don Lemon for his very active and proud role in the invasion of Cities Church in St. Paul, Minn.

Both journalism and democracy are dying, that is, if you listen to purple-haired Rep. Rosa DeLauro and the Associated Press. Being indicted by a jury of your peers is nothing short of an attack on the truth itself, and of course, our values. \n\nArresting journalists for doing their jobs is an attack on truth and our values as Americans.The freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy.

You may want to notice something here. All of a sudden, AP is calling Lemon a \"journalist\" now that he's been arrested. But when Baker was arrested, AP called him a \"Texas-based writer for a conservative media outlet.\" See the difference? That's Steve below, wearing his Biden bracelets.\n\nDon Lemon says his arrest is “unprecedented” because he’s a “journalist” practicing his First Amendment rights.I’m sure JOURNALIST Steve Baker would like to debate that “unprecedented” argument after the Biden regime had him arrested for covering J6.pic.twitter.com/RWVkDP4Scx— Breanna Morello (@BreannaMorello) January 30, 2026\n\nThe real crime is that we live in a world where you could get punished for coordinating logistics with raid organizers to invade a Christian church while services are going on, shouting the congregants down, traumatizing kids, and forcing people to flee to their cars. That’s journalism. \n\nIf we lose our free press, we lose our democracy. The arrest of Don Lemon and other journalists should be a reminder to our press to continue to aggressively and unabashedly pursue and report the truth for the good of our country. pic.twitter.com/njZNw195G4— Rep. Mike Thompson (@RepThompson) January 30, 2026\n\nI mean, all Lemon was doing was reporting on what he saw, objectively, as any true journalist would. Except for the parts where he points to parents rushing little children to their cars in the snow for fear of their safety, as he says, “I imagine it’s uncomfortable and traumatic for the people here… but that’s what protesting is about.” \n\nYou have to give Lemon credit. He expressed empathy and understanding for the people in real time while he was among those making it traumatic (his word) for those kids. \n\nDon Lemon led a group of protesters to shut down Church services.They screamed in the face of crying children.They blocked parents from reaching their kids in Sunday School.50 parishioners were prevented from leaving.One even broke an arm.Evilpic.twitter.com/joOYGi6tMR https://t.co/UrisFyjAp2— Lucky Teter (@TheMagaHulk) January 30, 2026\n\nIsn’t that what all journalists do? Doesn’t the First Amendment protect your right to invade a church in the middle of services to disrupt them, and then to ambush congregants and clergy by putting them on camera and hitting them with hostile questions and argumentation? I guess we’ll find out. Lemon’s going to have his day in court. \n\nIt’s at this point that I’m supposed to leave you with something to think about, and I really can’t quit thinking about how James Woods put this into perspective. He did so on X with fitting words, and perhaps an even more fitting Norman Rockwell painting that truly does represent the people Lemon & Co. traumatized on that snowy Sunday. And so, I’ll leave it here. \n\nSo much of Lemon’s arrest is perfect. After several activist judges failed to do their duty, a grand jury of citizens indicted Don Lemon on a serious act, the terrorizing of children and others praying at church services.So fitting that The People indicted Don Lemon.🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/gfmXvcvaRN— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) January 30, 2026\n\nFind out what you’re missing behind the members-only wall.

The trio takes an ill-advised shortcut through a remote gated community, where they find themselves trapped after witnessing a murder. Over the course of the night, they are blamed, hunted and fractured by their own differing belief systems, while the perpetrator — played by Van Der Beek — emerges as the cunning patriarch who holds the entire community under his influence.\n\n“This script is the most personal story I’ve ever written,” Burr said in a statement to TheWrap. “It’s set in the community I lived in for the first half of my life, and its characters are an amalgam of myself and my closest friends growing up.”\n\n“Growing up as a biracial person who identified strongly as half-black but who was afforded the occasional benefits that came with being able to pass as white, my perspectives often did not align with those of my white friends, while my experiences did not always align with those of my black friends,” Burr said in a statement. “Trusting authority figures was a privilege. Understanding that not all of my friends had that privilege was a journey.

Melania takes viewers along the ride, even showing her playfully dancing to 'YMCA' as they left the stage at the Starlight Ball. \n\nBut perhaps what's most interesting about it all were the small moments woven in, the ones that many viewers might easily miss.\n\nIf there's one thing for sure that this film showed in the fleeting moments, it's that Melania's love for 19-year-old son Barron is unrivaled - as she also hinted at his most positive personality trait.\n\nThe New York University student was not shown heavily in the film, only a few moments during inauguration day, but the First Lady spoke extremely highly of him throughout.\n\nIn one scene, as she and Donald Trump are sitting in the car together, they talk about Barron, who the President says that he has 'cute conversations' with.\n\n'I love him,' Melania says, as she adds that her son is an 'incredible mind.'\n\nOf course, after Trump was elected, it was revealed that the teen had a big part in his father's campaign, especially when it came to recommending podcasts and YouTube shows for him to appear on.\n\nDuring the film, she also briefly shares that Barron is 'very confident' and that she wants him to live his own life and carve his own path.\n\nIt's a Man's World by James Brown plays in the background, while shots of him at the inauguration parade appear on camera. \n\nHowever, Barron is the only child that's spoken about during the movie. \n\nMelania does not say a word about her four stepchildren - Don. Jr, 48, Ivanka, 44, Eric, 42, or Tiffany, 32, during the 90-minute spectacle.\n\nWhat's perhaps another curious moment in the film are the few minutes before Trump is officially sworn in.\n\nMelania is seen in a room backstage as she awaits to walk out to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.\n\nWhile she is waiting, she's watching the room on a TV that is playing CNN's live feed about the event. She even chuckles when the newscasters, including Jake Tapper, made a comment about Barron's height. \n\nOver the years, Trump has branded CNN as 'fake news' and repeatedly slammed their anchors, like Kaitlan Collins. \n\nThe cameras also capture former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as they await their turn to walk in to the rotunda. At one point, Harris is seen looking impatiently at her watch.\n\nWhile President Trump is not the main focus of this movie, there are a few moments where fans see him by the First Lady's side.\n\nThis includes a snippet at the end of the film, when they return home at 2am, back to The White House, after their inaugural ball circuit. \n\nTrump gets his dinner from the kitchen, as Melania takes off her sky-high heels and sits down on the couch. \n\nThe producers seem to prod Trump about his day, especially with the First Lady accompanying him for it all.\n\n'There's nobody like her, she's very difficult, but there's nobody like her,' Trump told the cameras about his wife.\n\nHe then tries to walk back his 'very difficult' comment by saying that he was just joking, before later heading to off to bed.\n\nThe next day, Melania admits that she doesn't mind that she had been awake for 22 hours straight, because she was part of a historic day for the country.\n\nOf course, since the documentary shows a look into her glamorous life, it also catches glimpses of her Hermès collection that's worth tens-of-thousands of dollars.\n\nWhile she travels back and forth from Mar-a-Lago to New York City to Washington, D.C., she is shown with two never-before-seen Birkin bags in the largest size, 40cm.\n\nOne of the Birkin bags is black, while the other was cream with a brown leather trim, going for over $21,000 on release sites like eBay.\n\nAt the end of the film, she said that she wants to move forward with 'purpose' and 'style' as a First Lady, ending it all with the photoshoot she had for her Official White House portrait last January.\n\nRight before credits roll, viewers are inundated with all of Melania's accomplishments so far, as they scroll across the screen. \n\nThis includes her 'peace letter' to Vladimir Putin, and championing of the 'Take It Down' act, which is a new federal law protecting victims from AI-generated and 'intimate imagery.' \n\n'Melania Trump's commitment to serving the American people and supporting global causes is unwavering,' the last sentence on the screen reads. \n\nDuring Thursday night's premiere of the film at The Kennedy Center, Melania told the Daily Mail about her motivations for making the movie. \n\n'Can you talk a little bit about your inspiration for focusing on these 20 days before inauguration?' the Daily Mail asked on the red carpet, which the First Lady painted black in line with the color scheme of the film's promotion.\n\n'Well, it was my life,' Melania said, walking alongside the President. 'So people will see it transitioning from private citizen to being the First Lady again.'\n\n'The schedule was very intense, they followed me from morning until evening,' the mother of one added.\n\n'And you will see what I have to do and what I did from planning the inauguration, to running my business… taking care of the family, moving to the White House, meeting with security detail, establishing the East Wing and hiring the people that need to work for me – but also they work for the American people.'\n\nAfter it premieres in theaters, the movie will be available to stream on Amazon.","summary":"The First Lady's new 90-minute documentary, Melania, finally hit theatres across the country on Friday - and there a lot of' blink-and-you'll-miss-it' moments to be seen in the feature.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/lifestyle/article-15514049/hidden-subtle-moments-melania-trump-new-movie-theaters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/30/19/105951873-0-image-m-120_1769801782805.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 21:54:12","author":"Editor,Jane Herz","authors":["Editor","Jane Herz"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.4},{"id":397863458,"title":"Border Czar Homan: 145,000 Unaccompanied Alien Children Rescued From Biden Era Neglect","text":"One of the more horrible aspects of the mass illegal immigration that was allowed to fester under the presidency of Joe Biden and whoever was running the autopen was the number of unaccompanied illegal alien children that went missing. Most estimates place the number at 300,000. Until recently, we didn't know what had become of those children.\n\nNow, we have nearly half of them back. On Friday, Border Czar Tom \"The Hammer\" Homan took a few moments off from staring down ICE protestors in Minneapolis to take note of this on his official X account.\n\nThe post continues:\n\n...to tirelessly to run down hundreds of thousands of leads and work numerous investigations to locate more than 300,000 unaccompanied alien children that the Biden Administration turned over to unvetted sponsors, lost track of, and weren’t looking forward. Through their outstanding efforts, they have so far been able to locate more than 145,000! President Trump promised that we would find these children, and under his strong leadership and with his unwavering support, the patriots at these, and other partner, agencies have been—and will continue to do—just that.\n\nMr. Homan doesn't mention what these kids may have been doing when they were found, and that may be for the best.\n\nRead More: Walz Reiterates Priorities in Face-Off With Border Czar Tom Homan\n\nHere's the thing: Civilized people don't exploit children; they protect them. Civilized people don't traffick children, taken away (or more horribly, given away) by their parents. The Department of Homeland Security, the Border Patrol, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have found not quite half of the expected number of lost kids, and with any luck and a lot of dogged determination, they'll find the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-ICE nutbars, shouting and waving signs, are opposing this effort. They are, in effect, supporting the trafficking of children. They are, in effect, supporting the exploitation of children, for purposes that don't bear contemplation.\n\nHow did we get to this sad state of affairs? We might note, yet again, that millions entered during the four years of the Biden administration's non-enforcement of the borders. Many children entered, accompanied and unaccompanied. Only a cursory effort, if even that, was made to determine which kids belonged to which adults. As with the adults, we don't know where many of these kids are or where they are being forced to do. But we're finding out, thanks to the efforts of Tom Homan and the men and women working for him.\n\nNeed any more reminders of what a joke the Biden presidency was? Need another good reason to go vote this fall? This is the work of years. It's amazing what the administration has accomplished in one year. 145,000 kids, now safe from whatever fate awaited them. That wouldn't have happened under a Kamala Harris presidency. \n\nIt's happening now. As always, the legacy media was quick to reply:\n\nEditor’s Note: Thanks to President Trump, illegal immigration into our great country has virtually stopped. Despite the radical left's lies, new legislation wasn't needed to secure our border, just a new president.\n\nHelp us continue to report the truth about the president's border policies and mass deportations.

Journalists, he said, “have their own agenda and it’s not your agenda. ... We're gonna do something about it.”\n\nThe quote came to mind anew on Friday morning. MS NOW reported:\n\nTwo journalists, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, and two people active in Democratic circles in Minnesota have been arrested by federal agents investigating an anti-ICE protest that disrupted a church service.\n\nLemon was in Los Angeles to cover the Grammy Awards when he was taken into custody Thursday.\n\nThere was a recent protest during Sunday services at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the disruption was reportedly driven by demonstrators’ belief that the church’s pastor works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSoon after, federal agents arrested three of those involved with the protest, including civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. Lemon, who was on hand for the developments, has now also been taken into custody, despite the longtime journalist’s insistence that he was at the church to cover the protest, not to participate in it.\n\n“I’m just here photographing, I’m not part of the group ... I’m a journalist,” Lemon is heard saying in one video of the event.\n\nThe Trump administration had tried to secure charges against Lemon in recent days, but to no avail. On Friday morning, however, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted that he’d been arrested anyway — a development the White House celebrated in an unusually provocative way.\n\nTime will tell what becomes of the criminal case, and Lemon’s lawyer said he will “fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.”\n\nBut as the details of the case emerge, it’s worth pausing to appreciate the larger context.\n\nTrump’s approach to the freedom of the press has never been especially healthy — we are talking about a president who’s echoed Joseph Stalin in his attacks on journalists — but his campaign against the media has gotten especially aggressive in recent months.\n\nIn September, for example, the Republican suggested that “evening shows” are “not allowed” to criticize him and that networks that give him “only bad publicity” risk losing their broadcast licenses. At one point, the president went so far as to claim that broadcasters that air evening news programs are doing something “illegal” if the White House disapproves of their coverage.\n\nThe list doesn’t stop there. Trump has sued news outlets that produce coverage he doesn’t like. He’s threatened media outlets over polling data he doesn’t like. He’s threatened to sic federal prosecutors on news organizations that publish reports he doesn’t like.\n\nThe FBI even searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and took her devices.\n\nI’m not talking about tantrums the president has thrown over the last decade, I’m referring to specific incidents that have unfolded over the last six months.\n\nThat journalists have now been arrested is a dramatic escalation, but it’s not a development that came out of nowhere. On the contrary, Trump and his team have launched a systemic campaign against the nation’s free press that is without modern precedent in the United States — and it’s clearly getting worse.\n\nIn the run-up to Election Day 2024, Trump was nearly as eager to attack the free press as he was to attack Kamala Harris. The Republican referred to journalists as “the enemy of the people,” media outlets as “evil,” and news professionals as “scum.”\n\nBut we’re well past the point of ugly taunts and name-calling. What we’re seeing is an authoritarian leader reading from the same playbook Viktor Orban used in Hungary, targeting journalists and journalism in the hopes of bringing it to heel.\n\nIn hindsight, “no one loves the First Amendment more than me” might very well be one of the most offensive lies Trump has ever told.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-arrest-of-journalists-is-the-latest-front-in-his-effort-to-orbanize-the-media","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1769806672/260130-donald-trump-viktor-orban-es_11638879f361_1163887d31e1_1163887fa70d/260130-donald-trump-viktor-orban-es_11638879f361_1163887d31e1_1163887fa70d.jpg?_i=AA&w=1200&h=630&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 21:51:33","author":"Ja’han Jones","authors":["Ja’han Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":397858412,"title":"The Melania ‘documentary’ might play in Orange County... but falls flat in NYC. Here’s why","text":"On a freezing January morning in New York City, I joined 19 fellow moviegoers in Auditorium 10 at AMC 34th Street 14 to watch one of the earliest public screenings in the U.S. of Melania, the $40 million Amazon “documentary.”\n\nIt was obvious from the notepads resting on the tables of the 60-seat theater that most were members of the press, but at least two members of the public had also bought tickets. \n\n“I came mostly out of curiosity,” 55-year-old New Yorker and astrologer Alan Lin told The Independent. \n\nAnother civilian who arrived halfway through the 104-minute movie, and left again a short time later to get a soda, started vaping as the credits rolled. “I liked it,” he told The Independent after the movie ended. “But I might have to go see it again because I missed most of it.” \n\nIf more people went to see the movie twice, it could give ticket sales a boost. Unsurprisingly, sales are proving stronger in more conservative areas like Orange County, California, and Miami, Florida. According to a Wired analysis, only two screenings in the U.S. have completely sold out — one at an AMC in Independence, Missouri, and one at an AMC in Vero Beach, Florida, an hour’s drive north of the Trumps’ residence, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump played down the weak ticket sales at his wife’s premiere at the Kennedy Center. “It’s a very tough business in theaters selling movie tickets after Covid,” he said Thursday night.\n\nWhile Melania has been released with much fanfare, you wouldn’t know it from this New York theater, where it was competing with Academy Award-nominated Marty Supreme and Hamnet, alongside reruns of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. \n\nThe 10:10 a.m. screening — never likely to be the busiest — was on the highest level of the four-storey complex. Promotional posters for Melania were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe first lady is said to be pocketing more than 70 percent of the $40 million Amazon paid to license the film, according to The Wall Street Journal. It was directed by Brett Ratner, the disgraced Hollywood director behind Rush Hour, who first met the Trumps in 2011. He hopes, it’s been reported, that this film will be his big comeback moment following a string of sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, which he denies and has not been charged over.\n\nWhile much has been made in the film of the first lady’s inauguration day “Hamburglar” hat; the golden eggs filled with caviar that guests were served at a banquet on the eve of the ceremony; and several mentions of how tall Barron is, the so-called documentary also serves as a vehicle to promote the MAGA-Trump agenda. \n\nMelania was paid as an executive producer and given direct control over everything in the film’s editorial content, culminating in a product that provides viewers with a narrow window into the “reality” of what kind of first lady she planned to be the second time around.\n\nMuch of the film focuses on the first lady’s messages of “unity” and “humanity,” themes that now jar with scenes that have played out in Minnesota, and other U.S. states, over the past year as a result of the president’s anti-immigration operation. \n\n“The weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant ... is a reminder of why I respect this nation so deeply,” Melania says in the film. “No matter where we come from, we are bound by the same humanity.” \n\nThere are glimmers of causes that the first lady admires. There is a brief video call with First Lady of France Brigitte Macron, where the women share their concerns about the harms of social media on children, and Melania touts her “Fostering the Future” initiative. \n\nBut the second half of the film focuses on behind-the-scenes-style footage - the buildup to and of inauguration day - where the viewer learns nothing new.\n\nDuring one of the glitzy inaugural banquets, there are glimpses of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the president’s former “first buddy” Elon Musk — a reminder of the role Big Tech has played in the making of the film and bankrolling other parts of the Trump administration’s agenda, such as his new ballroom, and donating to the inauguration itself.\n\nThere are a couple of not-so-subtle digs at Democrats. A shot of former Vice President Kamala Harris checking her watch during the inauguration was included, footage of the Trumps waving at the Bidens as they depart the White House aboard Marine One, and a portrait of former President Barack Obama in the White House that has since been moved to a hidden stairwell. \n\nThe movie is packed with flashy shots of Mrs Trump jetting between her home in the gold-plated Trump Tower penthouse in New York City and Mar-a-Lago. \n\nThe occasional interactions between the first lady and the president — including one where she cannot get him off the phone quickly enough and cuts him short with a “Congrats” after he calls to brag about election results — also shed no further light on their marriage.\n\nAt the end, Boney. M’s Sunny accompanies footage of Melania posing for her official portraits as first lady, with the lyrics “the dark days are gone, and the bright days are here” playing.\n\nWhatever the first lady’s vision was for a “unifying” a second term, it’s clear that the nation is more divided than ever.","summary":"There were 20-odd people in Auditorium 10 of AMC 34th Street 14 in New York City to watch the morning screening of Melania – most of whom were journalists, writes Rhian Lubin","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/melania-trump-movie-ticket-sales-new-york-b2911226.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/30/21/27/Premiere-of-Melania-at-the-Kennedy-Center-for-the-Performing-Arts-in-Washington-ohhhob8e.jpeg?crop=4641,3094,x429.5,y0&trim=0,430,0,429&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/luqaBorb-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-30 21:38:17","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":397852950,"title":"The ‘Melania’ Reviews Are Scathing: “Two Hours of Endless Hell”","text":"Skip to main content\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 1:13pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nGoogle Preferred\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nSend an Email\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump calls children while taking part in the NORAD Santa Tracker on Christmas Eve at the Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 24.\n\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nGoogle Preferred\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nSend an Email\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nCan anybody be entirely impartial when reviewing Melania?\n\nPerhaps not. The Amazon MGM documentary about the first lady directed by scandal-plagued filmmaker Brett Ratner with a whopping $75 million price tag (or “bribe,” as Jimmy Kimmel called it) provokes all sorts of feelings — regardless of one’s political leanings — before you even enter the theater.\n\nBut reviews are rolling in just the same, and below are samples of some of the (almost entirely scathing) critiques. Melania is billed as an inside look at Donald Trump‘s partner as she prepared to return to the White House during the 20 days before the 2025 inauguration. The film is rolling out into more than 1,500 theaters across the U.S. this weekend, and its box office returns are being closely watched as a political barometer of sorts.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSelling 'Melania': Brett Ratner and the First Lady Discuss the Making of Their Controversial $75 Million Amazon Doc\n\n'Melania' Review: Brett Ratner's Melania Trump Documentary Is an Unabashed, Fly-on-the-Gilded-Wall Fawn Job\n\nThe reviews below are coming out just as the film is hitting the screens. Mainstream press were reportedly blocked from attending the film’s premiere at the Kennedy Center on Thursday. While screenshots of theaters with unsold seats have been circulating on social media, tracking service NRG has predicted a launch in the $5 million range — which would be enormously successful for a documentary. Exhibitors are less certain, however.\n\nHere are some of the early critiques:\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter: “This is a film that fawns so lavishly over its subject that you feel downright unpatriotic not gushing over it … The expensive propaganda doc is glossily shot and lushly scored, although for some reason Ratner keeps inserting segments shot on what looks like Super 8 film, as if to infuse the Trumps with some of that Kennedy-era aura. Before the film ends with onscreen graphics listing Melania’s achievements as first lady in such laudatory fashion that North Korea would blush, she’s shown posing for her official portrait. Doing her best to look both sexy and authoritative, she seems most in her element.”\n\nThe Atlantic called the film “a disgrace,” saying, “Ratner seems desperate to find action, but there is none. The pace is stultifying … Mostly, Ratner captures his subject walking from liminal place to liminal place in five-inch heels, the camera trailing her like a lap dog … Melania the movie isn’t a documentary; it’s a protection racket. It’s a reminder that the richest people in the world are investing in entertainment brands not because they care about art but because the public does, and because all of these vanity projects and capitulations are a way to consolidate their own power and fortune.”\n\nThe Guardian: “Ratner’s film plays like a gilded trash remake of Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest in which a button-eyed Cinderella points at gold baubles and designer dresses, cunningly distracting us while her husband and his cronies prepare to dismantle the Constitution and asset-strip the federal government … the fun’s not infectious and the guests are a nightmare, and two hours of Melania feels like pure, endless hell.”\n\nThe Daily Beast: “I don’t want to blow anyone’s minds here or throw you off your balance when I inform you the Melania documentary is terrible. Were it not for scattered laughter-inducing scenes — most of which, I would gather, were not intentionally humorous — I would rule it an abomination.”\n\nVariety: “It feels like it’s been stitched together out of the most innocuous outtakes from a reality show. There’s no drama to it. It should have been called Day of the Living Tradwife … Its very existence is a pure expression of that control. By the time Melania arrives at the Inaugural festivities, the film has given itself over to a series of rituals (the candlelight dinner, the Inaugural itself, the luncheon, the Starlight Ball), which feels weirdly fitting since the filmmaking itself is so ritualized. It never lets the air of experience in.”\n\nThe London Evening Standard gave the film its only positive review so far (thus ensuring Melania will not have a 0 percent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes): “If you take this film for what it is, Melania’s own, curated take on herself, then there’s one thing she wants to get across, it’s that there’s human warmth there under the cheekbones and the slanting feline eyes. May I say right now she looks extraordinary for 55? … Is the film worth $40 million? I can’t see it myself, except for the shot of Kamala Harris at the inauguration, which is worth the entrance ticket … She’s a phenomenon. What, exactly, is her relationship with Trump, who was effusive about, ‘my beautiful wife’? We don’t know. The enigma remains.”\n\nThe Independent: “To call Melania vapid would do a disservice to the plumes of florid vape smoke that linger around British teenagers. She calls herself a ‘mother, wife, daughter, friend,’ yet is only depicted preening and scowling … Trump himself is an instantly more charismatic presence on screen. His scenes offer a relief from Melania’s mask of pure nothingness … It will exist as a striking artifact — like The Birth of a Nation or Triumph of the Will — of a time when Americans willingly subordinated themselves to a political and economic oligopoly.”\n\nMore to come.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nBox Office: ‘Melania’ Pacing for $8 Million Opening Weekend\n\nSundance Film Festival Reviews\n\n‘If I Go Will They Miss Me’ Review: Lyrical Dreams and Bittersweet Reality Collide in a Moving, Gorgeously Imagined Father-Son Drama\n\nMelania Trump\n\n‘Melania’ Review: Brett Ratner’s Melania Trump Documentary Is an Unabashed, Fly-on-the-Gilded-Wall Fawn Job\n\nSundance Film Festival reviews\n\n‘Frank & Louis’ Review: Kingsley Ben-Adir and Rob Morgan Bring Transcendent Grace to Prison Drama About Dignity and Compassion\n\nsundance 2026\n\nChanning Tatum and Gemma Chan-Starrer ‘Josephine’ Wins Two Top Awards at Sundance\n\nThe Oscars Are Giving Serious ’70s Vibes\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2026 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

John Fetterman (D-Pa.) has “completely sold out,” slamming the fellow Democrat on CNN for condemning rhetoric that likens U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to Nazis, saying it can “incite violence.”\n\n“John Fetterman is ... the favorite Democratic senator of Donald Trump,” Krasner said during an appearance on “The Source with Kaitlin Collins.” “He’s said that repeatedly. And that’s because John Fetterman has completely sold out the principles on which he ran for office.”\n\n“But what he’s been doing, for quite some time, for whatever reason — and we all know there may be a few reasons — is completely unacceptable for anyone who actually believes in democracy and who actually believes in the rule of law,” continued Krasner, who said he voted for Fetterman.\n\nConservative news outlets scrutinized Krasner earlier this week after he stated that ICE agents are “a small bunch of wannabe Nazis,” adding “we outnumber them” and warning they could be “hunted down” like the Nazis were after World War II. This led to a rebuke from Fetterman.\n\n“That’s gross, and I absolutely condemn that, absolutely,” Fetterman said on Wednesday on Fox News. “Do not compare anyone to Nazis. Don’t use that kind of rhetoric. That can incite violence and ... I strongly reject that and condemn that kind of language in the strongest terms. You know, members of ICE are not Nazis.”\n\nFetterman — who had regularly criticized Trump over his false claims about the 2020 election — later became the only Democratic senator to support Trump’s 2024 nomination for Attorney General Pam Bondi and criticized former Vice President Kamala Harris for calling Trump a “fascist.” Trump last year called Fetterman “the most sensible” Democrat.\n\nKrasner vowed earlier this week to prosecute federal officers who break state laws following Saturday’s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, joining a coalition of prosecutors dubbed “Fight Against Federal Overreach,” or F.A.F.O. — a cheeky reference to the acronym for “fuck around and find out,” which has become a favorite phrase of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other members of the Trump administration.\n\nPolitical tensions surrounding the Trump administration’s anti-immigration raids became increasingly fraught after an ICE officer killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month, and eyewitness videos caught Border Protection officers fatally shooting Pretti.\n\nWhen asked on CNN Thursday if he couldn’t have made his point about ICE without comparing them to Nazis, Krasner replied, “Why would I do that? The reality is, they’re taking almost everything they do out of the Nazi playbook.”\n\nKrasner noted that he hadn’t said “all” ICE agents were like Nazis; however, he added that there are “a lot of great federal officers,” but those who commit alleged crimes like homicide should be treated “like everyone else” by the U.S. criminal justice system.\n\n“The point I was making is actually very straightforward,” he said. “When you kill people, we can hunt you down and bring you to justice, in 10 years, or 20 or 30 years, just like what happened with the Golden State Killer, who was a serial killer in California.”\n\nKrasner continued, “That’s how it worked. It worked that way with the Nazis, but it also works that way with all kinds of other criminals who commit terrible crimes.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/larry-krasner-john-fetterman-has-completely-sold-out_n_697cc2aee4b0d9ba36bd951b?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/697cfde81b0000bf3e6fe6c5.jpeg?cache=omXxqRuyzJ&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 20:17:39","author":"Marco Margaritoff","authors":["Marco Margaritoff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":397831158,"title":"Joe Rogan skips Golden Globes after refusing to pay entry fee for podcast award nomination","text":"Joe Rogan took aim at the Golden Globes after revealing he declined to pay a fee to be nominated for the awards show’s inaugural podcast category.

That, for whatever honest artistic or nefarious political reasons, is what Amazon has paid for the rights to distribute Melania, the new documentary – the most expensive ever made – charting the 20 days before Melania Trump’s return to the White House in 2025, and how the enigmatic First Lady seeks to “reinvent”, “elevate” and “break old norms” of the job of being Donald Trump’s wife.\n\nMelania has been controversial from the moment it was announced. There’s the money – with an additional $35m budget for marketing – and the obvious fact that the project, with 55-year-old Melania herself serving as executive producer, is shameless propaganda.\n\nThere’s the unconscionable choice of director Brett Ratner, of Rush Hour fame, who has been excommunicated from Hollywood since six women accused him of sexual assault allegations in 2017 (no charges were brought). And there are the rumours of unrest on the production itself: Amazon mandated that no staff could opt out of the project for political reasons, two-thirds have reportedly removed their names from the credits, and many have made complaints about Ratner’s on-set behaviour.\n\nIt has been secretive – no advance press screenings have been held. The box office sales have reportedly been “soft” in the UK, despite Donald Trump’s insistence otherwise on Truth Social. At the showing I went to, four people in the seven-strong audience were journalists. \n\nAnd the timing could not be worse. The United States is a country in turmoil, with Trump threatening to take over Greenland and two people fatally shot by federal forces in Minnesota amid mass protests of an immigration crackdown. This glitzy documentary is simultaneously in horrible bad taste, and a news event promising to shed light on one of the most powerful women in the world.\n\nFor a few moments, as Melania’s opening scene swept us over the beach at Mar-a-Lago and zoomed in on a snakeskin Louboutin stiletto with Mick Jagger wailing along to “Gimme Shelter”, I was afraid that Ratner might have delivered a work of glamorous, self-aware high camp that I might have to report I enjoyed.\n\nThis was swiftly kiboshed, however, as Melania’s voiceover – as monotone as her wardrobe – kicked in. She introduces herself “navigating the complexities of life” and takes us into a suite at Trump Tower overlooking Central Park, as she and a group of sycophantic seamstresses compare different shades of navy blue.\n\nWhat follows are a series of loose and mostly unconnected diary events from January 2024. Melania is fitted for a ballgown; Melania assesses the champagne coupes for a candlelit dinner and the “beautiful shades of greige” for the White House interiors; Melania hires her new staff; Melania has a Zoom call with Brigitte Macron about “children” – all while explaining how detail-oriented and fashion conscious and focused on her initiatives she is.\n\nIf there was any reflection whatsoever into the messages she intends to project with her fashion, how she feels about hosting thousands of people at official events, how and why she has redecorated the White House, what she looks for in the team around her and what she expects them to do, or the reasons behind her chosen philanthropic causes, this might threaten to be a film of substance. Alas it – beautifully shot, and with a killer soundtrack featuring Spandau Ballet, Tears for Fears, and Michael Jackson, Melania’s favourite – is all style. (The only takeaway about her style is that she likes the colours black and white.)\n\nWe travel on Trump Force One as the Slovenian-born former model jets between New York, Washington and Mar-a-Lago, which she calls her “refuge from the outside world”. Watching this, in which opulence is everywhere, it is very difficult to imagine she was ever in it.\n\nThe real world is ignored, with some vulgarity, but when reality does encroach, it is with detachment: she watches the California wildfires on TV with sympathy from a luxuriant sofa (it may as well be an ivory tower), attends the funeral of Jimmy Carter and is reminded of her own mother’s death a year before, and meets a freed Israeli hostage, Aviva Siegel, fighting for her husband Keith to be released from Gaza.\n\nThat scene is moving and as emotional as Melania gets – Trump helped secure her husband’s rescue days after he was sworn in – and Melania displays warmth and compassion in the face of raw distress. But you would have to be a monster not to. Nowhere else do we see her bond, there is no suggestion of any friendships, we don’t see anything candid or vulnerable or even, really, human.\n\nWhich is not to say she comes across as badly as she quite obviously must be, given her marriage – she seems nice, composed, and articulate – she is just not interested in letting anyone in. Even in the long sequence at St Patrick’s Cathedral, as she pays tribute to her late mother and discusses her ongoing grief, she does not share details about what she was like or display emotion of any kind.\n\nThis is true of the whole film, which – instead of a personal portrait or a reflection on her experiences in the White House and how they changed her, how she feels about a second term, her nerves about the inauguration and returning to a life of duty – is really a string of platitudes. About America, about her husband, about fallen soldiers, about the momentousness of returning to the White House, about the immigrant experience.\n\nIn Washington she “felt the weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant” (given the anger and despair of American immigrants at the moment, this feels especially crass). At Arlington National Cemetery she is humbled by the servicemen and women defending her rights and reminded that we are all “bound by humanity”. Inauguration Day was “so rich with meaning”.\n\nThose of us who watched news coverage of the day are forced to relive much of that rich meaning again here, with a bonus shot of Kamala Harris checking her watch. Each moment of that 22-hour media opp, Melania insists, was “filled with historic purpose”. Conspiracy theorists who accuse her of being a body double or dead will have to concede that from the way this woman speaks, it is obvious she has spent several decades around the bluster of Donald Trump. Whom, if it wasn’t obvious enough, we learn little about.\n\nWe see one conversation in which he drones on and she tries to get him off the phone, another in which she wryly offers edits for his inaugural speech (which he reluctantly takes). I did enjoy hearing them catch up about 19-year-old Barron, the president revealing “I love him, he’s cute, we have cute conversations” to his wife, as if discussing a neighbour’s toddler rather than their own nearly adult son.\n\nMelania is worse than a bad film – it’s a boring one. A documentary must have failed its subject if you come away less curious about them than before, and I found myself much more interested in the people around the First Lady, those desperate for proximity to her gilded cage, than the woman herself. The White House staff, the drivers, the stylists, the young women interviewing for jobs in the East Wing.\n\nA documentary also must have failed its subject if you wind up wanting to hear more from her husband. Which is the worst part of all: in the hope of comedy, in the hope of drama, in the hope of a twist, I watched Melania and found myself wishing there had been more of Donald Trump.\n\nMelania is in cinemas now","url":"https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/melania-trump-reveals-nothing-gross-glitzy-ropaganda-4202678","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SEI_278362803.jpg?crop=356px%2C21px%2C844px%2C476px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 19:42:39","author":"Sarah Carson","authors":["Sarah Carson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":397855152,"title":"What’s a ‘Yinzer’? Our reporters’ roundtable with Gov. Josh Shapiro.","text":"Reporters packed the room Thursday for a Monitor Breakfast event with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. And there were plenty of national issues to discuss – immigration raids, political violence, rising antisemitism.\n\nBut when a reporter introduced herself as having “Pittsburgh roots,” Governor Shapiro couldn’t resist going local.\n\n“Great, another Yinzer!” he said, using Pittsburgh slang for a city resident. “Are you still a Steelers fan?”\n\nYes, she assured him. “Stillers,” Mr. Shapiro threw in, again shifting to Pittsburghese. (He’s from Philadelphia, but is apparently bilingual.)\n\nThe governor is on a book tour, promoting his memoir, “Where We Keep the Light.” The book paints a self-portrait of a man who’s all about his family, his Jewish faith, and “getting stuff done.”\n\nBut for the media, the interest is all about 2028 and the widely held assumption that Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, will run for president. At a time of deep national division, he prides himself on his ability to work across the aisle.\n\nStill, ask Mr. Shapiro straight up if he’s running, as the reporter from Pittsburgh did, and he demurs. Because he has to. He’s up for reelection this November, and while he’s strongly favored to win, the midterm elections are on a razor’s edge – both for control of the U.S. Congress and his state legislature. Pennsylvania is the nation’s biggest swing state, and he enjoys high approval ratings.\n\n“I don’t think we should be thinking about anything other than curtailing the chaos, the cruelty, and the corruption of this administration,” Mr. Shapiro says, as quoted in the Monitor’s coverage.\n\nBut the governor’s book did make waves earlier this month, pre-release, when a reporter got an advance copy and highlighted the controversy over his vetting by Kamala Harris’s team for the vice-presidency in 2024. Mr. Shapiro expressed upset over this question: “Have you ever been an agent for the Israeli government?”\n\nIn the book, Mr. Shapiro cries antisemitism. The issue of vetting came up last week in our Monitor Breakfast event with another prominent Jewish Democrat, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Mr. Emanuel expressed sympathy with both sides, saying the question was “not artful, but you have to ask.” Yet another top Jewish Democrat, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, also defended the process as “tough” but necessary.\n\nNotably, all three men are widely viewed as eyeing the presidency. And thus the issue of rising antisemitism could be a dominant theme in 2028. Indeed, the night before our roundtable with Mr. Shapiro, a motorist rammed his car multiple times into a major Jewish institution, the Chabad-Lubavitch world headquarters, in Brooklyn, New York. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime.\n\nIn fact, I told Mr. Shapiro after our event had ended, I have personally experienced antisemitism. I have received nasty emails from people who assume I’m Jewish, I said. “Lovely, just forward them to me,” Mr. Shapiro responded.\n\nOn a lighter note, in our post-roundtable chit-chat, we got back to the subject of football. The night before, while doing a book event in Boston, Mr. Shapiro mentioned visiting with Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots who is also working to fight antisemitism. My ears perked up.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” I said, “but I’m from Boston. Go Pats!”\n\nAfter several bad years, the Patriots are back in the Super Bowl. Mr. Shapiro was gracious, given that his hometown Philadelphia Eagles, who won the Super Bowl last year, won’t repeat.\n\n“I lived through those lean years with the birds, with the Eagles,” the governor said, “and so it’s kind of neat to see them [the Patriots] as good as they are.”","summary":"Josh Shapiro’s book tour may be laying the groundwork for a presidential run.

But for a documentary about the lead-up to President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, the commander in chief stays very much in the periphery.\n\nHere are the most noteworthy moments of the film, which is executive produced by the first lady and directed by disgraced Hollywood filmmaker Brett Ratner:\n\nPresident Trump jokes that Melania is ‘very difficult’ but an ‘incredible’ first lady\n\nTrump only appears a handful of times throughout “Melania.” Early in the movie, he can be heard in voiceover as she chats with him on the phone. “Hi, honey,” he says, to which she responds, “Hi, Mr. President.” He calls the election results “a big win,” adding that he won the popular vote in a landslide and had not anticipated such high numbers.\n\nLater, he greets Melania as she gets off the plane in Washington, kissing her on the cheek as he says she looks “very beautiful” like “a movie star.”\n\nThe few occasions that Trump does speak to the film cameras, it’s to compliment his wife. “She’s the most incredible first lady … She’s very difficult, but there’s nobody like her,” Trump says with a laugh, adding that she’s “not difficult” before bidding her goodnight.\n\nDonald Trump wonders why his inauguration has to ‘compete’ with football\n\nDuring a visit to their Florida home of Mar-a-Lago, Trump and Melania meet with staffers to nail down Inauguration Day plans. His team tells him that he’ll be riding with President Joe Biden to the U.S. Capitol on the day. “That’ll be an interesting drive,” Trump says with a smirk.\n\nThe couple proceeds to ask questions about their safety, as well as why the College Football Playoff national championship game between Ohio State and Notre Dame is being broadcast on Inauguration Day.\n\n“We have to compete with the championship? How did that happen?” Trump queries, adding “I think they did that on purpose.”\n\nIn that same exchange, he looks at a photo from his 2017 inauguration, where Melania wore a sky-blue Ralph Lauren dress with matching gloves. Trump then turns to Melania and asks, “You have a good dress? You have a nice dress? This one blew everyone away.” He asks if her 2025 inauguration outfit can compete, to which she laughs. \n\nBarron Trump is mostly MIA during the 'Melania' movie\n\nBarron has largely stayed out of the spotlight during both of his father’s presidential terms, and he is now in his second year at New York University.\n\nOn the rare occasions that he does appear in the documentary, he is filmed from the back or in side profile, save for a shot of him waving to the crowd during an inauguration celebration at Capital One Arena in Washington, which is soundtracked by “It’s a Man’s, Man’s, Man’s World” by James Brown & the Famous Flames.\n\n“Barron is a very confident young man,” Melania says in voiceover, adding that he got “quite the reception” at the event. At other points in the film, she praises her son for having a good head on his shoulders, explaining that she’s excited to see him forge his own path and start a family one day.\n\nMelania Trump does the ‘YMCA,’ sings along to Michael Jackson\n\nAs noted, “Melania” is short on genuine insight into the first lady and her duties. The film briefly features both virtual and in-person meetings with Queen Rania of Jordan, France’s first lady Brigitte Macron, and freed Israeli hostage Aviva Siegel, as Melania gets involved with various humanitarian causes.\n\nShe speaks broadly in platitudes about serving the American people and leading with love: “I’ll move forward with purpose,” Melania says at the end of the film. “And, of course, a sense of style.”\n\nThe few times that we really get to see the more human side of Melania are while she dances and half-sings along to both Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” and Village People’s “YMCA.” at various points. She laughs at a CNN inauguration broadcast, as the anchors marvel at how tall Barron is. (He is 6-foot-9, to be fair.)\n\nAnd although she doesn’t cry, per se, Melania appears visibly emotional during one scene as she watches news coverage of last year’s Los Angeles wildfires. \n\nDonald Trump chats with President Joe Biden, pats him on the shoulder\n\nA handful of famous faces appear throughout the documentary, including tech giants Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg at different inaugural events, as well as Trump’s presidential opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, during the ceremony itself. None of them are heard speaking in the film.\n\nBiden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, also appear a few times, as they pose for a picture with the Trumps on Inauguration Day. Before boarding Air Force One, Trump looks back at Biden and gives him a tap on the shoulder, and the two men can be seen chatting by the helicopter outside the U.S. Capitol.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/30/melania-movie-trump-documentary-revelations/88361149007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/29/USAT/88415363007-20250120-t-195040-z-710889320-rc-2-udca-9-nxpd-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpinauguration.JPG?auto=webp&crop=6272,3528,x419,y277&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 19:15:28","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.215},{"id":397817794,"title":"Nevada's first-in-the-nation primary bid gets boost from Latino Victory","text":"An influential Latino political group is arguing that Nevada should be the first state to vote in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary, directly challenging New Hampshire's traditional claim on the first-in-the-nation primary. CBS News has learned that Latino Victory is endorsing Nevada's push as national Democrats consider which states should have the earliest â and likely most influential â say in who the party's next presidential nominee is, after stark setbacks in the 2024 presidential election. \"Maintaining the status quo or prioritizing less diverse states like New Hampshire would be a disadvantage to our party's presidential nominee,\" Katharine Pichardo, the president and CEO of Latino Victory said in a letter directed to influential DNC members. \"Bottom line: Nevada is a diverse battleground that will produce a battle-tested nominee â and that is exactly what Democrats need at this moment to win back the White House.\" The show of support for Nevada's bid comes as the state continues on a collision course with New Hampshire and South Carolina. Internal party documents show they're also competing to be the first state to kick off the Democrats' 2028 presidential primary season. Being among the first states carries enormous influence, with candidates often frequenting those chosen with campaign events and showering them with money and attention that can help bolster party building efforts and build support among voters. The debate may seem esoteric, given the party brand issues Democrats have contended with and the fact that the 2028 election is still years away. But which states Democrats christen with the first positions in the political calendar could prove to be pivotal in the future identity of the party. The Democratic Party's primary calendar has been a point of contention in recent years. Standards had long held that the Iowa caucuses would start the season, while New Hampshire would have the first primary. South Carolina, with its deeply influential base of Black voters, was given an early state slot starting with the 2008 cycle, as was Nevada. But the relative lack of racial diversity in Iowa and New Hampshire, and a chaotic Iowa Caucus finish in 2020, led the party to overhaul its calendar for the 2024 cycle. Those changes jettisoned Iowa, put South Carolina first and led to a standoff with New Hampshire â which ended up holding a primary not sanctioned at the time by the party. Democrats are now rethinking the calendar once again, following a 2024 election that saw GOP President Trump win all seven of the nation's presidential battleground states, including Nevada. Nationwide in the 2024 election, Trump narrowly trailed former Vice President Kamala Harris among Hispanic voters, according to a Pew Research Center analysis, a shift towards the president that represented a major improvement from his past runs for the White House. Federal census data shows in Nevada, more than 30% of the population is Hispanic or Latino. Four or five states will be picked by Democratic leaders to have their respective 2028 nominating contests before Super Tuesday. Regional considerations are key here: one state each will be picked from the East, Midwest, South and West. The party's influential rules and bylaws panel is expected to start considering the applications at a Saturday meeting in Puerto Rico. Under its own longstanding state law, New Hampshire attempts to have the first presidential primary in the country. In a pitch to DNC members, New Hampshire's Democratic party argued the state \"serves as a critical testing ground for whether candidates can attract independent votersâan issue that couldn't be more pressing for the Democratic Party nationally.\" \"Moreover, the state's importance to winning the general election cannot be overstated: it was the closest state that Vice President Harris won in 2024, and history reminds us that had Al Gore won New Hampshire in 2000, which he lost by just over 7,000 votes, he would have been president regardless of Florida's outcome,\" the document reads. Whether DNC members follow that thought process remains to be seen. Meanwhile South Carolina, which then-President Joe Biden helped vault to the top slot for the 2024 cycle after voters in the state essentially saved his 2020 presidential primary campaign, remains incredibly influential in Democratic politics. \"South Carolina offers the Democratic Party a proven, disciplined, and consequential first test of presidential candidates, one grounded in the voters who are the backbone of the Democratic coalition and in the real-world demands of building majorities,\" the state's Democratic party said in their initial pitch this year. Nevada has been working for months to try and become the first 2028 presidential primary state for Democrats. State party officials have also received support from Somos Votantes, a large national Latino organizing group. \"The primary calendar shapes whose voices get to be heard first, so the order of the states in the presidential primary directly affect which voters candidates are forced to listen to early and then consistently,\" said Melissa Morales, founder and president of Somos Votantes. \"Any process that fails to center Latinos early risks repeating mistakes of past cycles.\"Documents reviewed by CBS News show that Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, New Mexico, Delaware, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia have started making pitches to the DNC to be among the first four or five states to hold 2028 nominating contests. Amid this debate, there are clear tensions among Democrats about how to address the left's stumbles in the 2024 presidential election, when Democrats lost the White House, Senate and failed to retake the House. The latest stage of the national party's work on the primary calendar comes weeks after a highly scrutinized decision by DNC chairman Ken Martin to not publicly release a full report centered on the 2024 election cycle. The party of the incumbent president usually faces congressional losses in the midterms, and the Republican Party under President Donald Trump is already facing that prospect this fall. But even a successful midterm cycle for Democrats doesn't necessarily inoculate them from struggles and challenges in 2028. The fear of an outcome like the 2024 election is a dynamic that haunts the party's longer-view outlook. Setting the 2028 primary calendar could represent one of the first major signals about how the party is addressing its setbacks in the last presidential election. \"We know that the Democratic electorate is becoming more and more diverse with Latinos being the fastest growing demographic,\" Pichardo, the Latino Victory leader, told CBS News in an interview. \"If Democrats are serious about winning back the working class, Latino, African-American, and AAPI voters, Nevada should be the first as it is a microcosm of America.\"","summary":"Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina are vying to be the first state to vote in the 2028 Democratic presidential primaries.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nevadas-first-in-the-nation-primary-bid-gets-boost-latino-victory/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/30/e3f1583f-bf8b-4b05-a1c3-bd045b18afec/thumbnail/1200x630/9ca0e80adc169dc83ae53d64a5aca432/gettyimages-1986211188.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 19:00:00","author":"Hunter Woodall,Nidia Cavazos","authors":["Hunter Woodall","Nidia Cavazos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.135},{"id":398000240,"title":"The Melania Trump Documentary Is a Disgrace","text":"Recently, I watched a new documentary about an enigmatic woman of notable charm and courage preparing for one of the most momentous events in her life. That woman is E. Jean Carroll, and the movie is Ask E. Jean, a feature about Carroll’s life and her decision to sue President Trump in civil court for defamation and sexual battery.\n\nIn 2019, Carroll alleged that Trump had sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s; Trump promptly denied the allegation while deriding Carroll at rallies and in TV interviews as “totally lying” and “not my type.” Ask E. Jean follows Carroll as she prepares for the trial, revealing why she buried what had happened for so long; it captures, too, her profound discomfort while she’s badgered during depositions by Trump’s legal team, and her eventual victory. (The jury found Trump liable for the sexual abuse and defamation of Carroll and ordered him to pay $5 million in compensation; Trump’s appeal is currently awaiting review by the Supreme Court.)\n\nBut very few people have seen Ask E. Jean or even heard of it. Streaming platforms and distributors have steered absolutely clear of a movie that so plainly impugns the president, regardless of its obvious relevance and engaging portrait of Carroll, whose decision to come forward was resolutely in spite of everything she knew she’d face as a result. “We all have a lot at stake here. This lawsuit is not just for me; it almost has nothing to do with me,” she explains in one scene to the director, Ivy Meeropol. “It’s for, really, women across the country.” In court, Carroll faced lawyers for a former (now reelected) president, making the case, as she puts it, that Trump was protected by “his scope of employment as president when he called me too hideous to rape.”\n\nThe president’s lack of impulse control and trigger-happy litigiousness have often collapsed in court, but they’ve had a profound impact on the entertainment industry. Both ABC and CBS have settled lawsuits served by Trump rather than fight, seemingly deducing that the cost and capitulation are worth it if they smooth the way for mergers and keep the mercurial and media-fixated president off their backs. (“A big fat bribe” is how the late-night host Stephen Colbert characterized CBS’s $16 million settlement to Trump, shortly before his own CBS show was canceled; CBS called the cancellation “purely a financial decision.”) And so you can’t see Ask E. Jean, but you have no end of options this weekend when it comes to watching a documentary about the current first lady, Melania: Twenty Days to History, whose unusual genesis (a $40 million bid from Amazon, which was reported to include a roughly $28 million personal fee for Melania Trump, and a further $35 million marketing budget) and aggressive rollout across more than 3,300 theaters reveal an awful lot about our entertainment infrastructure, none of it good.\n\nTo be fair, most people involved with Melania do seem to feel shame, if not the ones who matter. The publicity emails sent from Amazon regarding the movie have no individual names or email addresses attached, as though no one wanted their career or personal brand sullied by association. A report in Rolling Stone this week alleged that two-thirds of the production crew based in New York who worked on the film similarly asked to be uncredited. (“I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the propaganda element of this,” one reportedly said.) Melania is directed by Brett Ratner, best known for the Rush Hour franchise and for the multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment leveled at him by half a dozen people in 2017. (Ratner has denied or disputed the allegations; Melania marks his return to public life after a nine-year absence, although a photo of Ratner with the accused sex trafficker Jean-Luc Brunel—now deceased—did pop up in the last month.)\n\nAt the Melania screening I attended today, what was most surprising about the movie was how little is actually in it, despite a running time just shy of two hours. Mostly, Ratner captures his subject walking from liminal place to liminal place in five-inch heels, the camera trailing her like a lap dog. She looks immediately uncomfortable being filmed, an effect that never quite goes away. In voiceover, she opines vaguely about wanting the film to capture her motivations as first lady. “Every day I live with purpose and devotion,” she explains, while we see her being fitted for her inauguration outfit, working with designers to manage the aesthetic of the presidential balls, and interviewing various white women with barrel curls to join her staff. She talks proudly about having, during Trump’s first term, restored the White House Rose Garden (unfortunately since converted by her husband into a paved patio area).\n\nRatner seems desperate to find action, but there is none. The pace is stultifying. The camera lingers on a designer’s aide who trembles at the task of trimming Melania’s inaugural blouse with scissors. We see the first lady videoconference with Brigitte Macron, her French counterpart, about her Be Best initiative. Halfway through, Ratner picks up what seems to be Melania’s father’s Super 8 camera and never puts it down, so the latter part of the film is studded with grainy handheld scenes of helicopters and Arlington National Cemetery. Trump is inaugurated—Ratner uncharitably includes scenes of a backstage Kamala Harris looking pissed off—and we follow the president and his wife to three balls. Melania shows off her custom-made inauguration gown, stark white with black ribbons overlaying it, a dress that now looks unavoidably like the redacted Epstein files.\n\nWhat’s in the film—lots of shots of tech bosses paying homage to Trump, Ratner trying to get Melania to sing along to “Billie Jean,” Melania’s insistence on the sacred values of the Constitution and its protection of individual rights—is almost less compelling than what’s not. (Any glimpse of Stephen Miller.) But Melania’s heavy focus on its subject, despite her husband being one of the most attention-sucking people on the planet, does raise one interesting question: Is his wife the only person Trump can stand being upstaged by? Throughout, the president seems truly proud and enamored of Melania. “You look beautiful, beautiful,” he tells her in one scene. “Like a movie star.” (I laughed out loud at one phone call, during which Melania, in New York, seems exasperated when her husband won’t shut up about how big his election victory was.)\n\nWhat might make people curious to see Melania, despite the movie’s questionable origins and terrible timing—the merch-heavy White House premiere for the movie on Saturday night coincided with mass grief and outrage in America over the killing of the ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents—is the fact that Melania Trump is our least accessible first lady in recent memory. Like all true divas, she mostly declines to reveal herself in public these days unless there’s a formal event or something to sell. Almost all of her Instagram posts over the past year have promoted her movie, her branded ornament collection, her memecoin, or her “AI audiobook.” At her husband’s second inauguration, she wore a black-and-white broad-brimmed hat that covered half of her face and kept everyone near her at arm’s length. (On a state visit to the United Kingdom, she opted for a dark-purple version so forbidding that you couldn’t see her at all, an aesthetic the website Defector labeled “Babadook mode.”) The first lady is both “fiercely private,” according to one of her former confidantes, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, and largely unbothered by scandal. “For her,” Wolkoff wrote in her 2020 book, Melania and Me, “public disgrace was nothing more than brushing sand off her feet after a quick stroll on the beach.”\n\nOthers might not be as adept at doing so. It bears underlining here that first ladies prior to Melania have typically declined—out of a sense of propriety rather than specific ethical constraints—to profit directly from their role while in office. Trump world has been notably different in this regard. The idea for a documentary was supposedly sparked by the success of Melania’s 2024 memoir of the same title, in which she ignored the dozens of women who’d accused her husband of sexual assault, Carroll among them, but spent four full pages analyzing a failed caviar-based skin-care line she’d hoped to launch. (Donald Trump has always denied any allegations of assault and harassment.) “It is my sincere wish that you will find inspiration in my journey,” the first lady wrote in the introduction, before gliding over highly selective accounts of her early days dating “Donald,” her jewelry line for QVC, her “proactive adoption of blockchain technologies” (Melania-branded non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies), and her relationships with her stepchildren, which apparently benefit from “boundaries.”\n\nMelania the book wasn’t an autobiography so much as a highly priced brochure. Melania the movie isn’t a documentary; it’s a protection racket. It’s a reminder that the richest people in the world are investing in entertainment brands not because they care about art but because the public does, and because all of these vanity projects and capitulations are a way to consolidate their own power and fortune. It is galling to think about Jeff Bezos (whose wife is a former TV news anchor) deciding to invest so much money apparently to buy the president’s good graces while reportedly preparing to cut hundreds of jobs at The Washington Post. (Amazon reps have insisted that the company invested so heavily in the movie purely “because we think customers are going to love it.”) It is also galling—to me at least—that Apple CEO Tim Cook attended the premiere of Melania this week while the Trump administration’s militarized forces are killing Americans and detaining preschoolers. Melania Trump really doesn’t seem to care about the optics of launching her $75 million show reel while the country is in such profound crisis—that much she has always made clear. But most Americans do. And the particular details of the past week—the demonstrations and the tear gas in Minneapolis, the Melania ads covering the Sphere, the themed macarons at the White House, the scurrying-away of many who were professionally involved with this documentary—should be remembered long after the film itself is forgotten.","summary":"The exorbitant film captures the rotten state of the entertainment industry.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/melania-trump-documentary-review/685829/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/9KIyin0VsIcLpvD3c1RlnRELGBc=/440x0:1565x1125/1080x1080/media/img/mt/2026/01/2026_01_29_Gilbert_Melania_documentary_final_horizontal/original.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 18:30:00","author":"Sophie Gilbert","authors":["Sophie Gilbert"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.109},{"id":397806962,"title":"Melania film review: She's not Princess Di but she wants us to know she cares","text":"It’s the heels you see first…vertiginous white stilettos. Then the front of the shoes… leopardskin with a red trim. Eventually the camera moves up and there’s a striking white cotton dress, nipped in waist, full skirt. Then a shot of Melania from the back. And only in the limousine do you see Melania full-on, almost smiling. \n\nThat’s the big reveal in this film. The enigma smiles, she actually does. Her face in repose looks closed, but that, I think, is the Balkan look. If you take this film for what it is, Melania’s own, curated take on herself, then there’s one thing she wants to get across, it’s that there’s human warmth there under the cheekbones and the slanting feline eyes. May I say right now she looks extraordinary for 55? \n\nShe thanks the staff who say goodbye at Mar-a-Lago, and she seems genuinely glad to see everyone at the White House when she gets back there. She’s plainly a friend of her designer, Herve Pierre - they talk shop about her dress. She hugs a former Israeli hostage after she sobs in front of her and admires the picture of her husband, Keith, on her t-shirt. She goes to the Arlington memorial and thinks about the families of the boys that were lost in the Afghan withdrawal. She’s not Princess Di, but she wants us to know she cares. She has herself filmed at the back of her limousine singing along – though we don’t really hear what her voice is like – to Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. At the second of the three balls on inauguration night, she lets herself go a bit to YMCA, and jives just a little, momentarily like the flirty teenager she once must have been, before returning to her default reserve.\n\nThis is, remember, all her own work, or at least as mediated by Brett Ratner, the producer (who has a lot to thank her for in rehabilitating him after some years in the Holly wood doghouse), so what we see is what she wants us to see. And at the front of what she gives us is a devoted daughter. She attends with Donald the funeral of the former president, Jimmy Carter, but it’s the first anniversary of her mother Amalija’s death, and she’s still mourning. She tells us “I think about her every day”. She’s impassive in black at Washington cathedral, but it’s her own mother she’s thinking about. \n\nAfter she returns to New York, she makes a trip – “some time by myself” – to St Patrick’s Cathedral to light a candle (actually a few) for her mother. She stands before the high altar silently – she’s meant to genuflect, bend the knee, but it may be tricky in those heels to get up again- and we can only surmise what her own relationship with God is. One of the two beaming clerics at the entrance, who are plainly loving all this, offers to bless her as she leaves, and she says, yes, that would be nice. But she doesn’t cross herself. She tells them, “My mother came here often when she was in New York”, and that’s why she’s there. She gets her father, Viktor, to pay tribute to the nearly 60 years the couple spent married. “My parents’ marriage was an example of life-long love,” she says, which puts her own union with Trump into a new perspective. Slovenia, her country of birth, as she puts it, gets a look in with the Slovene crystal coupes at the dinner.\n\nWhat you also get from the off is a sense of her steely self discipline. She puts us in our place at the off by saying that her architecture degree (she left university after a few months, but no matter) means that she has an eye for symmetry, but she insists more than once on her “artistic vision”. That means in practice an awful lot of work on the detail of the official entertainments for the inauguration…we see her consultant, at one point, unveiling a big reveal in tissue paper. What can it be? It’s the official invitation for the inauguration ball. “Red. Your colour,” he breathes. “It’s beautiful, she murmurs. And when it comes to the entertainments, she’s on that too: caviar in gold eggs. Really.\n\nShe put in, she tells us, a lot of work from her teenage years into her career as a model. If you factor into that her mother’s job as a tailor/dressmaker, it’s plain she doesn’t regard being a clotheshorse as something rather shameful. We see a lot of the discussion that goes into the making of her outfits. Pierre Herve is a class act; “She’s very different”, he tells us, because she knows what she’s talking about. “My mother taught me” she says, “That it’s all about the discipline of the craft”. And so we find her talking about the width of her lapels for the inauguration outfit, or asking for her skirt to be closer at the hip (my God) with the eye of an expert. She’s not ashamed of it because she knows the work that goes into it.\n\nBut she also wants us to know, because she tells us, that she has remade the role of the First Lady. We see her talking about screen time with Brigitte Macron – polished, in brown leather jacket – on Zoom. We see her face to face with Queen Rania of Jordan, about her special project, care for children in foster care, and they promise to work together. She gives, in the closing credits, an account of her achievements in the role: the banning of non consensual sexual images, the letter to President Putin that secured the release of kidnapped Ukrainian children, the release of that Israeli hostage (if only she’d met some Palestinians too, heaven knows what might have come from it); and the work for foster children. She’s done things, she wants us to know.\n\nIs the film worth $40 million? I can’t see it myself, except for the shot of Kamala Harris at the inauguration, which is worth the entrance ticket, but if Jeff Bezos and his millions are that easily parted, good luck to her. The greatest relief in the whole thing came when she actually took her heels off, after three balls, and, as she says, 22 hours without sleep. She’s a phenomenon. What, exactly, is her relationship with Trump, who was effusive about, “my beautiful wife”? We don’t know. The enigma remains.\n\nMelania is in cinemas now","summary":"This documentary - with a limited cinema release before it hits Amazon - follows America’s First Lady in the 20 days leading up to her husband’s second inauguration","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/melania-film-review-b1269002.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2026/01/30/6/23/Premiere-of-Melania-at-the-Kennedy-Center-for-the-Performing-Arts-in-Washington-qx6imi5w.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 18:18:17","author":"Melanie McDonagh","authors":["Melanie McDonagh"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.236},{"id":397819020,"title":"Opinion: California’s existential issues scare off top candidates for governor","text":"This commentary was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nCalifornia faces a half-dozen existential issues that threaten the state’s future economic and social well-being, and they have persistently defied attempts to resolve them over the last 25 years.\n\nThey are — in no particular order, and often intertwined — high living costs, high poverty levels, homelessness, a housing shortage, uncertain water supply and subpar public education outcomes. There are also a number of lesser issues, some being components of what I would consider the “Big 6,” such as a deficit-ridden state budget and a shaky and increasingly expensive power supply.\n\nGavin Newsom will vacate the office a year hence and probably run for president, leaving some issues slightly better, some slightly worse but all still unresolved.\n\nCollectively, they should dominate the agenda of those we will be electing to office this year, particularly the man or woman who emerges as the next governor. However, they continue to threaten the future because, in a state as large and complex as California, forging a civic and political consensus to resolve them is numbingly difficult.\n\nCould that be the reason why so many potentially viable candidates have decided not to make the run? Is this why the field remains so unsettled, even at such a relatively late point in the political cycle?\n\nCould it be that those who dropped out or never dropped in looked at the daunting array of potentially intractable issues they would face and concluded that failure would be their most likely fate?\n\nWe’ll never know for certain what unmotivated them, but the intriguing fact is that several of those who decided not to run would have potentially led the pack, such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Rob Bonta, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla and Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso.\n\nThose still in the race are interesting in their own way, but none stands out as an obvious or natural frontrunner and their credentials tend to be on the thin side.\n\nCaruso, who ran a credible campaign for Los Angeles mayor four years ago, was the latest to take himself out of not only a campaign for governor but also one for mayor. He said he was “deeply disappointed to step back from an election I believe is so critical to California’s future.”\n\n“Though my name will not be on a ballot, my work continues,” Caruso said on X. “Public service does not require a title. It is, and always will be, my calling.”\n\nCaruso’s announcement came just a few days after Bonta, who had initially shunned a campaign for governor before saying he was weighing a run, finally announced that he would seek another term as attorney general.\n\nThat seemingly leaves just a field of second-tier candidates, as measured by standard political odds-making. In true 2026 fashion, as some drop out, others emerge as potential gubernatorial candidates.\n\nThe latest to do so is San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, a Democrat who has been a sharp critic of how Democrats in Sacramento, including Newsom, have been running things. On the day Bonta pulled the plug, Mahan let it be known that he was considering a run, and then officially announced his candidacy on Wednesday.\n\nMahan told the San Jose Mercury News that none of the remaining candidates had articulated a “clear and compelling” vision or the “bold and independent leadership” needed to tackle the state’s thorny problems, especially homelessness.\n\n“I see business as usual in Sacramento,” said Mahan, who was at the Capitol advocating for reforms aimed at making housing more affordable. “I don’t see anyone acting like it’s a crisis.”\n\nWith backing from Silicon Valley, Mahan could be a formidable contender for the state’s top-two primary in June.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.","summary":"Could it be that those who dropped out or never dropped in looked at the daunting array of potentially intractable issues they would face?","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2026/01/30/california-existential-issues-scare-off-gubernatorial-candidates/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1536%2C1024&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 18:00:00","author":"Dan Walters • CalMatters Columnist,Fred Greaves","authors":["Dan Walters • CalMatters Columnist","Fred Greaves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":397781918,"title":"'Washington Post' journalists plea to Bezos: Don't gut our newsroom","text":"When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post in 2013, the staff hailed him for rescuing it from mounting financial struggles. For years, the storied newspaper flourished as he invested in its journalism and business innovations.\n\nMore recently, the paper has lost tens of millions of dollars annually. And now Post reporters — by the scores — are writing letters and social media posts, appealing to Bezos not to eliminate their jobs.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed and find it contrary to what [Bezos] said at the time,\" former Post Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. tells NPR. \"There's been no announcement about this, no rationale about this. No vision for what the paper ought to be. I'm disturbed and surprised by that.\"\n\nWhile the Post has not made any public announcement, the letters speak to the bleak belief that layoffs are imminent.\n\n\"We are The Washington Post's international correspondents, writing with a collective plea for you to preserve our newspaper's global coverage, which we fear will be greatly weakened in coming cuts,\" one such appeal read. \"Our coverage — thanks to your investment — shapes conversation and global policy at the highest levels each day.\"\n\nAt full force, the current newsroom stands at just shy of 800 journalists. Union members say they have been warned the newsroom could lose anywhere from 100 to 300 people, though that higher figure could also include employees who work outside the newsroom.\n\nWarned about assignments, encouraged to job hunt\n\nThis story is based on interviews with 10 current and former Post staffers drawn from both the newsroom and the business side of the paper. The Post declined detailed requests to comment.\n\nThe silence about the paper's future from Bezos and Chief Executive and Publisher Will Lewis has further damaged trust, Post editors, reporters and business-side staffers said. They spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of putting their jobs in jeopardy.\n\nThe fact the letters are directed to Bezos reflects the journalists' lack of faith in Lewis, according to six Post staffers. \n\nThey note that Bezos has not weighed in publicly to support Post reporter Hannah Natanson after her computers and other devices were seized by FBI agents over an investigation of a leak of national security documents. Even so, Lewis and Executive Editor Matt Murray have strongly supported her and the paper's attorneys are fighting in court to get the the Justice Department to return her materials. \n\nEditors are still asking reporters to break news and meet their deadlines, as they have done throughout the paper's 148-year history, which includes leading roles in covering the Pentagon Papers, the Watergate scandal, the Clinton impeachment, and the Trump years.\n\nYet they are also now offering some unusual guidance.\n\nOn the international desk, some editors have told correspondents not to accept some assignments that would take them to dangerous spots abroad after Sunday, according to three Post journalists with direct knowledge of events. The fear is that the reporters might be laid off while in personal peril.\n\nAdditionally, some editors on the foreign, metro and sports desks have quietly suggested to the journalists who work for them that they should seriously consider any outside job offers they receive.\n\nSports reporters were recently told to cancel plans to go to Italy to cover the Winter Olympics next week, even though the paper had put down a significant deposit to reserve work facilities and hotel rooms. Executive Editor Matt Murray relented and is sending a scaled-back team of four journalists, a spokesperson confirmed Thursday. \n\nCalls for Bezos to sell the Post\n\nThe paper went through buyouts in the newsroom in fall 2023 as part of company-wide job reductions. The business side experienced layoffs a year ago.\n\nThe Post Guild, which represents hundreds of newsroom employees, wrote in a public statement that it vehemently opposes any additional cuts.\n\nA new round of cutbacks \"only stands to weaken the newspaper, drive away readers and undercut the Post's mission: to hold power to account without fear or favor and provide critical insight into communities across the region, country, and world,\" the Guild wrote. \"If Jeff Bezos no longer supports that mission, then the Post and its readers deserve a steward who does.\"\n\nIn the years right after acquiring the paper, Bezos — the billionaire founder of Amazon — had embraced the Post's reportorial zeal. In 2017 the paper adopted the \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" motto suggested by the paper's legendary Watergate reporter Bob Woodward.\n\nHe backed then-Executive Editor Marty Baron as a partner during the Post's aggressive coverage of President Trump's first term, despite increasing pressure from the administration and Trump himself.\n\nIn a lawsuit, Amazon alleged the Trump administration found a way to hit Bezos on the bottom line: the Pentagon awarded Microsoft a $10 billion cloud computing contract for which Amazon had been widely perceived as the leading bidder. The decision followed Trump's public criticism of Bezos. Court rulings led the Pentagon to settle Amazon's suit by splitting up the contract among four companies, including Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nTo this day, Bezos has never interfered in newsroom decisions, according to interviews with two dozen senior Post journalists over the years. But he has been silent on its future and fate for an extended period.\n\nBezos has a lot to keep him occupied. Besides his stake in Amazon, he owns several companies — including Blue Origin and the AI startup Project Prometheus — and he remarried last summer in a lavish, multi-day affair in Venice. Post journalists have questioned Bezos' commitment to the paper, particularly after he concluded Trump was likely to return to office well before the 2024 elections.\n\nSubscriptions are up, but the paper is losing tens of millions\n\nIn late 2023, Bezos named Lewis, who had edited the Telegraph in Britain and led Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal as chief executive, to lead the paper as CEO.\n\nLewis appealed not just because of his successful push for digital experimentation at the Journal, the British Telegraph and his own start-up, but because he had been a senior aide to two idiosyncratic conservatives: Murdoch and Boris Johnson when Johnson was prime minister. As NPR has previously reported, Bezos believed Lewis would be able to help the paper navigate Trump's return to office.\n\nLewis last held a town hall with staffers in June 2024, when he told them the paper had lost $100 million in 2022 and $77 million in 2023. Several people with knowledge of the company's finances say the losses spiked again last year. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they have not been authorized to speak about internal corporate matters. \n\nLewis has not met with the newsroom since that 2024 town hall, which coincided with intense scrutiny from NPR, the New York Times and the Post about questionable episodes in his journalistic past in the U.K. and his efforts to block coverage of it.\n\nWith much fanfare, Lewis has introduced several initiatives involving artificial intelligence. He has launched WP Ventures, promoting non-traditional journalism, and a free service compiling opinion pieces from other outlets to draw in new readers. Last year, the paper sold 675,000 subscriptions, its highest sales volume in five years, as first reported by the media newsletter Status.\n\nSo far, these measures have not adequately stemmed the red ink.\n\nA warm relationship with Trump\n\nIn late October 2024, Bezos killed a planned editorial endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for the White House. He argued that making presidential endorsements eroded trust with the broader public and said he was not doing so to advance his investments. \n\n\"While I do not and will not push my personal interest, I will also not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance — overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs — not without a fight,\" Bezos wrote at the time. \"The stakes are too high... To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles. Some changes will be a return to the past, and some will be new inventions. Criticism will be part and parcel of anything new, of course. This is the way of the world.\"\n\nBezos later announced a new libertarian emphasis for the editorial page, which had been a center-left voice opposing many of Trump's assaults on democratic institutions. Bezos instead urged a focus on \"personal liberties and free markets.\"\n\nMore than 375,000 digital subscribers canceled over the twin changes, as NPR reported. The editorial page editor resigned and numerous columnists and reporters departed for other publications. Despite those defections, the Post has not let up on its vigorous coverage, including on the Ukraine-Russia war, the U.S. seizure of Venezuela's president, and the Trump administration.\n\nBezos has, meanwhile, struck up a working and warm relationship with the president.\n\nHe and his wife have dined with the Trumps at Mar-a-Lago; Amazon contributed $1 million to Trump's inauguration last January and Bezos sat on the dais during the ceremony. The Amazon Prime streaming service paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported she is to receive the lion's share of that fee.\n\nAnd under the leadership of its new editor, Adam O'Neal, Bezos's editorial page has failed several times to cite his direct financial interests in the matters it opines about.\n\nUpon acquiring the Post, Bezos told its then-media reporter Paul Farhi that the paper was an important institution worth preserving for the nation.\n\n\"I don't want to imply that I have a worked-out plan,\" Bezos said. \"This will be uncharted terrain, and it will require experimentation.\"\n\n\"There would be change with or without new ownership,\" he said in the August 2013 interview. \"But the key thing I hope people will take away from this is that the values of The Post do not need changing. The duty of the paper is to the readers, not the owners.\"\n\nAmazon is a financial supporter of NPR and pays to deliver some of its content.","summary":"Members of the newspaper's union say they have been warned the company could cut as many as 300 jobs, although no announcement has been made.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/30/nx-s1-5692923/washington-post-bezos-layoffs","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x5504+0+0/resize/8256x5504!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F05%2F46d307854f77aded50ad6abbb591%2Fgettyimages-2221816293.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 17:00:00","author":"David Folkenflik","authors":["David Folkenflik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197}]}
