Ohio Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown — the man at the center of the United State’s most important (and most expensive) election outside the presidency this year — was cornered by Fox News and asked about Harris’ decision to remove her support from nationwide fracking bans in an unusually awkward moment for the battle-tested legislator. “My focus is on my state and my work,” a flustered Brown mumbled on his way toward an elevator. “I’ve endorsed Vice President Harris … I don’t know what she said on fracking.” Brown is known to be close with President Joe Biden, whose current semi-retirement has made the senator’s tight re-election chances even tighter. “Sherrod Brown is in lockstep with San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris on all of her radical policies, including a complete ban on fracking,” Brown’s opponent, Republican business owner Bernie Moreno, told The Post. “Brown and Harris would rather rely on our adversaries for energy instead of using our resources here at home. In November, Ohioans will reject their radical, anti-energy agenda,” he added. Brown, who has voted several times in favor of fracking bans, must now either reverse his own course to join Harris and help her pursue voters in emerging energy states like Pennsylvania and Ohio who rely on fracking, or hold fast to his well-documented beliefs. “The point is they’ve both supported fracking bans – Harris can try and flip flop now, but her stance is well documented,” a spokesperson for Moreno added. “We know they both want to ban it. But Bernie will always support Fracking.” Moreno is not the only prominent Republican to smell blood in the water right now either. “Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking and buy energy from every dictator around the world. Donald Trump wants to drill baby drill,” another Ohio senator, and Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance said today at a rally in Arizona. “Do we want to ban fracking,” he bellowed to the crowd who shouted back an enthusiastic, “NO!” It’s been a tough week for Republicans in the polls as the nation adjusts to a tumultuous two weeks of impactful shakeups. Harris has closed most of her significant gaps in the swing states and is looking to draw more white men into her camp — a demographic she may need desperately to win in November. By backpedaling on her 2020 promise to ban fracking nationwide, Harris is looking to keep her popularity scores going up, even if it costs her some credibility. And the GOP seems perfectly happy to help her get that message out.","summary":"As the presumptive Democrat nominee for president, Vice President Kamala Harris, attempts a tricky back peddle on her fracking policies, Republicans are attacking her and any other liberal they can find over the flipflop.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/us-news/kamala-harris-fracking-flip-flop-is-affecting-races-for-other-democrats/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/86812052.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fznmkRGx-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-03 00:15:11","author":"Joe Durbin","authors":["Joe Durbin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":253269202,"title":"Kamala Harris secures delegate votes needed to become Democratic nominee","text":"Kamala Harris has secured the delegate votes needed to clinch the Democratic US presidential nomination and become the first woman of colour at the top of a major party ticket. Ms Harris, the US vice-president, became the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden bowed to pressure from within the party and dropped out of the race last month. Ms Harris quickly won the support of party heavyweights and was the only candidate to qualify for the Democratic presidential ballot, which ensured the outcome of the delegate voting was never in doubt. Party delegates voted virtually this week. The online voting process doesn't end until Monday, but Ms Harris' campaign marked the moment when she crossed the threshold to have the majority of delegates' votes. Ms Harris, who joined the live stream event where the announcement was made, said she would officially accept the nomination next week after the virtual voting period had closed. \"But already I'm happy to know that we have enough delegates to secure the nomination,\" said Ms Harris, the first Black and Asian person to become US vice-president. Ms Harris needed to pass a 2,350-vote threshold from delegates to formally secure the nomination, her campaign said. Democratic National Committee (DNC) leaders had pledged to deliver a presidential nominee by August 7, before the August 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The DNC had said a virtual vote was needed to ensure the nomination process was completed by August 7, the date by which Ohio law required a nominee in place to make the state's ballot. Ohio lawmakers subsequently pushed back the deadline to September 1, but party officials said they nevertheless wanted to meet the August 7 deadline to avoid any legal risk in the state. The announcement came after the campaign said earlier that it raised $US310 million ($476 million) last month, an eye-popping sum showing that donors who once seemed spooked about the prospects for November's election with Mr Biden are now offering mountains of cash to boost his former No 2.

Yes, we all have reason to celebrate, and the rush we all felt when we learned of their liberation must resound and echo for a long time. It is up to us – each and all – to see to it. We owe them more than we know. From Freedom To Imprisonment Evan, Alsu, and Paul were going about their lives, when one day, the Russian Bear pounced. That day, they woke up a reporter, an editor, and a Marine veteran, but went to sleep prisoners. The gratitude we feel for what they do is a given under normal circumstances. Now, though, after their long and wrongful ordeals, when we thank Paul for his service, it must become a deeper expression, not casually spoken, and when we utter the names of Evan and Alsu, we must also reject those who call them fake news or – worse – the enemy of the people. Further, two commitments: 1. We must see that every Veteran and their families must be cared for with the same zeal with which they fought to protect us – for their entire lives. And let Paul Whelan be the face of that ideal. 2. Our obligation to our journalists is equal in magnitude but it takes a different stance. As a freelance journalist myself – for 21 years and counting – here are my thoughts. Journalism is sacred and it carries with it an enormous responsibility. Over these 21 years, my already huge appreciation for journalists – especially reporters – has only grown. I couldn’t on my best day do what they do every day: cover the world in a timely, objective, thoughtful manner. They play a grossly underappreciated role in our lives, and we know about our world because of what they do.

It’s not, I assure you, why Evan and Alsu answered the call to journalism. So what we owe them is a more appreciative and critical consumption of what they offer.

Stewart kicked off the discussion by marveling at the electric atmosphere of Harris’ recent rally in Atlanta, Georgia, where rapper Megan Thee Stallion performed, and Harris directly challenged GOP nominee Donald Trump to a debate. She said, \"So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it — you may have noticed. He won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me. Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage. Because as the saying goes, 'if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.'” As per HuffPost, Stewart exclaimed, \"Holy shit!...It’s the one thing I think that would, more than any policy or any discrepancy on economics or anything else, the thing that would bother Donald Trump the most is a giant arena filled with enthusiastic supporters having a party. I almost think he’d be like, ‘What? Popularity is my thing,’...doesn’t even give a shit about the election anymore, he just wants to be like, ‘My crowd was bigger.’” This isn’t the first time Stewart has taken aim at Trump. Recently, he offered advice to Republicans lamenting Kamala Harris’s ascendancy to the top of the Democratic ticket following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he was stepping down from the 2024 race. Republicans, including Trump's running mate JD Vance, have cried foul, claiming a \"coup\" within the Democratic Party. Stewart mocked, “But I get it. If I thought I had this thing in the bag, you were gonna be going up against old Joe Biden, then they pull this, I’d be like, ‘Ref, ref open your eyes. How can you not see they’re coup-ing! They’re coup-ing!’...But you know what? I do understand that they’re upset. It makes sense. So how about we do this out of fairness, I’m a fair person – you can replace your old guy, too.” As per The Independent, Stewart pointed out that Trump has responded to Harris’ presidential run in his classic manner. On the day Biden bowed out, Trump took to Truth Social and exclaimed, “So, we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race. Now we have to start all over again, Shouldn’t the Republican Party be reimbursed for fraud in that everybody around Joe, including his doctors and the Fake News Media, knew he was not capable of running for, or being, President? Just askin’?” Stewart found humor in Trump's reaction, noting his frustration and suggesting that the former president would need to recalibrate his attacks. “Well, what’s done is done. You’re gonna have to shift gears, recalibrate, you’ve had crooked Joe and sleepy Joe on speed dial. You’re gonna need a new line of attack.”","summary":"Stewart quipped, “...they’re upset.

Her interview list: Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people were granted anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. Shapiro and Kelly had been viewed as among the front-runners during her truncated selection process, which began with the vetting of about a dozen names. Some have publicly withdrawn from consideration, such as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is close with Harris from their shared time as state attorneys general but expressed concern about regularly traveling out of the state if he were to be on the national Democratic ticket. Her deadline for picking a running mate is effectively Tuesday, when Harris will launch a tour of seven key battleground states, starting in Philadelphia. President Joe Biden told reporters Friday he has spoken to Harris about her search for a vice presidential candidate, but when asked whether he had advice for the qualities she should look for in a running mate, the president publicly demurred. “I’ll let her work that out,” Biden said on the South Lawn of the White House before departing for Wilmington, Delaware, for the weekend. Some of the people on Harris’ short list had abruptly canceled plans for this weekend, signaling that something could be afoot in the selection process. For example, Shapiro scrapped three weekend fundraisers in the seaside communities on the coast of Long Island, New York, and his press secretary, Manuel Bonder, offered little explanation. “The governor’s trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee,” Bonder said in a statement. “His schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.” One Shapiro fundraiser was to be hosted by Michael Kempner, a member of President Joe Biden ‘s national finance committee. Kempner said in a note to invitees that the gathering had been postponed and openly advocated for Shapiro to be Harris’ No. 2, writing that “many are speculating that this is a sign he will be the vice president.” Meanwhile, a video put on social media by Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker — who publicly supports Shapiro for vice president -- caused a stir Friday. It showed a number of Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris for president, but also touting Shapiro for vice president, suggesting to some that Parker may have inside knowledge of Harris’ decision. However, a person with knowledge of the mayor’s thinking said the video was simply the mayor showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker’s friend, will be her vice presidential running mate. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Such wells are a serious health hazard in our communities, especially socioeconomically disadvantaged ones. This bill will work to protect our citizens from this danger. Those living in close proximity to oil and gas wells have an increased risk of developing asthma, heart disease, birth defects and cancer. Unfortunately, the oil companies responsible for the ethical management of these wells are doing everything they can to avoid the costs associated with the plugging process, and current law isn’t strong enough to make them.

Wendy Bernstein Berkeley Derision is no way to draw youth vote Re: “Harris administration would offer hard lesson” (July 30). Bill Behan’s letter denigrating younger voters exemplifies perfectly why so many of them are delighted by the prospects of a candidate like Kamala Harris. Data has shown that the millennial and Gen Z generations are the first generations who feel worse off than their parents. Prices and income requirements to achieve a first home are beyond even the median U.S. wage. As such, younger workers have to work two to three jobs just to survive. Yet when it came to the old guard in politics, these worsening conditions for our upcoming generations were largely ignored. Now, being presented with an option that listens to their concerns, why shouldn’t they be excited? If the only response to that is to belittle the candidate, complain about wanting free stuff (while ignoring Trump’s promises of unfunded tax cuts), and threaten a draft, is it really any mystery why young voters are so put off? Christopher Dooner Sunnyvale Inaction on Jan. 6 disqualifies Trump Donald Trump is morally disqualified from being president of the United States. His inaction following the breach of the U.S. Capitol by some of his supporters disqualifies him. The investigation by the Jan. 6 committee shed some light on Trump’s behavior, but neither Trump nor any of his spokespeople have provided an affirmative accounting of his actions during that period of time. In Trump’s Jan. 6 speech at the Ellipse, he directed the crowd to go to the U.S. Capitol and protest “peacefully.” As soon as he was aware that the Capitol security perimeter was breached he should have used the vast reach of his social media presence to immediately direct his followers to cease their actions and withdraw from the premises. This failure to act was a failure of leadership and moral authority. It is up to the voters of this country to hold him to account.

On Thursday, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif faced off against Italian boxer Angela Carini, winning in 46 seconds after Carini abruptly pulled out of the fight. Following the match, Carini burst into tears and declined to shake Khelif’s hand, telling reporters that she withdrew due to the intensity of her opponent’s initial punches. “I put an end to the match because after the second blow,” Carini said, “I felt a strong pain in my nose.” That reaction has since spawned scrutiny of Khelif, who was assigned female at birth and identifies as a woman. False claims that she is a trans person or that she is a man pretending to be a woman quickly spread thanks to reports she was disqualified from a 2023 International Boxing Association event and the resurfacing of comments by the president of that organization suggesting that her elimination was because she failed a hormone test. The inaccurate statements about her identity were boosted by prominent anti-trans individuals like Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, as well as politicians like US Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance and conservative Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Their statements stirred up a storm of anger on the right despite the fact that Khelif is a cisgender woman. As Vox’s Alex Abad-Santos has explained, there aren’t any transgender athletes at the Olympics this year who are competing outside of the sex they were assigned at birth, though IOC rules don’t bar their inclusion so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria. “There has been some confusion that somehow it’s a man fighting a woman,” International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams told reporters. “The question you have to ask yourself is, are these athletes women? The answer is yes.” The 2024 Olympic boxing match between Imane Khelif and Angela Carini, explained During their match this week, Carini and Khelif competed against one another in their respective first fights of this Olympics. Olympic boxing contests group competitors by weight class and operate in a knockout fashion, meaning the winner of a match moves forward while the loser is eliminated. Both had also previously competed in Tokyo, with Carini getting eliminated in her first bout during those Olympics, and Khelif getting eliminated in her second bout. The two fighters started the round trading blows; after Carini paused the match to adjust her headgear, Khelif went on the offensive, landing a solid punch to her opponent’s face. Rather than continue, Carini, pulling at her nose, relinquished the competition completely. That’s atypical for a boxing match, which often includes three rounds of combat. As the referee prepared to call the match, Carini told her team, “It’s not fair.” Carini could then be seen dropping to her knees and refusing any attempts at a handshake or other customary gestures of sportsmanship from Khelif. The match may have passed unnoticed except for the controversy that erupted after it, which was fueled by events that occurred more than a year before it even began. In 2023, Kehlif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting hoped to compete in the boxing world championships held by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in New Delhi, India. Kehlif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA, and press reports suggested that it was because they failed a test of some sort and had elevated testosterone levels. The IBA’s president reportedly told a Russia outlet at the time that both Khelif and Lin had “XY chromosomes” — a chromosomal composition most commonly seen in those assigned male at birth. Exactly what led to this statement is unclear. The IBA did not disclose documentation at the time or reveal what tests were conducted. Questions were also raised because the organization, which was led by Russian official Umar Kremlev, did not disqualify Khelif until after she had already beaten a Russian boxer. In recent days, the IBA released a statement claiming that in 2023, Khelif and Lin “did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.” The statement also said the test “conclusively indicated that both athletes … have competitive advantages over other female competitors.” Both Khelif and Lin had also competed in the 2022 world championships, also administered by the IBA the year before. The IBA’s 2023 decision was heavily criticized by the IOC, which deemed it “arbitrary” and not transparent. Both athletes competed without issue in the Olympics in 2021. At the time, neither medaled, and both lost to multiple female opponents. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the IOC has declared the IBA an unreliable steward of global boxing: Officials banished the group from regulating the sport at the Olympic level due to concerns over its financial dealings, leadership, and allegations of match-fixing. The lack of clarity about what happened in 2023 has helped mis- and disinformation about Khelif to fester. The IOC, however, has been clear that Khelif and Lin qualify to compete based on its rules. Those do not include sex testing, which the IOC abandoned in 2000 and which has long been scrutinized for operating off questionable and flawed science. The committee does still disqualify some athletes who have Differences of Sexual Development (DSD), “a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs,” per Reuters. When it comes to DSDs, IOC rules governing eligibility use factors like safety and fairness to determine who can compete. Beyond questions of sex, there are racial dynamics at play in the perceptions of this match. Female athletes of color — particularly those of African and African American descent — have long been accused of being men when they’ve beaten white women in competition. This happened most notably with tennis phenom Serena Williams and track star Caster Semenya, both of whom endured tropes that cast Black women as more masculine and threatening. Following the attention on this week’s match, Carini has said she’d like to apologize to Khelif: “If the I.O.C. said she can fight, I respect that decision.” Other boxers have expressed they aren’t concerned about competing against Khelif. “I don’t care about the press story and social media,” said Anna Luca Hamori, a boxer from Hungary who will compete against Khelif next. Lin’s first match proceeded as planned — like Khelif, she won. The attention is being used to advance conservatives’ agenda The facts of Khelif’s Olympic journey have not gotten in the way of the false narrative that exploded in the wake of her win. Her victory proved to be an opportunity for those with transphobic views to score rhetorical and political points. Rowling and other prominent anti-trans figures like Tesla CEO Elon Musk were quick to spread lies and cite the boxing match as an example of why they believe it is important to back stark gender binaries. “We object because we saw a male punching a female,” Rowling wrote in a post on X. US conservatives who misattributed and questioned Khelif’s gender identity also used the fight to weaponize the anti-trans rhetoric they’ve utilized in the past to activate their voter base. Vance was quick to wrongly link Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to the international boxing match in a nonsensical post, writing on X, “This is where Kamala Harris’s ideas about gender lead: to a grown man pummeling a woman in a boxing match.” Former President Donald Trump similarly wrote on Truth Social that he would “keep men out of women’s sports.” As Vox’s Nicole Narea and Fabiola Cineas have explained, this sort of rhetoric on the part of GOP leaders is tied to an explosion of anti-trans legislation in states across the country focused on bathroom access, women’s sports, and gender-affirming care for minors. Collectively, these bills have sought to frame trans people as a threat and to stoke fear among GOP voters. Women’s sports is an arena where the GOP has leaned into this messaging because they see it as activating religious Republicans, including Evangelical voters, and potentially resonating with more moderate women, too. “Trans issues in particular challenge … biblical concepts of gender,” Sophie Bjork-James, a Vanderbilt University anthropologist who studies the religious right, previously told Vox. “Evangelicals tend to believe that men and women have very different qualities that are innate in us. I think there’s a huge interest in maintaining a gender binary because it really does provide a foundation for their theology and their everyday lives.” Republican state legislatures including those in Tennessee and Texas have successfully passed bills that limit athletes to participating in sports for the sex they were assigned at birth. The attacks on Khelif are just the latest manifestation of such ideas.","summary":"An Olympic women’s boxing match — and misinformation about one of the athletes involved — is now being used by conservatives to promote their anti-trans agenda.&#160; On Thursday, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif faced off against Italian boxer Angela Carini, winning in 46 seconds after Carini abruptly pulled out of the fight.

Tammy Baldwin winning third term over soft-on-immigration record","text":"WATERTOWN, Wis. — The border crisis has emerged as a top concern for voters in Wisconsin — as the critical battleground state gears up for one of the most competitive US Senate races on top of a historic presidential election in November. Democrat incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin is likely to face off against multimillionaire Republican challenger Eric Hovde when voters head to the polls later this year. Baldwin, who is a fierce Kamala Harris ally, is now coming under scrutiny over her soft-on-immigration record, especially as Harris has emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee. Voters fear that a Balwin and Harris win could leave the besieged southern border wide open. “I don’t think the border is a border state issue anymore,” Kyle Schroeder, Chairman of the Wisconsin Young Republicans, told The Post, insisting that immigration is one of the top three issues for younger conservative voters aged 18-40 in Wisconsin. “Ultimately their voting records [on immigration] have been an absolute disaster,” the 28-year-old added of the prospect of a Harris presidency and Badlwin third term. “They voted to allow previously deported felons to return without penalty. They’re two peas in the pod at the end day.” Baldwin — who refused to appear with President Biden at a rally after his rocky debate performance then enthusiastically endorsed Harris within hours of Biden stepping down — shares a similar record as the Democratic presidential nominee, who was once coined the Biden administration’s “border czar.” Both Baldwin and Harris voted against Kate’s Law, a bill that would mandate five-year prison sentences for illegal immigrants with felonies apprehended in the United States. It was named after Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old woman who was killed in San Francisco in 2015 by an illegal migrant from Mexico who had seven felony convictions at the time of his arrest and had been deported from the US to Mexico six times. Baldwin voted against cloture on Kate’s Law in 2016, effectively helping to kill the bill. Harris also helped kill the bill when it came back up in 2017 in the Senate. Those votes are both taking center stage again after Sen. JD Vance — now former President Donald Trump’s running mate — reintroduced the bill in February of this year following the violent murder of Laken Riley allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who had been previously deported. Baldwin and Harris also voted against an immigration amendment to the Broader Options for Americans Act, which would have mandated the detention of an illegal migrant convicted of any DUI, even as a first offense. Had that amendment been approved, it could have meant the detention and eventual deportation of Victor Manual Gomez-Acosta, a Mexican man who was living in the US illegally, before he allegedly stabbed his wife and daughters to death earlier this year. “Kamala Harris’ open border policy has thrown once-stable cities into discord as they grapple with the influx of new residents,” Badger State small business owner Cori Houston told The Post. “Tammy Baldwin’s illegal immigration record is no better. The ongoing challenges facing these communities only suggest that their election will worsen conditions for regular American citizens,” Houston added. Houston also expressed concern about Harris’ record on immigration as a prosecutor in California. “A glance at San Francisco reveals her indifference to the issues of immigration and homelessness in her own community — why would she care about ours?” she asked. As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris supported the city’s decades-old sanctuary city policy and refused to seek the death penalty in the gruesome killing of a father, Tony Bologna, and his two sons, Michael and Matthew, by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador — despite calls from the mother and widow. In 2018, Baldwin and Harris voted against cloture on Senate Amendment 1948 — an amendment that would have made sanctuary cities ineligible for certain federal law enforcement grants. “Sen. Baldwin and VP Harris opened our borders and let criminals, terrorists and deadly drugs enter the US without any consequences,” Hovde, Baldwin’s likely rival in the 2024 Wisconsin Senate race, told The Post. “As more and more illegal immigrants commit shocking violent crimes on a seemingly daily basis, Sen. Baldwin and VP Harris are dangerously wrong for Wisconsin.” However, Baldwin’s team defended her record by pointing to her vote in February for a bipartisan border security compromise intended to cut back border crossings. “Earlier this year [Baldwin] voted for the bipartisan border deal that would have added hundreds of Border Patrol agents, shut down the border to illegal crossings, and helped stop fentanyl and other illegal drugs from coming into our country,” Baldwin’s spokesperson, Andrew Mamo, said. “While that bill was supported by Republicans, Democrats, and the US Border Patrol, her opponent Eric Hovde said he would have voted against the bill because he is more interested in playing politics with this issue than addressing the problem.” The bill, which was tied to funding for Ukraine, ultimately failed to pass. A Fox News poll, released July 26, shows Baldwin leading Hovde 54% to 43% among registered Wisconsin voters. The same poll shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck in the Badger State. Baldwin, meanwhile, appeared alongside Harris as a show of support at her first campaign rally as presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in Milwaukee on July 23. “I had the privilege of serving with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate,” Harris told the crowd at the rally. “And she is always fighting for the people of this state. And I know that the folks that are here are going to make sure you return her to Washington, DC, in November.”","summary":"The border crisis has emerged as a top concern for voters in Wisconsin -- as the critical battleground state gears up for one of the most competitive US Senate races on top of a historic presidential election in November.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/us-news/wisconsin-voters-fear-kamala-harris-win-sen-tammy-baldwin-winning-third-term-over-soft-on-immigration-record/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-ug26fnr8v-1722639600428.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722625251&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fznmkRGx-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:18:03","author":"Amy Sikma","authors":["Amy Sikma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":253268600,"title":"Speculation Josh Shapiro is Kamala Harris’s veep pick reaches fever pitch with video from Philadelphia mayor","text":"A video from Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker supporting Gov.

The video endorses Shapiro as her pick for various reasons, including his pro-labor and “progressive” policies, and only suggests he is Harris’s running mate towards the end of the video. Some online speculated this was a leak that was supposed to be published only after he was announced on Monday, but the video could just be arguing Harris should choose Shapiro, not that she already has. Further, neither Harris nor the Democratic National Committee paid for it. As of writing, the video has been up for several hours and is pinned to the top of Parker’s X page. “Proud to be back with so many leaders from across our region supporting @KamalaHarrisfor President and @JoshShapiroPA for VP! We are One CITY, One REGION, and ONE Commonwealth United!” she captioned the video. The video features footage from a rally of several labor leaders advocating Shapiro to be Harris’s running mate.

Two years ago, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris touted their “Chips Act” to bring the semiconductor industry back home from Taiwan, China and Singapore. The price tag on the bill: a cool $280 billion of corporate handouts. It was arguably the largest corporate welfare bill in American history. Intel, Micron, Global Foundries, Polar Semiconductor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung, BAE Systems, and Microchip Technology have been the direct beneficiaries of the law. This was supposed to be one of the “Crown Jewels” of the Biden-Harris admin. A massive job creator that would allow America to take back its technologicalleadership. Even many Republicans in Congress shamelessly voted for the handouts at a time when the federal government was already borrowing more than $1 trillion a year. Heavy failures But today, the failures far outweigh the successes — and in spectacular fashion. Intel was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Chips Act, receiving an $8.5 billion grant announced in March, a $25 billion sweetheart tax incentive and likely the lion’s share of an $11 billion federal loan program. That’s only the opening act. What did we get in exchange? Intel this week announced it was laying off 15% of its workforce — 15,000positions. America lost twice: billions of dollars and thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, Nvidia, which took no government money, has been the top-performing stock over the past 18 months and has made hundreds of billions of dollars for American shareholders. Its chips are mostly made in Taiwan, but it creates thousands of jobs here at home. This Chips Act was supposed to be the Biden-Harris crowning achievement. A giant job creator. Hundreds of billions of government handouts to bring the semiconductor industry back home. Now, it’s looking like the Titanic. Maybe these layoffs make business sense and will help Intel become the powerhouse it once was. But the company’s new government-dependent status means all of its decision-making is being directed by Washington — not the marketplace. Their strategy has been to maximize taxpayers’ dollars — not creating value for their customers. How many times can we learn the same lesson? Government is terrible at picking winners and losers. Remember Solyndra and Fisker Auto? Corporate welfare woes Politicians gamble — with your money — and go broke again and again. Corporate welfare almost never works. We’ve tried it with steel, autos, solar panels and electricbatteries. Just look at how this policy has hobbled the electric-vehicle industry. Biden has handed out tens of billions in handouts, mandates and other Hershey kisses to an industry that was well on its way to success when Donald Trump left office. Now the car companies are losing billions of dollars even as they chase down all this “free” money. EV sales would be much higher today if politicians had simply kept their paws off of it. Or consider that the Biden administration passed its Green New Deal —dishonestly called the “Inflation Reduction Act” — with hundreds of billions for solar and wind companies. Today, the industry is still flat on its back — providing less than 10% of American energy. Meanwhile the nonsubsidized oil and gas and coal industries still supply 80% of our energy. The oil and gas industry actually pays taxes rather than just taking government money. Poor policy The theory of national industrial policy is based on the idea that some sectors are of such paramount importance that they can’t be left to the private sector. That may make sense when it come to defense industries. But as we’ve seen with electric vehicles and green energy in recent years, trusting the government to take charge is about the worst way for any business to succeed. Ironically, the Biden-Harris administration wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% on our successful corporations — the ones that actually make a profit and don’t need government subsidies — and use that money to prop up the loser industries. It’s no way to run a country. It is the way socialist regimes have all gone broke. The two of us have suggested that America should pass a law preventing the government from giving any company a subsidy if it has more than $100 million in sales. Use the savings to cut tax rates for everyone. The failure of the Chips Act is a reminder of the maxim that the best government policy for the economy is: don’t meddle. In the meantime, Congress should suspend the $100 billion that the semiconductor industry hasn’t already spent and wasted. Never throw good money after bad.

Just a day after online voting kicked off, Harris, the only party candidate, received more than a majority of votes from delegates to become the nation's first woman-of-color presidential nominee as she has been cranking up a powerful campaign in a tight race against former President and Republican flag-bearer Donald Trump. Harris launched her campaign after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month amid dogged questions over his old age following a woeful debate performance in June. Her campaign has since created much enthusiasm among once-demoralized Democrats, seen a substantial fundraising haul and reshaped a race viewed as more favorable to Trump. \"I am so proud to confirm that Vice President Harris has earned more than a majority of votes from all convention delegates and will be the nominee of Democratic Party following the close of voting on Monday,\" Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement. Before the online vote started, the DNC said that 3,923 delegates -- or 99 percent of the participants -- had petitioned to put Harris on the nomination ballot. She ran unopposed in the intraparty battle as no Democrat met the threshold of obtaining at least 300 delegate signatures by Tuesday to be on the ballot. A candidate is required to secure 1,976 delegate votes to clinch the Democratic nomination. Should Harris beat Trump in the November election, she would become America's first woman president. After passing the delegate threshold, Harris said she was \"honored\" to be at the top of the ticket. \"I am honored to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. I will officially accept the nomination next week,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are.\" The virtual roll call vote is set to conclude on Monday. It was arranged ahead of the Democratic National Convention set for Aug. 19-22, because of Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for parties to submit the names of their candidates. South Korean policymakers have been closely watching the US election race as policy changes could take place depending on who occupies the White House. If elected, Harris is expected to continue key tenets of the Biden administration's foreign policy, including strengthening a network of alliances and partnerships to confront shared regional and global challenges, though she could put her own style in policy formulation and implementation processes. As Harris's campaign has gobbled up media attention, Trump's campaign has sharpened attacks on Harris in a neck-and-neck race that has drawn a sharp contrast between the two starkly different candidates in light of age, race, ethnicity and gender. Harris, currently 59, was born to a family of Jamaican- and Indian-born parents. During a major gathering of Black journalists earlier this week, Trump made remarks about Harris' racial identity, saying, \"Is she Indian? or is she black?.\" Harris dismissed them as \"the same old show\" of \"divisiveness\" and \"disrespect.\" The contest between Harris and Trump has given rise to the \"prosecutor vs. the felon\" narrative in reference to Harris' former service as the attorney general of California and Trump's conviction in a high-profile hush-money trial. As the competition is heating up, Harris is expected to walk a fine line to highlight the Biden administration's major achievements, such as reducing certain prescription drug costs and bolstering America's alliance networks, while guarding against attacks on the administration's perceived shortfalls. She also faces the question of how to keep maintaining forward momentum beyond what many have called a \"honeymoon phase\" following the launch of her campaign, and how to cement and broaden her appeal, particularly in the battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- that would largely determine the outcome of the general election. Harris is expected to announce her pick for vice president next week before she begins her swing through seven battleground states, which includes a stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Among those mentioned for the post are Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Harris was sworn in as vice president in January 2021, making history as the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to be in that post. She was inaugurated as a senator of California in 2017 and previously served as the attorney general of California and district attorney of San Francisco.","summary":"WASHINGTON --US Vice President Kamala Harris has officially earned the necessary number of delegate votes in a virtual voting process to become the Democratic Party&#039;s standard-bearer for the Nov. 5 presidential election, the party&#039;s national committee chief said Friday.

Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, told CNN that the former president's statements were \"totally reasonable,\" saying, \"Look, all he said is that Kamala Harris is a chameleon.\" Conservative media personality Candace Owens defended Trump's statements as \"objectively funny.\"According to Michael Tesler, political science professor at the University of California Irvine, Trump's focus on Harris' race is likely an attempt to \"appeal to the large share of African American voters who hadn't seen Harris as sufficiently supportive of Black interests during the first three years of her vice presidency.\"\"But the way he went about doing it was so inept that it will almost certainly backfire with all audiences,\" Tesler told Newsweek via email.\"Trump's racist attacks on Harris will likely rally [Black voters] to her,\" he added. \"And most white Americans do not want to be seen as racist, so trafficking in explicitly racist appeals is not an effective strategy.\"Tesler pointed to an article he co-authored on July 9, which cited polling data by the Associated Press that found registered Black voters rated President Joe Biden six points more positively than Harris during the 2022 midterm elections.As the 2024 election cycle has progressed, that gap in Black support has seemingly closed. A YouGov/Economist poll released July 29 found that Harris had a 7-point lead in favorability rating among Black Americans than Biden (77.3 percent to 70.3 percent).But polling earlier in the year had shown Trump making gains among Black voters, meaning that his campaign's focus on Harris' race this week could risk the momentum.\"Trump and the party have made gains with Black and Latino voters,\" said Lee Hannah, political science professor at Wright State University. \"We saw that in the 2020 election results and we've seen it in some polls. He is certainly risking softening that support and mobilizing new voters who take offense to a racially-charged campaign.\"Hannah noted that, with less than 100 days until the election, there has been a clear difference between Harris and Trump's campaign messages. While he believes Harris \"has been remarkably disciplined and on message\" during her first two weeks in the 2024 race, Trump \"hasn't been able to find a clear and focused attack on Harris that is resonating.\"\"He still has time for that, but if the election doesn't go his way, I think a lot of people are going to look back at these past two weeks as a missed opportunity,\" Hannah told Newsweek. Several prominent Republicans have attempted to steer away from Trump's comments about Harris' racial heritage and instead encouraged their party to focus on Harris' policies under Biden's administration. North Carolina Thom Tillis said in a post to X, formerly Twitter, that the GOP was not \"gaining ground\" by commenting on \"anything but this Biden administration's failed economy, failed border, failed national security.\"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also bashed Trump's comments while speaking to Punchbowl News on Thursday, saying, \"\"What have we been talking about all week long? ... Maybe they don't know how to handle the campaign, so they default to issues that simply should not be an issue.\"Hannah told Newsweek that Harris' team likely \"anticipated having to defend the Biden Administration's record\" when the vice president first launched her campaign, but that \"Trump's lack of focus has instead given her space to criticize Trump and make her case for president.\"\"Trump's team wants him to go after her record and positions, but instead they are spending time in cleaning up his comments from NABJ and answering questions about his running mate's quotes,\" Hannah added, referring to Vance's controversial past statements about women and reproductive rights.Tesler also described Harris' team as running an \"inclusive campaign that seeks to expand the Democratic coalition,\" while Trump is mainly firing up his MAGA base.\"This is, perhaps, most evident in their [vice president] selections,\" he added.Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, held a similar opinion when talking to Newsweek over the phone Thursday about Trump's NABJ appearance, saying that Trump's campaign has \"been about the base. It's not been about expanding.\"\"I think they're going to have to figure out a different way,\" she added.\"It may be that their ... strategy is, we just need to get the folks that support Donald Trump to turn out in huge numbers,\" Walsh said. \"In which case they're just going to keep throwing red meat, which I think was what we saw [Wednesday].\"","summary":"Analysts told Newsweek that the former president's comments about Vice President Kamala Harris' race may turn off some voters before November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-campaign-tactics-could-backfireanalyst-1934034","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442208/trumps-campaign-tactics-could-backfire-analyst.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:08:53","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":253267354,"title":"Biden’s latest idiotic Israel bash is exactly why Iran wants Kamala Harris to beat Trump","text":"Yet again, President Biden took precisely the wrong position when he bashed Israel for taking out Hamas’ leader, Ismail Haniyeh. Asked if asked if Haniyeh’s assassination ruined the chances for a cease-fire agreement in Gaza, the prez said, “It doesn’t help.” Is he for real? Would any normal American have said taking out Osama bin Laden after 9/11 was inflammatory and jeopardized peace with al Qaeda? (Then again, Biden did oppose the US mission to kill the 9/11 terror chief. Pathetic.) Fact is, if Israel had a chance to eliminate the head of the terror group responsible for the Oct. 7 horrors, Ismail Haniyeh, it would’ve been nuts to pass it up. That is precisely what you do to murderous terrorists like Haniyeh. And that’s the answer Biden should’ve given. And by the way, killing Hamas’ leader should only increase the group’s desire for a cease-fire. Remember, Haniyeh’s death came as Israel confirmed that it had wiped out the group’s military leader in Gaza, Mohammed Deif. Israel is destroying Hamas, piece by piece. Of course the group would be more likely to agree to some sort of truce, if only to buy time before all its members are wiped out or forced to surrender. Yet whether for political reasons or a cowardly fear of escalation, Biden has failed to support Israel fully and has instead looked to appease Hamas. He’s also appeased its chief sponsor, Iran, easing off sanctions enforcement and OKing funding for it. When Iran fired more than 300 rockets, missiles and attack drones at Israel, Team Biden-Harris warned Jerusalem not to respond. He lets Iran get away with funding anti-Israel protesters who wreak havoc in America. He even allowed its proxies to attack US bases in the Middle East, killing three US soldiers, with near impunity. And make no mistake: Vice President Kamala Harris is fully onboard with that program. No wonder Iran seems to be pushing to stop Donald Trump from winning in November. It fears him more than Harris. New US intelligence suggests Iran is actively working — surreptitiously, via online influence operations — to undermine Trump’s candidacy. US spy agencies have “observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,” an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. Tehran perceives correctly: Trump would would surely push back against it. As president, he took a tough line against Iran, withdrawing from the disastrous, pro-Iran 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions that slowed the Iranian economy. He also ordered the assassination of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani, one of the most powerful men in the regime. Iran’s leaders want to him back in the White House much like people look forward to root canals. All of which explains why Iranian agents are waging covert online influence operations to hurt Trump, just as they did in 2020. It also explains the recent Iranian plot to assassinate the ex-prez. Given all the horrors Iran has caused, voters should pray for a president who’ll fight back. Tehran just let voters know which candidate it thinks will do that.","summary":"Yet again, President Biden took precisely the wrong position when he bashed Israel for taking out Hamas' leader, Ismail Haniyeh.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/opinion/irans-working-to-make-trump-lose-because-it-fears-his-wrath/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/us-president-joe-biden-briefly-86767170.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8047nsJs-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:04:41","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":253267200,"title":"Vance says he’s called weird because Harris’ campaign is run by ‘social media interns bullied in school’","text":"JD Vance has come up with his own, somewhat unusual explanation for the ongoing attempts by the Harris campaign to brand him and Donald Trump as “weird.” The Republican vice presidential nominee laughed while discussing the Democrats’ new attack line against him, before suggesting that the label had been created by “social media interns” who had been “bullied in school.” The Harris for President campaign has ramped up attacks on Vance and Trump in recent days, with the label of “weird,” though seemingly innocuous, having stuck. “I certainly know the Kamala campaign wants to call me weird,” Vance said, during a recent episode of the Full Send podcast. “I don’t know if it’s something they focus-grouped and pushed on us. I’m a pretty normal guy, I’ve got a wife and kids and I like to hang out and watch football. And I care about this stuff because I care about the country.” He continued: “My best guess — this is just a total guess — is that her campaign is run by a lot of 24-year-old social media interns who maybe were bullied in school and so now they’ve decided they’re going to do the same thing. “They’re going to take that attitude of the middle school social scene and try to run a campaign on it… I just don’t think most Americans buy it or care.” Vance added: “My attitude is, I’m just gonna be who I am. If they want to attack me for whatever they’re going to attack me on that’s fine. You just have to power through and do your thing.” The Ohio Senator has been hounded by online users since becoming Trump’s running mate last month, as more and more of his past, questionable remarks, have emerged including calling the former president “America’s Hitler”. At one rally appearance, he claimed that his enjoyment of drinking Diet Mountain Dew soda would be branded by the Democrats as “racist.” A since-retracted fact-check article by The Associated Press titled “No, JD Vance did not have sex with a couch” also prompted ridicule online. Vance currently boasts the lowest favorability rating of any VP pick immediately after the party convention since the 1980s, with a net negative favorability of -6 points, according to CNN. The Harris campaign has also targeted Trump with its “weird” label, though the former president has lashed back in typical style. In an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham this week he claimed that it was Harris who is “weird.” “Just plain weird. You know who’s plain weird? She’s plain weird. She’s a weird person,” he said about the vice president. “Look at her past. Look at what she does.”","summary":"The Republican vice presidential nominee laughed while discussing the Democrats new attack line against him in a recent appearance on the Full Send podcast","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-weird-harris-campaign-interns-b2590506.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/14/hero_GettyImages-2152218732.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oyLda8DS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:02:52","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":253268436,"title":"Potential Harris running mates face the final exam","text":"Vetting and selecting vice presidential candidates usually takes months, but like every other aspect of this campaign, presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has been working at hyperspeed since she entered the race on July 21. With her new running mate expected to join her on stage no later than Tuesday, the selection process is now in its final hours. On Friday, The New York Times reported that vetting of the potential running mates has been completed after a Washington law firm reviewed candidates and presented the results to Harris. Reports are that this high-speed vetting was no fun for the potentials. Harris will reportedly be holding one-on-one sessions with each of the candidates over the weekend. It’s hard to imagine how vital these talks will be and how much is at stake. It’s enough to make the most confident governor, senator, or Cabinet secretary break out in a cold sweat. The NCAA tournaments lead to a Final Four and Miss America selects five finalists, but The Washington Post says that Harris has selected six potential running mates for this final round: Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Tim Walz of Minnesota; Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. There are no real surprises on this list, and all of them have the popularity and ability to be both assets in the campaign and capable partners down the line. The weekend meetings help explain a flurry of social media reports on Thursday revealing that candidates canceled appearances or shifted their schedules. It would not be surprising if all the members of the final six have shifted their calendars to make room for events this weekend, and possibly into next week. Over the past two weeks, several potential candidates have removed themselves from the list. That includes Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Gavin Newsom of California, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. For those who are meeting with Harris this weekend, this is the final exam to end all final exams—one that could put them at her side for possibly the next eight years and open the potential for their own administration in the future. A lot of the analysis of a potential running mate centers on how they might affect the election. Would Shapiro lock down Pennsylvania? Would Beshear be the perfect counter to Donald Trump’s running mate, faux hillbilly JD Vance? Is Walz the perfect \"normal\" guy to fend off Republican “weird”? But Harris has to do more than pick a name to win this election. She has to select someone she can trust implicitly—someone who can do what she has done for Joe Biden and what Biden did for Barack Obama. And it seems like that decision is still in progress. Show that you’re there for Kamala Harris and her running mate—whoever it may be—by sending $10 to her campaign today.","summary":"Vetting and selecting vice presidential candidates usually takes months, but like every other aspect of this campaign, presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has been working at hyperspeed since she entered the race on July 21.

J.B. Pritzker’s declaration Monday that it would be “near impossible” for legislation providing public money for a new lakefront stadium to pass the legislature this fall. “The focus is the Museum Campus downtown. I still think that’s the most beautiful piece of property in the country, where lake meets architecture downtown,” Warren said during the ABC/ESPN broadcast of the Bears’ Hall of Fame Game Thursday night. “We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights. We own 326 acres. So that still is an opportunity cause we do own the land. But our focus right now is to do everything we can on the lakefront.” Warren’s latest interview happened within the hour of a letter surfacing online from 40 Illinois business leaders — Warren and Bears Chairman George McCaskey among them — to Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign that touted Pritzker as an ideal running mate. Also signing his name to the letter was Related Midwest developer Curt Bailey, who similarly has lobbied Pritzker and state lawmakers for stadium subsidies — this for a new Chicago White Sox ballpark at The 78 redevelopment in the South Loop. During an interview on ESPN 1000 radio Tuesday, Warren name dropped several politicians — including Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Arlington Heights Mayor Tom Hayes — as he expressed confidence that “at the appropriate time, we will be able to come together and work something out.” When asked if the NFL franchise will have finalized the lakefront stadium location within the year, Warren said, “I am confident that the Chicago Bears will have a new stadium that we’ll be able to play in.” “Waddle and Silvy” show co-host Marc Silverman, also a sports columnist for Shaw Local and the Daily Herald, then asked if it was time to make the proverbial halftime adjustments and switch the primary stadium choice back to Arlington Heights. “It’s not time to adjust now,” Warren replied. “Illinois has so many positive areas. Optionality exists here not only for the stadium, but just in business. So sometimes when you have options, you think it has to be ‘either, or.’” “But we have great political leaders,” he continued. “I love the folks in Arlington Heights. But to answer your question, we haven’t reached that point now where it’s time to, you know, take a detour and go to Arlington Heights.” Warren met Pritkzer for breakfast July 16, in what was the first meeting since the General Assembly’s spring session concluded in May. Lawmakers left Springfield without a vote being taken — or even a formal bill making it to the floor — on the Bears’ ask for subsidies to help bankroll a new domed stadium south of Soldier Field. Both Pritzker, and now Warren, have downplayed the significance of the meeting. “We aren’t at that point yet where it becomes a ‘negotiation,’” Warren said during the radio interview. One of the things that I think it’s important — and I’ve tried to do with all of our political and business leaders — is to get to know them. Because one thing I found out: the better you get a chance to know someone personally, business becomes easier.” Since the reveal of the three-phased, $4.7 billion stadium and lakefront campus redevelopment project in April, Warren said staff at Halas Hall and consultants continue to refine the plan design and work through financial complexities. The Bears have pledged to contribute about $2 billion for the stadium, but want public money to cover the rest of the costs. But Warren said the stadium project is “exactly where I thought we would be,” and his goal remains to have shovels in the ground in 2025 and open in 2028.","summary":"Chicago Bears President/CEO Kevin Warren reiterated his commitment this week to building a new stadium on the Chicago lakefront, but acknowledged the sprawling Arlington Heights property the team owns is an \"opportunity.\"","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20240802/news/despite-lakefront-focus-bears-president-leaves-open-the-door-to-arlington-heights-stadium-opportun/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=026bbc5f-d886-5caf-b276-cb1782a40899&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:55:45","author":"Christopher Placek","authors":["Christopher Placek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":253267788,"title":"Haunting memories from a tour of Cook County's old 'morgue' more than half a century ago","text":"Sneed on Sunday ... The body count. A ghost from my past popped up this week. The specter arose when the Sun-Times tipped the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office was hoping to move from its decades-old Harrison Street haunts to two buildings in the Fulton Market District. Back in 1967, the predecessor of the medical examiner’s office was the old Cook County Coroner’s office, a.k.a. the “Morgue,” and it was at 1828 W. Polk Street. In those days, one of the duties of a newly hired reporter at the legendary Chicago City News Bureau was to check out the morgue in search of possible stories. I was so new. It was still an era of pencils, notepads, typewriters, pneumatic tubes to transport news copy, and coin purses loaded with dimes and quarters to phone in scoops from whatever phone booth you could find. And, back then, the old coroner’s office was still rife with patronage — and as crooked as the trigger fingers that sent many of those corpses to the morgue. It had been that way pretty much since the office’s inception in 1858 and wouldn’t change until reform finally stuck in the 1970s. Back in 1967, it was a cold afternoon the first time I visited the morgue, on the orders of an elderly and rumpled, but highly respected, CNB editor named A. A. “Dornie” Dornfeld, who called his women reporters “chickie” and “girlie.” Tales from the crypts My visit had been arranged as an introduction. An attendant greeted me at the door. I wore a dress and probably carried a purse. The attendant gave me an official office rundown and then asked if I wanted to see the layout of the “place.” It was getting late. There was no story. I hesitated … but what the heck. As a Roman Catholic, I had seen the dead in open coffins at wakes and during pre-burial funeral services. But this “visit” was totally different. It was a tour of what they called “bays,” crypts housing the lost, the mangled, the murdered. The contorted forgotten ones laid out on slabs, some forever unidentified. The lights were flicked on and off to allow me to view the grim and dark cubicles. They were granted no privacy, even in death. Too stunned to act surprised, I wondered later that night if this had been a test to shock me, a joke by a morgue ghoul or just a way to gauge the mettle of one of the young woman reporters now occupying the desks of young newsmen who had been drafted to march off to war in Vietnam. I never asked. But I have often wondered. And thereafter, I would jettison the dress. Trump getting Trumped … The Slovenian connection: Donald Trump may be blasting President Joe Biden for what he considers mishandling “the high stakes negotiations” in the largest multi-country diplomatic exchange of American prisoners in Russia since the Cold War. But it was former first lady Melania Trump’s birth country of Slovenia that provided Biden the final piece to the puzzle to secure the release of the American hostages in Russia. “It all came together one hour before their release when the Slovenian prime minister released the Russian [prisoner] held in their custody,” Biden said. Melania Trump was born in Slovenia in 1970, when it was part of Yugoslavia. Her father, Viktor Knavs, now 80, had been a chauffeur and car salesman and was a member of the Communist Party. As many Slovenians did at the time, Viktor and Amalija Knavs had their children baptized as Catholics. When their son-in-law was president, the Knavs became U.S. citizens in 2018 through a family-based pathway that President Trump had denounced as “chain migration” when used by others, saying “often it doesn’t work out very well.” Amalija Knav died in January at the age of 78. Anyway, it’s a proud day to be an American … and for the members of former Russian hostage/Wall Street reporter Evan Gershkovich’s dinner group, which has continued to hold dinners in absentia for him. Imagine the upcoming homecoming feast. No Russian vodka, puleeze. A silent star … It’s no secret the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will pitch itself as a major showcase for American Democracy. So just asking: Will the newly retooled DNC showcase of stars supporting the presidential candidacy of veep Kamala Harris, include an invite to former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who bravely testified at the U.S. House Select committee hearing on Trump’s mendacious conduct during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol? J.B. for V.P? Hmmm. It’s looking more and more possible that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker could be steps away from becoming Dem presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s veep choice. To wit: Not only is Midwestern Gov. Pritzker, scion of the Hyatt Hotel fortune, being vetted seriously as one of the contenders who would not have to give up a Senate seat if chosen, but his wife, M.K. Pritzker, is already a terrific first lady from the very Republican state of South Dakota. Sneedlings … Bench press: Two legal eagles were in transition last Thursday.

On Friday, Aug. 2, Whelan, 54, spoke to reporters about his experience in Russian captivity for 2,043 days — which is the equivalent of nearly six years. Whelan was born in Canada and holds U.S., U.K., Irish and Canadian citizenship, and served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1994 to 2008. Whelan criticized the \"nonsense narrative [the Russian government] came up with\" after he was accused of espionage in December 2018, reports ABC News. He also weighed in on Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So, you know, this is how Putin runs his government. This is how Putin runs his country. Yeah, I'm glad I'm home. Yeah. I'm never going back there again,\" he said with a smile. On Thursday, Aug. 1, Whelan arrived on American soil with fellow former detainees Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva. The trio were released as part of the largest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Both Whelan and Gershkovich, 32 — a reporter for the Wall Street Journal — had been imprisoned for spying. Kurmasheva, 47, is a Russian-American journalist who was detained in October 2023 after Russian officials accused her of being a \"foreign agent.\" Their family members and loved ones were there to greet them, alongside President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. According to Whelan, Biden, 81, gave him an American flag pin, which he wore while speaking to reporters on Friday at Joint Base San Antonio. \"It's a keepsake,” he said. \"I just say thank you to everybody. You know, thank you for all your prayers, your your, you know, good wishes. Thanks for doing everything you did,\" he continued. Biden also told reporters that keeping his word to free American citizens was an important promise to see through. \"I would get this done even if I was seeking a second term. You're stuck with me as president for a while, kid, there's no way out, okay,\" he said. \"You got me for at least another 100 — 90 days or so. So it had to do with that. It had to do with the opportunity trying to convince one last country to say okay, they'll step up.\" WNBA star Brittney Griner also shared her gratitude for the prisoners' release. Griner was detained in Russia in February 2022, when authorities alleged that she had vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage when she arrived in Moscow to play for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg.

Click here to watch Harris joined the virtual nomination announcement on the phone. “I’m honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States, and I will tell you, the tireless work of our delegates, our state leaders, our staff has been pivotal in making this moment possible,” Harris said. This weekend will also be pivotal for Harris as she finalizes her choice for a running mate. The vice president is expected to meet with six finalists over the next few days. Among them is Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has repeatedly skirted the issue. “She makes the ultimate decision. She has to pick the person she’s most comfortable with. Moving forward, it’s going to be very soon, within a matter of days, so I wish our governor good luck,” said U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin. A group of high-powered Chicago area business executives sent a letter to Harris, urging her to pick Pritzker to be her running mate. Among them is Sam Sanchez with Third Coast Hospitality. “He understands business, and that’s important, that you have to understand. You have to be an entrepreneur to understand the need and balance the needs of the hard-working people in America and understand the need of the entrepreneurs and the capitalism, and he brings both of them together,” Sanchez said.

Many political observers do not believe Pritzker can provide the help Harris needs with Illinois being a solid blue state. But with the DNC 17 days away, Democrats are excited about Harris securing the nomination. “I really hope her speech at the DNC really ignites more people.

But behind the scenes, months of nail-bitingly tense negotiations, near misses and fraught moral compromises had been playing out in the run-up to the largest East-West prisoner swap for decades. Not since the Cold War, when secret agents and political prisoners would be routinely exchanged on Berlin’s Bridge of Spies, have so many captives been traded. The remarkably complex deal, which saw 24 inmates freed from prisons in seven countries, had previously collapsed and was in doubt until just before it was sealed. Among those released were two captives holding British citizenship, eight Russian agents, four Americans, five Germans and five Russian anti-Putin activists. In the twilight hours of his presidency, embattled Joe Biden played the pacifier as Western officials bickered over terms. In particular, the Germans were reluctant to release Kremlin assassin Vadim Krasikov – who shot dead a Chechen exile in Berlin five years ago – reportedly fearing any swap would become ‘business model’ for Russia. But in hush-hush meetings on the fringes of other diplomatic gatherings, President Biden eventually convinced Chancellor Olaf Scholz to agree to it. According to analysts, this was the moral compromise – and it could prove to have lasting implications. Because if Vladimir Putin was previously unsure about whether he could recover valued henchmen, he no longer harbours any doubts on that score. It was a backstairs deal, if ever there was one. Due to Russia’s illegal invasion and occupation of Ukraine, East-West relations are at their worst for decades. Yet as this exchanged proved, spymasters in London, Washington and Moscow are still talking to each other. Throughout the negotiations, shadowy officials set up a special channel to discuss the various prisoner proposals. Among the detainees discussed was former US Marine Paul Whelan, a citizen of four countries, including Britain. He had been visiting Moscow to attend a wedding in December 2018 when he was arrested by balaclava-wearing Kremlin hoods who accused him of espionage. Mr Whelan spent 2,043 days in custody, singing national anthems to raise his spirits and was known to joke that the Russians thought they had arrested James Bond when actually they had detained Mr Bean. His ordeal finally ended at a quarter to midnight local time when a plane carrying him, Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich and others landed at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Mr Whelan was the first to be greeted by Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. He saluted before shaking their hands. Months earlier it looked as if the deal had collapsed following the death of Putin critic and political rival Alexei Navalny, who perished in a Russian prison cell in February. Previously, Germany had been willing to trade Krasikov to secure Mr Navalny’s safety. But when he died, many observers thought the exchange would expire with him. Work to resuscitate the deal began immediately after his death at the Munich security conference – and continued even as Mr Biden undertook his disastrous TV debate against Donald Trump. On July 19, a Russian court found Mr Gershkovich guilty of spying and sentenced him to 16 years in a top-security detention centre. To the outside world, it had all the appearances of a devastating blow to the journalist. But those really in the know suspected otherwise. Prior to prisoner swaps, the Moscow authorities traditionally sentence to crushingly long prison terms those they are actually soon to release. Mr Gershkovich and the others received pardons yesterday as they finally tasted freedom.","summary":"Not since the Cold War, when secret agents and political prisoners would be routinely exchanged on Berlin 's Bridge of Spies, have so many captives been traded.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13704131/The-inside-story-deal-freed-journalist-Evan-Gershkovich-historic-prisoner-swap-Putin-critic-Alexei-Navalny-exchange-death-Russian-prison-writes-MARK-NICOL.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/02/23/88102887-0-image-m-10_1722638768310.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/01/5932421216208964809/1024x576_MP4_5932421216208964809.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:47:12","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol Diplomacy","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol Diplomacy"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":253266688,"title":"Philly mayor tweets puzzling video, sparking rumors Josh Shapiro is Kamala Harris’ running mate","text":"Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker sparked a frenzy Friday afternoon by seeming to leak the identity of Vice President Kamala Harris’ new running mate in a campaign ad-style video that described Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as Harris’ No. 2 on the Democratic ticket. “Kamala Harris for president — Josh Shapiro for vice president!” the mayor declared in the video. “Now we need you. Let us and Kamala Harris know you stand with her!” The video quickly went viral — with viewers questioning whether Parker had accidentally revealed Shapiro’s triumph in the veepstakes over other contenders, such as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Tim Walz of Minnesota. A source close to Parker quickly told the Philadelphia Inquirer that she was simply making a show of support for Shapiro, whom she considers a “friend.” ”This is not an announcement of anything. This is just the mayor showing her support for a longtime friend who we know is one of the people being considered,” a source close to Parker told the local newspaper. National sources close to the Harris campaign told The Post that they strongly doubted the mayor leaked any closely held information. One source close the Harris campaign told The Post that the video was “odd,” but that they believe Parker was simply “trying to make ‘fetch’ happen.” Another source close to the campaign said it’s their understanding that Harris, 59, has not yet made a decision on her running mate — and that if she has, extremely few Democrats know the name. A third Post source, who is close to a different potential Harris running mate, said the selection was “still up in the air” so far as they’re aware. Context clues hint at the denials being true — including the fact that Parker posted a video wearing the same outfit on July 26, suggesting the footage indicating Shaprio was the VP pick could be more than a week old. Harris’ running mate decision is expected either over the weekend or early next week — with the yet-to-be-named pair expected to blitz the swing states with Harris in the coming days ahead of the Aug. 19-22 Democratic convention in Chicago. The pairing must be formalized by Aug. 7 in order to meet an Ohio ballot-access deadline. She is expected to speak with her running mate at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Harris on Friday secured enough voters in a virtual roll call to cement her status as the Democratic presidential nominee after President Biden, 81, abruptly ended his campaign for a second term on July 21 after a party mutiny over his apparent cognitive decline.

Her interview list includes Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people were granted anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. Shapiro and Kelly had been viewed as among the front-runners during her truncated selection process, which began with the vetting of about a dozen names. Some have publicly withdrawn from consideration, such as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is close with Harris from their shared time as state attorneys general but expressed concern about regularly traveling out of the state if he were to be on the national Democratic ticket. Her deadline for picking a running mate is effectively Tuesday, when Harris will launch a tour of seven key battleground states, starting in Philadelphia. President Joe Biden told reporters Friday that he has spoken to Harris about her search for a vice presidential candidate, but when asked whether he had advice for the qualities she should look for in a running mate, the president publicly demurred. “I’ll let her work that out,” Biden said on the South Lawn of the White House before departing for Wilmington, Delaware, for the weekend. Some of the people on Harris’ short list had abruptly cancelled their plans for this weekend, signaling that something could be afoot in the vice-presidential selection process. For example, Shapiro scrapped three weekend fundraisers in the seaside communities on the coast of Long Island, New York, and his press secretary, Manuel Bonder, offered little explanation as to why. “The governor’s trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee,” Bonder said in a statement. “His schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.” One Shapiro fundraiser was to be hosted by Michael Kempner, a member of President Joe Biden ‘s national finance committee. Kempner said in a note to invitees that the gathering had been postponed and openly advocated for Shapiro to be Harris’ No. 2, writing that “many are speculating that this is a sign he will be the vice president.” Meanwhile, a video put on social media by Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker — who is publicly supporting Shapiro for vice president — caused a stir Friday. It showed a number of Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris for president, but also touting Shapiro for vice president, suggesting to some that Parker may have inside knowledge about Harris’ decision. However, a person with knowledge of the mayor’s thinking said the video was simply the mayor showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker’s friend, will be her vice presidential running mate. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I am honored to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. I will officially accept the nomination next week. This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are. Join us: https://t.co/abmve926Hz — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 2, 2024 Following this, Kamala Harris shared a post on X, and said, “I am honoured to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.”“I will officially accept the nomination next week. This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are,” she added.After this announcement, US President Joe Biden also shared a post on X and stated, that he made one of the best decisions to pick Kamla Harris as president adding he couldn’t be prouder.“One of the best decisions I’ve made was picking @KamalaHarris as my vice president. Now that she will be our party’s nominee, I couldn’t be prouder,” Joe Biden said on X.More than 4,000 convention delegates had until Monday to submit their ballots, but no other candidate qualified to challenge Harris, making her selection all but certain. Still, the formal nomination ascent of the first woman of colour to lead a presidential ticket marks a milestone for a nation long riven by racial and gender issues, as per the Washington Post. “I am honoured to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States,” Harris said on a call with supporters. “And I will tell you the tireless work of our delegates, our state leaders and staff has been pivotal in making this moment possible.”The announcement was made moments before by Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison, who noted that Harris crossed the threshold just a day after online balloting began. The voting was opened on Monday.“The fact that we can say today — just one day after we opened voting — that the vice president has crossed the majority threshold and will officially be our nominee next week, folks, that is simply outstanding,” Harrison said.On July 27, Harris signed the forms, officially declaring her candidature for the US presidential elections, assuring that her people’s-powered campaign would win in November.Harris took to social media X and emphasised that in November, her people-powered campaign will win.She further reiterated that she would work hard to earn every vote.”Today, I signed the forms officially declaring my candidacy for President of the United States. I will work hard to earn every vote. And in November, our people-powered campaign will win,” Kamala Harris said in her post.After President Biden abruptly bowed out of the race on July 21 and endorsed Harris, Democratic leaders scrambled to create a nomination process that did not rely on state primary contests, all of which Biden had already won.The new nomination contest allowed anyone to run if they obtained 300 signatures of delegates supporting their bid, including no more than 50 from any single delegation while meeting other basic qualifications.With top party officials seeking to rally the party to confront the candidacy of Donald Trump, no elected Democratic politician besides Harris announced their intention to seek those signatures. The candidates who did signal their intent to seek the nomination failed to obtain the required signatures.On July 30, the Democratic National Committee said that 3,923 delegates had petitioned to put Harris on the ballot for the nomination, a large majority of the total delegate pool.Party leaders decided months ago, when Biden was still expected to be the nominee, to use a virtual vote to finalize the nomination, rather than waiting for the party convention in Chicago on August 19-22. They said the early nomination was needed because legal ambiguities in Ohio’s early deadlines meant that Biden could be kept off the ballot in that state. Ohio ultimately amended its timeline for ballot qualification, but the Democrats stuck to their plans for a virtual nomination. Under the party’s rules, delegates do not need to vote on Harris’s vice-presidential selection.Democratic convention planners are preparing a symbolic roll call for prime-time television coverage in Chicago, with representatives of each state offering their votes for Harris in a customized fashion.Harris becomes just the second person of colour in America’s nearly 250-year history to head a major presidential ticket, after Barack Obama in 2008. Harris is Black and Indian American, and Trump has recently attacked her identity and suggested that she formerly downplayed her Black heritage, an assertion for which there is no evidence.Harris will also be the second female major-party nominee, after Hillary Clinton in 2016, when Clinton lost to Trump in a contest that stunned Democrats and upended the political landscape.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/08/us-election-kamla-harris-officially-secures-democratic-nomination-for-president/","image":"https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:35:34","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.014},{"id":253266466,"title":"Acting Secret Service Director acknowledges additional failures in Donald Trump assassination attempt and addresses personnel changes following former president’s shooting","text":"Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe continued to reveal failures Friday from the day former President Donald Trump was nearly assassinated while speaking at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Rowe also revealed that nobody has been fired yet over Trump’s near-death experience. The acting director explained that Secret Service officials had no radio communications with local police and weren’t aware Thomas Matthew Crooks had a gun aimed at the ex-president before he opened fire. Rowe confirmed that ‘there was somebody who did, in fact radio out that they had seen the individual with a weapon.’ ‘What I can tell you is that piece of information, that vital piece of information, and by no fault of anyone, it was a very stressful situation, it did not make it over,’ Rowe said. Local and state law enforcement officers aren’t on the same radio network as Secret Service agents. Trump’s Secret Service detail, Rowe said, was ‘operating under the assumption’ from the last bit of information that they received. ‘That there was an issue that the locals were working at the three o’clock,’ he said, using a clock as a directional cue. ‘That’s a bit of information that we had. Not anything about a weapon.’ In fact, more details about the threat were being shared, when the gunshots rang out. ‘So the former president’s detail – they had an advanced person on the ground who was responsible for the site,’ Rowe said. ‘The radio transmission goes out about locals working an issue at the 3 o’clock.’ ‘The member of that detail called their Pittsburgh Field Office counterpart. “Hey, what do you know about this?” In the midst – right in the middle of that phone conversation, the shots begin firing,’ Rowe said. The former president is a fan of holding large outdoor rallies, but Rowe suggested that busy radio chatter – from people making medical emergency requests due to the heat – could have played a role clogging up the airwaves at a vital time. Rowe said that about 100 calls had been made for support ahead of the shooting. ‘It was a very hot day that day,’ Rowe explained. ‘There were a lot of – not only EMS type of calls to address people but, there were people that needed some other type of law enforcement assistance.’ ‘This happens. Candidly happens a lot at outdoor rallies where, especially on hot days,’ the acting director continued. ‘So there was a lot of traffic, radio traffic on the local net about, “Hey, I need an EMT here.” So there were a lot of people that were needing assistance,’ Rowe said. Rowe said it was now ‘plainly obvious’ that the Secret Service didn’t have the information they needed, but refused to assign blame. ‘It just so happened that there was a sense of urgency, that there might have been radio traffic that we missed,’ he said. ‘We have to do a better job at that.’ During the press conference, which ran under an hour, Rowe revealed that he would ‘provide some type of statement that people are being held accountable’ when asked if the American public would be informed about firings over the assassination attempt. He also said that all the main principals – Trump, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance and whomever Harris chooses for her VP would all get Secret Service sniper teams at their events going forward. Rowe was also asked about an allegation from a whisteblower that he ‘personally directed’ cuts to the agency’s Counter Surveillance Division, the unit tasked with evaluating event sites in advance. ‘I’ve become aware of this. We got a congressional letter on it. What I can tell you is that the Counter Surveillance Division, they do a fantastic job,’ Rowe said. He said that he was aware of the allegations that he had denied requests to utilize them. ‘The Counter Surveillance Division has been out there supporting the former president at some very high-profile events. They continue to provide that support and they’re out there providing support right now,’ Rowe said. When asked to clarify if he cut CSD resources he responded, ‘I did not, no.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe continued to reveal failures Friday from&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Acting Secret Service Director acknowledges additional failures in Donald Trump assassination attempt and addresses personnel changes following former president&#8217;s shooting first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/acting-secret-service-director-acknowledges-additional-failures-in-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-and-addresses-personnel-changes-following-former-presidents-shooting/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Acting-Secret-Service-Director-admits-more-staggering.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:34:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.813},{"id":253266316,"title":"White House explains Biden’s actions after reboarding plane without Kamala Harris following return of freed Americans","text":"President Joe Biden had welcomed home Americans freed from Russian prisons Thursday, and spoken and to the media about the dramatic swap – but he still had one more thing to attend to. The president, 81, slowly climbed the steps of the jet that had ferried the group of prisoners from captivity, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris waiting behind on the tarmac at the night-time event. The moment came after both Biden and Harris gave an emotional welcome to Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whalen, and Alsu Kurmasheva after their dramatic return from captivity. Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, hugged each of them upon his return. The interlude for Biden lasted two minutes long after Biden left his VP behind. The president was out of view for about a minute and forty seconds while on board the plane. ‘President Biden wanted to personally thank the flight crew who brought these brave individuals home to their families,’ White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told DailyMail.com when asked about what the president was doing on board the aircraft. Harris, who has been shadowing Biden during key moments, remained below and did not step on board. Biden had earlier posted an image of the freed prisoners aboard the aircraft as they made their way home. When he was done, he slowly walked down the jetway, with one hand on each railing, to rejoin Harris, then walked over toward Whelan. Biden and Harris were on hand for the emotional nighttime arrival at Joint Base Andrews following their transatlantic flight, after Biden addressed reporters at the White House on the historic prisoner swap that freed them. ‘It feels wonderful. A long time in coming, but I was absolutely convinced we would get it done,’ Biden told reporters at the base, which he also uses when traveling aboard Air Force One. After exchanging some words with Harris, Biden, 81, slowly climbed the jetway that had brought the prisoners to U.S. soil. Harris, whose own role in the effort was being highlighted by White House officials, spoke to Biden’s role in her own comments. ‘And I’m very thankful for our president and what he has done over his entire career but, in particular, as it relates to these families and these individuals; what he has been able to do to bring the allies together on many issues but, in particular, this one. Online users who watched Biden’s trip to the aircraft online had their own theories, after Biden has been seen being guided by figures including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and former President Barack Obama at public events. ‘No one is talking about how Biden climbed onto the jet after the Americans already got off. Did he think he was getting on Air Force One?’ asked one user. ‘Maybe he was using the bathroom!’ wrote another. Biden took the successful negotiations as a vindication for his belief in the diplomatic value of personal relationships. ‘You’ve heard me kid with Barack — he’d kid me — all politics is personal. It matters. Other leaders trust you, you trust them, you get things done. And that’s how this got done: with a lot of — a lot of help.’ The RNC Research X account also posted the video of Biden and Harris. ‘Kamala watches Biden shuffle aimlessly across the tarmac and nearly trip up the stairs of the plane (from which the passengers had long disembarked). This is the obvious decline Kamala covered up in her thirst for power — the scandal of the century,’ went the tweet. That prompted another ‘weird’ attack from Bates at the White House. ‘.@POTUS was personally thanking the flight crew who brought these brave individuals home to their families. Most Americans are putting partisanship aside to welcome this outstanding news for our country. Y’all should join them. Don’t be weird,’ he wrote.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden had welcomed home Americans freed from Russian prisons Thursday, and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: White House explains Biden&#8217;s actions after reboarding plane without Kamala Harris following return of freed Americans first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/white-house-explains-bidens-actions-after-reboarding-plane-without-kamala-harris-following-return-of-freed-americans/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-White-House-reveals-what-Biden-was-really.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:32:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.152},{"id":253266508,"title":"How Kamala Harris became first black woman and Asian American US presidential nominee","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris received enough votes to clinch the Democratic Party’s nomination on Friday (Picture: AP) Vice President Kamala Harris has made history by becoming the first black woman and Asian American to be the presidential nominee of a major US political party. Harris secured the Democratic Party’s nomination on Friday afternoon after gaining the majority of votes from delegates. ‘I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States,’ said Harris in a livestream call sponsored by her party. ‘Your dedication cannot be overstated. Your dedication to our country. I know we all feel this way so strongly. We love our country, we believe in the promise of America, and that’s what this campaign is about.’ Vice President Kamala Harris will officially be the Democratic Party’s nominee for president after the virtual roll call voting period ends on Monday (Picture: AP) How did Kamala Harris become a 2024 presidential nominee? Harris crossed the threshold of 2,350 votes to win the nomination, one day after the party began a virtual roll call vote. It will completely official after the voting period for the 4,000 delegates closes on Monday at 6pm. ‘I am so proud to confirm that Vice President Harris has earned more than a majority of votes from all convention delegates and will be the nominee of the Democratic Party following the close of voting on Monday,’ stated Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison during the call. Harrison highlighted the historic moment. ‘Today, my friends, is special, because we can proudly say we will have the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket,’ he said. Vice President Kamala Harris received President Joe Biden’s endorsement after he dropped out of the 2024 race (Picture: AP) Did Kamala Harris face competition in securing the Democratic nomination? President Joe Biden announced he was ending his reelection campaign on July 21 and minutes later, endorsed his vice president, Harris, to replace him as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Biden called his decision to choose Harris as his second-in-command when he won the 2020 election, the ‘best decision I’ve made’. Democrats quickly united in support of Harris, despite some other names who were tossed around including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Maryland Governor Wes Moore. Though there was earlier talk of potential candidates competing ahead of the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, Harris for the past couple of weeks has enjoyed running unopposed. Kamala Harris was the first woman, black and South Asian American to become vice president (Picture: AP) How has Kamala Harris made history? Harris, the daughter of an Indian-American mom and a Jamaican-American dad, is the first black and South Asian woman in US history to win a presidential nominee designation. It comes after she made history in 2020, becoming the first woman, black and South Asian American to become vice president. Glenda Carr, who heads the Higher Heights organization helping black women run for office, told CBS News that ‘this is an exciting moment about her making history’ and that ‘her candidacy sets a new direction in the way that we talk about Black women’s political leadership’. Democratic National Convention Chair Minyon Moore ahead of the roll call vote said that Harris ‘has earned the right to run this race and run it in a dignified way’. Former President Donald Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial background in a combative panel discussion on Wednesday (Picture: Getty Images) What did Donald Trump say about Kamala Harris’ racial background? Former President Donald Trump, who secured the Republican nomination in mid-July, attacked Harris’ racial identity in a combative interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Wednesday. ‘She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,’ said Trump. ‘I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she black?’ Trump faced heavy criticism for questioning Harris’ racial background as numerous polls have shown Harris edging slightly ahead of him. As of Friday morning, 538 had polling averages showing Harris leading Trump with 45% support from voters versus 43.5%. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Reuben Gallego (D-AZ), and Vice President Kamala Harris over their progressive policy positions on the U.S. southern border. The ad, “Ruben and Kamala: Bad for America,” marks the fourth installment of a joint $10 million ad buy with the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), Lake’s campaign announced in an emailed release. That followed the initial report of the ad from Fox News’s Julia Johnson. This is the latest example of down-ballot Republicans tying their opponents to Harris and her deep record of far-left policy positions. Meanwhile, Democrats, like Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Suzan Delbene (D-WA), are working to distance themselves from Harris. The trends indicate that the newly-minted Democrat nominee, who did not secure a vote in the Democrat primary, is imperiling the bids of down-ballot Democrats. Lake’s ad begins by highlighting Gallego’s record of voting with President Joe Biden and “border czar Kamala, including their radical border agenda” 100 percent of the time during the first half of Biden’s term. FiveThirtyEight’s data shows that while serving in the 117th Congress from 2021-2023, Gallego voted with Biden 100 percent of the time. Beginning with the 118th Congress, FiveThirtyEight stopped tracking the data. The ad then highlights Harris’s position during the 2019 Democrat primary of decriminalizing illegal immigration. The ad shows Harris saying, “We’re not going to treat people who cross the border as criminals.” It also highlights her saying, “We need to probably think about starting from scratch,” when asked whether she agreed with abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2018. It also shows clips of Gallego bashing the idea of a southern border wall. In one segment, he says, “We’re not going to support a border wall that is not needed.” “Trump’s stupid, dumb border wall,” he says in another clip. In a statement shared in the release, the former Fox 10 Phoenix news anchor ripped both Gallego and Harris. “Radical Ruben Gallego has a long record of supporting open-borders policies and voting against efforts to secure our border,” she said. “He supported Joe Biden and his border czar Kamala Harris as they created this national security & humanitarian crisis. Ruben and Kamala are bad for the border, bad for Arizona and bad for America,” Lake added.","summary":"Arizona Republican Kari Lake's U.S. Senate campaign released an ad Friday hammering her opponent, Rep.

Her interview list includes Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people were granted anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. Shapiro and Kelly had been viewed as among the front-runners during her truncated selection process, which began with the vetting of about a dozen names. Some have publicly withdrawn from consideration, such as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is close with Harris from their shared time as state attorneys general but expressed concern about regularly traveling out of the state if he were to be on the national Democratic ticket. Harris’ deadline for picking a running mate is effectively Tuesday when she will launch a tour of seven key battleground states, starting in Philadelphia. President Biden told reporters Friday that he has spoken to Harris about her search for a vice presidential candidate, but when asked whether he had advice for the qualities she should look for in a running mate, the president publicly demurred. “I’ll let her work that out,” Biden said on the South Lawn of the White House before departing for Wilmington, Delaware, for the weekend. Some of the people on Harris’ short list abruptly canceled their plans for this weekend, signaling that something could be afoot in the vice-presidential selection process. Shapiro, for example, scrapped three weekend fundraisers in the seaside communities on the coast of Long Island, New York, and his press secretary, Manuel Bonder, offered little explanation as to why. “The governor’s trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee,” Bonder said in a statement. “His schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.” One Shapiro fundraiser was to be hosted by Michael Kempner, a member of Biden’s national finance committee. Kempner said in a note to invitees that the gathering had been postponed and openly advocated for Shapiro to be Harris’ No. 2, writing that “many are speculating that this is a sign he will be the vice president.” Meanwhile, a video put on social media by Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker – who is publicly supporting Shapiro for vice president – caused a stir Friday. It showed a number of Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris for president while also touting Shapiro for vice president, suggesting to some that Parker may have inside knowledge about Harris’ decision. However, a person with knowledge of the mayor’s thinking said the video was simply the mayor showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker’s friend, will be her vice-presidential running mate. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Associated Press writer Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pa., contributed to this report. « Previous","summary":"The short list includes 4 governors, a senator and a Cabinet secretary, according to 2 people with knowledge of her selection process.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/02/harris-interviewing-6-potential-vice-president-picks-this-weekend-ap-sources-say/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/08/Election_2024_Harris_02864.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:17:20","author":"Seung Min Kim And Zeke Miller,SEUNG MIN KIM and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press","authors":["Seung Min Kim And Zeke Miller","SEUNG MIN KIM and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.094},{"id":253265792,"title":"Kamala Harris Becomes the Democratic Presidential Candidate Instead of Joe Biden","text":"Kamala Harris has been named the Democratic Presidential candidate for the upcoming elections, officially replacing President Joe Biden.

Vice President Harris is of Indian and Jamaican descent, which has confused many Trump supporters, including the former U.S. president. During an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention this week, Trump drew backlash for questioning Harris’s racial identity. “She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she became a Black person,” Trump said. Trump went further and took to Truth Social to share a video from 2020 that featured The Office alum Mindy Kaling cooking Masala dosa with Harris. In the video, Kaling called the VP “Crazy Kamala” and a “stone-cold phony.” Kaling tells Harris, “We’re both South Indian.” Harris then replies, “Yes, you look like the entire one-half of my family.” “Damn, I forgot how weird The Office got after Michael Scott left,” Chieng joked. Chieng went on to slam Trump, saying, “How did he even find this? Was he doing a deep oppo research on Mindy Kaling’s Instagram page? How far down the Mindy rabbit hole did he go? Is he going to come out next week like, ‘Kamala Harris is not Black, and Mindy and B.J. Novak belong together, OK? Do the right thing B.J. Make an honest Indian out of her.’” The Daily Show host commented that the video “doesn’t even prove his point,” adding, “He’s saying Kamala identifies as Indian and not Black. And this is a video of her saying, ‘I’m half Indian.’ What does Trump think the other half is? Woman? How does this guy not understand what half means?” “He constantly tells us he’s a genius, but he can’t comprehend a golden doodle?” Chieng continued before joking, “Also, Trump doesn’t get to decide how Black a Black person is.

The video is titled ‘We Choose Freedom’ and features the song ‘Freedom’ by Beyonce, which is also being used as Harris’ walkout song at events. While Beyonce has not officially endorsed the vice president as of now, a source familiar confirmed Beyonce’s team gave the campaign permission to use the song. The video is also narrated by the vice president herself and is being promoted across the campaign’s social media platforms. In it, Harris lays out her priorities as her campaign scrambles to reintroduce Harris to the American people as the Democratic presidential candidate. She also goes on a blistering attack on former President Donald Trump. But noticeably absent from the minute-twenty video: any mentions of President Biden or images of them together. ‘In this election, we each face a question,’ Harris says in the video. ‘What kind of country do we want to live in?’ ‘There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate, but us, we choose something different. We choose freedom,’ she continues. The video starts with imagery of an American flag and Harris supporters waving ‘Kamala’ signs at her rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday. It then cuts to ominous images of Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance. Later in the video, Harris calls for a future where ‘no one is above the law.’ At that point it shows an image of Trump’s mugshot from his Georgia election interference case as well as headlines from when Trump was indicted and found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York. Harris has been taking the fight to Trump in her speeches. At her first rally, she touted prosecuting predators and said Trump is one. She spoke of taking on fraudsters and slammed Trump for being guilty of fraud. While the new video features images of Trump, it does not mention the Republican presidential nominee by name, and besides the directed lines, it is a more optimistic introduction of the Democratic candidate. The video relies heavily on images of Harris supporters holding signs and cheering from Harris’ first campaign rally with voters as a presidential candidate. The Milwaukee event was attended by three-thousand people in the all-important swing state. It also features pride flags, families, construction workers and physicians. ‘The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body,’ Harris says. She calls for a future ‘where no child lives in poverty’ and ‘where we all can afford health care.’ It ends with Harris’ rallying cry she is enthusiastically using on the campaign trail. ‘We believe in the promise of America and we are ready to fight for it,’ she says. ‘Because when we fight, we win.’ While the campaign’s first video was released on social media, it has not yet placed any political ad buys on television featuring the vice president. However, the campaign has been advertising on digital. The same day Biden dropped out of the race, it started posting digital ads promoting the president’s endorsement of Harris and pushed supporters to raise money for her run for president. In just over 24 hours, the Harris campaign raised more than $100 million from more than 1.1 million donors.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris released her first video promoting her run for president&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217; new campaign video excludes a significant name and fiercely criticizes another person. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/kamala-harris-new-campaign-video-excludes-a-significant-name-and-fiercely-criticizes-another-person/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-releases-first-campaign-video-that.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:01:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.074},{"id":253266460,"title":"UAW leader says Trump would put labor movement into reverse if he’s elected again","text":"DETROIT — Putting Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket increases the Democrats’ chance of winning Michigan and keeping the White House in November, the head of the United Auto Workers union says. In an interview Friday with the Associated Press, Shawn Fain said former President Donald Trump is beholden to billionaires, knows nothing about the auto industry and would send the labor movement into reverse if he’s elected again. “Trump has never supported working-class people. He has never supported unions,” Fain said. “But he sure as hell was trying to pander for our votes now.” Fain has become a top nemesis of the Republican presidential nominee, who frequently rails against him at rallies and in speeches. Trump has called him an idiot, courting autoworkers’ votes by saying Fain is putting their jobs at risk by embracing a move to electric vehicles. Although the UAW has members across the nation, many automaking jobs are concentrated in the Great Lakers region and Michigan, a key swing state that could decide the presidential race in November. This week, the UAW endorsed Harris. Trump and Harris realize that increasing their share of union votes gives them a much better chance of taking Michigan, where the last two presidential elections have been close, said Marick Masters, a business professor emeritus at Wayne State University who follows labor issues. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton, then lost the state four years later by nearly 154,000 votes to President Biden. Appealing to autoworkers helps to get votes from other union members, and union membership is high in the state at about 556,000, Masters said. That doesn’t include thousands of family members and union retirees, he said. Any swing in those votes could be consequential in the race. During his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, Trump called on union workers to fire Fain, falsely claiming that Chinese auto companies are building factories in Mexico to ship vehicles to the U.S. without tariffs. Industry analysts say they aren’t aware of any such plants under construction – at least not yet. “You probably have to get rid of this fool, this stupid idiot representing the United Auto Workers,” Trump said of Fain at a July 20 rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Trump claimed that he’ll get 95% of the UAW vote because Fain is pushing electric vehicles. “They’re going to be made in China,” he said. He also pledged to bring the auto industry back from obliteration if he’s elected. But the industry is far from obliterated. Since Biden took office in January 2021, employment making cars and parts has grown 13.8% to just over 1 million people, according to the Labor Department. Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have made billions in annual profits. Fain dismissed the insults as typical Trump behavior. “All the man does is name-call, label people. He never has solutions,” Fain said. “That’s the problem in leadership. You need to find solutions.” The move from internal combustion vehicles to those powered by electricity is inevitable, Fain said, and union members need to be ready for it. During the transition, auto companies are still making gasoline vehicles and keeping factory workers employed, he said. Trump, Fain said, did nothing for autoworkers when General Motors closed its small-car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019. Biden, who last month announced he would drop out of the race and support Harris, helped to get GM to build an electric vehicle battery plant in the Lordstown area, replacing some of the lost jobs, Fain said. On Friday, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said Harris has secured enough votes from delegates to become her party’s nominee. Fain said he’s confident that Harris will remain an advocate for working people, citing her trip to walk picket lines with striking GM workers in 2019. “She was there with the president through a lot of things we’ve been through,” he said. “She’s been there for labor.” Of candidates to become Harris’ vice presidential choice, the union prefers Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Fain said. The union isn’t backing Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly because he has opposed a bill that would boost union organizing, while Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro favors school vouchers, which would send tax dollars to private schools and hurt public schools, Fain said. But even if Harris doesn’t pick one of the union’s favorites, the 370,000-member UAW would still put its political might behind her, Fain said. “I think she’s a brilliant woman. A very strong person,” Fain said. “She understands the issues. I think Trump’s just all talk. That’s all he’s ever been. He’s a showman.” In a statement, Trump’s campaign called Fain “a puppet for the Democrat party” who isn’t serving union laborers who are supporting Trump. “Shawn Fain’s empty words don’t matter – President Trump will take action to fight for the American auto worker,” the statement said.

The online voting process doesn’t end until Monday, but the campaign marked the moment when she crossed the threshold to have the majority of delegates’ votes. Harris is poised to be the first woman of color at the top of a major party’s ticket. “I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee,\" Harris said on a call with supporters. Harrison said “we will rally around Vice President Kamala Harris and demonstrate the strength of our party” during its convention in Chicago later this month. Democrats have pushed ahead with a virtual vote to nominate Harris, nearing the culmination of a turbulent process that was upended by President Joe Biden’s decision not to seek reelection. Delegates to the Democratic National Convention began voting via secure email on Thursday, and the voting will remain open until Monday evening. Harris has not yet chosen her running mate, and she's expected to interview candidates over the weekend. The formal nomination is expected to be finalized by Aug. 7 even though the party's convention in Chicago isn't scheduled to begin for more than two more weeks. Democratic officials have said the accelerated timeline was necessary because of an Aug. 7 deadline to ensure candidates appear on the Ohio ballot. Harris was endorsed by Biden shortly after he dropped out of the race, catapulting her to the forefront of the campaign to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump. No other major candidate challenged Harris for the nomination, and she was the only choice for delegates under party rules that required pledges of support from at least 300 delegates, with no more than 50 signatures from any one delegation. Any delegate who wants to vote for someone other than Harris will be tallied as \"present.\" Democrats still plan a state-by-state roll call during the convention, the traditional way that a nominee is chosen. However, that will be purely ceremonial because of the online voting. The party insists it has to have its nominee in place before its convention opens in Chicago on Aug. 19 to make sure it meets ballot access deadlines in Ohio — an argument that the state’s Republicans dispute. Ohio state lawmakers have since changed the deadline, but the modification doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1. Democratic attorneys warn that waiting until after the initial deadline to determine a presidential nominee could prompt legal challenge. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Taking a victory lap after her winning performance at the Paris Games, Biles trolled Trump for his controversial claims that undocumented immigrants are taking so-called “Black jobs” from Americans. The world champion was amplifying a post by singer/songwriter Ricky Davila that praised Biles as the greatest of all time. “Iconic photo of the GOAT mastering her black job and collecting gold medals,” Davila tweeted. Biles won the all-around gold medal on Thursday, her second of the Paris Games. It raised her career haul to nine gold medals, and she could add even more honors with three more finals looming in coming days. The wins amount to a remarkable comeback after Biles withdrew from the last Olympics to focus on her mental health. Her tweet amounts to a rebuke of Trump who has refused to back down from controversial remarks about “Black jobs” at his recent debate with President Biden. Trump doubled down on the comment Wednesday during a forum with reporters at the National Association of Black Journalists in which he also falsely claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris only recently “became Black.” “A Black job is anybody that has a job,” Trump said at the NABJ event, drawing derisive groans from the crowd. The spat with Trump isn’t the first tangle between Biles and his right-wing supporters. Biles’ 2021 decision to withdraw from competition sparked an unusual backlash from Trump’s MAGA allies who suggested she should suck it up and compete regardless of her health concerns. One of them was Trump’s vice presidential running mate JD Vance, who denounced Americans for supporting Biles’ difficult decision at the time. “I think it reflects pretty poorly on our … society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,” said Vance, who was launching an ultimately successful run for U.S. Senate. Democrats seized on the remarks this week to take shots at Vance, who has stumbled badly in his debut on the national stage with comments deriding Americans who don’t have children. “The audacity of JD Vance to go after the GOAT Simone_Biles as if he isn’t the most unpopular V.P. pick in decades,” tweeted Aida Ross, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.","summary":"Gymnast Simone Biles dinged former President Trump today by tweeting &#8220;I love my Black job&#8221; after her latest Olympic gold medal win.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/02/sports/sports-breaking/simone-biles-dings-trump-with-i-love-my-black-job-tweet/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_20240802_brk_sbi01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:00:00","author":"Tribune News Service","authors":["Tribune News Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.257},{"id":253265370,"title":"Hunter Biden will be sentenced on gun charges in November","text":"Hunter Biden, the son of U.S. President Joe Biden, will be sentenced on Nov. 13 after a jury found him guilty of federal gun charges, according to a court filing on Friday. Hunter Biden became the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a felony on June 11 when a jury in Wilmington, Delaware, found him guilty on three counts related to his lying about illegal drug use when he purchased a handgun in 2018. The sentencing by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika will take place eight days after the Nov. 5 presidential election pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Sentencing guidelines for the gun charges are 15 to 21 months, but legal experts say defendants in similar cases often get shorter sentences and are less likely to be incarcerated if they abide by the terms of their pretrial release. Joe Biden issued a statement following the verdict saying he accepted the outcome of the case. At the trial, prosecutors offered an intimate view of Hunter Biden’s years of struggle with alcohol and crack cocaine abuse, which they said legally precluded him from buying a gun. Biden’s lawyers sought to show he was not using drugs when he bought the gun and did not intend to deceive because he didn’t consider himself a drug user when he filled out the form. Hunter Biden has also been charged with three felony and six misdemeanor tax offenses in California, alleging he failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019 while spending millions on drugs, escorts, exotic cars and other high-ticket items. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 5 in Los Angeles.
