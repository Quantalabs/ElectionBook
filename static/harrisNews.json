The digital landscape has rapidly changed in the era of social media, and both politicians and media personalities have taken notice. Some have referred to the 2024 election as the \"podcast election,\" arguing that podcaster Joe Rogan and others like him turned the tide for President Donald Trump by having him on their shows. Meyers famously roasted Trump for his political ambitions at a White House correspondents' dinner in 2011, a few short years before he went on to win the presidency. Now in the second Trump term, 14 years later, Meyers spoke to Variety magazine about how the media landscape has changed. After the interviewer noted the trend of politicians appearing on comedians' podcasts, Meyers agreed they have turned out to be a far better platform for them than television interviews ever were. SETH MEYERS SKIPS ASKING GEORGE CLOONEY ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE, NOT RECOGNIZING HIM AT FUNDRAISER \"We’ve kind of weaned ourselves off politicians as guests to begin with, because we have more fun talking about politics than talking to politicians,\" Meyers said of his show which hosted then-President Joe Biden in February 2024 and then-Vice President Kamala Harris in October 2022. \"I actually think there’s more value in a politician going on a podcast and not feeling the rush to just hit talking points, which sometimes they might have on a show like mine,\" he added. \"I think it’s good for the politicians and good for the voters for them to go someplace where there’s more time and less of a race to hit whatever their PR team has come up with.\" While Meyers argued that podcasts don’t necessarily infringe on the type of comedy he does, he noted that they do have one key advantage. \"If there’s anything that podcasts have affected, it’s that you realize that when you’re talking to somebody for eight minutes, it’s very unlikely you’re going to get deeper than a podcast host does with them over the course of an hour and a half,\" he said. He contrasted this with television interviews, where \"You want to move quickly and be funny, because it has to be a different thing than a long-form podcast interview.\" BIDEN SHRUGS OFF AGE CONCERNS DURING FRIENDLY SETH MEYERS CHAT: 'IT'S ABOUT HOW OLD YOUR IDEAS ARE' CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The interviewer noted a prediction from veteran talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that there might not be late-night hosts in 10 years, and Meyers said it may indeed turn out to be true. \"Unless some major sea change happens, I don’t think there’s going to be a whole new wave of network hosts, in the way there always has been,\" Meyers said. \"Nobody understands this business and this format better than Jimmy Kimmel, so when he talks about it, I tend to share his opinion.\" He added further that podcasts continue to be as big as ever, because people are simply going to adapt to the best technological format that carries their message. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Interesting voices are always going to use the technologies they have at hand to find an audience. So, if you’re a great lover of the institution of late-night talk shows, there’s probably some sadness in your future,\" he said. \"But if you love funny people telling funny jokes and talking to people in interesting ways, that’s always going to be available.\"","summary":"Seth Meyers suggested talk shows have &quot;weaned&quot; off of using politicians as guests, suggesting podcasts offer better platforms for political discourse than TV interviews.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/seth-meyers-explains-why-his-late-night-show-has-weaned-ourselves-off-politicians","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/931/523/seth-meyers-gg-ap.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 23:14:01","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":332854710,"title":"Supreme Court ruling on trans treatments for minors decried by media as 'huge setback for transgender rights'","text":"The legacy media was united in its disapproval of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling upholding Tennessee's ban on transgender medical treatment for minors. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court struck down a challenge to a Tennessee law restricting access to puberty blockers and hormone treatment to children who identify as the opposite sex. Several news organizations framed the ruling negatively and implied it was a \"setback for transgender rights\" for all ages, despite the decision affecting only minors. The result was also described as a \"major blow,\" a \"devastating loss,\" and a \"stunning setback.\" SCOTUS RULES ON STATE BAN ON GENDER TRANSITION ‘TREATMENTS’ FOR MINORS IN LANDMARK CASE \"BREAKING: The Supreme Court upholds a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors in a huge setback for transgender rights,\" the Associated Press reported on X Wednesday. \"BREAKING: Supreme Court upholds a Tennessee law restricting gender transition care for minors, delivering a major blow to transgender rights,\" NBC News similarly posted. \"The US Supreme Court backed a Republican-backed ban in Tennessee on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, in a setback for transgender rights that could bolster efforts by states to defend other measures targeting transgender people,\" Reuters wrote. \"The Supreme Court upheld Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a stunning setback to transgender rights,\" The Boston Globe also posted. While the Tennessee law was passed in 2023 and Supreme Court oral arguments were heard in December, some news outlets tied the ruling negatively to President Donald Trump's policies. Newsweek warned in its headline that the ruling was a \"major setback for transgender rights,\" telling readers the decision \"effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump's Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people.\" The Washington Post described the 6-3 ruling as a \"divided Supreme Court\" and called the broader trans debate \"a polarizing national issue the Trump administration has seized on in initiatives targeting transgender rights.\" NPR said the decision \"plunged the Supreme Court into yet another culture war feud.\" SCHUMER RIPS SUPREME COURT DECISION UPHOLDING STATE BAN ON TRANSGENDER TREATMENT FOR MINORS: ‘AWFUL’ The New York Times attempted to equate the ruling on trans-identifying minors to the Supreme Court's 2020 decision giving gay and transgender adults civil rights protections from employers under Title VII. \"The decision, which came amid the Trump administration’s fierce assaults on transgender rights, was a bitter setback for their proponents, who only five years ago celebrated a decision by the court to protect transgender people from workplace discrimination,\" the Times wrote. CNN went even further, decrying the ruling coming at a \"critical time\" for the transgender community. \"The 6-3 decision by a conservative majority is a major blow to the transgender community and its advocates at a critical time,\" CNN wrote. \"Since 2020, Republican-led states around the country have passed a wave of laws regulating the lives of trans Americans, with a particular focus on minors.\" \"And President Donald Trump, who ran for reelection in part on ending the ‘transgender lunacy,’ has taken several steps intended to roll back gains made by that community,\" CNN continued. The Guardian called the ruling \"a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for dozens of other lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS CNN political director David Chalian said Republicans will use the ongoing transgender debate ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, but stressed there will be a \"real human impact\" on American families. \"We're going to learn what the human impact is of this court decision among families across the country, but in the politics of it, I think the two things to watch are how Republicans will sort of hit the gas on this issue, what they believe is a winning culture war issue for them, and watch how Democrats, especially those considering a 2028 presidential campaign, respond to this court ruling. Have they learned to message around this issue in a way that's more politically palatable than what Kamala Harris was able to do back in 24,\" Chalian said on the channel. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An MSNBC panel sounded the alarm about the \"slippery slope\" that could put transgender kids at risk as a result of the ruling. \"Any transgender minor is now at risk because states are copycats. They see now that Tennessee has been successful, and so they're going to implement laws that copy the language here,\" MSNBC legal analyst Barbara McQuade said. \"So I think if you are a family today with a transgender child, your child is likely at risk if you live in a state that is hostile to transgender Americans.\"","summary":"Several news organizations pushed the narrative that the Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee&apos;s ban on trans treatment for minors was a &quot;huge setback&quot; for transgender rights.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/supreme-court-ruling-trans-treatments-minors-decried-media-huge-setback-transgender-rights","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/activist-holds-trans-flag.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 22:23:25","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":332852326,"title":"Fox News Poll: Economic pessimism abates slightly as voters reflect on the economy","text":"Voters are feeling a bit better about the economy, yet overall sentiment remains negative. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, positive ratings of the economy have inched up from 21% in March to 28% in April to 31% in the latest Fox News survey, which is about where things stood at the end of the Biden administration in January. During the previous four years, that number was higher than the current rating only once, when it hit 32% in June 2024. For reference, at the end of the first Trump administration, 33% gave economic conditions positive marks (December 2020), but that had been as high as 55% in January 2020 (just before the pandemic). Currently, 62% say their family is getting ahead (14%) or holding steady financially (48%), up 5 points since January. The 36% who say they are falling behind is the lowest in four years. FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM Still, economic sentiment is mostly gloomy: 84% are extremely or very concerned about inflation, 68% score conditions as only fair or poor, and 55% feel pessimistic about the economy. Democrats, Independents, women, and voters without a college degree are among those most likely to say the economy is in bad shape, while Republicans, men, and college graduates are among those most likely to rate it better. FOX NEWS POLL: DEMOCRATS' FAVORABILITY HITS NEW LOW, STILL FAVORED OVER GOP IN 2026 MIDTERMS \"During the Biden years, Republicans and independents were overwhelmingly negative about the economy, while Democrats were slightly less so,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"Now with Trump as president, Democrats think the sky is falling, while Republicans see rays of sunlight.\" By a 21-point margin, voters oppose the federal budget legislation passed by the House of Representatives that the president calls the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" (38% favor vs. 59% oppose). About half think the bill would hurt their family (49%), while one quarter think it would help (23%), and another quarter don’t think it would make a difference (26%). Sixty percent feel they have a good understanding of what is in the OBBB, and while those voters are more likely to favor the legislation than those who are unfamiliar with it, more still think it will hurt rather than help their family (45% vs. 34%). Views of the legislation are highly partisan, with Republicans favoring it (73%), and Democrats (89%) and Independents (73%) opposed. Fewer than half of Republicans think it will help their family (46%). Overall, 57% think tariffs hurt the economy, the highest ever recorded in Fox News surveys -- and double the number who think tariffs help. While a majority (53%) approve of Trump’s handling of border security (46% disapprove), the president otherwise receives negative marks on the issues: immigration (46% approve, 53% disapprove), and foreign policy (42-57%). His worst ratings are on the economy (40-58%) and inflation (34-64%), where he’s underwater by a whopping 30 points. The president’s overall job approval stands at 46%, while 54% disapprove. That’s up a couple ticks from 44-55% in April. His highest approval, 49%, came in March 2025 and April 2020. Men under age 45 (55% approve) and White men without a college degree (54% approve) are among those giving the president his best marks. Seven in 10 Republicans consider themselves part of the MAGA movement, and fully 98% of them approve. About 90% of Democrats disapprove of the job Trump is doing generally and on specific issues, with the exception of border security, where fewer disapprove (80%). Most Republicans are with Trump, but approval drops to 68% on inflation and 75% on the economy, generally. Disapproval among Independents ranges from roughly half on border security to three-quarters on inflation. When voters are asked how they feel about Trump as a person, his ratings are underwater by 10 points: 45% have a favorable opinion and 55% an unfavorable view. For comparison, that’s about on par with JD Vance (44- 53%), Joe Biden (43-56%), and Marco Rubio (42-46%), and ahead of Elon Musk (41-58%), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (40-45%), Gavin Newsom (39-45%), and Pete Hegseth (32-45%), while his ratings trail those of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (48-50%) and Kamala Harris (49-51%). Harris’s higher favorability comes from more Democrats (87%) and Independents (38%) viewing her positively compared to favorable views of Trump among Republicans (85%) and Independents (34%). None of those tested – not the president, not the vice president and not the former president nor the former vice president -- garnered positive marks from at least 50% of voters, although Harris comes closest. As mentioned above, most are concerned about inflation (84%), including 78% of Republicans. By a single point, the future of the U.S. narrowly tops inflation as voters’ top concern, with 85% saying they’re worried about the direction of the country. That includes 8 in 10 Republicans, and 9 in 10 Democrats and Independents. Eight in 10 voters are concerned about government spending and Iran getting a nuclear weapon, while around 7 in 10 are worried about antisemitism, illegal immigration, and the use of the U.S. military domestically, and roughly 6 in 10 about protests in U.S. cities. More Democrats (87%) and Independents (71%) express concern about the deployment of federal troops in cities in response to anti-ICE protests than Republicans (42%). On the other hand, more Republicans (84%) are worried about illegal immigration than Independents (68%) and Democrats (49%). There are zero issues that all three groups, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, agree on as priorities. The top three concerns for Democrats are the future of the U.S., inflation, and U.S. troops being deployed, while for Republicans, it’s illegal immigration, Iran getting nukes, and government spending. Among Independents, it’s the future of the country, inflation, and government spending. CLICK HERE FOR CROSSTABS AND TOPLINE Conducted June 13-16, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,003 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (149) and cellphones (566) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (288). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error for results among subgroups is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data.

The latest Fox survey, released Wednesday as President Donald Trump urged for Iran’s \"unconditional surrender,\" also finds voters split on Israel’s decision to launch military strikes against Iran’s nuclear programs – nearly half (49%) approve of the strikes while slightly fewer (46%) disapprove. Republicans (73% approve) are more than twice as likely as Democrats (32%) and Independents (32%) to approve of the strikes. FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM Voters have contradictory concerns. On the one hand, voters are pessimistic about how the air strikes will affect security. Most think the attacks against Iran will make the world a more dangerous place (59%) rather than safer (36%). About three-quarters of Democrats (74%) and Independents (77%) agree the strikes will increase peril, as do nearly 4 in 10 Republicans (36%). On the other hand, voters are worried about Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Almost 8 in 10 say they are also extremely or very concerned about Iran’s nuclear program (78%) up from 66% in April and matching the high in September 2010. The increase comes from demographics across the board. FOX NEWS POLL: DEMOCRATS' FAVORABILITY HITS NEW LOW, STILL FAVORED OVER GOP IN 2026 MIDTERMS While concern is palpable, voters see other issues as more pressing. When presented with a list of eight issues, Iran’s nuclear program falls in the middle. The future of the U.S. (85% extremely or very concerned), inflation (84%), and government spending (80%) rank higher while antisemitism (69%), illegal immigration (67%), the use of U.S. military troops domestically (66%), and protests in U.S. cities (63%) rank lower than concerns about Iran. While roughly 8 in 10 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are concerned about Iran getting a nuke, it only ranks in the top three concerns for Republicans. Overall, 8 in 10 think what happens in the Middle East matters a great deal or some to life in the U.S. (81%) while more than half support financial aid to the Israelis for their military (53%), a 3-point increase since March, but down from a high of 60% in November 2023, shortly after the October 7 Hamas attacks. Since November 2023, Democrats (-14 points) and Independents (-11) are less likely to support sending money to the Israelis while Republicans (+4 points) solidified their support. \"Even though most think the stakes are high, there is a reticence to get involved in the Middle East,\" says Shaw. \"The public isn’t blind to history and history teaches us that those who get directly involved in these conflicts do so at their peril.\" Trump left the G7 summit early on Monday along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing the ongoing and intensifying situation in the Middle East as the reason. Trump’s approval rating on foreign policy has held relatively steady since April: 42% approve vs. 57% disapprove for a net negative rating of -15, it was -14 last month. He fares better on border security (53% approve, 46% disapprove) and immigration (46%, 53%) while he does worse on the economy (40%, 58%) and inflation (34%, 64%). Overall, 46% approve of his job performance as president, while 54% disapprove. Trump’s personal favorable rating held steady at 45%, compared to those in his administration. Trump’s personal favorable rating held steady at 45%. Compared to those in his administration, Trump’s about even with Vice President JD Vance (44% favorable) and performs better than Rubio (42%), Elon Musk (41%), and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (32%). Robert F. Kennedy Jr. does the best with a 48% favorable rating. For comparison, the favorable ratings among Democratic Party leaders were in the same ballpark: Kamala Harris (49% favorable), Joe Biden (43%), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (40%), and Gavin Newsom (39%). Everyone tested was viewed more negatively than positively, although by only 2 points for both Harris and RFK Jr. The Russia-Ukraine conflict The continuing war between Russia and Ukraine takes a backseat to the conflict in the Middle East, with 72% saying the war matters a great deal to life in the U.S. compared to 81% who say the same about what is happening in the Middle East. Those saying the Russia-Ukraine war matters are down from 81% in October 2023 (when the question was last asked) and a high of 85% in March 2022 (at the start of the war). Even so, 56% of voters support sending money to Ukraine to help fight Russia. That number has held steady at between 54 and 63% for the last three years. Big picture, majorities favor sending financial aid to the Ukrainians (56%) and the Israelis (53%) to fight their respective wars, with partisanship driving support in the different theaters. Seventy percent of Democrats support funding Ukraine compared to just 46% of Republicans, while 71% of Republicans favor sending aid to Israel compared to just 43% of Democrats.

Influence: What does it mean to be influential in 2025?","text":"If you ask an AI image generator to create a picture of a typical influencer, it spews out pretty much what you would expect.\n\nThe young woman’s hair is glossy, her smile is big and her cleavage considerable. She is grinning into her phone.\n\nTweak that to request an image of a typical influential person and you get a picture of a middle-aged man in a suit and glasses, with a haircut that would not look out of place in the 1950s.\n\nThis two-minute experiment proves nothing except that artificial intelligence is still struggling to understand what influence really means in an age of influencers — just like the rest of us.\n\nThe concept of influence goes back to the ancient Greeks and is more nuanced than “the ability to get others to do what you want by making them want to do it”, which was the premise at the heart of Dale Carnegie’s seminal self-help book on the topic.\n\nA glance at Time Magazine’s 2025 most influential list tells some of the story: from US President Donald Trump to journalist and podcaster Megyn Kelly and Australia’s own Andrew Forrest, to be influential is to shape the lives, beliefs, conversations and, sometimes, the spending habits of others.\n\nThis influence-themed edition of The Nightly On has sought out those at the top of their game across politics, sport, business and entertainment; from the head of the Australian Olympic Committee Mark Arbib, who will shape Australia’s hopes ahead of Brisbane 2032; to Kyle Sandilands, the outspoken radio host who has ruled Sydney’s airwaves for decades; and newly re-elected Minister Katy Gallagher, who will use her dual portfolios of finance and women to put financial abuse loopholes in her crosshairs in 2025.\n\nIt also dives into the world of online influencers and how they have made a business out of being influential.\n\nBehavioural change expert and Monash University professor Liam Smith says most people want to be thought of as influential — for good reason.\n\n“There’s a natural inclination in many people to want to be influential because of deep-seated psychological and evolutionary drives,” Smith says.\n\n“From an evolutionary perspective, those who were influential probably had better access to food, water (and) shelter.\n\n“Psychologically people are social beings, meaning we seek status, recognition and belonging.”\n\nIn other words: “It’s human nature to want the approval of peers.”\n\nThe desire to be influential may be timeless, but the question of who gets to have influence and how it is wielded has changed.\n\nFor as long as political leaders, corporate bosses, the media and religious rulers have existed, they have had influence. Their decisions have real-world consequences: they can move stock markets, kill or create jobs and shape society’s values.\n\nBut the erosion of public trust in institutions, from political parties to the Church, and the rise of social media has paved the way for a new of breed of influencers.\n\nIn the US the “Joe Rogan effect” is such that Trump’s appearance on the popular podcaster’s show — and Rogan’s subsequent endorsement of Trump — was seen as a turning point that helped clinch the young male vote. Presidential candidate Kamala Harris was so keen to appear on a popular rival podcast, Call Her Daddy, that her team reportedly spent a six-figure sum building its own version of the set.\n\nAustralia’s Federal election saw Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and then-Opposition leader Peter Dutton hit the podcasting circuit, with those appearances subsequently sliced and diced for TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.\n\nThere is logic to that: nearly half of all Australians, not just young people, now access at least some of their news on social media. The numbers are higher for gen Z and millennial voters, who collectively have overtaken baby boomers as the biggest voting bloc.\n\nSmith said “normative influences” — meaning individuals or groups whose opinions someone cares about — can be particularly influential to young people. So it makes sense for politicians to try to tap into this source of influence.\n\n“A hundred years ago, it would have been peers in the schoolyard or at work that they’d listen to,” he says. “In a hundred years time, there’ll be other normative influencers . . . maybe AI-generated robots — who knows?”\n\nThere is irony in the fact that the public figures who wield the most influence in the political, corporate and creative worlds would likely run very fast away from being labelled someone “of influence”.\n\nAcademic Jonathan Albright says even those who find the world of online influencers appealing — bypassing as it does traditional routes to power — could be uncomfortable with the label.\n\n“What we’re seeing in 2025 is a fundamental split in how influence operates,” says Albright, a senior lecturer at the University of Western Australia.\n\n“It’s now a dual-currency system where people must simultaneously appeal to human audiences and algorithmic systems. This creates the paradox ... everyone wants influence but many reject the ‘influencer’ label because that term invokes the machinery behind what’s supposed to feel authentic and organic.”\n\nCheek Media chief executive and Big Small Talk podcaster Hannah Ferguson is one popular Australian commentator pushing back on the extent to which the term influencer is applied to particularly women using online platforms.\n\n“The agenda is clear — to undermine our intelligence, to paint us as untrustworthy, and to conflate us with green juice and a discount code,” she told the National Press Club in May. “There is nothing wrong with being an influencer, but the label is intended to cause significant reputational damage. The impact is deeply misogynistic.”\n\nInterestingly Ferguson is now flagging a Senate run, chasing a different kind of influence.\n\nWhat we’re seeing in 2025 is a fundamental split in how influence operates. It’s now a dual-currency system where people must simultaneously appeal to human audiences and algorithmic systems.\n\nCatherine Archer is an expert in influencers at Edith Cowan University. She says while sources of influence may change over time there are still some constants, whether you are talking about Canberra, the boardroom or TikTok.\n\nPeople tend to be influenced by those based on three categories: competence, appearance or rank, she says.\n\nAnd regardless of the changing face of influence, a person’s character — or at least other people’s perception of it — remains as important as it ever was.\n\n“Influence is a very old concept, all the way back to the Aristotelian concept of ethos, pathos and logos,” she says. “And the ancient Greeks were on to something when they said a person’s character would affect their influence.”","summary":"Social media continues to redefine what influence looks like in the modern world.

Airlines are cutting ticket prices as travel from Europe to the U.S. is down, another rough sign for a U.S. travel industry that already faces a multibillion-dollar deficit.\n\nA crude awakening? As the conflict between Israel and Iran worsens, gas prices in the U.S. are rising incrementally, but a supply disruption could soon send costs soaring.\n\nBrains on the blockchain. Sam Altman claimed that Meta has offered OpenAI’s top talent $100 million signing bonuses to jump ship for Mark Zuckerberg’s AI ventures.\n\nOutlook: not great. Microsoft is planning to cut thousands more jobs (mostly in sales) to cut expenses as the company continues to spend heavily on AI investments.\n\nSupply chains of command\n\nDonald Trump has never been shy about calling his political rivals “communists,” “Marxists,” or — in Kamala Harris’ case — “Comrade Kamala.” But in office, Trump has governed less like Adam Smith and more like a populist in a capitalist costume.\n\nAccording to the president, he sets the prices. “I am this giant store,” he told Time, likening the U.S. economy to a retail empire under his control. “I own the store, and I set prices.” That philosophy has been more than metaphor: Trump has pressured companies such as Apple and Walmart not to pass on tariff costs to consumers, threatened automakers over offshoring, and handed farmers government bailouts to cushion his trade wars. He’s even dangled executive orders to rein in Big Pharma’s drug prices — a move that might make Bernie Sanders blush.\n\nBut the pièce de résistance? Last week, Trump unveiled a perpetual “golden share” in U.S. Steel as part of its sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel. The unprecedented move gives Trump veto power over key business decisions — how much steel is produced, whether jobs stay in the U.S., and more — long after the deal closes. “We have a golden stock… which I control,” he bragged.\n\nThat level of government control over a private company’s production, hiring, and future is rare in the U.S. — and not something typically championed by a self-described capitalist crusader. “This is, in a very elaborate way, nationalizing U.S. Steel,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum. “That’s a lot like being a Peronista from Argentina.”\n\nTrump’s economic doctrine isn’t socialism as Karl Marx imagined it, but it is a brand of economic interventionism more common in places like China and Brazil, where governments hold “golden shares” in strategic sectors. And while traditional socialism focuses on redistributing wealth downward, Trump’s policies — from tariffs to tax cuts — appear to have the opposite effect. Quartz’s Joseph Zeballos-Roig has more on Trump’s invisible hand — now with more micromanaging.\n\nGet rich or buy trying\n\nCongratulations to the Class of 2024: Over 1,000 Americans became millionaires every single day last year, per the just-released UBS Global Wealth Report. Fueled by a record-breaking stock market and the ever-rising tide of asset prices, global wealth rose 4.6% overall — but North America did the heavy lifting.\n\nThe U.S. alone saw an 11% gain in household wealth, powered by a 25% jump in the S&P and a Nasdaq rally that put 2021 to shame.\n\nThe fastest-growing cohort? “Everyday millionaires,” or EMILLIs — UBS’ shorthand for people with $1–$5 million in assets. There are now 52 million of them globally, up fourfold since 2000 and holding a collective $107 trillion. That’s nearly as much as the entire ultra-rich club (those with over $5 million), who collectively hold $119 trillion.\n\nEven the billionaire club bulked up slightly, with UBS counting just under 3,000 worldwide. But the real money movement is coming. The long-heralded “Great Wealth Transfer” — roughly $83 trillion in assets expected to change hands over the next two decades — has already begun, and it’s likely to shift financial power dynamics in a major way. One early winner: Women, who are set to inherit at greater rates due to longevity and double-dip inheritances (from spouses and parents).\n\nIt’s yet another reminder that income doesn’t equal wealth. In fact, many countries with higher average salaries rank surprisingly low in wealth, thanks to limited asset accumulation. The report suggests that wealth-building is less about a paycheck and more about what you inherit — or how early you bought into Apple.

The NYSE halted trading, pointing to a \"merger effective\" order.\n\n\"The companies have now completed the transaction as contemplated by their merger agreement,\" Nippon and U.S. Steel said in a joint press release. \"The companies have also entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. Government, and U.S. Steel will issue a Golden Share to the U.S. Government.\"\n\nNippon Steel has bought all common shares of U.S. Steel, completing the merger, a source close to the matter said Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick, a Republican, cheered the deal's closing, thanking Trump on X and calling the outcome \"a massive victory for working families in the Mon Valley, our economy, our national security, and America's manufacturing future!\"\n\nBut the United Steelworkers (USW) union, which vigorously fought the deal, vowed to \"continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments,\" according to a statement.\n\n\"And we will use the most powerful tool workers have against global corporations: collective bargaining.\"\n\nUnder the December 2023 transaction, Nippon agreed to pay $55 per share for U.S. Steel, an all-cash deal that included a 40 percent premium and pitched the combined company as the \"best steelmaker with world-leading capabilities.\"\n\nWhile the transaction included a pledge to maintain the name U.S. Steel and the company's Pittsburgh headquarters, industry watchers expected an exodus of U.S. Steel executives.\n\nBut after the deal sparked bitter opposition from the USW and a broad range of politicians, including then President Joe Biden and former Ohio Senator JD Vance -- now Trump's vice president -- Nippon stepped up its lobbying efforts in Washington and Pittsburgh to win support for a transaction that appeared for months to be on life support.\n\nIn early January, shortly before leaving office, Biden blocked the transaction, saying that placing \"one of America's largest steel producers under foreign control\" could \"create risk for our national security and our critical supply chains.\"\n\nBut backers of the deal had been hoping the shift in political climate following Trump's election victory over Biden's vice president Kamala Harris might revive the deal's prospect.\n\nBesides agreeing to keep U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh headquarters and to maintaining U.S. production, the revamped deal's national security agreement calls for a majority of U.S. Steel's board to be U.S. citizens and for key leaders, including the CEO, to be U.S. citizens.\n\nThe government's \"golden share\" will allow it the right to appoint one independent director and grant it consent rights for proposed capital budget cuts, the redomiciling of activities outside the United States and on acquisitions in the United States.\n\nThe \"golden share\" does not entitle the U.S. government to dividends, nor does it require Washington to make investments in the company.\n\nAtlantic Council senior fellow Sarah Bauerle Danzman said the deal is not a nationalization of U.S. Steel because the government will not be involved in day-to-day management and \"because the United States is not taking equity stakes away from owners.\"\n\nWhile the structure gives the government \"extraordinary\" influence, the mechanism could be difficult to enforce in a downturn if Nippon fails to comply, Danzman said.\n\n\"How would the U.S. government compel Nippon to increase investments to its promised amount?\" wrote Danzman, adding that Washington's enforcement options \"are relatively weak here, especially if Nippon finds itself in a fragile economic position.\"","summary":"Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel announced Wednesday they have completed a long-debated transaction granting the U.S. government a &quot;golden share&quot;

A striped area rug covered the floor near the dog’s cushy bed.\n\nIn the second clip, a life-sized sheep sculpture stood watch near the sliding glass doors as the real sheep made their way back outside.\n\n“We have house sheep,” DeGeneres, 67, wrote atop the video. \n\n“Our sheep keep coming inside,” the comedian captioned the Instagram post. \n\n“To be fair, we do have a piece of furniture that looks like a sheep, but that one doesn’t try to eat our rugs.” \n\nFans were thrilled with the peek inside the couple’s home across the pond — though some wanted to see more of their luxury surroundings. \n\n“Love the house 😍,” commented a follower, while another wrote, “I need to see a full home tour please 👏😍.” \n\nOthers were enchanted by the appearance of the “house sheep.” \n\n“To be fair, they wanted a change of scenery,” remarked a follower in part, while yet another joked, “I don’t see the issue ❤️.” \n\nDeGeneres was previously spotted riding a lawnmower in England in May — presumably at the country estate — while showing off a rare glimpse of her brunette hair. \n\nShortly after the November 2024 election, de Rossi and DeGeneres were said to have been “very disillusioned.”\n\nInsiders told TMZ at the time that the couple opted to “get the hell out” of the US “immediately” following Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris.\n\nThe outlet reported they purchased the property — located in the Cotswolds in South West England — prior to the 2024 election. \n\nThough a report in November 2024 claimed the farmhouse had flooded, DeGeneres addressed the speculation on Instagram while observing her dating anniversary with de Rossi.\n\n“20 years ago today we began this relationship not realizing what a long beautiful adventure this would be,” she captioned a selfie of the couple enjoying the sweeping countryside. \n\n“You are the best thing that ever happened in my life. You take care of me. You help me see the good in everything. You help to guide me and pick me up when I feel off or down. You are a beautiful soul that I am so very grateful to have as a partner to navigate this crazy life with. My wife. My best friend. The love of my life. Thank you for being you and loving me.

If he wins the primary, he would be the favorite in the November general election and would be tasked with leading the nation's largest city. Cuomo has cast himself as a centrist focused on issues like public safety and affordability.Nixon, an actress known for roles such as Miranda Hobbes on Sex and the City and a progressive activist, challenged Cuomo in the 2018 gubernatorial primary race. Although her campaign garnered national attention and support from more progressive Democrats, she fell short against the then-incumbent at the polls. She discussed her gubernatorial run during the discussion with Newsweek.What to KnowNixon said she decided to run for governor because she felt \"no one else\" on the left was prepared to challenge him out of concerns of vindication. However, she felt she would be \"insulated from his attacks.\"\"I also thought, in a funny way, I don't have any real belief that I'm going to get elected. So it's not like I'm going to take a risk and fail,\" she said. \"It's like, 'I'm going to do my best, I'm going to try my hardest, but I don't have any real illusions I'm really going to topple him. But I'm able to do a lot of other things.'\"Her campaign brought attention to Democrats who were part of the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), a coalition of moderates who engaged in a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, she said. Cuomo faced criticism during his tenure for not doing more to break up the coalition, and he eventually worked to broker a deal to do so in 2018 amid Nixon's challenge.Nixon said she believes her campaign helped empower candidates who primaried those IDC members.\"I've been able to bring attention to these IDC candidates who were trying to unseat these Democrats, and we succeeded in unseating them, who are caucusing Republicans to the Republicans' control of New York State Senate. And you know, I can champion a whole host of this progressive legislation that has been bottled up because Andrew Cuomo doesn't want it to see the light of day, which is why he's empowering the Republicans to be in charge,\" she said.Nixon has supported Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. In the 2018 primary, Nixon received 34 percent of the vote, while Cuomo won nearly 65 percent support.Cynthia Nixon's Criticism of DemocratsNixon criticized Democrats during the discussion, raising concerns about their ties to corporate donors and weighing in on how the party can win back support from voters who shifted to the right in recent elections.The idea that Democrats are losing because they are too far left is \"nonsense,\" Nixon said.She said Democrats like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Vice President Kamala Harris, both of whom lost to Trump in their presidential bids, are \"so indebted to their donors that they're not actually allowed to offer real solutions to people.\" She pointed to universal health care and ending the use of fossil fuels to mitigate climate change as two issues where donors get in the way of potential solutions for Democrats.\"There are so many ways in which our Democrats are not able to offer real solutions that you would think are bread and butter Democratic Party solutions, because they are being sentenced by corporations and big donors,\" Nixon said. \"And so as a result, it's just very flat when they're offering, and it's not genuine.\"Trump, she said, is \"more genuinely himself,\" she said, adding it is \"such a strange thing to say.\"\"The Democrats keep saying we're the better people, we're kinder, we're gentler, we're more inclusive, but we're not really offering people something they can take home with them, take to the bank,\" she said. \"But the idea that we went too far left or something, that's, to me, that's nuts.\"What People Are SayingNixon also said: \"We have a price we lose when we try to go toward the center, because it's just flat and there's nothing there.\"Cuomo wrote in a post to X on Wednesday: \"I know how to make government work. I will bring effective, experienced leadership to City Hall.\"What Happens NextCuomo resigned from office in 2021 over a report from Attorney General Letitia James' office alleged that he sexually harassed multiple female employees and created a toxic working environment. Whether New York voters are willing to give him another chance will be determined in the Democratic primary next Tuesday. New York City remains a Democratic stronghold, so whoever wins the primary will have an advantage against a Republican and independent Mayor Eric Adams.","summary":"Nixon criticized Cuomo, who is eyeing a political comeback, during an Editorial Lunch discussion at Newsweek's Manhattan office.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/cynthia-nixon-andrew-cuomo-empowering-republicans-governor-2087591","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2666381/cynthia-nixon-speaks-newsweek-office.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 20:50:24","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":332843518,"title":"Trump Expresses Support for David Ellison Paramount Takeover: ‘He’ll Do a Great Job With It’","text":"As the Paramount-Skydance deal remains stuck in regulatory limbo with the FCC, President Donald Trump has expressed support for the $8 billion takeover by David Ellison. \n\nWhen asked by reporters on Wednesday whether he sees the agency’s review being resolved soon, Trump replied: “I hope so. Ellison’s great, he’ll do a great job with it.”\n\nThe deal, which Paramount executives have said would close in the first half of 2025, recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7. If the deal is not closed by the time that extension expires in July, it would automatically be pushed another 90 days into October. \n\nAfter that, if the deal is still not closed, the FCC blocks the merger or one of the parties involved breaches the terms of the agreement, then Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal.\n\nThe praise for David Ellison comes after he and Trump were recently spotted sitting near each other at a UFC event in Newark, New Jersey held earlier this month. \n\n Trump has also previously spoken amicably about his father and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who recently partnered with the administration on Stargate, a$500 billion AI infrastructure project. \n\nThe elder Ellison is providing $6 billion to finance the Skydance merger. Though he was initially set to have a 77.5% controlling stake in Paramount following the deal’s closing, the FCC application was subsequently amended to reflect that David would control 100% of the Ellison family’s voting interest.\n\nDespite the positive remarks for the younger Ellison, Trump is currently locked in a $20 billion legal battle with Paramount and CBS over an Oct. 7 “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, which he alleges was deceptively edited to make her look good.\n\n“What they did was they interviewed Kamala, her answer was horrendous, I would say election threatening,” he said on Wednesday. “They took the entire answer out, and they took another answer from another question and put it in. And they did that, I understand, a number of times … We caught ’em, and they are very embarrassed by it, and they are working on a settlement now.”\n\nTrump added “they’re all getting fired,” a reference to the departures of former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and former CBS News president Wendy McMahon. The pair, who have both previously expressed their disagreement with reaching a settlement with Trump, said during their departures that they were choosing to leave on their own volition after failure to agree on the path forward with the network. \n\nCBS News has maintained that Trump’s accusations of deceitful editing were false, explaining that the promo shown on “Face the Nation” used a longer section of Harris’ answer. It also turned over the transcript and camera footage from the interview to the FCC as part of the agency’s investigation into allegations of “news distortion.” In a March filing to dismiss the Trump suit, CBS called it “an affront to the First Amendment” and “without basis in law or fact.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently shot down Paramount’s offer to settle the lawsuit for $15 million, with the president aiming to get at least $25 million and an apology.\n\nParamount’s settlement talks come as Disney previously paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Margins of error among registered voters vary by state, from as high as +/-6 percentage points in Wyoming to +/-1 point in more populous states like California.While Trump's positive net approval rating nationally remains slightly to his advantage, he's now viewed in a positive light in just three of his seven successful swing states that helped cement his second term: Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.Voter sentiment could lend itself towards pivotal gubernatorial races this year, as well as midterm elections in 2026.Trump's approval ratings are underwater in Virginia, currently governed by Republican Glenn Youngkin, where 46 percent of voters approve of the president's job—down one percentage point since last month—and 52 percent disapprove.Trump's popularity or lack thereof has remained stagnant in New Jersey, where 44 percent express approval and 53 percent disapprove. Republican Jack Ciattarelli is attempting to flip the state red, facing off against Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill in the Garden State's gubernatorial race.Looking ahead to next year's races that could sway control in Congress, Trump's disapproval rating in Maine—home to Republican Senator Susan Collins—dipped two more percentage points since May, now sitting at 59 percent.The states that approve and disapprove of Trump are Wyoming and Vermont, respectively, where 69 percent of voters approve and 64 percent of voters disapprove.Trump has touted other surveys in his favor, including a new Insider Advantage poll conducted on June 15-16 among 1,000 likely voters, which put his approval rating at 54 percent, with 44 percent disapproving, giving him a net approval rating of +10 points.\"Great Poll Numbers For Trump!\" the president wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.What Happens NextDomestic economics and war overseas could likely cause voter sentiment to fluctuate either in Trump's favor or against him.","summary":"Trump is now viewed in a positive light in just three of seven swing states that helped him get reelected.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-poll-approval-ratings-republicans-2087564","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2666366/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 20:37:35","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":332828164,"title":"Bruce Springsteen Calls President Trump a ‘Moron,’ Says We Are Living Through an ‘American Tragedy’","text":"Bruce Springsteen isn’t backing down when it comes to his thoughts on President Donald Trump.\n\n In a wide-reaching interview with The New York Times published Wednesday (June 18), the rock star criticized everything from the politician’s leadership to his effect on the social fabric of the United States. Springsteen is currently on his Land of Hope & Dreams Tour, on which he performs a setlist every night that he says “addresses our current situation” under Trump’s administration.\n\n And how would Springsteen describe the current situation? “It’s an American tragedy,” he told the publication. “I think that it was the combination of the deindustrialization of the country and then the incredible increase in wealth disparity that left so many people behind. It was ripe for a demagogue. And while I can’t believe it was this moron that came along, he fit the bill for some people.”\n\n Reflecting on Trump’s first few months in office since winning a second term, Springsteen added that “what we’ve been living through in the last 70 days is things that we all said, ‘This can’t happen here. This will never happen in America.’ And here we are.”\n\n The Boss has long been vocal in his opposition to Trump, endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and telling The Atlantic four years prior that the twice-impeached POTUS was a “threat to our democracy.” Trump, however, hit back at Springsteen a few weeks ago after the rocker slammed his administration as “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” during a May concert in Manchester, England. \n\n “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social shortly after the show. “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK … This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.”\n\n The insults didn’t phase Springsteen, who has since continued to voice his dismay with the current state of affairs in his home country on stage. In late May, he released an EP featuring a recording of the speech that ticked Trump off. \n\n And in his NYT interview, the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer didn’t shy away from criticizing Trump’s immigration policies, which in recent weeks have manifested in widely criticized ICE raids in places like Los Angeles. “There’s a large migrant population that lives and has altered Freehold in a very vibrant way,” Springsteen said of his hometown in New Jersey.\n\n “There are communities all across America now that have taken in immigrants and migrant workers,” Springsteen continued. “So what’s going on at the moment to me is disgusting, and a terrible tragedy.”\n\n Despite everything, though, the musician says he still has a lot of hope for the future of the country he’s spent his career writing about in his songs. Why? “Because we have a long democratic history,” Springsteen said. “We don’t have an autocratic history as a nation. It’s fundamentally democratic, and I believe that at some point that’s going to rear its head and things will swing back.” \n\n He added, “Let’s knock on wood.”","summary":"The Boss also slammed the POTUS' \"disgusting\" immigration policies.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bruce-springsteen-president-trump-moron-american-tragedy-1236002745/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bruce-Springsteen-france-may-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 19:50:40","author":"Hannah Dailey","authors":["Hannah Dailey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.045},{"id":332830392,"title":"Kamala Harris won U.S elections 2024: U.S Attorney General Pam Bondi asked to investigate results","text":"Kamala Harris' election results are currently capturing attention amid claims of discrepancies in Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential victory.

One of his promises was clear, consistent, and unmistakable: to put “America First” by ending our involvement in risky and expensive overseas conflicts. Yet Trump’s recent support for Israel’s escalating attacks on Iran—and his intimations that the United States may become directly involved in the conflict—suggests that he is well on the way to betraying his anti-war mandate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly pitched himself as a peace candidate during his political career. In 2016, he ran to Hillary Clinton’s left on foreign policy, arguing that she was “trigger happy” and that foreign adventurism “has produced only turmoil and suffering and death.” Trump returned to this message in his most recent race. He came out of the gate at his first campaign stops in 2023 by promising to restore peace after, he claimed, then-President Joe Biden had brought the world “to the brink of World War III.” When Kamala Harris took up the mantle for the Democrats, Trump warned his rallygoers that, if she was elected, their “sons and daughters will end up getting drafted to go fight for a war in a country that you’ve never heard of.”\n\nHis claims were dubious and hyperbolic, but in both of his successful campaigns, Trump correctly recognized what many pundits, politicians, and liberals failed to see: The Democratic Party establishment’s foreign-policy positions are out of step with the views of most Americans. A Pew Research survey released in April found that a majority of Americans (53 percent) do not believe that the U.S. has a responsibility to help Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. According to a March poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, strong majorities of Americans say they want a cease-fire in both the Ukraine-Russia (61 percent) and Israel-Palestine conflicts (59 percent); a May poll by the University of Maryland found that an even stronger majority of Americans prefers negotiation with Iran (69 percent) over striking its nuclear facilities (14 percent).\n\nBiden’s presidency was historically unpopular for any number of reasons, but an important one was his focus on wars in Europe and the Middle East while issues such as immigration and inflation roiled the country. Although Trump’s bombs-away militarism during his first term was far from dovish, one of his few unambiguously positive accomplishments was that he managed to avoid entangling American troops in any new large-scale conflicts. His anti-war rhetoric and no-big-wars track record, combined with Harris’s refusal to break with Biden on foreign policy, her embracing of endorsements from the Iraq War–associated Cheneys, and her identification of Iran (rather than Russia or China) as the United States’ greatest adversary, seem to have led many Americans to view Trump as the candidate more likely to pursue peace. By clear margins, voters trusted Trump over Harris to handle foreign conflicts. Were he to turn around and now involve the country in just the sort of war he’s spent years decrying, he would join his predecessor in allowing international imbroglios to derail the domestic agenda that he was elected, for better or worse, to enact.\n\nThe Trump administration is sending mixed signals about its plans. Although the president has suggested that the United States may get involved in the clash between Israel and Iran, other officials quietly insist the U.S. won’t become an active participant unless Iran targets Americans. As for Israel’s claims that Iran is months away from creating a nuclear weapon—claims that Israeli officials have repeated since the early 2000s—the U.S. intelligence community, including Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, dispute that these plans are under way. The president appears unmoved, telling reporters, “I don’t care” what Gabbard said about Iran’s nuclear program. “I think they were very close to having one,” Trump insisted.\n\nAmericans have rejected the path to war at the ballot box again and again in the past decade and a half, ever since Barack Obama burst onto the campaign trail in 2007 with a speech in which he called the Second Gulf War “a tragic mistake” and invoked “the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.” Trump has innumerable faults, many of them disqualifying, but he has also grasped better than many politicians that the American people are exhausted by decades of pro-war, world-policing foreign policy. Trump promised something different, something voters very much wanted: a focus on issues at home rather than conflicts abroad that might drag the United States into another disastrous war.","summary":"Getting the U.S. involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran would cut against one of his most consistent campaign promises.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/06/trump-iran-israel-antiwar/683221/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HOECF-y07aId85S6tRoFL-E3NXs=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/06/2025_06_18_trump_israel_iran/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 19:38:00","author":"Tyler Austin Harper","authors":["Tyler Austin Harper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":332855588,"title":"Trump endorses Paramount merger with David Ellison's Skydance","text":"President Trump has endorsed David Ellison's takeover of Paramount Global — an $8-billion merger that has been complicated by his $20-billion lawsuit over CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" On Wednesday, Trump was asked about the hold-up in the federal review of Skydance's takeover of the storied entertainment company. The question came as reporters clustered around the president on the White House lawn to watch the installation of a flagpole. The Paramount-Skydance deal has been pending at the Federal Communications Commission since late last fall. Trump said he hoped the deal goes through. \"Ellison is great. He'll do a great job with it,\" Trump said. Then he appeared to connect the merger-review delay to his lawsuit against CBS and its parent Paramount over last fall's \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has maintained since last October that the Harris interview was edited to burnish her chances in the November election. CBS has denied the allegations, saying the edits were routine. The raw footage showed Harris was accurately quoted, but Trump's team said he suffered \"mental anguish\" from the broadcast. \"They interviewed Kamala. Her answer was horrendous,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"I would say election-threatening. ... Her answer was election-threatening it was so incompetent.\" 1st Amendment experts have called Trump's case frivolous, but Paramount wants to avoid waging an extensive legal fight. Paramount's leaders have pursued a settlement to help clear a path for the company's sale to Skydance — a deal that needs the approval of the FCC. The mediation process to resolve the lawsuit, filed in a Texas court, has become protracted. \"They're working on a settlement,\" Trump said Wednesday. He mentioned that two high-level CBS executives — the head of CBS News and the executive producer of \"60 Minutes\" — had abruptly departed as the merger review dragged on. \"They're all getting fired,\" he said. Late last week, Trump's legal team filed court documents asking for a deadline extension in the discovery process, disclosing the two sides were working to reach a resolution. Earlier this month, Ellison met Trump briefly while the two men were sitting ringside at a UFC fight in New Jersey, according to video footage shared online. Skydance declined to discuss Ellison's interaction with Trump. It marked the second time this year that Ellison chatted with the president at a UFC match. The first was in April. It's been nearly a year since Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and fellow Paramount directors approved the two-phased $8-billion deal that will hand the company to the son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison, who is a Trump supporter. The deal will also see the Ellison family buy the Redstone investment vehicle, National Amusements Inc. Santa Monica-based Skydance intends to consolidate the company that boasts the Melrose Avenue Paramount film studio, Paramount+ streaming service, CBS and cable channels including Comedy Central, Showtime and BET. Skydance operations and personnel will be folded into Paramount. The deal faces one final regulatory hurdle: FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's consent to transfer 29 CBS television station licenses to the Ellisons from the Redstones. This week, the Senate approved Trump's second Republican appointment to the panel, Olivia Trusty.","summary":"\"Ellison is great.

In a one-week period at the beginning of June, Republican Nathan Simington and Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starks both resigned from the FCC. Trusty was previously a staffer for Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS). \n\nRepublican Chair Brendan Carr has driven an unprecedented shift in telecommunications policy in his six months leading the FCC. Since 1996, the commission has generally advanced the goal of faster and cheaper technology through competition. Carr has taken a decidedly more political approach, using the FCC to punish Trump's enemies and reward his friends.\n\nCarr has opened an investigation into CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, threatened Comcast’s broadcast licenses over MSNBC’s political coverage and pressured Verizon’s DEI policies in order to gain approval for its acquisition of Frontier. \n\n“In normal times, there’d be little reason to oppose the confirmation of a candidate as qualified as Trusty. But these are not normal times,” said Matt Wood, VP of policy and general counsel of the nonpartisan Free Press Action, in a statement. \n\n“Trusty’s confirmation gives Carr the majority he needs to radically reshape the media sector in Trump’s image, including offering policy favors to large broadcasters in exchange for their unwavering loyalty to the president.”\n\nThe biggest immediate question is whether Trusty will vote with Carr on these issues or like a more traditional Republican commissioner. \n\n“I think she is a reliable vote for Carr on most issues, but not all issues,” Blair Levin, a former FCC chief of staff and a telecom industry analyst at New Street Research, told CNET. \n\nTrump has not yet selected two other nominees to fill the FCC’s two vacant seats, and there’s no sign that he will anytime soon. FCC rules state that only three commissioners can be of the same political party at any given time.\n\n“I think those two seats stay vacant for a very long time,” Levin said. “I don't see why Trump wants to use any political capital or Senate time -- certainly not before the budget bill passes.

The implication was that Trump would embarrass himself and that Stewart would have his punchlines easily written for him.\n\nStewart stepped down as the host of The Daily Show in August 2015 and wasn’t on the air when Trump toppled Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. His former colleague, Stephen Colbert, was, however. As Trump was declared the victor during a Showtime election night special that was supposed to be a celebration of Clinton’s victory, the comedian was visibly shaken.\n\n“How did our politics get so poisonous?” Colbert asked without a hint of self-awareness. Over the next four years, he claimed that Russia hacked the election for Trump.\n\n“Can we stipulate for the purposes of this conversation that Donald Trump will never be president of the United States?” well-known plagiarist Mike Barnicle asked on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on June 17, 2015. “We just showed his lethal danger to the Republican Party.”\n\n“Lethal danger to the Republican Party.” Trump led in many polls over the then-prohibitive favorite Jeb Bush less than one month after Barnicle’s comment.\n\n“Is Trump running to spite the reporters who mocked him as a bluffer? To use his political fame to trade up for his next wife? Does Trump actually believe he can become president of the United States?” New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait asked in an August 2015 piece subtly titled, “Donald Trump is going to lose because he’s crazy.”\n\nChait has never been very good on the prediction front. He supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and called 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign “brilliant” before Election Day.\n\n“Donald Trump will not be the 45th president of the United States,” James Fallows wrote in July 2015 in the Atlantic. “Nor the 46th, nor any other number you might name. The chance of his winning nomination and election is exactly zero.”\n\nAnd in one of the least surprising things you’ll read, Fallows worked in President Jimmy Carter’s administration as chief speechwriter before becoming a “journalist.”\n\n“I do not hate Donald Trump, but I do not take him seriously. … Everything that was garish and ridiculous about him was fully on display,” John Heileman said in Bloomberg in June 2015. “Will it get him anywhere close to becoming the nominee or the President of the United States? I think not.”\n\nHeileman signed with MSNBC during the Trump presidency to allow himself to become more unhinged, ironically calling Trump “unhinged, manic, unnerving, demented and deranged.”\n\n“Trump has a better chance of cameoing in another ‘Home Alone’ movie with Macaulay Culkin — or playing in the NBA Finals — than winning the Republican nomination,” pollster Harry Enten snarked for FiveThirtyEight at the time.\n\nTrump captured the nomination easily before winning the presidency. Enten signed with CNN. \n\nIn our fourth spot, no horribly wrong predictions column would be complete without hearing from “conservative” Bill Kristol. \n\nBill Kristol, Aug. 22, 2015: “Prediction: Biden will announce on September 7 after marching with cheering crowds in the annual Wilmington AFL-CIO Labor Day parade.”\n\nBill Kristol, Twitter, Oct. 5, 2015: “Isn’t the best window for @JoeBiden between the Dem debate (Oct 13) and Hillary’s Benghazi testimony (Oct 22)? I’m saying Biden announces Oct 19.”\n\nBill Kristol, Twitter, Oct. 16, 2015: “I continue to think Biden will run–and that he can beat Hillary.”\n\nBill Kristol, Twitter, Oct. 20, 2015: “Biden confirms to Obama at lunch today he’s running, announces at U Delaware tomorrow. You can feel the Joementum!”\n\nBiden never ended up running despite Kristol’s reporting that he would announce on Oct. 21, 2015. And Kristol has been wrong about basically everything ever since.\n\n“Donald Trump is not going to be the next president of the United States. This reporter is already on record pledging to eat a bag of rusty nails if the real estate tycoon with the high hair manages to snag the GOP nomination, much less takes down likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton next fall.”\n\nThat was the hot take from Ben White of CNBC, who never followed through on his promise to eat a bag of rusty nails after Trump won the nomination and vanquished Clinton.\n\nTrump is “a guy who knows he is going to lose. … I don’t know that he’s ever wanted to win. It’s sad. It’s sad and pathetic what’s going on out there.”\n\nYep. Before MSNBC’s Joe Scarbough insisted that Joe Biden was as sharp as ever in 2024 before his disastrous debate against Trump that June, he was not only predicting that Trump would lose to Clinton but that he wanted to lose despite giving up a nice life to run for president.\n\nScarborough left the Republican Party after Trump won.\n\n“Our emphatic prediction is simply that Trump will not win the nomination,” Nate Silver wrote in FiveThirtyEight on Aug. 11, 2015. “It’s not even clear that he’s trying to do so.”\n\nHere’s the thing about Silver: For whatever reason, and one of life’s great mysteries, Silver’s predictions are treated like gospel by some in the media. Why? Because he got the 2008 election right after Barack Obama defeated John McCain, which was a result that basically anyone sane and sober expected.\n\nWHEN PROPAGANDA STOPS WORKING\n\nSilver’s model for the general election going into Election Day had Clinton’s chances of winning at 71.4%. He also predicted that Harris would defeat Trump in the last election. At what point do we stop listening to this person?\n\nHard to believe it’s been 10 years since Trump burst onto the political scene. Nothing has been remotely the same since.

Responding to a question about his presidential ambitions, Newsom said, “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.”\n\nThat’s in keeping with the time-worn playbook for politicians who look in the mirror and see a president staring back. They shun naked ambition and portray themselves as reluctantly offering to serve the nation in its moment of crisis, whatever that might be.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Newsom, in an address broadcast live by CNN, warned that Trump’s sweeping campaign to arrest undocumented immigrants was such a crisis, saying “other states are next.”\n\n“This is about all of us. This is about you,” Newsom said. “It’s time for all of us to stand up.”\n\nNewsom uttered a similar theme in his Wall Street Journal interview. “I have a responsibility to combine passion with action, to stand tall and firm and defend the values that I hold dear, that I think the vast majority of Americans hold dear, and assert myself in this moral moment,” he said.\n\nTrump’s anti-immigrant drive is a political gift to Newsom, providing a springboard for him to fill a vacuum and claim leadership of the opposition to Trump. The Democratic Party has been unable, in the seven months since losing the White House, to curb its internal power struggles. Nor have political media anointed any of the potential candidates to succeed Trump as the frontrunner.\n\nIt would be fair to say that Newsom, who has been cultivating a national image ever since winning re-election in 2022, would probably start ahead of most would-be rivals for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhether he would finish ahead, and go on to win the presidency, is another matter. The road to the White House is long and winding, with plenty of opportunities to stumble — as the career of another Californian, Kamala Harris, attests.\n\nAssuming that Newsom’s hints mean he’s a candidate, in the final 18 months of his governorship he’ll be juggling a day job and a side gig, which is likely to diminish his standing in California, which is mediocre at best.\n\nA recent poll by UC-Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies found that by a 2-1 margin, California voters already believe Newsom is more focused on running for president than in fixing the state’s problems.\n\n“People kind of look at him as being very ambitious,” poll director Mark DiCamillo said about Newsom.\n\nA Newsom presidential campaign would be something of a referendum on California. Its serious social and economic problems, which have not markedly improved during Newsom’s governorship, would be campaign fodder for Democratic rivals and, if he were to win the nomination, for the Republican candidate.\n\nVideo clips of California cities’ squalid encampments of the homeless, the smash-and-grab robberies and the sometimes violent demonstrations against Trump’s immigration sweeps would bolster the sour image that those in other states already have of California. Elect Newsom, his rivals would say, if you want the nation to emulate California.\n\nBeing a Californian was one of the burdens Harris could not overcome last year. An ad featuring her advocacy of giving conversion surgery to transgender prison inmates was, it’s widely believed, the single most effective spot of the campaign.\n\nSaddle up.

Nestor’s hands were shaking after only a few minutes outside—at 3:30 in the afternoon, when it was still a relatively warm three degrees. Over the next two nights, the temperature would plunge to minus eleven and then to minus seventeen degrees. This would be no walk in the woods. But that was their plan. While other migrants at the Sunoco station were arranging rides to the official Canadian border crossing a half hour north on the highway, Nestor and José were ready to risk arrest, or worse, by hiking through backcountry in mid-January, just as the United States was about to tighten its net of immigration laws. \n\n“You can’t go,” I heard a bystander call out to them in the Sunoco parking lot. “You’ll die out there.”\n\nThere was every reason to think they would not make it, just like the Mexican woman who drowned, the two Senegalese men who froze, or the others whose tragic endings have made the local news in recent years.\n\nAs US president Donald Trump clamps down on America’s southern border and escalates his immigration crackdown into a campaign of threats and deportations, many asylum seekers are looking the other way—north, to Canada. Those who arrive in Plattsburgh on the last leg of their journey to the border will continue one of two ways: a taxi ride to the official border crossing, where legal restrictions make it difficult to enter the country, or the more dangerous route through frozen, forested terrain to sneak their way in, maybe with the services of a smuggler.\n\nThe Sunoco station, with its long, well-stocked aisles of snack food and six stools at the window, is as good a place as any to think things through, or to wait for the next bus back to New York. Both in their early twenties, Nestor and José (I am only using their first names) didn’t want to turn back. “We’re from Venezuela, but because of the violence and crime there, we got special refugee status in Colombia,” Nestor said, communicating through a mobile translation app. “But at the moment, that part of Colombia that we left is at war.”\n\nThey had thought they could enter Canada at Roxham Road, once known among international migrant routes as a kind of back door for refugee claimants, just nine kilometres from the official crossing at Lacolle, Quebec. Apparently, they didn’t know Roxham was closed by the Canadian government two years ago. Their Uber driver refused to let them in his car and drove off in a hurry.\n\nInside the Sunoco, another man who had arrived on the same bus offered to get involved. “I’ll take them up to the woods,” he said to me. “I’m just waiting for my friend to pick me up.” He was in possession of a tabletop-sized slot machine. “I’ll do it for a hundred bucks each.” \n\nIt was getting dark. The Venezuelans declined the ride and walked out the door.\n\n“We Don’t Have Any Water. We’re Lost”: In the Footsteps of Migrants Who Never Made It\nCitizen of Nowhere: The Complicated Limbo of Deepan Budlakoti\n“Guaranteed Jobs” That Don’t Exist: The Dark World of Immigration Consultants\n\nThe first time Trump took office, in 2017, he contributed to a surge in asylum seekers looking to come to Canada—over 50,000, the highest level in decades. And a large portion were from the US. Canada began preparing earlier this year for another surge after Trump’s return to office. In Quebec, space for a new processing centre has been leased near Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, where hundreds of asylum seekers have been presenting themselves in recent weeks. And to catch anyone trying to cross illegally in the woods—and to respond to the US president’s complaints about the southbound flow of migrants and illegal drugs—Mounties have deployed more officers, surveillance drones, heat sensors, stationary cameras, and two Black Hawk helicopters. \n\nThis was, after all, the busiest region for illegal crossings in both directions along the entire 8,891-kilometre border last year, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and US Customs and Border Protection. Plattsburgh, population 20,000, spills down from the suburban malls near the interstate, from the big Price Chopper grocery, the Walmart, the Splash Car Wash, the Five Guys, and nearly two dozen other fast-food outlets to an older downtown on the edge of Lake Champlain, where the sweeping views tell visitors exactly where they are: across the water from Vermont’s Green Mountains and up the shoreline from New York’s rugged Adirondacks. It’s a gateway to the great outdoors for cottagers, boaters, hikers, and skiers, an easy drive of an hour and fifteen minutes for the 4 million–plus Canadians in metropolitan Montreal.\n\nBut away from the lake, on the lonely roads that wind through some of the poorer tracts of New York real estate, a darker story is playing out. These are the crossing fields, where migrants heading in both directions take their chances with the elements, with law enforcement, with the smugglers, and, if they make it that far, with finding a stable life at the end of their trail. \n\nThe path through these North Country communities is well worn. Nearly two centuries ago, enslaved African Americans took cover in safe houses along the Underground Railroad, on their way to Quebec and Ontario. In the 1960s and ’70s, with Americans divided over the Vietnam War, Plattsburgh was a place for draft resisters to exhale and connect with others in the anti-war movement, before they crossed into Canada. \n\nOnce again, the Plattsburgh area is at a migration crossroads. Anyone living near the border can attest to it.\n\n“Everybody, everybody’s found clothes. Everybody’s had a migrant in their barn or somewhere,” said Terrence Rowe, who lives about one and a half kilometres from the border, in Champlain, New York. “I believe they just want to put as many miles between you and them. I don’t think they want to hang around.” But Rowe also pointed to a clearing in the brush that runs past his house and straight to the border, leaving him and his partner exposed to a human byway. “It’s seventy feet from my bedroom window. Who knows who it is crossing here?”\n\nRowe has recorded dozens of migrants passing in both directions, day and night, on his motion-activated video cameras. In January, he witnessed an incident in real time: in his driveway, a swarm of US Border Patrol officers arrested a migrant who had arrived by Uber. The car had been called to Rowe’s driveway in broad daylight—not a usual sight in a world where everyone tries to stay hidden.\n\n“I think migration is often invisible,” said Janet McFetridge, the Champlain village mayor, “because they’re on the run for whatever reason and they don’t necessarily want to be seen.” \n\n“I’m sure there’s something right now that’s going on around us,” McFetridge added on a recent afternoon, in between serving the regulars at her cafe and bookshop on Main Street. “There’s movement somewhere back in the border half a mile there.”\n\nMcFetridge, a retired schoolteacher, works in the village office in the morning and runs the cafe most afternoons and Saturdays, providing a gathering place for villagers in a two-storey building from the 1870s that she and her late husband brought back to life. She often donates her tips and any profits to charitable causes. In the winter, she keeps a collection of hats and mittens in the trunk of her car should anyone, including a passing migrant, be in need.\n\nFor years, McFetridge gave out mittens, hats, and words of encouragement to migrants as they were about to cross into Canada at Roxham Road. She posted herself there six days a week, sometimes along with others from Plattsburgh Cares, a coalition providing advocacy and support to migrants. They greeted migrants as they climbed out of the taxis that had picked them up in Plattsburgh. Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers would arrest the asylum seekers on the spot but then escort them into the system for processing. Eventually, many of those refugee claims would be taken up. \n\nRoxham became a byword throughout the migration routes in the Americas and beyond. Migrants would arrive by bus or train to Plattsburgh, then take a taxi to Roxham, and walk the last few metres along a dirt path, dragging their suitcases. \n\nBetween 2017 and 2023, nearly 100,000 asylum seekers crossed into Canada at unofficial entry points like Roxham Road—bypassing formal border crossings and, with them, the Safe Third Country Agreement. That pact between Canada and the US bars most asylum seekers from making a refugee claim at official ports of entry, since each country considers the other a “safe” place to make such claims.\n\nWhen Canada closed the pathway in March 2023, migrants showed up unaware at Roxham and were turned away. With no place else to go, they turned to the county department of social services, local churches, and migrant support groups like Plattsburgh Cares for emergency food and shelter. Since then, more migrants seeking asylum have arrived in Canada by plane—a total of 23,020 in Quebec last year, nearly double the 11,655 in 2022, the last full year that Roxham was open. \n\nWhile Plattsburgh Cares lent support on the New York side of Roxham, they were often joined there by the Quebec group Bridges Not Borders. Standing on the New York side, the Quebec group would monitor interactions between the migrants and the Mounties. Both support groups, along with immigration experts, raised concerns that closing Roxham would force migrants to take more dangerous routes into Canada and rely more on smugglers. \n\n“It’s gone so much underground, and that was our big concern when Roxham was closed,” said Frances Ravensbergen, a spokesperson for Bridges Not Borders. “There was a humane approach when people were coming through Roxham and they could get support on both sides.” \n\n“Now people are crossing just all over the place,” Ravensbergen said. “We know there’s two-way traffic going on. There’s certainly indications of smuggling but nobody, nobody, knows the full extent of what’s going on.”\n\nThe final hours of the life of Ana Karen Vasquez-Flores show how quickly things can go wrong when a migrant turns to a human smuggler for help.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed by US Border Patrol, Vasquez-Flores was last seen on a security camera on December 11, 2023, at an Esso station in Lacolle, around six kilometres from the US border. She and her alleged smuggler waited in his car at the gas station until her husband, Miguel Mojarro-Magana, sent a photo of a bank deposit of $2,500 (US) as proof of payment. The deposit was made at a Chase branch on Junction Boulevard in Queens, New York. \n\nThree minutes later, at 2:38 p.m., her handler wheeled out of the Esso parking lot and drove them down Highway 15, toward the border. The two would stay in touch through messages on WhatsApp while she walked alone through the woods, near Champlain, to a designated pickup spot. Vasquez-Flores, who was five months pregnant, would be wading through a river in the dark along the way. \n\nThe winds were starting to pick up in the late afternoon, to nineteen kilometres an hour, and the temperature dropped to two degrees by sundown. Shortly after 6:15 p.m., she took her first steps into the Great Chazy River, according to messages later obtained by US Border Patrol. She was never heard from again. \n\nVasquez-Flores, a Mexican in her thirties, had arrived in Montreal with her husband just ten days earlier, on December 1. Mojarro-Magana had a US visa; his wife didn’t, according to news reports. The plan was for him to go ahead to the US without her and for her to cross illegally to meet him. \n\nOn December 7, four days before his wife’s crossing, according to the criminal complaint, Mojarro-Magana responded to a TikTok video allegedly posted by Jhader Augusto Uribe-Tobar, a Colombian national living in Montreal. They exchanged the following messages (translated from Spanish by a Border Patrol agent):\n\nOn December 11, the day of the crossing, text messages were exchanged between Vasquez-Flores, her husband, and Uribe-Tobar. Vasquez-Flores had this final text exchange with Uribe-Tobar as she was approaching the river:\n\nThe Border Patrol officer who filed the criminal complaint against Uribe-Tobar wrote: “Based on my training, experience, and knowledge of the investigation, in this exchange [Uribe-Tobar] directed Vasquez-Flores on where to go and how to cross the river. The last message that said ‘Karen’ showed that it was sent at 6:17 p.m. and it shows that it was never delivered; it is suspected this is when she was swept away by the river.” \n\nThe next day, Mojarro-Magana spoke to a Border Patrol officer at the McDonald’s in Champlain. He reported his wife missing and shared a screenshot of the last location that she sent him. It was just south of the intersection of Perry Mills Road and Missile Base Road. Search teams found footprints in the snow leading into the river.\nThe river flows east from there on its way to Lake Champlain, passing just across the road from Rowe’s house, before it winds through the village of Champlain, where Vasquez-Flores’s body was recovered three days after she went missing. \n\nVillagers haven’t forgotten. McFetridge and others in the county planted a cross in memory of Vasquez-Flores last July, at the river’s edge. Also mentioned at the ceremony, the mayor said, were the deaths of two Senegalese men, Abdoulaye Ndoye and Ndongo Sarry, both twenty-five, whose bodies were found covered in snow in March last year, about fifteen kilometres outside the village. The border is never far from the mind. At McFetridge’s cafe and bookshop, neighbours will swap stories about the articles of clothing they found on their property, the sighting of a stranger wheeling a suitcase through the village, or the rescue of a group of six Haitians in the woods just west of the village in mid-January this year. \n\nBut they won’t talk about US immigration policy at the cafe—not in a close-knit town of 5,605 which narrowly went for Trump in the 2024 presidential vote.\n\n“Trumpers and non-Trumpers do not speak to each other about this issue at all. At all, no,” said Cathie Davenport, who lives in Mooers, just west of the village. “We’ll talk about other things. Yeah, about a lot of other things, but not this.”\n\nDavenport has been involved in Plattsburgh Cares. She said in an interview that she objects to Trump’s deportation roundups. “I’m worried about people who are legally here and have become citizens being picked up and deported. That’s what I’m worried about.”\n\nRowe might have other ideas, but “when I go to [McFetridge’s] little coffee shop down here, I don’t talk politics at all,” he said, adding: “My golf partners are for Democrats too, but we don’t talk about it. We golf.”\n\nAny talk of American politics would be foreign to Rolana, a sixty-two-year-old teacher from Haiti, a country overrun by street gangs. On Christmas Eve, she arrived at the Sunoco station in Plattsburgh with two large suitcases on wheels and a hand-held bag. She had hopes for a new start in Quebec, where she imagined living and working in her native language.\n\n“I want to enter Canada,” she said in French before climbing into her Uber at sundown. “I am an immigrant because Haiti is very difficult.” The school she ran in a suburb of Port-au-Prince was broken into. After that, she left for the US in 2023 and stayed with relatives in several cities before deciding to head north. \n\n“I know that maybe I’ll be more at ease in Canada with my French. All my life, I’ve been a teacher,” she said. “I’ll listen to my cousin who advised me to settle in Canada.”\n\nShe had another reason for trying to leave the US for Canada in December—the worsening political climate. As a Haitian, she was admitted to the US in 2023 under the Temporary Protected Status—TPS—program, which allows individuals from designated countries facing conflict or crisis to remain temporarily and apply for permission to work.\n\nBut Trump campaigned for the White House on an anti-immigration platform, promising “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country” to rid the US of undocumented immigrants, many of whom he claimed were “murderers and rapists.” He also promised to scale back the TPS. The campaign reached a low point in September, when Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were targeted by false rumours that they abducted and ate family pets—claims Trump repeated in a presidential debate with Kamala Harris.\n\nOf course, Rolana and her relatives took note. They worried that after Trump took office on January 20, he could revoke the TPS at any time and leave her subject to deportation. “Nobody wants to be undocumented or illegal under that regime—and you can call it that,” said Naomie, a niece, who spoke by phone from her home in Washington, DC. She asked that her real name not be published. “I’m a [naturalized] US citizen, thankfully, but not even thankfully, because I don’t even know if that protects me in any way, shape, or form.”\n\nAnyone who lands in Quebec and files a claim for asylum will have to wait three years and nine months for a decision, according to the latest estimate from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada—if they are deemed eligible for consideration at all.\n\nRolana was denied entry on the spot. On Christmas Eve, she got a ride to the border at Lacolle and exited her Uber within a half kilometre of the border agents’ booths, pulling her suitcases across the plaza to present herself to officials. After interviewing Rolana, they offered her a meal and a shower, she said, but then sent her back to the US on Christmas Day. She was denied entry to Canada because, as someone who had been living in the US, she didn’t qualify under the Safe Third Country Agreement. \n\nRolana took a bus to New York and made her way to Washington to live with her niece. She spent months looking for work, even trying for shift work at Walmart or a supermarket and wondering how long she would be able to stay in the country. She eventually got fed up living as a migrant in Trump’s America. Turned away by Canada and unwelcome in the US, in March, she moved back to the one place she could still call home: Haiti, a country under siege by rival gangs, the land she fled nearly two years ago after her school was broken into and robbed of its generator.\n\nHer big challenge now is to keep her school running. “I try to hold on. I try to find the means at hand to continue the school,” she said. “I can’t let these children down.” She insists she feels safe, despite a report from a United Nations representative that says Haiti is near “total chaos.” Her experience in the US left her feeling disappointed. “I can’t stand Donald Trump because of the way he’s treating immigrants,” Rolana said in a phone interview from Pétion-Ville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince. “I am not a thief. I am not a criminal.”\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration has started ratcheting up pressure on migrants by moving up the deadlines for those in the TPS program to leave the US. But apparently, that hasn’t forced more migrants to cross through the woods to Canada, according to Corporal Érique Gasse, a spokesman for the RCMP. To be sure, the Mounties don’t catch every migrant, but Gasse said they are confident that, with their surveillance technology, they are aware of almost every migrant who is crossing. Then it’s a question of getting a patrol car dispatched in time to make an arrest, either by the RCMP or the Sûreté du Québec provincial police.\n\n“When we see someone on the way, we hear someone, feel someone is passing, we will dispatch patrols, and again, most of the time, they will find them,” Gasse said.\nThe RCMP intercepted sixty-three migrants in March in Quebec, down from the ninety caught in March of last year. It’s unclear how many might have eluded the Mounties altogether. \n\nThe biggest activity now at Quebec’s doorstep is not in a desolate area of the woods but at the main border crossing at Lacolle. The number of asylum seekers in Quebec is down overall from a year ago, but they have been spiking at Lacolle since the Department of Homeland Security started warning Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans in a temporary-stay program called CHNV to leave the country immediately (these warnings have since escalated to actual termination notices). The number of migrants jumped from 755 in February to 1,356 in March, then up to 2,733 in April, which is four times the figure for April 2024, according to the Canadian Border Services Agency.\n\nThose headed for the Lacolle crossing are facing their own risks too. In the past, when migrants were turned away by Canadian border agents, US Border Patrol would receive them but usually let them go. But thanks to an executive order signed by Trump in January, Border Patrol is required to take the rejected asylum seekers from Canadian authorities and turn them over to officers at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, for detention and deportation. \n\n“It happened before, but it seems to be more common now,” said Ottawa-based immigration lawyer Heather Neufeld.\n\nThese developments on both sides of the border left the Venezuelan friends Nestor and José with few options after spending that first night at a hotel in Plattsburgh. But Nestor remained hopeful. When told in a text message from The Walrus in February that Venezuelans were at risk of losing their TPS protections, he wrote: “I don’t think this will spread, or maybe there will be an order for an amnesty for all those people who are in danger in their country of origin. Now for the moment, just pray and ask God that everything goes well.” He declined to reveal his whereabouts. \n\nFor some migrants, the fear of being caught and detained in the US is enough to force them to take drastic measures, said Neufeld, even if that means risking their safety in a clandestine hike with a smuggler. “People who are fearing for their lives will find ways to come to Canada,” she said.\n\nIf Neufeld is correct, Trump’s immigration policies could encourage more migrants to take their chances crossing Rowe’s property in Champlain next winter. Over the winter, his cameras caught four adults—one of them holding a baby—walking through deep snow in a blowing storm. A short while later, three of the adults, with the baby, turned back. The fourth person disappeared into the distance on their way to the Canadian border.","summary":"How a gas station in New York became a gateway to the north\n\n\nThe post Migrant Crossings into Canada Surge as US Deportation Threats Grow first appeared on The Walrus.","url":"https://thewalrus.ca/migrant-crossings-into-canada-surge-as-us-deportation-threats-grow/","image":"https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/WEB_ReportFromTheFields_JUN2025.jpg","video":"https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/migrantsRowe2-1.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-18 17:15:13","author":"Michael Shenker","authors":["Michael Shenker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":332789450,"title":"Exclusive: Jamaica’s Ambassador Antony Anderson On Strengthening U.S. Ties, Economic Growth, And The Future Of The Island","text":"His Excellency Major General (Ret'd) Antony Anderson currently serves as Jamaica's fourteenth ... More Ambassador to the United States of America and as the Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the Organization of American States (OAS). He officially assumed duties on 28th May 2025, at the Embassy of Jamaica in Washington, D.C.\nEmbassy of Jamaica - Washington\n\nIn the third-floor ceremonial office of the Jamaican Embassy, just steps from Washington, D.C.’s iconic Dupont Circle, Antony Anderson is settling into his new role as Jamaica’s ambassador to the United States.\n\nThis new appointment, which Anderson has had for nearly three weeks, represents a marked departure from his former role as the Commissioner of Police of the Jamaica Constabulary Force. In this new chapter, he faces a complex geopolitical landscape, one shaped by a Trump administration focused on challenging foreign trade norms and implementing a zero-tolerance immigration policy that’s spurred the mass deportation of more than 2,500 Jamaican nationals.\n\nAnderson, a warm yet reserved figure sporting a pale blue suit with a red tie and the Jamaican flag proudly pinned to his lapel, said leadership and focus are essential, now more than ever.\n\n“Jamaicans are not constrained by how they see themselves in the world,” said Anderson, 61. “We come from a small island in the Caribbean, but we don't think that way. We have no problem taking first, second, and third at the Olympics in a race.”\n\nAn official photo taken of the Richard Fowler's interview with Amb. Anderson in the Embassy of ... More Jamaica's ceremonial office.\nRichard Fowler\n\nIn his first major interview with an American publication since his appointment, Anderson shared his vision for Jamaica’s relationship with the United States. He also discussed the recently revised U.S. travel advisory for Jamaica, his plans to strengthen Jamaica’s diplomatic footprint in Washington, and how he intends to address the challenges posed by the current political climate, striking a balance between his ambassadorial role and the growing influence of the Jamaican-American diaspora.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n“We are looking out for new opportunities, and there’s no better time for opportunity than change,” said Anderson. “My work will focus on helping Jamaica navigate these changes to create better and larger opportunities that align with our policy of growth.”\n\nTo understand Anderson's reserved nature, one must consider his decorated military and law enforcement background. While his warmth is evident, his careful approach to understanding issues before giving thoughtful, calculated responses reflect his robust military training.\n\nAnderson holds a master’s degree in Defense Administration from what was formerly known as the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham, and a bachelor’s degree in Engineering from Cranfield University in the United Kingdom.\n\nCoupled with decades of experience in law enforcement, including work with various international agencies and joint operations with local and state law enforcement in the U.S., Anderson begins his tenure at a critical time for Jamaica.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with Prime Minister of Jamaica Andrew Holness and local ...

In 2024, Jamaica welcomed approximately 4.3 million visitors, with the majority coming from the United States.\n\nHowever, Anderson, whose previous role as head of the police put him in direct oversight of public safety, quickly highlighted Jamaica’s falling crime rates, which he said reaffirms the island’s safety for American tourists.\n\n“When you look at real crime numbers and the incidences of crimes against tourists, American tourists are absolutely safer in Jamaica than any major U.S. city that they might choose to visit,” Anderson said. “But you have perception versus reality.”\n\nThe island has seen a 45% reduction in murders and a 20% drop in major crimes year-to-date.\n\n“We've done a lot of things to improve some of the concerns that caused the level of the advisory,” Anderson said. “Our security situation has improved dramatically. We've addressed some of those concerns in our health sector. So we've created the conditions that if the administration wanted to revise the travel advisory positively, then there’s enough reason to do so.”\n\nWith the new travel advisory in hand, Anderson said he wants to build on a relationship that is evolving under the new Trump administration.\n\nA shared focus for Anderson and his American counterparts is tackling crime and drug trafficking.\n\nJamaica’s Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency Major General (Ret’d) Antony Anderson, ...

In 2023, when Jamaica accounted for the largest share of Caribbean immigrants in the U.S., approximately 1.3 million people of Jamaican descent called this country home.\n\n“Jamaicans, wherever they go, don’t necessarily form a community by themselves,” Anderson said. “They integrate into the community, especially if their values align. And when they become part of a community, they add value. Within one or two generations, those kids are doing amazing things for the country.”\n\nAnderson pointed to figures like U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Emmy Award-winning actress Sheryl Lee Ralph, underscoring how the Jamaican mindset of limitless potential has shaped the success of its diaspora.\n\n“Jamaicans have a mindset that says we can be as good as anyone in the world,” Anderson said. “When that’s instilled in our children, they do rise and they do great things because they know there are no limits to their vision and imagination.”\n\nTOPSHOT - US Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks on the ...

Harris: “At the park, my mother would tell us to stay close,” Harris said. “But my father would just smile and say, ‘Run, Kamala. Run. Don’t be afraid. Don’t let anything stop you.’”\n\nThe relationship between the U.S. and Jamaica isn’t without its challenges.\n\nFor years, Jamaica has been a recruitment hotspot for of recruiting highly skilled healthcare and education professionals. This has led to the country’s third-place ranking on the Human Flight and Brain Drain Index. In 2023, nearly 26,000 Jamaicans, including many teachers and healthcare professionals, relocated to the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAnderson is no stranger to this aspect of immigration, often overlooked or underreported in U.S. immigration stories. “We ultimately believe that you are free to go if you please, but we as a nation must work to create an environment for you to stay.”\n\nKINGSTON, JAMAICA - MARCH 06: Nurses watch during a visit by Prince Harry at Bustamente Children's ...

In early 2025, offshore oil potential was identified in the Walton-Morant Basin, located south of the island. Estimates suggest more than 2.4 billion untapped barrels, which Jamaican officials are working to turn into a major economic driver.\n\nA significant part of Jamaica’s identity is its cultural influence, especially through dancehall and reggae music, which continue to dominate global charts. With artists like Vybz Kartel and Spice selling out arenas, Anderson believes that time’s of the essence in making the Jamaica brand global.\n\n“Now is the moment,” Anderson said. ‘to take our Jamaica brand, our cool brand, keep its Caribbean flavor, but make it larger and part of a world standard.”\n\nEmphasizing music, food, and Jamaica’s dominance in athletics, Anderson also highlighted efforts to create more talent incubators and streamline the investment process. “There’s a push to make everything easier—to make investment easier—and it’s called SPEED—the Streamlining Processes for Efficiency and Economic Development.”\n\nLed by former Jamaican Ambassador to the U.S. Audrey Marks, who’s now innovation minister and a member of the Jamaican Senate and Minister for Innovation, the SPEED initiative aims to foster an environment conducive to investment and talent growth.\n\nAs Jamaica’s global influence continues to expand, Anderson stands ready to leave his mark on what comes next for the island nation.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Ambassador Antony Anderson outlines his vision for Jamaica’s growth, U.S. relations, and expanding global influence","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfowler/2025/06/18/exclusive-jamaicas-ambassador-antony-anderson-on-strengthening-us-ties-economic-growth-and-the-future-of-the-island/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6852ee3ca056740551195757/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 17:15:04","author":"Contributor,Nathan Howard,Richard Fowler","authors":["Contributor","Nathan Howard","Richard Fowler"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.444},{"id":332780596,"title":"Gavin Newsom's Chances of Being 2028 Democratic Nominee Surge—Poll","text":"California Governor Gavin Newsom's chances in the 2028 Democratic primary surged in the latest poll after he garnered national attention for his handling of Los Angeles protests over President Donald Trump's immigration policy.Newsweek reached out to Newsom's team for comment via email.Why It MattersNewsom has long been viewed as a likely presidential candidate for Democrats who has presented himself as a foil and leading opponent to the Trump administration. The Los Angeles protests earlier presented him perhaps his highest-profile clash with the president so far after Trump federalized the National Guard troops, arguing local officials were not doing enough to quell demonstrations that at times grew violent, though most protesters were peaceful.The governor said Trump taking control of the National Guard only escalated the situation, which he believed was already under control, casting the move as an abuse of power. Newsom sued to block the federalization of the troops, though the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily blocked another judge's order to return the troops to Newsom's control.Still, Newsom's handling of the protests has earned praise from many Democrats, and the latest poll finds that his support against other hypothetical candidates has ticked up since March.What to KnowNewsom's support more than doubled in the latest poll of Democratic voters conducted by Morning Consult, though former Vice President Kamala Harris still held a strong lead over other potential candidates.Eleven percent of respondents said they plan to support Newsom in the primary if he chooses to run, up from 5 percent in March, according to the poll. Harris' support slightly fell from 36 percent to 34 percent.Meanwhile, former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg saw his support drop from 10 percent to 7 percent, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's support increased from 5 percent to 7 percent, the poll found.An additional 26 percent said they intended to vote for someone else, while 16 percent were still unsure who they would cast their ballots for in the primary.The poll surveyed 1,000 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents from June 13 to June 15, 2025.Protests began after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began conducting raids in Los Angeles earlier in June to fulfill Trump's promise of mass deportations. The raids are following legal directives from federal authorities, but critics have raised concerns about the treatment of migrants by federal authorities as well as the tactics used by immigration agents during the raids.Amid the protests, Trump deployed about 4,000 members of California's National Guard and the 700 U.S. Marines to assist in stopping violence despite objections from Newsom and other local officials.The White House accused Newsom of not taking sufficient action to quell the protest. Newsom, however, said Californians \"do not want our streets militarized by our own Armed Forces\" and that Trump's move was a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" Newsom has also accused the Trump administration of deliberately spreading doctored and misleading images of recent protests in Los Angeles.While Newsom is viewed as a prospective candidate, his fellow Californian Harris has led most polls. Her decision about whether to run for president will shape the nature of the race. Harris has also been floated as a potential candidate to succeed Newsom as the California governor.What People Are SayingNewsom told The Wall Street Journal earlier in June: \"I'm not thinking about running, but it's a path that I could see unfold.\"CNN data analyst Harry Enten said: \"If Gavin Newsom wanted to take on Donald Trump and loves the attention, he has 100 percent gotten it. Take a look here. Google searches of Gavin Newsom with Donald Trump, get this, up 9,700 percent. More folks are googling Gavin Newsom's name with Donald Trump than ever before.\"What Happens NextAlthough most candidates will likely announce after the 2026 midterms, candidates are already working to build name recognition and support from Democrats. The protests in Los Angeles have calmed since last week, but Newsom will likely remain a top opponent to Trump's policies through the rest of his term.","summary":"Newsom's support ticked up in the latest poll after the Los Angeles protests over President Trump's immigration policy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-chances-democratic-nominee-surge-poll-2087479","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2666088/gavin-newsom-polling-chances-surge-2028.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 17:05:31","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":332765580,"title":"Donald Trump Gets Double-Digit Poll Boost from 4 Voter Groups","text":"Donald Trump's approval rating is growing among four key demographics, according to a new poll.The latest Pew Research poll, conducted between June 2-8, shows that Trump's approval rating has grown since April among older Hispanics and Black voters, Asian women and moderate Republicans.Why It MattersDonald Trump made considerable gains with Black, Hispanic and Asian voters in the 2024 election, increasing his share of the vote in all but two states in 2024.These gains among key voting blocs traditionally aligned with Democrats could reshape the balance of power in Congress and embolden Trump to pursue more aggressive policies with broader public backing.What To KnowAccording to the latest polling data, Trump's approval rating among Hispanics aged 50 and over rose from 31 percent in April to 38 percent in June. Over the same period, disapproval declined from 67 percent to 60 percent, lifting his net approval rating from -36 to -22—a 14-point improvement.Among Black voters aged 50 and older, Trump has also seen modest gains, though his overall approval remains deeply negative. In April, just 6 percent approved of his performance while 90 percent disapproved, giving him a net approval rating of -84. By June, approval among this group increased to 13 percent and disapproval fell to 85 percent, improving his net approval rating to -72.More dramatic movement came from Asian women, where Trump saw a 6-point boost in approval, climbing from 27 percent in April to 33 percent in June. Disapproval also dropped from 71 percent to 65 percent, shifting his net approval among this group from -44 to -32—a 12-point swing.Perhaps most significantly, Trump saw a substantial shift among moderate Republicans, whose approval of him rose from 60 percent to 67 percent. Disapproval in that group declined from 38 percent to 32 percent, bringing his net rating from +22 to +35—a 13-point gain in net favorability.In contrast, Trump's approval rating has sharply declined across educational lines, with especially steep drops among female voters with some college education or less.Among female college graduates, Trump's approval fell significantly from April to June. In April, 28 percent approved of his performance while 70 percent disapproved, resulting in a net approval of -42. By June, approval had dropped to just 15 percent, with disapproval rising to 85 percent—pushing his net approval rating down to -70, a 28-point slide.The decline is even more dramatic among women with some college education or less. In April, Trump had relatively stronger standing with this group: 42 percent approved of his performance compared to 57 percent who disapproved, yielding a net rating of -15. But by June, only 16 percent approved while 82 percent disapproved, plunging his net approval to -66—a stunning 51-point drop in just two months.That is a surprising reversal for Trump, who made huge gains among non-college-educated voters in 2024. According to an analysis of data published by Catalist by pollster Nate Silver, voters who didn't attend college have shifted the most towards Trump since 2012.The most dramatic shift was observed among nonwhite voters who did not complete college. In 2012, this group contributed a net +11.0 percentage points to the Democrats' popular vote margin. By 2024, that figure had dropped to just +5.4 points—a net swing of -5.6 points over the 12-year span.White voters without college degrees, who have traditionally leaned Republican, became even more firmly aligned with the GOP. Their net contribution to Democrats dropped from -9.7 points in 2012 to -11.4 points in 2024, representing a swing of -1.7 points.Conversely, white college graduates showed a modest but consistent shift toward the Democrats, swinging from a -1.7 point contribution in 2012 to +0.6 in 2024. This 2.3-point swing reflects the party's growing strength among more educated white voters. Meanwhile, nonwhite college graduates remained relatively stable in their Democratic support, with only a minor -0.4 point shift over the 12-year period.The Catalist data also found that former Vice President Kamala Harris underperformed Biden's 2020 margins by 12 points with Latino men, 7 points with Black men, and 4 points with AAPI women. Even among women, where she was expected to excel, Harris failed to exceed Biden's 2020 margins, and support declined among Latinas and AAPI women.What Happens NextTrump's approval rating across all demographics is likely to fluctuate in the coming weeks.","summary":"Donald Trump made considerable gains with Black, Hispanic and Asian voters in the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-polling-demograhpics-pew-2087436","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2665997/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 16:18:50","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":332783360,"title":"Taking on \"the language police\" and taxing the rich: Tom Suozzi has a vision for moderate Democrats","text":"Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., has emerged as one of the favorite representatives of the centrist faction of the Democratic Party after winning in a suburban district on Long Island that President Donald Trump carried in 2024.\n\nAfter the election, Suozzi criticized Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign for failing to respond to attack ads from the Trump campaign on trans women participating in women's sports, which itself drew criticism from Democrats and LGBTQ+ advocates. \n\nWhile he's perhaps best known for his support for restoring the state and local tax deduction, Suozzi now cautions against doing so without first hiking taxes on the rich. Moving forward, he’s calling on Democrats to turn to a message of building America’s middle class, raising taxes on billionaires and supporting organized labor, arguing that can help the party rebuild majority support in the United States.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI want to start off talking about some of the comments from WelcomeFest. In my view, you describe a slightly different approach to running as a moderate than some of the other panelists and elected officials that were there, suggesting that it's maybe more of a question of emphasis as much as it is policy positions.\n\nYou said, “I've got a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood. I have a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign. I'm good on all the issues, but that's not what I campaign on. I campaign on the economy, immigration, taxes and crime. That's what people are talking about.”\n\nYou later discussed how Democrats need to provide a positive alternative vision on immigration, and learn how to say no to consultants. To me, that sounds similar to some of the progressive critiques of the 2024 campaign, and even somewhat similar to Bernie Sanders' message. I'm wondering if you see an economy-first, populist message as the way forward for the Democratic Party — and, if so, what you see as moderates' and centrists' role in that.\n\nI think that we have to get back to the historic message of the Democratic Party: We want to build the middle class and people who aspire to the middle class. We have to get back to the idea that, in return for hard work, you make enough money so you can have a decent life. You can buy a house, you can educate your kids, you know, [get] health insurance. You can retire.\n\nThe middle class, and the opportunities to get into the middle class, have been decimated over the past 50 years or so. I don't know if you know this episode, but in the 80s, we were all worried about the Japanese and the German car companies, and they were like, you know, they started eating our lunch with their cars versus American cars. \n\nAnd people were very worried that this was the end of America. They were closing our factories; people were losing their jobs. And so there was a big switch in our country, manifested in a paper written by a guy named Milton Friedman that said, “Stop worrying about the employees, and stop worrying about the community you're in, and start worrying about more about the shareholders. And if you take care of shareholders, everything will work out.”\n\nAnd so we kind of did that in America, and we made a lot of money. The problem is we didn't share that money. And did you ever see the movie \"Pretty Woman\"?\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\nIn the movie, one of the storylines is about these guys who want to buy this older man's company, and they're going to sell off the shipyard, and the older guy says it will be decimated. And the response was, yeah, but we'll make a lot of money. And so that's what we did in America. \n\nWe went with this pure globalist crowd, pure figuring out to make the most money possible, and we left behind a bunch of towns with polluted properties, and people lost their union jobs, typically, and as a result, they're pretty miserable, because they're willing to work hard, but they can't — they don't have the opportunity to make the same kind of wages as they used to, and they're now. \n\nThere’s a polluted site in town. Their churches are empty, and there's no more Elks Club, and there's no more Rotary Club, and their kids are doing methamphetamine and fentanyl. They're mad. And we have to figure out how to create those opportunities together for people in our country, especially considering the fact that 60% of Americans do not graduate from college, and we've been talking about the need to learn more for years, but it just has not proven to be effective, and we need to instead focus on opportunities to get the skills to get decent wages in our country. \n\nSo yes, that's a very important part of what we need to do. So when we're fighting with the Republicans, we need to point out that, you know, we Democrats are in favor of increasing the minimum wage; Republicans are against an increase in the minimum wage. Democrats are for unions; Republicans are against unions.\n\nDo you think that was emphasized in the 2024 campaign?\n\nNot at all.\n\nAnd it sounds like that would be something you’d want to emphasize going forward.\n\nAbsolutely. We have to emphasize that. That’s what people care about. I talked at the WelcomeFest, were you there?\n\nNo, unfortunately, I had other commitments. I couldn’t go.\n\nOne of the most important things I said is if you ask the American people, “What do you care about? What are the issues you care about the most?” They say, “The economy, immigration, taxes, crime and health care.” And if you ask the same people, what do you think the Democrats care about, or what the Democratic Party emphasizes? They say, “Choice, LGBT protections, health care,” so there’s a little bit of crossover there; “protecting democracy and climate.” So those are all very important issues, but they’re not issues that the American people are concentrating on. We need to talk about the issues that people care about. That’s why you’re a representative.\n\nI think some of the discussion around transgender Americans' participation in sports might be potentially helpful in illustrating your point here. You caught a lot of criticism when, shortly after the election, you said, “I don't want to discriminate against anybody, but I don't think biological boys should be playing girls sports. Democrats aren't saying that, and they should be.”\n\nYou later voted against the GOP measure that would have effectively banned trans participation in sports, which you know didn't draw nearly as much attention as your previous statement. But I'm hoping you could explain how you came to the decision to vote against that bill in light of the previous statement, and how you see that fitting into your broader philosophy of talking about kitchen table issues while simultaneously maintaining the support for human and civil rights that people expect from Democrats.\n\nAfter the election, I was very angry because I had been asking the campaign to say something about the commercials that they were running against them, and they didn't say anything. And that's when I said, really, I was just angry at my own party for not saying something about it, and I agreed to have a class with my staff, with some LGBT activist. I think it was the Human Rights Campaign, actually. And, you know, I don't say that the same way anymore.\n\nNow, I say I don't think transgender women should be playing in competitive women's sports. I still mean the same thing, but I’m using language that may be more appropriate. And like I said, I have a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, but I also don't think that transgender women should be playing in competitive sports. I think that's what most people think.\n\nBut the bill that was suggested in Congress was poorly written, and I spoke to a lot of my friends, and I thought that this bill did not make a distinction between competitive women's sports and young girls playing in elementary school. It was totally irresponsible.\n\nI don't think that the federal government should be taking on this role, as it should be something done at the local level and by sports organizations. But the idea that, you know, Congress is going to say, “Hey, we've got to do physical exams of young girls and women,” I don’t think makes sense, and I just think it was irresponsible.\n\nI talked to a lot of my colleagues. There's one colleague, Susie Lee from Nevada, who wrote a beautiful statement that I ended up reposting about how she was a former high school and college swimmer, and she doesn't support transgender athletes competing in girls' and women’s sports, especially when fairness or safety are compromised. But she doesn't think that this law was done appropriate the way that they did it.\n\nSo I mean, all these topics are very, very difficult to talk about. And one of the problems in our party that we've had historically is that it's hard to even open your mouth to discuss these issues — the language police, the cancel-ers shut you down right away and and that's that's just plain wrong, and we can't all be walking around on eggshells every time and not being able to say what we feel. And I think that certainly amongst my colleagues, they have been very, very good about giving people grace. We have to give them an opportunity to say what they think. \n\nIf somebody's for religious reasons or moral reasons, or maybe just not comfortable talking about these things, we can't just try and paint them as though there's something wrong with them. If we start to listen to people and what we allowing people to express themselves.\n\nI’d like to move on to a few questions about sort of the meat and potatoes issues that you touched on earlier. My first one is about health care. I think most people in this country can agree that our health care system doesn't work very well for your average person. When I speak to a lot of Democrats, many of them tell me that Democrats need to offer the public some sort of transformative change for our health care system in future elections. \n\nSome say that we should have a public option. Others prefer Medicare-for-all; members of leadership often like to talk about protecting and expanding on the Affordable Care Act. Understanding that there's not a specific bill on the table in this Congress, I'm wondering which of these policies you prefer, and do you think any of them would make a good marquee campaign issue going forward? And in general, I'm wondering, what's your vision for trying to fix the American healthcare system? \n\nSo that's a really hard question, and I wish I had the perfect answer. As a matter of fact, I bring this up often with think tanks and with provider groups of doctors and hospitals and health care advocates. Everybody's looking for their little thing instead of laying out a comprehensive solution to our health care problem. \n\nI believe that Obamacare has done dramatic things to improve health care in America, but there still has to be more things done to improve affordability and these enormous amounts of money, and especially with end-of-life care. It’s such a big, huge, complicated topic. I don't think I can give you the answer right now, but I think with Obamacare, of the Affordable Care Act, we have to amend it, not end it. And right now, I think that what the Republicans are doing as part of their bill, with the reconciliation bill, is they're trying to gut Obamacare in a way that's not obvious to everybody that that's exactly what they're doing, and they're going to kick a lot of people off of the affordable health care and but because the President is such a master of distraction, nobody's even talking about the reconciliation bill. \n\nI mean, there's been so little attention given to it, because at the hottest times that we were spending 24 hours a day working on this issue in Washington, D.C., he was cutting the tariffs that he had imposed on China, and he was accepting the plane from Qatar. Now he's doing the protest and military response in LA and now today, even the arrest of Senator, but not the arrest, but the forcible hands-on [detention] of Senator Padilla.\n\nThis is going to be a huge distraction, and the issue is the fact that they're cutting all these people's health care while they're giving a tax cut tax break, I should say tax break to the wealthiest people in our country who don't need a tax break. It's a losing issue for the President and the Republicans, but it's not getting enough attention, because he's such a master of distractions. \n\nAnd so, I always equate it to a pickpocket. They usually work in teams, and one person comes in and bumps into you, and when you're reacting to that person bumping into you, the other person picks your pocket. \n\nAnd so he does that, getting people all excited, whipped up. And meanwhile, he's cutting Medicaid and giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, so and creating the largest deficit in all of the country. \n\nSo, healthcare is one of the biggest challenges that I've always had. I love the idea of universal health care. Lovely idea, academically, but as a practical matter, it’s just not going to happen. Some of the people who have the best, best, best health insurance in the world are union employees. They're never going to give us their plans, and politically, they'll never do that. You've got other people, you know, working for large employers that have great health insurance, they don't want to give up their health insurance. So we have to figure out, getting more and more coverage for people. That has been very, very important.\n\nBut there are all kinds of things that need to be done regarding costs, the most important thing that Democrats should be holding President Trump's feet to the fire on is negotiating pharmaceutical drug prices. He was talking about that 2016 before, right before he became president, he said, “The pharmaceutical companies, these guys are getting away with making Americans pay so much more than other countries.” And then he banned them. \n\nAnd then Biden and the Democrats did something about it, but it was only for like 10 drugs, 25 drugs, I can't remember, but we should be doing that for all the drugs, negotiating. We should be negotiating prescription drug prices, which would save the largest purchasers of prescription drugs in the world, Medicare and Medicaid, enormous amounts of money that can be used for other things, to fix the healthcare system. \n\nSo I really don't have the right answer. I've always supported the idea of allowing people who are younger than 65 to purchase Medicare, so it would be a less expensive option.\n\nBasically, a public option by allowing people who are not of retirement age to purchase Medicare.\n\nYes, but I’m talking to other people. It's so hard because of all the things going on, that it's not like, you know, the hot burner issue, that it's always been historically, because there's some really crazy things happening. \n\n But I'm very open. I need some ideas to protect people as to what to do, to create more competition in the system to drive down prices, and to get better results from people. People's life expectancy is less than it used to be, and I just — I don't have the answer yet. That's the challenge. I wish I could do that, say This is the plan, and then I'll go work on it.”\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nOn taxes, you've been called “Mr. SALT” for your dedication to restoring the state and local tax deduction. At the same time, you have said that you support raising the top marginal tax rate so the policy would not be a giveaway to wealthy Americans. I'd like to ask to what extent you would support raising the top marginal tax rate on the wealthiest Americans, or, for that matter, potentially the Social Security cap? And do you think raising taxes on billionaires is a good campaign issue for Democrats?\n\n If you have nothing further out I have some more questions on the economy.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk recently about creating a more heterodox Democratic Party. But at the same time, I think there needs to be a tent pole that keeps Democrats recognizable as Democrats, and helps define what the party stands for, especially if there's going to be a more heterodox Democratic Party. I'm wondering what you think the tent pole should be?\n\nRewarding hard work.\n\nAmerica is founded on two big systems, capitalism and democracy. And capitalism says we have a society based upon competition. Capitalism as a system has lifted more people out of poverty, created more innovation. It's the best economic system in the history of the world, and it's based on competition.\n\nThe smarter you are, the stronger you are, the healthier you are, the harder working you are, the luckier you are, the better you’re going to do. Unfortunately, in a system based on competition, some people are not good competitors.\n\nLittle babies are not good competitors. Senior citizens, who are getting failed as they age, are not good competitors. You get hit by a car and you break both your legs, you’re not going to be a good competitor. You have a drug, alcohol, mental health problem, you get cancer, just something bad happens — you're not going to necessarily be a good competitor.\n\nSo if you have just that system alone, you're gonna have some people that do really, really well, and you have a bunch of people that do really poorly with a life of misery, but you're not going to naturally create a middle class in that system. So there’s a second system in America called democracy. It says, “All men and women are created equal.\"\n\nWe don't want you to be relegated to a life of misery because you're a little baby and your parents are not taking care of you. You can’t take care of yourself. We don't want you to starve to death. We don’t want to have senior citizens living in the cold. So we're going to put protection in place, and those protections are going to be like worker safety issues, so you don't cut your fingers off at work. And we're going to put a smokestack filter on top of your smokestack so you don't pollute there and give everybody cancer. And we're going to have a 40-hour work week, and we're going to give you overtime pay and, you know, etc., etc.\n\nSo it's not a choice of, \"I'm going to pick this system or that system.\" You're all this, you're all that. You have to find a balance between these two systems, because if you do too much on the capitalist side, with no guardrails, you can end up with a lot of people who have a miserable life, and they'll get into an awful existence. If you put too much, too many rules in place, too many protections in place, you're going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg, where all this innovation and wealth has been created from. You have to find a balance. Balance is a very central theme of everything I believe, and you can't find that balance in the current environment, where everything is based on fear and anger. You have to give people goodwill, willing to sit down, talk to each other and try to find. And so, that’s not happening. \n\nWhen you say what the tent pole is, you mean what’s going to stand out above everything else?\n\nYes. What is the defining set of policies or positions that make someone a Democrat?\n\nWe have to rebuild the middle class. That does not happen on its own. There has to be laws and provisions put in place to make that happen. We have to raise the minimum wage and help unions. That's why I'm working on legislation that you know will give you corporate discounts if you share 5% of your company stock with your lowest 80% wage earners of your company, because with AI and a lot of the other things happening in the contemporary global economy, we have to create more of an ownership economy in the country.\n\nI’ve got a couple more questions on the economy. One is related to what I think some within the party, or at least some people adjacent to the party, are thinking about a kind of tent pole set of issues, which is “abundance,” and the “abundance movement,” as people have called it, particularly at the WelcomeFest and some of the characters there. You often emphasize the importance of speaking to regular people in their district and just talking to everyday working Americans. I'm wondering if your constituents ask you about abundance, or if it's something that they bring up to you?\n\nNo, I don’t think that’s something that would come up in regular conversation. It’s more of a new idea and an academic idea, but it’s not something that people would come up in normal conversation.\n\nIf you were to say to people that we need to build more. When I think of the whole abundance movement, and I agree with a lot of it, it’s related to permitting reform. What can we do to make sure that we continue to have the safeguards in place that government and private sector people do not harm the public, but we also have this problem where we want to build all this green energy stuff, and we can't do it. Why does it take so long to build more solar, more wind, more transmission lines.\n\nThe example that those guys were writing high-speed trains out in California, it took them 20 years and its not done. We have to figure out how to get things done. They want to see results.\n\nI’ve got one more longer question and then a few rapid-fire questions for you. Some of the WelcomeFest types have talked about learning to say no to the groups. But in my observation, I think elected officials have at times hesitated to sign on to this prescription from some of the pundits in the space, and you actually specifically discussed the importance of talking to ethnic media or niche media outlets. And, in our conversation here, you've, you know, expressed the importance of unions, which I believe Josh Barro asked whether or not, whether or not it was necessary to break the unions to get things done in New York.\n\nI'm wondering what you think of this notion of learning to say no to “the groups.” I'm wondering what it means to you and how that might be different from some of the other people discussing it as something that Democrats need to learn to do.\n\nI don’t like the idea of framing it as \"saying no to the groups.\" I think you have to listen to groups, same as you listen to people. They're groups of people that you know care passionately about a topic, and they put a lot of time and energy into thinking it through and trying to advance an agenda. So they're all very talented, passionate people that have an important perspective on things. However, you can't be intimidated by them. You can't be, like “I’m going to do whatever they say, no matter what they say.” That’s a prescription for failure.\n\nYou have to have a set of values and stick with your values. You’ve got to do the hard work of listening to what different people say, and it requires a tremendous amount of patience at times, both with individuals and groups. But then you have to make a decision based upon what your values are and what you think is best for the people and to listen to what the people say.\n\n So you have to be willing to say no when it's appropriate. \n\nI believe Rep. Torres expressed it as being willing to listen, but not allowing any single group to have a veto.\n\nI've got a couple of quick questions for you, and then I can let you go. I understand you're not in New York City, but I'm wondering if you were, who you would be supporting in the city's Democratic primary later this month.\n\nWell, I do have a piece in New York City, northeast Queens, and I've decided to support Andrew Cuomo. Historically, he and I have not gotten along that well but I feel like the city ... needs a strong executive who can navigate the many different things happening in the city right now. And I don't like the Democratic Socialist movement, and I don't think that the guy now in second place, who's a Democratic socialist, has the requisite experience or background to manage the city larger than Fortune 500 companies. You have to have the executive experience to be able to run things.\n\nIn terms of other members of the party. I’m wondering who you think is doing the Trump era right, the second time around?\n\nI admire Hakeem Jeffries. I think he's a very, very reasoned person, very intelligent, has tremendous ability. He’s obviously a wonderful orator. I don't know if you know Joe Neguse, I think he is doing a good job. I think Richie Torres is doing a good job. I think that Jason Crow is doing a good job.","summary":"Rep.

In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday — expanding its recognition beyond Black America.\n\nThis year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump’s second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.\n\nRelated: Thoughts on Juneteenth, a day of reflection\n\nStill, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. “I’ve not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.”\n\nPeople who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a “right” way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party?\n\nIt depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans’ true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as “Black Codes,” enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\nPlans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\n“The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question ‘What is Juneteenth?'” Morial said.\n\nWhat if you’ve never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nDr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn’t learn about it until his 30s.\n\n“I think many folks haven’t known about it — who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn’t celebrate it,” Anderson said. “It was like just a part of history. It wasn’t a celebration of history.”\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn’t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are taking place?\n\nSearch online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you’ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth’s history.\n\nThe National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.\n\nAre there special Juneteenth decorations or foods?\n\nThe red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.\n\nMore people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth’s birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nIn recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n\n“I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,” Morial said. “If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that’s what I would do.”\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren’t Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there’s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you’re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n“I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,” Brown said. “It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. … Isn’t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.”\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n“Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we’re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,” Brown said. “Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.”\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n“You know how at Christmas people will say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a ‘Merry Christmas’ from everybody. This is the same way.”","summary":"It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed — after Civil War's end.\n\n\nThe post A guide to what the Juneteenth holiday is and how to celebrate it appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/news/2025/06/a-guide-to-what-the-juneteenth-holiday-is-and-how-to-celebrate-it/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP21171019234162-scaled-e1750182579349.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 14:53:45","author":"Terry Tang","authors":["Terry Tang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.278},{"id":332773340,"title":"Japan’s Nippon Steel closes its takeover of rival US Steel","text":"Japan’s Nippon Steel has closed its nearly $15bn purchase of its American rival US Steel, ending more than a year of political wrangling that threatened to scuttle the agreement on multiple occasions.\n\nUS President Donald Trump approved the tie-up last week, months after his predecessor Joe Biden moved to block the deal. Nippon Steel clinched Trump’s approval after pledging to invest $11bn in the Pennsylvania-based company by 2028, billions of dollars more than it had initially promised. It also handed the government a golden share in US Steel, which will allow the White House to veto key corporate decisions.\n\n“I am very pleased that the partnership between Nippon Steel and US Steel has been realised thanks to President Trump’s historic and visionary decision,” Eiji Hashimoto, Nippon Steel’s chair and chief executive, said in a statement.\n\nUS Steel’s base in the electoral swing state of Pennsylvania, and its historic role in American industry, caused the deal to become the subject of intense debate during the US presidential election last year. Biden, former vice-president Kamala Harris and Trump all opposed the deal while on the campaign trail, concerned that it would threaten thousands of union jobs.\n\nAs a result, Nippon Steel launched a grassroots political campaign to bring workers and local elected officials on side. The effort helped persuade Trump who reversed his decision, hosting a rally last month to celebrate the “blockbuster agreement” at US Steel’s Pittsburgh headquarters.\n\nThe Japanese steelmaker has committed to keeping US Steel’s headquarters in the industrial city. Nippon Steel also said that a majority of US Steel’s board of directors will be US citizens, and so will top executives like its chief executive.\n\n“We share President Trump’s commitment to protect the future of the American steel industry, American workers and American national security, and we look forward to building a stronger and brighter future for US Steel,” said Nippon Steel’s vice chair Takahiro Mori.\n\nIn the final days before the transaction contractually needed to close, Nippon Steel agreed to a so-called “golden share” for the US government, handing the White House veto power over key business decisions in an unprecedented move.

The union hopes obtain a deal by next Tuesday.\n\n“We call on management at CBS to bargain in good faith and reach a fair deal with the union by the current last scheduled bargaining date of June 24, 2025,” WGA East added. \n\nBack in April, WGA members at CBS News’ over 270 member bargaining unit voted to ratify a new collective bargaining agreement with the network. The three-year deal covers newswriters, producers, promotions writer-producers, editors, graphic artists and news desk associates who work in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The sticking point of the deal was AI and its role in the newsroom. The deal featured several AI safeguards, including protections for staffers who lose their jobs as a result of AI, a 3% annual raise and more vacation time for first-year employees.\n\nHowever, CBS News Digital employees, which covers staffers who work for CBSNews.com, it’s mobile website, social media channels and the CBS News app have yet to receive the same protections.\n\nKathy McGee, WGAE Vice President of Broadcast/Cable/Streaming News and a writer/producer at CBS News New York, said in February of 2024 of the decision to unionize, “The WGAE already represents workers at CBS News and CBS News Streaming, and it is incumbent on CBS’s management to recognize CBS News Digital’s demand for voluntary recognition of their union.”\n\n“We are seeing unprecedented mergers, consolidation and layoffs in the news industry,” McGee continued in the initial statement. “Journalists are telling stories and lifting voices in communities that are often ignored. The most responsible thing media workers can do is to form a union to win critical workplace protection.”\n\nAt the time a CBS News spokesperson told TheWrap, “We have great respect for our Digital News team and highly value their contributions to our organization. We are currently reviewing the matter and we look forward to working through this process.”\n\nThe CBS News Digital Union expressed their reasons for unionizing in an internal memo to management last year, titled “Why We’re Organizing.” The guild asked for transparency, equitable and fair compensation and benefits, diversity, and editorial standards. “As a union, we want to ensure that all of CBS News Digital’s staff are protected and treated fairly as we continue on this journey together. We look forward to meeting you at the bargaining table,” the guild said.\n\nRead the full memo below to management below:\n\nWe are reporters, writers, editors, digital and social media producers, push and platform editors and more. We are writers and thinkers and above all, journalists. We are dedicated and passionate people with a commitment to the truth. We are CBS News Digital and we have formed a union. Here’s why we’re organizing with the Writers Guild of America East:\n\nWe have the support of an overwhelming majority of our colleagues at CBS News Digital, and we are asking for voluntary recognition by the company.\n\nThe dedicated cohort at CBS News Digital thrives on bringing timely news and information to the public. We work 24/7/365 to keep Americans informed about the changes that could impact their daily lives, but perhaps most importantly, we truly care about the work that we do, and want to have long, fruitful and fulfilling careers here.\n\nWe love what we do and we are committed to working at CBS News.\n\nWe want to continue working and making a living in a tumultuous business, and we want the same commitment from CBS News. When we work together to address these issues, we are stronger as employees and it will make for a better product and workplace.\n\nAs a union, we hope to address these issues:\n\nTransparency: Open and honest communication is essential in our industry, and we want to ensure that management is consulting with employees on major decisions that affect CBS News Digital.\n\nEquitable and Fair Compensation and Benefits: We want to ensure that we are being paid fair, respectable and liveable salaries. We need clear and comprehensive job descriptions, competitive compensation, fair benefits and financial recognition for taking on extra projects and working holidays, weekends and nights. We want a standard for raises and a streamlined pathway to grow within CBS News.\n\nDiversity: To create content that is truly reflective of America, we need to have a diverse and inclusive team. It is vital to our mission as journalists to show all viewpoints and have employees from all backgrounds. We want a workplace where every employee is treated equally and will receive the respect they deserve.\n\nEditorial standards: As employees of one of the most prestigious and well-respected news organizations in the world, excellence is demanded of us every day. We want standard guidelines around what will be produced editorially and be allowed to produce outstanding quality journalism.\n\nBy joining together as a union and collectively creating a contract, we want to make sure our voices are heard as we navigate through this exciting but constantly changing industry.\n\nAs a union, we want to ensure that all of CBS News Digital’s staff are protected and treated fairly as we continue on this journey together. We look forward to meeting you at the bargaining table!\n\nCBS News has been embroiled in drama from all sides. The network’s parent company Paramount Global is working toward as acquisition deal from Skydance. The media giant’s executives have said that the deal, which is currently awaiting regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses, is expected to close in the first half of 2025. CBS is also involved in a $20 billion legal battle with President Donald Trump. The president’s lawsuit takes aim at an Oct. 7 “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he has claimed was deceptively edited to make her look good. CBS News has maintained that Trump’s accusations of deceitful editing were false\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently shot down Paramount’s offer to settle the lawsuit for $15 million, with the president aiming to get at least $25 million and an apology.","summary":"The unionized journalist, editors and social media producers call on management to meet \"in good faith\" ahead of their current last scheduled bargaining date of June 24\n\n\nThe post CBS News Digital Staffers Say Fight for Contract Improvements Continue a Year After WGA Unionization | Exclusive appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/cbs-news-wga-east-contract-fight-one-year-after-unionization/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-36.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 14:00:00","author":"Daren Defrank","authors":["Daren Defrank"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.263},{"id":332710790,"title":"Pam Bondi Asked To Investigate 2024 Election Results","text":"U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been asked by a Republican congressman to investigate \"credible claims\" that an elections service provider breached protocols during the 2024 election.Representative Abe Hamadeh of Arizona requested an investigation into the handling of ballots by Arizona-based Runbeck Election Services in several western states, according to a news release from his office.Newsweek has contacted the Department of Justice (DOJ) for comment via a contact form on its website as well as Hamadeh's office and Runbeck Election Services via email.Why It MattersHamadeh's call for a federal investigation comes as election integrity remains a concern for voters and elected officials following the 2024 election, in which Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.The DOJ has taken action in recent weeks to address concerns about election integrity, including demanding election records dating to 2020 from Colorado. FBI Director Kash Patel said on Monday that he has shared documents with lawmakers that reportedly detail \"alarming\" though unsubstantiated allegations about potential Chinese interference in the 2020 election.Meanwhile, a legal challenge questioning the accuracy of the 2024 election results in Rockland County, New York, is moving forward.What To KnowIn his letter to Bondi, Hamadeh pointed to what he said were credible reports that boxes of printed blank ballots from several states were improperly mixed with returned mail ballots that were in the process of being prepared for tabulation in Runbeck's warehouse.He did not provide any details about the origin of the allegations, which have not been confirmed.He requested that the DOJ investigate the circumstances surrounding the mixing of the ballots at the warehouse, security measures that were in place to prevent such incidents and whether they were followed and the potential impact on the accuracy of election results in Arizona's Maricopa County and elsewhere.Hamadeh's office also pointed to Patel's turning over of documents about an alleged plan for China to mass-produce fake driver's licenses and ship them to the U.S. to make fake mail-in ballots.What People Are SayingRepresentative Abe Hamadeh, in a statement: \"This alarming situation raises serious questions about the security and integrity of the election process in Maricopa County and potentially beyond.\"The comingling of blank ballots with live ballots poses a significant risk to the accuracy and fairness of election results. It is crucial that we have confidence in the integrity of our elections, and any potential mishandling of ballots must be investigated to ensure that the will of the voters is accurately reflected.\"Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science at Northeastern University, previously told Newsweek: \"Irregularities in elections should always be investigated, but the sources of such inconsistencies, which can include error or miscalculation, are not always nefarious. Mistakes can happen.\"What Happens NextThe DOJ has not yet issued a response to Hamadeh's request for an investigation.","summary":"Bondi has been asked to investigate \"credible claims\" that an elections service provider breached protocols during the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/pam-bondi-asked-investigate-2024-election-results-2087246","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2665774/pam-bondi-asked-investigate-2024-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 13:30:02","author":"Khaleda Rahman","authors":["Khaleda Rahman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":332734586,"title":"He donated the land that became Griffith Park. Then he shot his wife","text":"Surely you are familiar with the sprawling, rugged glory of Los Angeles’ Griffith Park. But do you know about the park’s benefactor and namesake, Griffith J. Griffith? The philanthropist and felon endowed L.A. with what was then the largest urban park in the world and still remains a jewel of the city. He also shot his wife in the face. She survived; he served two years at San Quentin; they divorced. We’ll get to that. But first, let’s rewind back to December 1896. Los Angeles was a city with great ambitions — a rapidly exploding boomtown that was still in the process of leaving its rancho past behind. Col. Griffith J. Griffith and his wife Tina were the talk of the town, often spotted at theater openings or the opera. She was from a prominent society family. He was a formerly penniless Welsh immigrant who’d made his fortune in mining and other ventures. Our paper described Griffith as “part visionary and part blowhard.” One acquaintance dubbed him as “midget egomaniac,” another as a “roly-poly pompous little fellow.” He was, by all accounts, bizarre. His business card just read: \"G.J. Griffith, capitalist.\" He insisted on being called “Colonel,” though his military title was thought to be entirely phony. On December 16, 1896, Tina and Griffith donated more than 3,000 acres of hilly splendor to be used as an L.A. public park. The massive, city-altering gift was several times larger than New York's Central Park. “It must be made a place of rest and relaxation for the masses, a resort for the rank and file, for the plain people,” Griffith demanded at the time. Griffith was grandiose and eccentric, but he also believed in shaping the fledgling city, according to Mike Eberts, a historian and author of \"Griffith Park: A Centennial History.\" \"He was a fellow who wanted to be loved. He wanted to be seen as a great leader. He was also, in his own way, and for his time, something of an idealist,\" Eberts said. Some believed that Griffith’s mighty bequest was also angled, in part, to dodge taxes. But for generations of Angelenos who’ve savored the park, such details are — like Griffith’s military title — mere semantics. The initial gift brought him great acclaim locally. Here’s how our paper put it in 1898: “No need to ask ‘Who is G.J. Griffith?’ The individuality of the man has impressed itself so deeply and favorably on this community that his name is even as a ‘household word.’” While thought to be in a delusional — and potentially drunken — stupor in a room at Santa Monica’s Arcadia Hotel, Griffith shot his wife in the face in 1903. She lost an eye but lived. Our paper breathlessly covered the ensuing trial, which ended with Griffith taking a short trip to San Quentin. A few years after his release, Griffith (now divorced, according to Eberts) appeared at City Hall once again bearing gifts just before Christmas and hoping to rehabilitate his tarnished image. “I wish to pay my debt of duty in this way to the community in which I have prospered,” Griffith reportedly told the mayor and City Council as he offered a significant sum of money to build Griffith Observatory. They accepted, though our paper reported that other citizens and public officials angrily protested the decision. One prominent community member suggested that the “bribe” would send an egregious message to the city's youth: “Are you prepared to say to them that if a man is a millionaire he can commit a crime and then with his wealth bribe the community to receive him back into fellowship?” The city’s parks commission eventually rejected Griffith’s gift, our paper reported, and it wasn’t until after his death in 1919 that it was accepted as a bequest in his will. The observatory celebrated its 90th birthday this year. For Eberts, the takeaway is simple: \"You don't have to be a perfect person to do a great thing.\" Despite myriad challenges — including a sprawling homeless population and its reputation as a sometimes dodgy place to live and work — downtown L.A. is staging a comeback by attracting a steady stream of new residents.Occupancy in downtown apartments has remained about 90% for more than a year, slightly higher than the level before the pandemic.A sweep near 120th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard this month was one of several that took place in working-class Hawthorne; all part of an immigration enforcement blitz in Southern California that has mostly affected workers living in the country illegally — similar to those that President Trump has employed in the past.The incident, which was captured on video and shared on social media along with subsequent raids in the South Bay suburb, has sparked outrage, fear and anxiety in a town where half the population is Latino.Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial in New York City includes an allegation that he was involved in mob family-style racketeering with coercion, kidnapping, threats and beatings done to cover up a pattern of sexual assaults, sex trafficking and prostitution.Prosecutors have so far called nearly 30 witnesses to the stand in Manhattan and are expected to finish up with witnesses this week.They include three women who described graphic sexual assaults, including key witness and Combs’ onetime lover, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura. It was Ventura’s lawsuit in 2023 that set off the unraveling of the Combs enterprise with its details of sex, violence and \"freak-offs.\"Wildfire threatens structures in eastern San Diego County; evacuations have been ordered.As the summer harvest season launches, confusion and uncertainty hang over California fields.How Mexican supermarket chains and food merchants are standing up for immigrants.Gardeners on ICE raids: ‘People are afraid, but they still have to work.’‘Largest jewelry heist in U.S. history’: 7 indicted in massive Brink’s job.Heat advisory is extended.

But pessimism was higher for women even among Republicans and independents, according to a new Harris poll.\n\nOverall, 62% of women and 47% of men said that the economy and inflation is getting worse, a gap of 15 percentage points. The gender gap crossed party lines with both Democratic and Republican women expressing greater concerns about the economy than men did.\n\n“Here’s what everyone missed: women aren’t being pessimistic about the economy – they’re being realistic,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer of Harris Poll. “Women are experiencing the sharp edge of inflation on essentials like groceries and childcare in ways that stock portfolios can’t capture.”\n\nThe news will be worrying for the Trump administration. Women are more likely than men to be registered to vote and to show up at the polls. While Trump made gains among women in the 2024 election, women were still 10% more likely to vote for Kamala Harris. Recent analysis has shown that much of Trump’s win can be attributed to gains made among men, particularly non-white men.\n\nAcross a series of questions about their outlook on the state of the economy, most respondents (78%) – both men and women – expressed concerns about the amount of uncertainty, particularly around prices.\n\nYet women appear to be bearing the brunt of Trump’s economic policy, particularly around his tariffs.\n\nPrevious research has shown that women are more likely to feel the impacts of inflation because of broader gender inequality, including gaps in pay and household responsibilities.\n\nWhile a majority of respondents said they were primarily responsible for their household’s shopping, more women (71%) than men (62%) reported being their household’s primary shopper.\n\nThis difference in household shopping responsibility translates into broader gaps in concern over affordability and prices:\n\n More women said they are very worried about food prices (52% of women compared to 39% of men)\n\n More women said they’re spending more time trying to find deals or go to more affordable stores (36% versus 26%)\n\n More women said their financial security is getting worse because of their difficulty in affording essential goods and services (55% versus 46%)\n\nThe differences increased when respondents were asked about their comfort in affording their lifestyles in the current economy, including affording a family, a home, life as a single individual, and childcare. Just 27% of women said they felt comfortable affording a family now, compared to 43% of men.\n\nAlthough confidence in switching jobs was low among all respondents, 34% of men were confident in a job switch compared to 25% of women. Women are also more pessimistic about receiving a meaningful raise this year: 54% of women said they think they’ll get a raise, compared to 63% of men.\n\nLack of confidence in the economy can impact people’s behavior, particularly the big milestones they can make in their lives. They are more likely to delay buying homes, starting a family or switching jobs.\n\n“We’re witnessing a generation living in what we call ‘anticipatory financial distress’,” said Rodney. “This isn’t a casual concern; it’s the mental equivalent of holding your breath underwater, waiting for the surface.”\n\nWhat makes up “the economy” for one person can be completely different than what it means for another. For some, the economy can largely be defined by how the US stock market is doing; for many others, it’s the price of their weekly grocery bill.\n\nOver the last few years, certain parts of the economy thrived, while others caused serious pain. The stock market reached record highs, and the wealth of the ultrarich soared. At the same time, the labor market has remained relatively stable, with the unemployment rate staying at about 4%.\n\nBut even as Americans were holding onto their jobs, prices skyrocketed, particularly in 2022, when the inflation rate hit a decades-high of 9.1%. In attempts to bring inflation down, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which ultimately made borrowing money, particularly for a mortgage, much more expensive than it had been during the pandemic.\n\nPrevious Harris polls conducted before the 2024 US election had shown that pessimism under the Biden administration was high. Many Americans appeared to blame the White House for the high inflation, even though inflation eventually came down to under 3% in 2023 and 2024.\n\nSo far in his second term, Trump has primarily used tariffs as his main tool to balance out the economy, arguing that tariffs will increase domestic manufacturing. So far, many companies have said they will instead pass the price increases onto consumers. Recent data has shown that inflation hasn’t climbed yet, but economists warn that many companies stockpiled in anticipation of tariffs, and price increases could continue into the summer.\n\nThis survey was conducted online within the US by The Harris Poll from 22 to 31 May 2025, among a nationally representative sample of 4,208 US adults.","summary":"Exclusive: poll shows 62% of women and 47% of men across political spectrum say economy and inflation getting worse\n\nWomen across the political spectrum are more concerned about the state of the US economy and inflation under Donald Trump than men are, according to a new exclusive poll for the Guardian.\n\nMore Democrats than Republicans are now concerned about the economy following the president’s return to power.

Hortman and her husband Mark, while Senator Hoffman and his wife Yvette remain in hospital.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and former VP pick to presidential candidate Kamala Harris branded the shootings as being 'politically motivated' and condemned the attack.\n\nHe said: \"Hortman was someone who served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, humor, and a sense of service.\n\n\"She was a formidable public servant. A fixture and a giant in Minnesota.\"\n\nHowever, when questioned by reporters about the incident and whether he would be speaking to Walz, Donald Trump had a less compassionate answer.\n\nReferring to Walz, he said: “I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling him.\n\n\"Why would I call him? I could call and say, 'Hi, how you doing?' Uh, the guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. I could be nice and call, but why waste time?\"\n\nThe spokesperson for Walz, Teddy Tschann, hit back at Trump’s comments later that day.\n\nThey said: “Gov. Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn’t about Trump or Walz. It’s about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the Governor remains focused on helping all three heal.”\n\nPeople online had a similar reaction and condemned Trump for his comments.\n\nOne furious user on Reddit wrote: “What a vile POS Trump is.”\n\nAnother frustrated person added: “A state senator is MURDERED and Trump won’t speak to the leaders of that state. The amount of damage he continues to do to our society is astounding. He’s the most un-American leader we’ve EVER had.”\n\nA third commented: “Beyond despicable. I can't imagine any other president being so callous. Trump is the epitome of a narcissist, zero empathy. POS.”\n\nWhile another said: “If they were GOP that were shot/killed, Trump wouldn't care about them but he would use that to try and further divide us, but since they were just Dems, no big deal, he wasn't affected in any way. Don't forget, this is the 'what's in it for me' administration.”\n\nWith a fifth person writing: “I know we say this all the time, but imagine if Biden or Obama had said that about a sitting governor when they were President. The outcry would have been through the roof. Trump had developed his own norms so it’s not even questioned anymore.”\n\nUNILAD has reached out to the White House for comment.","summary":"![CDATA[People have hit back at Trump for his incompassionate response]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-response-minnesota-assassination-tim-waltz-021395-20250618","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt36b6ee7e90d177a3/685292fc807efd15b91be604/people-digusted-trump-democratic-lawmaker-murder-vi","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 10:53:40","author":"Gerrard Kaonga","authors":["Gerrard Kaonga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":332646870,"title":"Minnesota Incidents Increase Concerns Over Growing Political Violence","text":"The shootings of two Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota are the latest incidents to raise worries about the threat of political violence in the U.S.\n\nExperts warn that the attacks, which follow an assassination attempt against President Trump and an arson at the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), are part of a broader pattern of political violence that could be on the rise amid heightened polarization as the midterms near.\n\n“Each act has its own unique horror about it, and the details are uniquely awful. But in terms of the big picture, it’s the latest in what’s become a pattern of politically motivated attacks,” said Matt Dallek, a George Washington University historian and professor.\n\n“For decades, we’ve been living in an era of partisan polarization, and the polarization has gotten worse over time, and that means that the general political climate has also coarsened and become more toxic.” \n\nMinnesota state Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman (D) and her husband, Mark Hortman, were killed in their home on Saturday in what the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota labeled “a political assassination” and “the stuff of nightmares.” State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette Hoffman, were also shot and seriously injured. \n\nA specific ideological motivation remains unclear, but officials revealed that the now-arrested suspect had traveled to the homes of additional Minnesota state politicians and filled notebooks with dozens of additional lawmakers’ names. \n\nThe tragedy underscored the threat environment for political figures at all levels. It came just a few weeks after an arson attack at the Pennsylvania governor’s residence, in which the suspect who set the fire the night after a Passover Seder allegedly “harbored hatred” against Shapiro, according to officials.\n\nLast year, then-candidate Trump was grazed by a bullet when a gunman attempted to assassinate him at a small-town Pennsylvania campaign rally. In 2022, Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) husband was wounded by an assailant looking for the then-Speaker. In April of that same year, a man pleaded guilty to an attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n“We saw a lot of political violence in the ’60s and ’70s and even in the ’80s, and then they kind of disappeared in the ’90s and 2000s. And so this feels different, having a number of instances in the past year or so,” said Jillian Peterson, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Minnesota’s Hamline University and executive director of the Violence Prevention Project. \n\nDirect cause-and-effect lines are hard to draw, but the latest incidents come against a backdrop of intense political polarization and increasingly toxic rhetoric on the national stage. \n\n“We see increasing demonization and delegitimizing political rivals. We see increasing language that portray political rivals as an existential threat to the nation, for democracy and so on. We see increasing … animosity towards people who hold different political views,” said Arie Perliger, an expert on political violence and extremism at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\nAs discourse becomes more virulent, political figures are increasingly perceived as “symbols” of policy and ideas, Perliger said, noting that Trump has been “a major factor” in fostering that perception.\n\nTrump has repeatedly hurled names and insults onto the political stage, casting rivals as enemies and taking heat for dehumanizing language against immigrants. Across the aisle, Democrats have pitched Trump and Republican policies as a threat to democracy.\n\n“If you are consistently portraying the other side as a threat, it’s no wonder that eventually there’s some people who take that to the point where they say, ‘OK, if the other side is a threat, violence against the other side is justified. That’s the only way to save the country,’” Perliger said. “I think both sides could learn from becoming much more responsible.”\n\nIn the wake of the Minnesota shootings, Trump joined a chorus of condemnation from both sides of the aisle, saying “such horrific violence will not be tolerated” in the U.S. \n\nFormer President Biden said “this heinous attack motivated by politics should never happen in America.” Former Vice President Kamala Harris urged that “the hate and division that dominate our political discourse must end.” House GOP Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) stressed that “no public official or any American should fear for their safety in their own home.” Others have called to turn down the temperature. \n\nBut the flood of condemnation that comes after violent incidents, experts said, doesn’t offset divisive political rhetoric year-round. \n\nThe current moment seems to lack “a particularly serious effort to seek any sort of reconciliation or unity or sustained condemnation of this kind of violence,” said Dallek. He pointed out that Trump has said he won’t call Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) in the wake of the incident, knocking the blue state leader as “whacked out.” \n\nThere’s also a growing cultural normalization of violence across the board.\n\nBack in December, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in New York City. This week, a satirical musical based on Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old charged with the killing, opened in San Fransisco. \n\n“I’m not sure if it’s a great thing to make people who are murderers cultural heroes. I don’t think it’s the best idea, as much as we can have different views about their motivations and so on,” said Perliger.\n\nAnd among Trump’s first moves of his second term were sweeping pardons for hundreds convicted in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. \n\nThough details are still unfolding about the Minnesota shootings, they raise warning signs and security concerns for political figures ahead of what’s set to be a high-stakes midterm fight for both parties. \n\nThe risk goes up “the more that these types of really heated or hate-filled types of political rhetoric make it into the public sphere and of course, during election cycles that happens more,” said Peterson. \n\n“It’s sort of that violence begets violence, and so if we don’t start to really tone down the rhetoric … I think it’s time to really take that seriously as we move into this next election cycle,” she said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe shootings of two Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota are the latest incidents&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Minnesota Incidents Increase Concerns Over Growing Political Violence first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/minnesota-incidents-increase-concerns-over-growing-political-violence/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Minnesota-attacks-add-to-fears-of-rising.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 10:21:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":332875240,"title":"Trump to Extend US TikTok Ban Deadline, White House Says","text":"TikTok will live on for at least another three months in the United States, as President Donald Trump is poised to extend a sale or ban deadline for the third time since taking office this year.\n\"President Trump will sign an additional Executive Order this week to keep TikTok up and running,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday.\nThe popular video sharing app was supposed to be banned in the US after its Chinese owner, ByteDance, refused to sell it to a US buyer by a January deadline.\nTikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the BBC.\nLeavitt said the 90-day extension would \"ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.\"\nBefore Leavitt's announcement, Trump told the BBC that he would \"probably\" extend the TikTok deadline.\n\"We'll probably have to get China approval,\" Trump said. \"I think we'll get it.

Is there a takeaway for Kamala Harris?","text":"Decades ago, Pete Wilson did something unusual. The U.S. senator came home to run for California governor. The path to power typically goes the opposite direction, with governors trading the statehouse for the (perceived) influence and prestige of being one of just 100 members of a club that fancies itself — not so humbly or precisely — as \"the world's greatest deliberative body.\" Wilson bucked that sentiment. \"It is a much more difficult role,\" he said of being governor, and one he came to much prefer over his position on Capitol Hill. It turns out that Wilson, a Republican who narrowly prevailed in a fierce 1990 contest against Democrat Dianne Feinstein, was onto something. Since, then five other lawmakers have left the Senate to become their state's governor. Several more tried and failed. Although it's still more common for a governor to run for Senate than vice versa, in 2026 as many as three sitting U.S. senators may run for governor, the most in at least 90 years, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Clearly, the U.S. Senate has lost some of its luster. There have always been those who found the place, with its pretentious airs, dilatory pacing and stultifying rules of order, a frustrating environment to work in, much less thrive. The late Wendell Ford, who served a term as Kentucky governor before spending the next 24 years in the Senate, used to say \"the unhappiest members of the Senate were the former governors,\" recalled Charlie Cook, founder of the eponymous political newsletter. \"They were used to getting things done.\" And that, as Cook noted, \"was when the Senate did a lot more than it does now.\" What's more, the Senate used to be a more dignified, less partisan place — especially when compared with the fractious House. An apocryphal story has George Washington breakfasting with Thomas Jefferson and referring to the Senate as a saucer intended to cool the passions of the intemperate lower chamber. (It helps to picture a teacup filled with scalding brew.) These days, both chambers are bubbling cauldrons of animosity and partisan backbiting. Worse, there's not a whole lot of advising going in the Senate, which reflexively consents to pretty much whatever it is that President Trump asks of the prostrated Republican majority. \"The Senate has become an employment agency where we just have vote after vote after vote to confirm nominees that are are going to pass, generally, 53 to 47, with very rare exceptions,\" said Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat who's running to be governor of his home state. The other announced gubernatorial hopeful is Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican who's made no secret of his distaste for Washington after a single term. Tennessee's Marsha Blackburn, a fellow Republican fresh off reelection, is also expected to run for governor in her state. Bennet arrived in the Senate 16 years ago and since then, he said, it's been \"really a one-way ratchet down.\" \"You think about the fact that we're really down to a couple [of] bills a year,\" he said this week between votes on Capitol Hill. \"One is a continuing resolution that isn't even a real appropriations bill ... it's just cementing the budget decisions that were made last year, and then the defense bill.\" Despite all that, Bennet said he's not running for governor \"because I'm worn out. It's not because I'm frustrated or bored or irritated or aggravated\" with life in the Senate, \"though the Senate can be a very aggravating place to work.\" Rather, working beneath the golden dome in Denver would offer a better opportunity \"to push back and to fight Trumpism,\" he said, by offering voters a practical and affirmative Democratic alternative. Try that as one of 47 straitjacketed senators. When Wilson took office in January 1991, he succeeded the term-limited George Deukmejian, a fellow Republican. He immediately faced a massive budget deficit, which he closed through a package of tax hikes and spending cuts facilitated by his negotiating partner, Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. Their agreement managed to antagonize Democrats and Republicans alike. Wilson didn't much care. After serving in the Legislature, as San Diego mayor and a U.S. senator, he often said being California governor was the best job he ever had. There are legislators to wrangle, agencies to oversee, natural disasters to address, interest groups to fend off — all while trying to stay in the good graces of millions of often cranky, impatient voters. \"Not everybody enjoys it,\" Wilson said when asked about the prospect of Kamala Harris serving as governor, \"and not everyone is good at it.\" Harris, who served four years in the Senate before ascending to the vice presidency, has given herself the summer to decide whether to run for governor, try again for the White House or retire from politics altogether. California's next governor will probably have to take some \"very painful steps,\" Wilson said, given the dicey economic outlook and the likelihood of federal budget cuts and other hostile moves by the Trump administration. That will make a lot of people unhappy, including many of Harris' fellow Democrats. How would she feel about returning to Sacramento's small stage, wrestling with intractable issues such as the budget and homelessness, and dealing with the inevitable political heat? We won't know until and unless Harris runs.","summary":"Lawmakers are following a path taken by Pete Wilson, who left the Senate to become California governor.

He's flirting with it as president","text":"President Donald Trump has tried to strong-arm pharmaceutical companies into lowering drug prices by executive order. He has publicly warned Walmart not to raise prices in response to his tariffs, while privately sending automakers the same message. His administration has signaled that farmers could get bailed out from any market damage caused by his push to remake the world’s trade order.\n\nAnd last week, the president touted what amounts to quasi-nationalization of steel manufacturing. “We have a golden stock, we have a golden share, which I control, or a president controls,” Trump said about the pending sale of U.S. Steel to Japan’s Nippon Steel. “That gives you total control.”\n\nTrump’s “golden share” in U.S. Steel, negotiated as part of a long-delayed sale, extends for perpetuity, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. It hands Trump or his designee veto power to ensure steel production reaches a certain level and that jobs aren’t moved outside the U.S., among other matters at U.S. Steel. The company will soon be a Nippon subsidiary. \n\nDuring his campaign for president last year, Trump railed against socialism, often criticizing his political opponents as “communists” and “Marxists.” When then-Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned on cracking down on price gouging for groceries, he attacked her as “Comrade Kamala.”\n\nBut as president, Trump has been comfortable deploying the power of government to achieve specific economic outcomes, diverging from the GOP's traditional hands-off, free-market approach. He has taken public and sometimes aggressive steps to exercise greater control over the behavior and decisions of publicly-traded companies. Call it Trump-style socialism, with the president casting aside the invisible hand of Adam Smith and putting himself in charge instead.\n\n“Several of Trump’s policies lean toward central control rather than market incentives,” said Erica York, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. “Whether it’s the deal with U.S. Steel, the country and industry specific tariffs, or the carveouts in the tax code for certain industries and types of work, too many of the administration’s policies lean toward greater degrees of government involvement in economic decision-making.”\n\n\"It's just 'L'état, c'est moi,' right? Trump is the state,\" said Scott Lincicome, the vice president for economics and trade at the libertarian Cato Institute, referring to a declaration attributed to French King Louis XIV. \"He's not a die-hard progressive leftist, but there are certain things he likes. There [are] certain things he wants to be in control of.\"\n\nBroadly defined, socialism entails the redistribution of wealth, policymakers picking economic winners and losers, and government controlling the means of production in lieu of businesses, among other tenets. In the U.S., as in many countries, elements of socialism already intermingle with capitalism, particularly in social insurance for the elderly and the collection of taxes to finance public roads and public schools. \n\n“Now I don’t think the end goal is socialism,” York said of Trump’s actions, “but the Trump administration is no stranger to using ‘tools’ of government to intervene in the private market.”\n\nLast month, Trump talked about the U.S. economy as if it were a supermarket with him having final say over prices. “We are a department store, and we set the price,” Trump told Time magazine. “I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price… and they can pay it, or they don’t have to pay it.”\n\nHe cast himself as the chief executive directly managing everything for the public. “I am this giant store. It’s a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there,” he said. “And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay.”\n\nAs Trump has sought to broaden his reach, he hasn’t shied from targeting specific companies. He lambasted Walmart after its CEO Doug McMillon warned that tariffs could drive price increases for its products. Trump posted on social media within days that the company should “‘EAT THE TARIFFS.” Apple CEO Tim Cook also drew the president's ire last month, after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on iPhones not produced in the U.S. \n\nThat kept up a tendency from his first term to rail against multinational companies or prod them to change course if he perceives them to be an obstacle to his goals. The roster of targets back then included Amazon, Boeing, General Motors, and Harley-Davidson. At one point in 2019, then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pushed companies to diversify their supply chains beyond China during Trump’s first trade war.\n\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who regularly communicates with top CEOs, said Trump has employed a “divide and conquer” strategy that's kept firms from adopting stances that might put a Trump-sized target on their backs.\n\n“CEOs are very frustrated because they don't want to speak out individually, or else you get attacked like these law firms or universities who do speak out,” Sonnenfeld said, referring to Trump’s attacks against Harvard University and prominent law firms.\n\nNow Trump is empowering the government to influence an American company's core operations. That doesn't usually happen outside a period of emergency. The U.S. government last took a golden share in the federal rescue of General Motors following the 2008 financial crisis. The managing stake in U.S. Steel would align the U.S. closer to countries such as China and Brazil, which own golden shares in prized strategic industries. \n\n\"What they have done is, in a very elaborate way, nationalized U.S. Steel,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum. \"And that's not something a genuine conservative would do. That's a lot like being a Peronista from Argentina.\"\n\nThere is a twist to Trump-style socialism. To the extent it redistributes wealth, it's poised to flow upward. An analysis on the Trump-backed megabill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the top 10% of U.S. households would gain $12,000. The poorest 10% of families lose out on $1,600. Democrats are lambasting the GOP's megabill as a giveaway to the richest Americans.\n\n“This is caviar over kids,\" Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said, \"and Mar-a-Lago over the middle class.\" \n\n📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief","summary":"Trump has been comfortable deploying the power of government to achieve specific economic outcomes, diverging from the GOP's traditional free-market approach","url":"https://qz.com/trump-tariffs-trade-socialism-walmart-apple-us-steel","image":"https://qz.com/_next/static/media/logo-initials.7c4a39d5.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 09:00:00","author":"Joseph Zeballos-Roig","authors":["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":332588264,"title":"DNC Resignations Highlight Democrats’ Dysfunction ","text":"The Democratic Party has gotten itself into a mess because it’s evolved—or devolved—into a party fairly perceived as more concerned with the interests of the few and less concerned with the welfare and rights of the many.

He’s for you.” The anti-transgender message was obvious (and broadly popular), but the subtext was more important: Harris is for niche issues that excite activists while Trump is for the meat-and-potatoes concerns of the common American.","summary":"Why it matters that two union leaders have departed the Democratic National Committee.","url":"https://thedispatch.com/article/democrats-disarray-randi-weingarten-dnc/","image":"https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2204968832.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 06:43:00","author":"Jonah Goldberg","authors":["Jonah Goldberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.044},{"id":332535288,"title":"UFC champion Sean Strickland turns on Trump as president weighs up dramatic action against Iran","text":"UFC champion Sean Strickland turns on Trump as president weighs up dramatic action against Iran\n\nREAD MORE: Conor McGregor brutally floors partygoer with two punches\n\nBy ISABEL BALDWIN\n\nPublished: 04:58 BST, 18 June 2025 | Updated: 05:02 BST, 18 June 2025\n\nFormer UFC Champion Sean Strickland has made his stance on the United States' involvement in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran clear. \n\nUS president Donald Trump reportedly is weighing up whether to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites, it emerged earlier on Tuesday. \n\nBut Strickland, who has previously expressed his support of the president, hit out as he suggested Trump was neglecting the wishes of those who elected him to office. \n\nThe 34-year-old replied to a social media post from Trump, in which the Commander-in-Chief had boasted about the US military taking 'complete and total control over the skies of Iran.'\n\n'America doesn't want to be involved in Israel's war......

Gavin Newsom is running for President","text":"This column was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nAfter 6 1/2 years of denying any interest in running for president, Gavin Newsom has finally fessed up.\n\nIn a flurry of media interviews keyed to anti-Donald Trump demonstrations in Los Angeles and elsewhere, Newsom has acknowledged what everyone in and around national politics had already assumed — that he’s entertaining a White House bid.\n\nThe most explicit of several hints was published in the Wall Street Journal. Responding to a question about his presidential ambitions, Newsom said, “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.”\n\nThat’s in keeping with the time-worn playbook for politicians who look in the mirror and see a president staring back. They shun naked ambition and portray themselves as reluctantly offering to serve the nation in its moment of crisis, whatever that might be.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Newsom, in an address broadcast live by CNN, warned that Trump’s sweeping campaign to arrest undocumented immigrants was such a crisis, saying “other states are next.”\n\n “This is about all of us. This is about you,” Newsom said. “It’s time for all of us to stand up.”\n\nNewsom uttered a similar theme in his Wall Street Journal interview. “I have a responsibility to combine passion with action, to stand tall and firm and defend the values that I hold dear, that I think the vast majority of Americans hold dear, and assert myself in this moral moment,” he said.\n\nTrump’s anti-immigrant drive is a political gift to Newsom, providing a springboard for him to fill a vacuum and claim leadership of the opposition to Trump. The Democratic Party has been unable, in the seven months since losing the White House, to curb its internal power struggles. Nor have political media anointed any of the potential candidates to succeed Trump as the frontrunner.\n\nIt would be fair to say that Newsom, who has been cultivating a national image ever since winning re-election in 2022, would probably start ahead of most would-be rivals for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhether he would finish ahead, and go on to win the presidency, is another matter. The road to the White House is long and winding, with plenty of opportunities to stumble — as the career of another Californian, Kamala Harris, attests.\n\nAssuming that Newsom’s hints mean he’s a candidate, in the final 18 months of his governorship he’ll be juggling a day job and a side gig, which is likely to diminish his standing in California, which is mediocre at best.\n\nA recent poll by UC-Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies found that by a 2-1 margin, California voters already believe Newsom is more focused on running for president than in fixing the state’s problems.\n\n “People kind of look at him as being very ambitious,” poll director Mark DiCamillo said about Newsom.\n\nA Newsom presidential campaign would be something of a referendum on California. Its serious social and economic problems, which have not markedly improved during Newsom’s governorship, would be campaign fodder for Democratic rivals and, if he were to win the nomination, for the Republican candidate.\n\nVideo clips of California cities’ squalid encampments of the homeless, the smash-and-grab robberies and the sometimes violent demonstrations against Trump’s immigration sweeps would bolster the sour image that those in other states already have of California. Elect Newsom, his rivals would say, if you want the nation to emulate California.\n\nBeing a Californian was one of the burdens Harris could not overcome last year. An ad featuring her advocacy of giving conversion surgery to transgender prison inmates was, it’s widely believed, the single most effective spot of the campaign.\n\nSaddle up. Win or lose, a Newsom campaign for the White House would be a bumpy ride.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

[The]\n\nlocal government, the state government and the federal government have to work together rather than fighting each other, fighting each other’s agendas and all of that stuff that doesn’t do good to anybody.”\n\nSecondly, Schwarzenegger stressed the need for immigration reform.\n\n“For decades now, this country has needed immigration reform, which means that we recognize the fact there’s people in the South of America that want to come North to work and that we therefore should supply them with enough visas so they can come, because we need those workers,” the FUBAR star said. “So this is the bottom line. Because then we would know who is here, we will be able to get rid of the criminal elements that are here and all this stuff, so we wouldn’t be in a mess that we’re in right now.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nForbesCarrie-Anne Moss: How Arnold Schwarzenegger, Keanu Reeves Are AlikeBy Tim Lammers\n\nAs such, Schwarzenegger — a Republican who backed former Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024 presidential election — noted that to create immigration reform, both major parties must do it together.\n\n“Democrats and Republicans have to come together and solve this issue if they really want to be public servants,” Schwarzenegger said. “If they want to be party servants, to be party hacks and be tight with their ideology, then it won’t happen.\n\n“But if you want to make this country better, and if you want to improve this country and improve the situation of people’s lives, and bring the prices down of this [and that], you will go and serve the people of America,” Schwarzenegger added. “This is what it is if you’re a public servant.

I mean, imagine I came over here at the age of 21 with absolutely nothing, and then to create a career like that,” Schwarzenegger said. “I mean, in no other country in the world could you do that. Every single thing, if it’s my bodybuilding career, if it’s my acting career, becoming governor, the beautiful family that I’ve created, all this is because America is strong.”\nForbesArnold Schwarzenegger And Carrie Anne-Moss On ‘FUBAR’ Season 2’s Tango Scene And MoreBy Tim Lammers\n\nWith the opportunities, Schwarzenegger explained to The View co-hosts, come responsibilities.\n\n“The key thing also is at the same time that we got to do things legally. That is the important thing. You got to do things legal[ly],” Schwarzenegger said. “And those people that are doing illegal things in America and they are foreigners, they are not smart because when you come to America, you’re a guest, and you have to behave like a guest.\n\n“Like when I go to someone’s house, I’m a guest, then they will do everything I can, keep things clean and to make my bed and to do everything that is the right thing to do, rather than committing a crime or being abusive or something like that,” Schwarzenegger added. “So, that doesn’t really work in this country.”\nForbes10 Arnold Schwarzenegger TV Moments To KnowBy Tim Lammers\n\nIn addition, Schwarzenegger noted how important to give back when you’re given opportunities.\n\n“I think the important thing is, when you become an immigrant, to think about, ‘Okay, I go to America because I want to use America for the great opportunities that America has in education, in jobs, creating a family, all of those kind of things,’ then you have to think about, ‘Okay, if I get all of those things from America, then I have to give something back.’” Schwarzenegger said.\n\n“You have a responsibility as an immigrant to give back to America and to pay back to America, and to go and do something for your community, for no money whatsoever, give something back to after school program, Special Olympics or whatever it is,\" he added. \"Make this country a better place.”\nForbesNetflix’s ‘Ginny & Georgia’: What Else Has Georgia Starred In?By Tim Lammers\n\nAfter his comments, The View co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Sunny Hostin chimed in, with Goldberg adding, “Don’t forget, 90% of the people who come here are doing the right thing, while Hostin said, “They’re less likely to commit crimes.”\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s entire segment on Tuesday’s episode of The View can be seen below.

Days after claiming the US had no direct involvement with Israel’s actions — attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities coupled with the assassination of several leadership figures and scientists — he made a series of posts that indicated otherwise, claiming “We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,” adding later:\n\nWe know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.\n\nAnd so, with the increasing likelihood of more direct US involvement in Israel’s attacks on Iran, perhaps the widest public chasm (on policy matters, rather than petty individual squabbles) has opened between Trump and his current and former supporters. Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon have both demanded Trump stick to his isolationist promises, and heavily MAGA/conspiracy theory representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted that “foreign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction. That’s not kooky. That’s what millions of Americans voted for. It’s what we believe is America First”.\n\nIf only they had some way of knowing what Trump would do in power — say, a four-year period in which he bombed Afghanistan and Syria, assassinated an Iranian military leader, launched thousands of drone strikes, and appointed a national security advisor with comically hawkish intent towards Iran.\n\nDespite this, it was an article of faith among every Trump supporter Crikey spoke to in our coverage of the 2024 election: the US had to stop getting involved in wars overseas, and Trump was the candidate most likely to achieve that.\n\nAt a rally in Michigan, on the Friday before the election, Trump told supporters, “I am the candidate of peace”, going so far as to add: “I am peace.” (“La paix, c’est moi … ” perhaps).\n\nHe argued at the same rally that if his opponent Kamala Harris won, “only death and destruction await because she is the candidate of endless wars”. And of course in this, and so much else, the Democrats made life so much easier for him, with Harris proudly claiming the endorsement of Iraq War architect and former vice president Dick Cheney and his similarly pro-war daughter Liz, as well as former staffers for Ronald Reagan.\n\nIt was in that context that Trump made remarks about how Cheney the younger was a “war hawk”, telling Tucker Carlson at an Arizona event:\n\n“I don’t want to go to war. [Liz Cheney] wanted to go, she wanted to stay in Syria. I took [troops] out. She wanted to stay in Iraq. I took them out. I mean, if it were up to her, we’d be in 50 different countries.” \n\nHe later added, “She is a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.”\n\nThis was widely represented in headlines as yet another fascist swipe from a man given to threats of violence against his political opponents. But that was not what voters understood him to mean.\n\nThe rhetoric continued after his victory — in his victory speech in Florida, Trump said “I’m not going to start wars, I’m going to stop wars”, and at his inauguration, after promising to liberate the US Army from “radical political theories and social experiments”, he said, to waves of applause:\n\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end — and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\n\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\n\nAs Bernard Keane pointed out in these pages, if we were to draw parallels between 1968 and 2024, the bitter stoking of racial grievances by George Wallace (who, incidentally, would also survive a later assassination attempt) is probably a better fit than the establishment-friendly Republican candidate Richard Nixon. But one thing Nixon and Trump do share, apart from authoritarian views on protest, is coming to office with a promise of peace.\n\nOf course, that analogy is every bit as ominous. Nixon followed his 1968 pledge with a further five years of war, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of bombs secretly dropped on Cambodia and Laos, tens of thousands more dead American soldiers and (at the lowest end of the estimates) hundreds of thousands of people killed by US forces across Indochina.","summary":"With the help of the electorate's short memories, Trump was able to sell himself as a peacemaker.

Katy Perry, Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong, Ivan Cornejo, and Finneas, are among the artists speaking out against the president’s deployment and ICE raids.\n\n Protests took place across the country over the last several weeks in opposition to the tactics the federal government has implemented to target immigrant communities.\n\n Bad Bunny backed Kamala Harris’s campaign for president in late October, supporting her approach to an “opportunity economy” for residents of the island.","summary":"Upwards of 500 Dominican migrants have been arrested on the island since Trump took office","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bad-bunny-ice-officers-raid-puerto-rico-1235367103/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2198993805-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:00:19","author":"Tomás Mier","authors":["Tomás Mier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234}]}
