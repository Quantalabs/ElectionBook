She came to check on me every month at my home in Southampton, where I worked at the time, and I went for regular scans at the Princess Anne Maternity Hospital, attached to Southampton General. I was invited to see the delivery ward and meet the chief midwife, registrar and consultant. I was not a private patient, so everything I got was standard NHS practice.\n\nI'd been reading a book by the childbirth campaigner Sheila Kitzinger in the run up to my labour and, even though I hadn't been able to follow her advice on the pleasure of home delivery – at 33, I was deemed 'too old' – I followed her guidance on making your birth plan very clear.\n\nI knew I wanted as natural a birth as possible. I wanted the delivery room to be dark with gentle music playing. I made my plan clear to the doctors and midwives but assured them I would not stick religiously to my plan if anything went wrong.\n\nThe staff listened to everything I said and did their utmost to make it all work. Ed was born at 5pm, 14 hours after I went into labour. I was given the best care possible throughout, went home after 24 hours in the hospital and, for three months afterwards, was visited regularly by my midwife. It could not have been a more comforting experience.\n\nFour years later, during my second pregnancy, I decided to ask doctors about the possibility of giving birth at home again.\n\nWe'd moved to London and my GP referred me to a consultant obstetrician at St George's Hospital in south London.\n\nBy then 37, I was ready for a fight to get my way – but didn't need it. The doctor examined me, read through my notes and said: 'Fine. I can't see a problem. You can have your baby at home.' My antenatal midwife came to visit me regularly and I was even assigned a GP who had experience of home delivery. On my due date, my husband David and I were shopping in M&S when I felt the unmistakable discomfort of imminent labour.\n\nAt home, the midwives came to check on me at once. All went to plan and Charlie came out like a rocket. Again, the maternity services could not have been better.\n\nYou would hope that, four decades on, medical care has only improved. To this country's shame, the opposite is true.\n\nI thank heaven I don't have to endure the state of maternity services now. I would be terrified at the thought of giving birth today. I've heard so many stories from young colleagues who've been to hell and back. Things are so bad that the NHS now faces a £27billion bill for maternity failings in England. How have we come to a position where women are being failed more than ever at their most vulnerable?\n\nI wanted to cry when I read about the experience of Emily Brazier at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. She was admitted for induction in 2022. She was given pethidine, an opioid similar to morphine, codeine and unrestricted access to gas and air. Her partner was not present as she was not yet in active labour.\n\nAfter the drugs had been administered, she fell asleep but was not checked. She had been left alone. At around 2am medical staff found her baby, Liliwen, had been born unattended and was in very 'poor condition'. She died around 20 hours later from perinatal asphyxia – a lack of oxygen.\n\nAt Liliwen's inquest this month, the coroner concluded she had died after her mother was left unattended by midwives and gave birth in a coma. Her lawyer said 'this tragic case highlights concerns regarding understaffing on maternity wards'.\n\nThen there's the shocking evidence of racism within the maternity services.\n\nA survey published by the British Medical Journal this year revealed one in four black women has experienced racial discrimination by medical professionals during pregnancy, while a report by Fivexmore, a community interest company, showed black women are 2.3 times more likely to die than white women in pregnancy, labour and after giving birth.\n\nBlack women are being subjected to appalling racist treatment on NHS maternity wards, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said.\n\nI remember covering this awful story nearly ten years ago on Woman's Hour. Why, so long after it became public knowledge, has it not been fixed?\n\nThe coroner at baby Liliwen's inquest demanded a review of the use of gas and air in labour after her death. Her mother had free access to it – but it's not the gas and air that's dangerous. It's the lack of care on the part of midwives and doctors that caused Liliwen to die.\n\nStreeting is aware of all this and must make maternity care a priority in the NHS if he's not to be accused of letting women languish, as so often happens, at the bottom of his to do list.\n\nLike Anne, I'll work till I drop \n\nLike me, Princess Anne is a 1950 baby and will soon achieve her three-quarter century. Next month she'll celebrate her 75th birthday and says she won't stop working until she's 90. We agree on that one, Ma'am. I hate the idea of retiring. Retirement is a dirty word. Happy birthday and keep on keeping on.\n\nAnother A-list invasion \n\nWe saw how resentful the inhabitants of Venice were when Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez took over the city with their wedding.\n\nNow a small village in Oxfordshire is to be overrun by A-list guests at the nuptials of Eve Jobs, the daughter of Apple founder, the late Steve Jobs. The estimated cost of her ceremony is £5million, and guests will include Kamala Harris, the Kardashians and Elton John – who is apparently being paid £1million to perform.\n\nEve may have been the Apple of her father's eye, but I doubt the residents of rural Oxfordshire will be best pleased when the entire village is forced into lockdown this weekend.\n\nI want that hay fever tablet now! \n\nI am still sniffling and sneezing with my hay fever that won't go away or be eased by the drugs currently on offer. Roll on the new immunotherapy tablet that it's said will train the immune system over three years to tolerate tree pollen. I don't care how long it takes to finally have an effect – hay fever this year has made my life a misery. I want this tablet and I want it now. \n\nTradeswomen – plumbers, plasterers, carpenters – are said to be swamped with work because clients feel safer with them in the home. I wish I could find some near here. No more hearing 'Mornin' darlin'.' No more sexist slurs asking what would\n\nmy husband want done. And no more surprise that, yes,\n\nI'll be the one paying the bill.","summary":"It's been 42 years since I gave birth to my first son and 38 years since the second one came along, and I look back at that time with awe, joy and amazement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14933547/JENNI-MURRAY-terrified-thought-giving-birth-today.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/23/17/100568123-0-image-m-16_1753288957004.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:19:37","author":"Editor,Jenni Murray","authors":["Editor","Jenni Murray"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":344635530,"title":"Black Women in Entertainment Launches as National Network for Black Woman Creatives in Hollywood","text":"Black Women in Entertainment (BWIE), which began as a mobilization effort for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign, has launched as a national network centered on supporting and connecting Black women in the entertainment industry, the organization announced Wednesday.\n\n“Today marks one year since I turned inspiration into action,” BWIE founder and communications strategist Evan Seymour, who previously served as the global publicity lead for Apple TV+, said in a social media statement. “After watching the historic Win With Black Women Zoom, I decided to bring together a few of my incredible entertainment industry friends to support then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to serve as leader of our country.

The more benign governments generally try to govern for all – balancing interests across all legitimate groups for the betterment of society.\n\nIn our current system, businesses take risks, expend capital, and seek to gain returns for its owners. Some fail and some succeed.\n\nThey typically hire workers and workers take pay to buy from businesses and/or invest.\n\nAs capital grew though, over time, those“owners” became less and less the Mum and Pop shops.\n\nThey became international conglomerates – some directed by oligarchs, or those that worked for their interests, and some directly owned by them –\n\nFor example:\n\nThe owner of CNN and many other media outlets is Warner Bros, whose CEO noted that “Trump is better for business” before the US election.\n\nIt’s Paramount Pictures, which recently cancelled the top rated late night Stephen Colbert show after Colbert called out corruption – a show that Donald J Trump detests.\n\nIt’s Amazon, whose owner forbid its Washington Post editorial team to endorse Kamala Harris and after Trump won, bent the knee in spectacular, cringeworthy fashion.\n\nIt’s Mark Zuckerberg who told Meta employees that Facebook etc. will become “a productive partnership to the” Trump government. He’s so desperate to win he’s even bought a house close by to Trump to keep lobbying.\n\nIt’s Peter Thiel, the NZ citizen, whose money reportedly fueled JD Vance, a guy who will become President should Trump expire.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry is dominated by billionaires e.g. Australia’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart, and Koch in the US\n\nIt’s Fox and Sky News.

Joyce advised Waikato on how to lobby for a new medical school\n\nI argue that the American government was captured when Donald J Trump was elected.\n\nYes, to a large extent the first time.\n\nBut the second time was/is extraordinary.\n\nUnder the auspices of the “think/junk tank”, Heritage Foundation Project 2025, these vested interests set out a detailed playbook for how Trump, or indeed any Republican candidate, could take over the American government – and enact a corporate, Christo-fascist state.\n\nThose measures include dismantling the Department of Education, directing aid in exchange for setting up “free market” paradises in third world countries, demolishing concepts around climate change, LGBTQ, firing any workers who don’t pledge complete loyalty etc.\n\nTrump has happily complied – each of these has been done and continues now.\n\nTrump has pushed for more fossil-fuel production, rhapsodized about “beautiful coal”, dubbed climate change a “hoax” and invoked his “drill, baby, drill” mantra.2\n\nExperts allege Trump ‘invented’ a national energy crisis to justify expansion of coal, oil and gas’.\n\nDoes that sound familiar?\n\nBecause it is the precise same playbook New Zealand’s Coalition right wing have used to justify our own expansion of a dying, fossil fuel future -as Luxon does in this clip.\n\nThese governments are all regressive because they are pinned to a dialogue and narrative that they have been taught, and they then pass on this rhetoric from within a very powerful position.\n\nIn my own view, they are captured politicians who no longer seek the public interest, nor hold a strategic, evidence based way.\n\nThis morning, I watched Winston Peters call RNZ journalist Guyon Espinor a “sausage” for revealing details about NZ First’s connections to tobacco. He’s been using this supposed insult for a while now against various figures, including the opposition.\n\nPeters had boasted about how his social media viewership surpasses3 RNZ’s, and mocked our public broadcaster for running the story.\n\nAs a recent media outlet reported, the minority parties in New Zealand (ACT and NZ First) now have their own social media teams to capture and put out footage for them.4\n\nSome might call that propaganda, but it’s very effective.\n\nLike the old system we co-existed within, many have now accepted this new way.\n\nTrump’s “fake and biased” news propaganda has worked brilliantly, and some NZ politicians are simply delighted.\n\nBarring significant electoral reform, donor transparency and the like, it will be very difficult to amend such elements — and you can be sure that any attempt to will be treated as another “must take down” by those pulling the strings.\n\nAnyone who thinks it is easy isn’t paying attention – many of the people behind the scenes are wealthier than New Zealand by a mile – and governments are nothing compared to their awesome might and multi-pronged resources.\n\nStill, it may be worth trying.\n\nExcerpt from Mountain Tui Substack","summary":"Winston Peters' recent \"sausage\" insults distract From Regulatory Capture in our government.

But Governor Bola Tinubu refused to accept the letter. Tinubu’s goal was to ensure that the impeachment proceedings commenced against Pedro by the State House of Assembly ran its full course. Pedro’s ‘sin’ was that against the dictates of his boss, he decided to seek the governorship position. First in the defunct Action Congress (AC) and when that door was closed, through the Labour Party. At the election, Pedro predictably failed woefully. But Tinubu felt his “disloyal” deputy should be punished for daring. That was how the state House of Assembly came in. Within a matter of days, a panel was inaugurated by then State Chief Judge, Justice Ade Alabi, a verdict of guilt was established, and the state lawmakers completed the rest by impeaching a man who had already resigned from office! \n\nPedro’s case is not too different from that of Alhaji Ali Olanusi who was until Monday the deputy governor of Ondo State. Because Olanusi decamped to the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the eve of the presidential election, Governor Olusegun Mimiko’s men in the State House of Assembly met and passed a resolution asking the State Chief Judge to establish an impeachment panel. Before anybody knew what was happening, the “panel” had been constituted, sat, found Olanusi guilty and submitted its report to the lawmakers. All of this within 48 hours! On Monday, Olanusi was impeached and almost immediately, a letter arrived at the State House of Assembly from Mimiko nominating Alhaji Lasisi Oluboyo as his replacement. The letter was approved and the man (who almost prostrated before Mimiko while being sworn in) is now the Ondo State Deputy Governor!\n\nUnfortunately, this is a familiar story across the country where governors dispense with their deputies as casually as most people dismiss their drivers and the charge is that of “disloyalty”, not to the system but to their persons. At last count, no fewer than 18 deputy governors have lost their jobs under the current dispensation due to differences with their governors…\n\n======================================= \n\nBetween 30 April 2015, when I wrote the foregoing in my column, ‘The Endangered Spare Tyres’, and today (ten years later), eight more deputy governors have been removed from office after losing the trust of their principals. Ordinarily, a deputy governor should complement rather than merely echo the governor. Unfortunately, under the current dispensation that began in 1999, they have been reduced to no better than political mannequins—present when needed for ceremonies, silent when substantive issues arise, and perpetually walking on eggshells lest their words be misinterpreted as signs of ambition or disloyalty.\n\nAs early as August 2001, former Anambra State Governor, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife, had described deputy governors as ‘spare tyres’ whose offices exist at the pleasure of state chief executives. Incidentally, he spoke at the opening ceremony of a two-day seminar on the role of deputy governors in a presidential system of government. It’s almost as if the late Ezeife—who was at that period Special Adviser on Political Affairs to President Olusegun Obasanjo—wrote the manual on how governors should treat their deputies. No one is perhaps in a better position to explain this complexity than the former APC National chairman, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, who was deputy governor in Kano State (to Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso) for two terms and a governor for two terms. In August 2023, Ganduje disclosed that he was writing a book, titled ‘Deputising and Governance in Nigeria’, to share insights on the issue. “My book is not dwelling on governors and deputies alone. It includes presidents and vice presidents, considering what happened between Olusegun Obasanjo and Atiku Abubakar,” Ganduje said.\n\nWhile we await Ganduje’s book, we must admit that the reciprocal relationship between an elected political figure (president or governor) and their deputy is a distinct partnership that presents unique challenges. In Nigeria, it often involves dealing with mischief makers and rumour mongers, managing public perceptions and navigating a complex relationship with those around the principal—including desperate influence peddlers, ambitious politicians who eye the office and errant family members.\n\nIn giving a befitting burial to his late predecessor, President Tinubu has demonstrated what a united government could achieve by assigning important roles to Vice President Kashim Shettima. But even that is not enough to douse the unhelpful speculation of recent weeks. Many would recall that on 21 June, presidential spokesman, Mr Bayo Onanuga, publicly dismissed claims suggesting a rift between the duo. This followed the omission of Shettima’s name during the recent endorsement of Tinubu for a second term by North-East stakeholders in Gombe, sparking tension at the event.\n\nIn his interview with Channels Television, Onanuga explained, and quite correctly, that the choice of a running mate is the prerogative of the candidate after nomination. But Onanuga also addressed the reputational issue regarding his principal which may have instigated the agitation. “Yes, when he (Tinubu) was governor, there were issues. In his first term, he and his deputy, Kofo (Bucknor-Akerele) did not get along, and she had to leave. Femi Pedro replaced her. In the second term, he retained Pedro, but Pedro later defected because he wanted to be governor. That is why he had to go. I do not want to reopen old wounds, but that is what happened,” said Onanuga who rejected the notion that Tinubu “has a pattern of discarding deputies. Each instance was shaped by unique political circumstances.”\n\nThe intervention by Onanuga is significant because it goes to the real issue of the role of deputies in Nigeria’s political environment. “In this country, deputy roles, whether as deputy governors or vice presidents, are always surrounded by rumours. Even when there is no conflict, people around them manufacture stories,” Onanuga said. “But as far as I know, Tinubu and Shettima work together very well.”\n\nInstructively, two weeks after Onanuga’s intervention, the ‘debate’ was reopened following Shettima’s remarks at the public presentation of ‘OPL 245: The Inside Story of the $1.3 Billion Oil Block’, written by former Attorney General and Justice Minister, Mohammed Bello Adoke, SAN. What was no more than an expression of gratitude to the author was quickly weaponized into evidence of disloyalty to the president. Some of the commentaries that followed offer a masterclass in the peculiar dynamics that define the number two position in Nigerian politics. They also reveal the impossible tightrope that Nigerian deputy governors and vice presidents must walk.\n\nHere was Shettima, doing what any reasonable person would do at a book launch, by sharing a personal anecdote that illustrated the author’s character and influence. His recounting of how Adoke, alongside others including then House of Representatives Speaker, Aminu Tambuwal, helped to forestall his removal as Governor of Borno State, was both relevant to the occasion and historically significant. Yet within hours, these remarks were twisted into an indirect criticism of presidential power, a veiled commentary on the suspension of Rivers State Governor SiminalayiFubara, and a subtle rebellion against his own principal.\n\nWhen a sitting vice president cannot acknowledge past kindness without triggering speculation about present loyalties, we have created an environment that stifles rather than strengthens democratic governance. The tragedy is not just in the mischief of misinterpreting Shettima’s comment, but in how this reflects our political culture of failing to distinguish between legitimate public discourse and palace intrigue. The fact that Shettima’s office felt compelled to issue a clarification speaks to how even the most innocuous statements can be transformed into political weapons by those who profit from manufacturing discord. If a vice president cannot safely reference his own political history at a literary event without sparking a loyalty test, what does this say about the space for independent thought in a democracy?\n\nThe irony is that Shettima’s remarks demonstrated the kind of institutional memory and personal relationships that strengthen rather than weaken governance. His acknowledgment of Adoke’srole during a difficult period, his recognition of political figures who acted on principle rather than partisanship, and his willingness to engage with Nigeria’s complex political history should be seen as assets to the current administration. Instead, they were treated as potential liabilities by commentators more interested in sensationalism than substance. Sadly, such situations have led to the fall of many deputy governors under the current dispensation.\n\nIn the United States, from where we copied the presidential system of government, the role of the vice president has evolved over the past three centuries. Initially, the office was reserved for whoever finished second in the presidential race. But the 1800 presidential election threw up very interesting outcomes and was stalemated in Congress for several months, because Thomas Jefferson of the Democratic-Republican Party and Aaron Burr of the Federalist Party (the two leading parties at the time) each won 73 electoral votes. That episode necessitated the 1804 constitutional amendment which eventually culminated in a presidential candidate forming a joint ticket with a chosen vice-presidential nominee.\n\nTo date, 15 American vice presidents have become president. While eight were elevated after their principals died, six have been elected, with the latest being Joe Biden, who had a four-year gap between the two jobs. Gerald Ford, of course, assumed the presidency in 1974 after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Nixon himself had been VP to President Dwight Eisenhower between 1953 and 1960 before he was eventually elected president eight years later in 1968.Interestingly, Nixon is also on the list of incumbent vice presidents who failed in the elections to succeed their principals. Others were John Breckinridge in 1860, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Al Gore in 2000, and Kamala Harris in 2024. Meanwhile, by the US constitution, the vice president is the presiding officer in the Senate with tie-breaking power, but they also play executive roles.\n\nPerhaps the real burden of being number two in Nigeria is not just the constant scrutiny but the way that often misses the point entirely. While we obsess over imagined slights and manufactured controversies, we lose sight of what a vice president or deputy governor could contribute to governance. Until we develop the political maturity to distinguish between legitimate expression and disloyalty, between historical reflection and present criticism, we will continue to handicap these important constitutional offices with unnecessary drama and misplaced suspicion.\n\n Yahaya Kwande’s Last Laugh\n\nAs he walked into the hall rather briskly, it was difficult to believe that Ambassador Yahaya Kwande marked his 96th birthday 0n 7th April this year. But seated alongside other traditional rulers in Qua’an-Pan, Plateau State to receive our (fact-finding) panel on Tuesday afternoon, the recently coronated Longkwo of Kwo presented the picture of a fulfilled man. “I refused to die because I was waiting for something. Now, I have got it,” Kwande said to a thunderous applause from the audience. On the killings in Plateau State that brought our panel, Kwande located the problem in the absence of consequences for bad behaviour that pervades the entire country. But I am more interested in the made-for-Nollywood story of how he eventually realised his ambition at 96.\n\nFor Kwande, the struggle to become the traditional ruler of his village began in 1988, following the death of LongkwoMiskoomHoomkwap Sule II. Although he was selected by the kingmakers at the time, one of the contenders secured a court injunction to stall his installation. Not long after, the court nullified Kwande’s selection on grounds of procedural flaws. For the next two decades, the throne was vacant while contenders battled one another in several courts. When in 2013, Kwande was selected again, he was upended by another court judgement, this time on grounds of ineligibility. When Kwande eventually prevailed at the Court of Appeal which affirmed his eligibility for the throne, there was a new lacuna: All the kingmakers who selected him in 2013 had died without leaving written records! \n\nWith that, the vacancy on the stool continued until 2021 when Governor Simon Lalong succeeded in breaking the logjam but his administration bypassed Kwande who was then 92 to appoint a retired Army colonel, Fidelis Longtoe Attahiru I, as the Miskoom. But in March last year, Attahiru I died. A new selection process conducted in March this year turned out to be another keen contest between Kwande and Herbert Isa. At the end, Kwande narrowly prevailed with three votes to his rival’s two. And the coronation of the former Nigerian ambassador to Switzerland and Second Republic lawmaker was done at Kwande town by Governor Caleb Mutfwang last Thursday. Interestingly, the ceremony was also witnessed by Lalong, currently the Senator representing the district in the National Assembly. In his tribute to Kwande last weekend, the former governor explained his role in the saga as excerpted below:\n\nThis is not just about a coronation; it is the continuation of a journey steeped in tradition, culture, and history—a journey that speaks to the resilience, reconciliation, and unity of the Kwo people. It is particularly meaningful given the personal odyssey of the man at the centre of it all—His Royal Highness Miskoom Yahaya Kwande—whose long path to this throne exemplifies the timeless truth that “to everything, there is a season.”\n\nDestiny, as we know, may be delayed, but never denied. It is God alone who lifts men and places them in positions of honour according to His will. As the people of Plateau State, Nigeria, and friends across the world rejoice with Kwo Chiefdom, we must also reflect on the enduring virtues of patience, perseverance, and faith—virtues that the new Long Kwo personified throughout the long years of waiting.\n\nBefore the installation of the late Miskoom Attahiru I in March 2021, I was, by divine orchestration, given the opportunity as Governor of Plateau State to play a key role in resolving the longstanding issues that had left the Long Kwo stool vacant for an unprecedented 33 years—following the passing of MiskoomHoomkwap Sule II in 1988.\n\nLike many traditional succession challenges, the process of selecting a new Long Kwo had been mired in prolonged litigation, taking the ruling houses and their princes to the highest courts in the land. It was only in 2021 that closure finally came. Understanding the urgency of healing and restoration, our administration adopted a policy of non-interference, promoting emancipation and mutual respect among the stakeholders. We encouraged the ruling houses, princes, elders, and kingmakers to engage in dialogue and reach consensus.\n\nHowever, the journey was not without complications. Many of the original kingmakers had passed away, and the path forward seemed uncertain. It was at that point that we invoked a doctrine of necessity—one grounded in reconciliation and guided by wisdom—to help them come together and break the 33-year jinx. In line with my administration’s guiding principle of upholding the sanctity of traditional institutions, I remained committed to allowing the people choose their own leaders. This posture led to the peaceful selection and installation of the late Miskoom Fidelis Attahiru I on 31st March 2021 in Ba’ap, the headquarters of Qua’an-Pan Local Government.\n\nAt that historic occasion, I reaffirmed our belief that the selection of traditional rulers must be left to the people, free of government interference… It is, therefore, with deep fulfillment that I witness the coronation and presentation of staff of office to HRH Miskoom Yahaya Kwande.

And I really do, hope, frankly, that [Harris] comes to that reality,” Brown said of Harris’ political future when asked by “State of Gold” podcast host Jon Slavet. \n\nBrown, the former mayor of San Francisco and longtime speaker of the California state Assembly, argued that Harris’s talents don’t seem to align with being an executive and that she is more suited for a top legal job, such as being an attorney general or Supreme Court justice. \n\n“She may not want to run for governor of the state of California,” the 91-year-old Democrat continued. “That may not be where she should be going. I think it’s going to be difficult for her to win that job.”\n\nBrown touted the “quality” of several Golden State officials considering a 2026 run at the governorship. \n\n“There’s just so many really talented people thinking about that job,” Brown said, singling out former Los Angeles mayoral candidate and businessman Rick Caruso as someone with “great executive potential.” \n\nHarris, 60, was romantically involved with Brown in the mid-1990s when she was a young prosecutor in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office and he was a married man and speaker of the California state Assembly. \n\nTheir relationship reportedly began in 1994 and ended sometime in 1995, the year Brown was elected mayor of San Francisco. \n\nBrown noted that Harris hasn’t spoken with him since he advised her not to become Joe Biden’s 2020 election running mate. \n\n“I’ve gotten in real trouble giving Kamala Harris advice,” Brown said with a laugh.\n\n“She is bold enough, tough enough, and well-informed enough that if she would utilize that talent, she would not need a person like me giving her advice, period. She would be doing what needs to be done,” he added. \n\nHarris, who lost the 2024 presidential election in a landslide to President Trump, is reportedly mulling whether to launch a bid to succeed termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom. \n\nSeveral polls have shown that she would be the clear front-runner in the race if she were to enter. \n\nHarris is slated to make a final decision on her next move by the end of the summer, Politico reported earlier this year. \n\nBrown argued that Harris “needs to understand” that successfully leading California would mean running it like “a private-sector person” would operate a business. \n\nHe touted the “California Forever” project spearheaded by Apple founder Steve Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs – an effort to build a utopian city on farmland in the outskirts of San Francisco – as an example of the type of innovative thinking needed to succeed in the governor’s mansion. \n\n“[If] Kamala Harris does something similar in her quest to become governor, she may get there,” Brown said.","summary":"“I do think people running for public office really ought to fit eventually where they are trying to land at.

They even cheered when Donald Trump won the election, with peak absurdity displayed in this viral celebratory tweet:\n\nNow it’s 2025, and they’ve left Vice President JD Vance alone. I guess vice presidents have no power over Gaza, after all? \n\nAnd after dubbing former President Joe Biden “Genocide Joe,” they seem to have misplaced their creativity when it comes to Trump, who now has the power to reshape U.S. policy. Instead, he has openly embraced the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Among other things, Trump moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, defunded UNRWA, and greenlit Israel’s annexation plans. And who could forget the video he posted of his Gaza fantasy—replete with a golden Trump idol at his Trump-branded Gaza casino? \n\nYet none of these pro-Palestine activists protest Trump. No chants, no stupid nicknames, no disruption. Nothing.\n\nInstead, they obsessively focus on Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC—the true villain, apparently, of the push for peace in the Middle East.\n\nDisowned by the Democratic Socialists of America and hounded by a segment of the far left that ignores real enemies in favor of cannibalizing allies, AOC’s latest crime was voting “no” on an amendment pushed by far-right wack job Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to defund Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system. AOC’s response was direct and principled.\n\nOnly six House members supported that amendment: Republicans Greene and Thomas Massie, who opposes all government spending; and Democrats Al Green, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib.\n\nIt’s a bizarre coalition, to put it mildly.\n\nThe far right is isolationist and opposes all foreign funding, no matter the context. The far left, meanwhile, insists there’s no distinction between offensive and defensive weapons—arguing that by shielding Israeli civilians from rocket attacks, Iron Dome enables further aggression. But there is a difference, and it matters. Because any deliberate attack on civilians—whether Israeli or Palestinian—is terrorism, period. Civilians should never be targets. And yes, that applies to Israel as well, which has shown it can eliminate threats surgically when it chooses to, as Hezbollah painfully learned.\n\nBut this isn’t about untangling the endless knot of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which none of us can do (no matter how much yelling is done in the comments attached to this story). It’s about where pro-Palestinian activists choose to aim their fire.\n\nAnd right now, they’re ignoring the people gleefully fueling this war—Trump and his minions—and attacking people like AOC, who have neither the power nor the posture to support genocide, and who actually agree with them on the end goal!\n\nWhy not go after the dozens of other Democrats who voted the same way AOC did—i.e., against Greene’s stunt amendment? Why not target Republicans who support Israeli occupation without conditions? Why team up with literal white supremacists like Marjorie Taylor Greene?\n\nThankfully, AOC didn’t mince words.\n\n“If you believe neo-nazis are welcome and operating in good faith, you can have them!” she tweeted—and she couldn’t be more right.","summary":"Rep.

While the alleged incident led to support for the actor, including mentions from Kamala Harris, things soon changed when the truth was revealed.\n\nChicago police released surveillance images of the supposed perpetrators, identifying the men as Nigerian American brothers who worked as extras on Empire, as Smollett was accused of planning the attack, as he paid the brothers $3,500.Smollett's NightmareThe actor was buried in backlash, as he would soon be indicted on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct; however, the charges were dropped. \n\nSmollett was not out of the woods yet, as he was re-indicted and later convicted on five felony counts of disorderly conduct. The star was sentenced to 30 months probation, including 150 days behind bars, and ordered to pay fines totaling more than $120,000. \n\nHe lucked out again, as in 2024, his conviction was reversed on procedural grounds, as it was found the re-prosecution violated due process. \n\n\"We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,\" The Illinois Supreme Court said at the time.\"Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.\"\n\nSmollett’s lawyer, Nenye Uche, also said this \"was not a prosecution based on facts, rather it was a vindictive persecution and such a proceeding has no place in our criminal justice system...\"\n\nThe following year, Smollett settled with the city of Chicago. He has continued to deny the attack was a hoax orchestrated by him.Turning The Page?Smollett's alleged attack also muddled the claims from Elliot Page, formerly known as Ellen Page, after he described an alleged transphobic attack in 2023.\n\nAfter claiming he was confronted by a man who \"threatened to assault\" him, people compared the actor's story to Smollett.\n\nThe Umbrella Academy star claimed the man screamed, \"I’m going to f------ gay bash you, f-----.\" According to Page, he ran into a nearby convenience store, where employees helped him.\n\nAdmitting he is privileged enough to hire security, Elliot stated that it \"doesn’t mean it’s not traumatic. But I have resources that, in every instance that is difficult, protect and can shield me from these things.\"Social media users, however, weren't about the story, claiming it sounded \"fishy,' and compared it to Smollett's \"hoax.\"","summary":"Jussie Smollett's wild 2019 case will be touched on again in an upcoming Netflix documentary, years after the actor claimed he was part of a hate crime.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/jussie-smollett-netflix-documentary-new-evidence-hate-crime/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/DMwoJpDap/0x0/jussie-1753306827535.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 23:00:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":344624196,"title":"Skydance moves to slash DEI policies at Paramount in promise to FCC","text":"“Skydance, for its part, does not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives,” the letter reads. “The company is committed to ensuring that its storytelling reflects the many audiences and communities it serves in a manner that complies with non-discrimination requirements and other applicable laws.”\n\nIn February, Paramount announced it would eliminate its DEI practices in response to President Donald Trump’s executive order that directed federal agencies to investigate private companies over their DEI programs. In making its decision, the company’s leadership cited Trump’s order and the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard that deemed race-based affirmative action programs in college admissions unconstitutional.\n\nBefore the second Trump administration, conservative legal experts applied that Supreme Court ruling to private companies.\n\nIn the letter, Skydances states Paramount will no longer factor DEI in its hiring practices, employee compensation, and public messaging, among other areas.\n\nThe corporate change comes as Skydance and Paramount wait for the FCC to greenlight their $28 billion merger. The companies’ concessions on DEI will likely convince the agency to approve the deal.\n\nEarlier this month, Paramount settled Trump’s lawsuit, alleging that last fall’s 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, then his Democratic rival in the 2024 election, contained deceptive editing. CBS News, owned by Paramount, airs the weekly news program. The settlement amounted to $16 million, far below the $20 billion in damages that Trump initially sought.\n\nTrump may be receiving more money after he claimed on Tuesday that Skydance would contribute $20 million in advertising, public service announcements, or “similar programming” as part of a side deal alongside the $16 million settlement. Skydance and Paramount have disputed the existence of such a side deal.\n\nCritics claim the settlement was part of a deal that Paramount made with Trump to get its merger with Skydance approved. This is in light of CBS recently pulling the plug on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, on which the comedian often criticizes Trump. After a decadelong run, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is slated to end in May 2026.\n\nBeyond slashing DEI practices, Skydance vowed to hire an ombudsperson who will ensure CBS publishes unbiased journalism as a solution to Trump’s claims that the broadcaster is biased. The ombudsman will report to the president of the consolidated company for at least two years.\n\n“Skydance recognizes that, as a broadcast licensee, it will be charged with operating in the public interest, and the company intends to undertake a comprehensive review of CBS and to make any necessary changes to ensure compliance with that standard,” a separate letter states. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS’s reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based.”\n\nOVER 200K SIGN PETITION TO KEEP STEPHEN COLBERT ON AIR\n\nThe promises come after Skydance CEO David Ellison met with Carr last week to reaffirm the company’s commitment to unbiased journalism and diverse viewpoints.\n\nThe letters were dated Tuesday but weren’t widely reported on until Wednesday.","summary":"Skydance Media indicated on Tuesday that Paramount Global&#8217;s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies will dissolve once the Federal Communications Commission approves the proposed merger between the two entertainment companies.

His appearances on shows hosted by Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Andrew Schulz and Adin Ross—paired with a calculated push into the \"manosphere\" podcast ecosystem—helped him win this demographic by a 14-point margin over Vice President Kamala Harris, according to exit polls.It worked—until it didn't. Barely six months into his second administration, influential voices like Schulz and Rogan have raised both raised their concerns, as have many of the low-propensity voters who make up their audiences who are now expressing buyer's remorse across social media and in polling.A recent Harvard Youth Poll found that nearly half of young men believe Trump is hurting the economy. Only 17 percent say they trust Congress, while 70 percent believe elected officials are mostly motivated by self-interest. Another 37 percent say they are \"struggling to get by,\" and a majority report feeling pessimistic about the future. And that survey was taken before accounting for public opinion on the Jeffrey Epstein saga that has blotted out news coverage this summer, morphing into a growing political problem for the White House.'Trump Overpromised'Trump's winning campaign messaging tapped into frustrations over economic instability, identity politics and cultural marginalization. But now, months into his second term, a number of these voters are reconsidering their support — even as the president has delivered for his base on many of the culture war promises he made.Part of the disillusionment stems from a belief that Trump overpromised and underdelivered. Rachel Janfaza, a writer and researcher who has conducted listening sessions with Gen Z voters, told Newsweek that many young men she interviewed were frustrated by the disconnect between Trump's campaign rhetoric and real-world results.\"They voted for him because he met them where they were,\" said Janfaza. \"But the message has to match the messenger. They're not seeing results. Rent is still unaffordable, jobs are hard to come by, and they feel like their degrees are obsolete the moment they graduate.\"A Harvard Institute of Politics poll in April — just three months into the new administration — found that 47 percent of men aged 18 to 29 believed Trump was hurting the economy, with 40 percent saying they were worse off than during the Biden administration. SocialSphere polling earlier this year also showed Trump's economic approval among young men dropping 14 points in just two months.But the dissatisfaction appears to have since grown, and it extends beyond economics. Many young men expected Trump to act on uncovering conspiracy theories he amplified during the campaign—particularly those involving Jeffrey Epstein.\"He promised to release the Epstein files, to expose the deep state—and they believed him,\" Janfaza said. \"Now that he's in office and hasn't followed through, they're asking, 'Why not?'\"Many are no longer willing to accept the administration's explanations. \"It's not just that they're disappointed—they feel duped,\" she added.Up for GrabsData from the Cooperative Election Study, one of the largest politically focused surveys in the U.S., suggests that although more young men voted Republican in 2024, they haven't become more conservative. In fact, they remain broadly progressive on issues like abortion rights, systemic racism, and immigration—indicating their shift may have been circumstantial, not ideological.Many online commentators refute that theory, suggesting the dissatisfaction among Gen Z with Trump is that he hasn't gone far enough on promises like mass deportations. \"Gen Z is so much further to the right than Trump they disapprove of his job because they feel he's not going hard enough,\" wrote one popular anonymous X account.Richard V. Reeves, founding president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, doesn't buy that explanation. He said the original swing toward Trump was mostly a reflection of a generational rejection of Democratic messaging. \"Democrats just didn't compete for their vote,\" Reeves told Newsweek. \"When they did reach out, it was as allies—never directly as men.\"He also dismissed the idea that 2024's backlash was rooted in anti-feminism, as some commentators suggested after the election. \"It wasn't angry young men rebelling against feminism,\" he said. \"It was a backlash against overreach—against being constantly told they were the problem.\"As Reeves pointed out, this discontent does not appear to be translating into strong support for Democrats. Put another way, the opposition is not benefiting from its opponents' missteps, as is usually the case. A Quantus poll conducted between June 30 and July 2 among 1,000 registered voters, suggests that young voters are feeling politically homeless, with 43 percent of Gen Z respondents saying that neither party represents American values.As Reeves put it: \"They're not tribal. Their votes are up for grabs.\"Writing for Scientific American, Adam Stanaland came to a similar conclusion, arguing that young men's support for Trump was not just political—it was personal. \"In a culture that equates 'being a man' with financial success and protection, their anger was a direct response to pressures and threats,\" he wrote.Polling backs up this volatility. Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University and author of Generations: The Real Differences between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silents, wrote in The Atlantic that Gen Z's partisan shifts are largely driven by independents breaking right—not by deeply rooted ideological change.\"If young people's attitudes persist as they get older, Gen Z might never be pleased with how things are going in the country,\" Twenge said. \"They'll want to 'vote the bastards out' in the next election no matter which party is in power\".","summary":"The reversal is especially striking given how aggressively the president's 2024 campaign targeted young men.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-gen-z-polling-collapse-2103179","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2689036/trump-gen-z.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9ab2c0f97964d9eff7dcce7057fb18ba","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 22:01:23","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.06},{"id":344609864,"title":"DAVID MARCUS: Why socialist NYC mayoral candidate's Uganda trip makes surprising sense","text":"DemocratIc Party nominee for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani has been at the center of a political firestorm since his shock victory in the primary last month, and faced with mounting questions about his communist past, he’s doing what leftists always do, running away and not answering questions. In this case to the African nation of Uganda where Mamdani was born. The socialist wonderboy’s campaign swears that this ten-day excursion in the middle of the general election has nothing to do with politics, Mamdani and his wife are just celebrating their wedding, again, and if you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you that Zohran may be mayor of soon. UNEARTHED MAMDANI CLIP REVEALS HOW HIS UPBRINGING MADE HIM OPEN TO BEING CALLED 'RADICAL,' SOCIALIST The obvious political move being made here is to hide Mamdani, at least until the end of the month, and this isn’t the first time. Last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., brought Zohran to Washington DC to meet with Congressional Democrats in what turned into a laughable moment of cloak and dagger, here is how Fox News Digital described it: \"Ocasio-Cortez and Mamdani were scheduled to host the 8 a.m. breakfast at the National Democratic Club. While the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is located right next door to where Wednesday's breakfast is being held, the DNC said it was not involved with the event. Minutes before the breakfast was scheduled to start, the location was moved to a restaurant a few blocks away.\" JEFFRIES DECLINES TO ENDORSE MAMDANI, SAYS THEY WILL MEET AFTER UGANDA TRIP Reports indicate that the windows to the place were blacked out and that Zohran quietly exited out of a backdoor. What clearly happened here was that most Democrats in Congress, very wisely, didn’t want a photo op with the most radioactive \"Democratic Socialist\" on the current political scene. In fact, in New York, political ads tying Democrats to Mamdani are already running. Zany Zohran is hightailing it out of, not just Gotham, but America, without the coveted endorsement of either House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, even both are also from New York City. And that underlines the point, these guys don’t want to talk about Mamdani and a future Democrat party dedicated to seizing the means of production and abolitioning prisons, no Democrat who isn’t a member of the Squad wants to. ZOHRAN MAMDANI FIRES BACK AT WHITE HOUSE MISPRONOUNCING HIS NAME: 'M-A-M-D-A-N-I' Serious Democrats understand that Mamdani is not some generational political talent, or the next Obama, he is a boilerplate archetype that Democrat Socialists use over and over, young, charismatic, edgy, social media savvy, and non-white. Examples of this DSA type abound, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), Minneapolis mayoral candidate Omar Fateh, Illinois Congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, and of course the trendsetter herself, AOC. The DSA and other George Soros backed operations excel at winning primaries in deep blue areas with young, far left candidates like those above, but what they don't do, ever, is win competitive general elections. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The idea is supposed to be that once the Democratic primary is won, no Republican can win, so the socialist skates to victory, almost every wacko district attorney in our major cities came to power exactly this way. And this is the real reason Mamdani ran away to Uganda, just as Kamala Harris was hidden away when she became the presidential nominee last year because she had no defense for the Biden administration, so too, Zohran has no explanation for being a full blown communist ten minutes ago. While the hide behind the couch strategy failed for Harris, she was running against Donald Trump, Zohran is luckier and running against Eric Adams, an unpopular mayor, Andrew Cuomo, a disgraced former governor, and Curtis Sliwa, a legendary New Yorker, but also known best for his beret and love of cats. If all three of Mamdani’s rivals remain in the race then the socialist will be able to hide his way to Gracie Mansion and control of America’s greatest city, maybe he does one debate, goes on a few lefty podcasts, that will be enough. 10 days in far-flung Uganda, out of the blue, is the beginning of this strategy, even if Mamdani claims the trip is to celebrate his marriage and troll the supposed racists, mostly actually anonymous X accounts, saying he should go back to Africa. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If, on the other hand, the three claimants to the right to take on Mamdani can settle it and get behind one candidate by September, then Zohran might actually be forced to run on his record and past statements, something no Democrat Socialist ever wants to do. For now, even when Mamdani gets back from his African Adventure, expect him to remain quiet, because unless and until he is facing one, serious challenger, hiding him in the basement is almost certain to secure him victory.

There is a two-year period in which Versant could not engage in selling major assets like CNBC or even the entire company without major tax implications, sources told The Post.\n\nA source close to the situation said the company won’t likely jeopardize the tax-free nature of the spinoff.\n\nLate last year, Comcast announced it would hive off its cable assets and keep NBCUniversal’s NBC broadcast TV network, “Real Housewives” home Bravo, its film and TV studios and theme parks, as well streaming service Peacock.\n\nBezos bought the Washington Post from Warren Buffett in 2013 for $250 million, but the paper since has been dogged by steep losses as subscribers have fled.\n\nThe Amazon founder has been vacationing with his new bride Lauren Sanchez in the South of France. They were spotted Tuesday leaving glitzy beach club Le Club 55, not far from where the mogul’s mega-yacht, Koru, dropped anchor.\n\nBezos’ desire to expand his media empire follows a flurry of headlines in recent weeks that he was interested in buying Vogue magazine for Sanchez, a former TV reporter — or even the fashion glossy’s parent company Condé Nast.\n\nOver the past year, Bezos and Washington Post CEO Will Lewis have tried to move the Beltway broadsheet more to the center — to the dismay of staffers.\n\nBezos’ decision to kill the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president shortly before the election in November sparked a revolving door of high-profile departures. More than 300,000 readers canceled their subscriptions.\n\nThe uproar continued after Bezos ordered the outlet’s opinion section to focus on “personal liberties and free markets” — a more neutral topic — rather than weighing in on politics and other issues.\n\nThe directive led to the resignation of Opinion Editor David Shipley, followed by the departure of longtime columnist Ruth Marcus.

He further vowed that CBS would be “unbiased” under the new corporate leadership.\n\n“Relatedly, we discussed Skydance's commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS's editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers,” Ellison’s lawyer wrote in a regulatory filing.\n\nThe meeting between Ellison and Carr took place days before Paramount and CBS announced that they had canceled outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert’s late-night show, leading to further speculation that the demise of The Late Show was not a “purely financial decision” and may have been politically motivated. \n\nParamount has insisted that the cancellation was due solely to the dwindling ad revenues for late-night television and the high production costs of Colbert’s show, though many CBS staffers feel it is actually “part and parcel of the Trump shakedown settlement.”\n\nRegardless of whether Colbert’s cancellation was a move to appease Trump or not, both the president and Carr have gloated over the decision. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” Trump declared on Friday. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nCarr, meanwhile, tweeted on Tuesday that the “partisan left’s ritualist wailing and gnashing of teeth over Colbert is quite revealing,” adding that “they’re acting like they’re losing a loyal DNC spokesperson.”\n\nLater on in the day, the president repeated his claim that he had struck a secret side deal with Skydance to give him up to $20 million more in pro-Trump advertising and PSAs as part of the 60 Minutes settlement. A group of liberal senators is investigating whether Ellison made any such promises to Trump. \n\nParamount has denied knowledge of that backdoor arrangement, asserting that its payoff to Trump \"does not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs.”","summary":"‘New Paramount's new management will ensure that the company's array of news and entertainment programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum,’ Skydance’s general counsel wrote to FCC","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/skydance-paramount-cbs-trump-dei-bias-b2794797.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/19/19/60_MINUTES-TRUMP_97018.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/S2C4X4R2-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-23 21:00:19","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.456},{"id":344610108,"title":"Trump is losing support from men as approval rating drops below 50%","text":"Men are cooling on Donald Trump after making up a significant chunk of the president’s 2024 voting bloc.\n\nAccording to a new poll by CBS/YouGov, Trump's approval rating is tanking with men during his second term. It found that 47 percent of men approve of Trump's job, and 53 percent do not. \n\nLast October — just before Trump's second electoral victory — a similar CBS/YouGov poll found that 54 percent of men supported Trump and 64 percent said they thought he would be a strong leader. \n\nThe drop overall reflects a broader disapproval with Trump's second term; DecisionDeskHQ's polling averages showed that the president's overall approval rating was down by about 12 points since January, a drop from 56 percent then to 44 percent this week. \n\nAccording to the new CBS/YouGov poll, 47 percent of men said Trump was focusing \"too much\" on deportations, while 33 percent said he was showing the \"right amount\" of focus. In another metric, 65 percent of men said Trump has not done enough to lower prices, and only 29 percent said they felt he had. \n\nOn February 7, Trump had a 60 percent approval rating with men, but his numbers began to slip in the months that followed, according to the poll. By the end of the month, his favorability had dropped to 56 percent, and by April 11 — just a week after he unveiled his tariff plan — men's approval of the president fell to 49 percent. \n\nTrump won big with men in 2024. According to Pew Research, men favored Trump by 12 points in 2024. Men under 50 split their votes almost evenly between former Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump. In 2020, men under 50 backed former President Joe Biden over Trump by 10 points. \n\nAccording to the CBS/YouGov polling data, the big issues driving down Trump's approval with men are his performance on the economy, his seeming inability to curb inflation, and his intense focus on immigration issues. \n\nBy mid-April, Trump's approval rating among men on the economy dropped to minus 10 points, his approval regarding inflation fell to minus 20, and his immigration approval — one of his strongest areas among men — dropped to just plus six points, \n\nThe poll found that 49 percent of men believe that the economy is getting worse, and 65 percent said that Trump wasn't doing enough to lower prices for goods and services. \n\nAnother 60 percent said they believe Trump is focusing too much on tariffs, and 57 percent believe his policies are directly increasing the cost of their groceries. \n\nThey aren't wrong about their grocery bills; Consumer Price Index data shows that annual inflation rose by 2.7 percent in June, up from 2.4 percent in May. \n\nThey're also not wrong about Trump's tariffs, according to Yale's Budget Lab. Americans are currently facing an average tariff rate of 18.7 percent, which is the highest it has been since 1933. \n\nThe three key issues driving down Trump's approval rating were the major issues that attracted men to Trump in the first place, according to the poll. That could spell trouble for Republicans come the midterm elections if they do not adjust their focus and messaging before the election. \n\nTrump's dipping approval comes at a difficult time for him, as even some stalwart supporters among his voter base and within his party are questioning him over his handling of the alleged \"Epstein client list.\" \n\nThe president promised to be transparent about what the government knew of disgraced New York financier and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein — a man who had a long and well-documented friendship with Trump. \n\nAfter U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told the public she had the so-called client list on her desk, the administration backtracked and insisted no such file existed, and confirming previous rulings that Epstein died by suicide in his New York jail cell while awaiting trial. \n\nTrump has reacted with dismissal and annoyance toward Republicans — and his own voters — who have asked him questions about his administration's position on the Epstein documents. \n\nSince then, Trump has faced questions and criticism from his voting base and within the conservative cultural sphere that helped sell his vision for America to the public — especially men.","summary":"The same issues that drew men to support president — immigration, inflation, and the economy — are now driving them away","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-approval-rating-men-b2794808.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/22/Media_Trump_Wall_Street_Journal_79214.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/O3g0WUPf-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-23 20:48:31","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":344603730,"title":"DEI is dead at Paramount, David Ellison's Skydance promises FCC","text":"David Ellison's Skydance Media pledged to abandon all diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Paramount Global in an attempt to win government approval for its $8-billion merger. Paramount already had scaled back diversity programs earlier this year. In a Tuesday letter to Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, Skydance said it would go further to cancel diversity efforts. \"Paramount no longer will maintain an Office of Global Inclusion and will not have any teams or individual roles focused on DEI,\" Stephanie Kyoko McKinnon, Skydance general counsel, wrote in the three-page letter to Carr. The appointee of President Trump, in one of his first moves as chair, dismantled the agency's diversity programs and called on companies to do the same. Kyoko McKinnon said Paramount will remove \"references to DEI in its public messaging, including on its websites and social media,\" along with culling DEI language in \"internal messaging and training materials.\" Last week, Ellison met with Carr to press his case that Skydance and its backer RedBird Capital Partners would be strong stewards of Paramount, which includes CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, BET and the Melrose Avenue movie studio, Paramount Pictures. Skydance needs Carr's approval for the merger and the transfer of the CBS television station licenses to the Ellison family. Skydance separately tackled persistent complaints by conservatives about alleged news bias at \"60 Minutes\" and other programs. Ellison's firm pledged to \"promote transparency and increased accountability\" at CBS News. The company said it would install an ombudsman, reporting to the president of Paramount, \"to receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS\" for at least two years. Trump's ire over edits of a \"60 Minutes\" Kamala Harris interview last fall nearly derailed Skydance's takeover of Paramount. Carr opened an inquiry into alleged news distortion after Trump sued CBS in federal court in Texas. Earlier this month, Paramount reached a $16-million settlement with Trump to resolve the dispute that caused deep divisions within Paramount and prompted high-level CBS departures. Trump boasted Tuesday on Truth Social that he anticipates receiving an additional $20 million worth of advertising and PSA time from the new owners. During his July 15 meeting with Carr, Ellison underscored \"Skydance’s commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS’s editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers,\" according to an FCC filing. Skydance's Kyoko McKinnon added: \"We further reaffirm that, after consummation of the proposed transaction, New Paramount's new management will ensure that the company's array of news and entertainment programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum, consistent with the varying perspectives of the viewing audience.\" Ellison recently met with prominent journalist Bari Weiss, reportedly to discuss Skydance acquiring her center-right online publication, the Free Press, as an alternative to traditional news sites. She started the outlet, which is often critical of DEI, after quitting her job as a New York Times opinion writer, citing intolerance of her and her more conservative viewpoints. Also last week, late-night host Stephen Colbert learned his CBS talk show would be canceled in May. CBS has said Colbert's cancellation was \"purely a financial decision\" and not related to the merger approval. Still, conservatives and liberals have widely questioned whether Colbert's frequent criticisms of Trump played into the decision. Skydance has said it didn't have a role in the Colbert decision. Skydance isn't the only company under pressure to ditch diversity programs to win FCC approval for a deal. Two months ago, telecommunications giant Verizon pledged to drop diversity efforts to gain Carr's blessing for the company's $20-billion takeover of Frontier Communications. Carr separately launched probes into Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp.'s workplace diversity efforts. After George Floyd's 2020 murder in Minneapolis, Paramount and other Hollywood companies vowed to hire more people of color. Such moves were cheered by many, including those cognizant of Hollywood's troubled history with diversity. Paramount encouraged executives to make diverse hires and promotions, and progress toward the corporate goals was one of many factors considered when calculating bonuses. That program was dismantled last year. For years, CBS struggled to shake its prime-time sitcom formula to build shows around white men, a la \"King of Queens,\" \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" The network broke the pattern in 2018 with \"The Neighborhood,\" starring Cedric the Entertainer, and procedural drama \"FBI,\" starring Zeeko Zaki. CBS also championed mentorship programs for writers and directors to build a more diverse pipeline of creators. That initiative dated to 2004. Skydance promised not to set numerical goals related to race, ethnicity or gender of job applicants. \"The company is committed to ensuring that its storytelling reflects the many audiences and communities it serves in a manner that complies with non-discrimination requirements and other applicable laws,\" Kyoko McKinnon wrote. \"I am very encouraged by today's announcements,\" said Daniel Suhr, president of the conservative Center for American Rights, which filed an FCC complaint about \"60 Minutes\" and suggested a CBS News ombudsman. \"These are important steps towards better broadcasting that serves all consumers.\"","summary":"Skydance separately promised to appoint a CBS News ombudsman to 'promote transparency and increased accountability' at CBS News.

Who was that again? That was not Obama,” said co-host Behar, 82, in reference to the infamous 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. \n\n“The thing about him is he’s so jealous of Obama,” she claimed, “because Obama is everything that he is not: Trim, smart, handsome, happily married, and can sing Al Green’s song ‘Let’s Stay Together’ better than Al Green. And Trump cannot stand it. It’s driving him crazy.” \n\nReacting to Behar’s comments, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told The Independent: “Joy Behar is an irrelevant loser suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nThe White House statement additionally claimed the ABC talk show “hit an all-time low last year,” and that Behar “should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump’s historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off air.”\n\nA representative for The View later commented on the White House’s remarks about its viewership, telling Entertainment Weekly: “Season to date, The View is ranking No. 1 in households and total viewers among all network daytime talk shows and news programs for the fifth straight season” and “is up in total viewers and women 18-49, versus the comparable weeks last season, to its most-watched in four years.”\n\nThey refrained from directly commenting on the White House’s name-calling of Behar. \n\nThe Independent has contacted ABC for comment. \n\nThe White House’s threatening statement comes days after Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show was canceled by CBS. \n\nIn a sudden and unexpected move, the network axed its long-running late-night franchise, insisting that it was purely a “financial decision” and “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nHowever, the cancelation came just days after CBS’s parent company Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump after he complained that a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris last year was manipulatively edited.\n\nIt also comes at the same time as Paramount’s pending $8.4 billion merger with Skydance, a production company financed by pro-Trump billionaire Larry Ellison and run by his son David, whom the president has personally lauded.\n\nIntense speculation surrounding CBS’s motives has mounted, with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a frequent Colbert guest, demanding that “America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.” \n\nTrump himself gloated about Colbert’s firing, posting on Truth Social: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nColbert has since hit back at the Republican during a recent segment of his talk show, saying: “How dare you, sir? Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism?” Looking into the “Eloquence Cam,” the talk show host did not pull his punches, telling the president: “Go f*** yourself.”\n\nIn addition, earlier this month, Trump sued The Wall Street Journal over its publication of an alleged birthday letter he wrote to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The WSJ described the card as a sexually suggestive drawing and containing a reference to “secrets” both men shared. Trump vehemently denied the allegations, and then sued the paper and its owners for $10 billion.","summary":"Behar alleged the president was ‘jealous of Obama’ because he ‘is everything that [Trump] is not: Trim, smart, handsome, [and] happily married’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/joy-behar-the-view-donald-trump-b2794710.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/23/17/31/Joy-Behar-and-Donald-Trump.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/GIf3wIPM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-23 20:31:08","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":344592202,"title":"Over 200K sign petition to keep Stephen Colbert on air","text":"“America needs Stephen Colbert’s voice now more than ever.

How do we combat this level of inhumane violence and propaganda? Solomon, co-founder of Roots Action, joins The Marc Steiner Show for an urgent discussion about Israel’s manufactured genocide of Palestinians and how the media manufactures consent to, at best, hide and, at worst, justify Israel’s heinous actions.\n\nNorman Solomon is the cofounder of RootsAction.org, executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, and the author of numerous books, including War Made Easy: How Presidents & Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death and War Made Invisible: How America Hides the Human Toll of the Military Machine.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nNorman Solomon, Common Dreams, “In too much of the US, Israel's Gaza genocide has been made invisible”\nNorman Solomon, Common Dreams, “Who’s afraid of Zohran Mamdani?

A proofread version will be made available as soon as possible.\nMarc Steiner:\nWelcome to The Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I'm Marc Steiner. It's great to have you all with us again.\nAs we begin this conversation, let me give you the grim reality of what's happening in Gaza as we tape this conversation. Over 58,000 Gazans, the vast majority of whom are non-combatants, women, and children, have been killed, 140,000 wounded, 370,000 buildings severely damaged, 79,000 destroyed altogether. And Gazans are being pushed into smaller and smaller corners of an already small land, no running water, illness spreading, and there's mass starvation. As someone who over the last 57 years has been working for peace and a two-state solution or some form of dwelling together, this is absolutely devastating.\nAnd as we see the right rising in the Holy Land, in Israel, it's also taking hold here in the United States, and we're on a precipice here in the good old United States of America where neofascism is rising. And our guest covers that deeply. He quotes Congressman Ro Khanna, who said, \"What's going on is chilling. They're banning all international students from coming to Harvard. Think about that. All foreign students banned. They could do this in other universities. They have fired seven of the 18 directors of the NIH, totally dismantling future medical research in our country. It dismantled the FDA, firing people who approve new drugs. They're systematically firing people at the FAA, the Arab Administration. They're openly talking about defying the United States Supreme Court orders. J.D. Vance just said, justify the orders they're calling the universities the enemy. This is very chilling.\" That was Ro Khanna's quote.\nSo today, we talk with Norman Solomon. Norman Solomon is the co-founder of rootsaction.org. He's the executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy and the author of numerous books, including War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning us to Death, and War Made Invisible: How America Hides the Human Toll of the Military Machine. His website is www.normansolomon.com -- That's Solomon with all Os -- And he has incredibly detailed well-written articles, and joins us now.\nSo great, Norman, it's good to see you. Glad you're here. Welcome.\nNorman Solomon:\nThanks a lot, Marc.\nMarc Steiner:\nYou've been doing -- That's what you do, you write. But you've been doing a lot of writing both about Israel-Palestine and about what's going on with the Democrats, and it really feels as if, on both fronts, the state of the Democratic Party and the horrendous slaughter taking place in Gaza, that we are on a precipice, I think, in some ways deeper and more dangerous than ones that I've noticed in a long time.\nNorman Solomon:\nIt's hard to fathom. There are so many layers of it, to be in a country, the United States, that literally makes possible an ongoing genocide. It's not a metaphor, it's not an exaggeration. This is genocide going on. And yet, we're living in that country that, under President Biden and now under President Trump, is literally enabling it, giving the weapons to make it all possible, and really the political support to enable it as well.\nAnd then we have the domestic repression that, really, I'm in my mid-70s now, I can't remember it ever being this bad, even in the depths of the Nixon administration and the crackdowns, the class war, the repression, the disappearances, the troops, I want to say, often with their faces covered, their identities. This is the kind of authoritarian regime that we would have nightmares for. It can't happen here, but it is happening. So in terms of foreign policy, in terms of what's happening in this country, it certainly is very upsetting if we're paying attention. And at the same time, we know we can never give up. We have to organize and turn this around.\nMarc Steiner:\nSo one of the things you just said, it took me back to my youth when I was a teenager as a civil rights worker in the South 16, 17, 18 years old. What we're seeing now, to me, is akin to that, the terror that civil rights workers, the terror the Black community was under in the South is growing here in this country now, but in Israel it is a fact of life every day. 60,000 Palestinians killed so far in that teeny strip of land.\nAnd I wonder how you begin to approach a couple of things, lemme just start here. We both come from the Jewish community. We both come from that world, and I grew up with people with numbers on their arms in my house. So how do we become those who oppressed us? It's like the shift is turned. We're doing exactly what was done to us. I guess that's what I've been wrestling with and arguing, I spoke about it at a synagogue just the other week, for us to pay attention. How do we make us pay attention to that?\nNorman Solomon:\nThis is so fundamental. What does \"never again\" mean?\nMarc Steiner:\n\nNorman Solomon:\nDoes it mean never again for all, any people or does it mean for our clan, our tribe, our self-identified ethnocentric group? And it's a really basic question. And there's also the matter of who we are and where the allegiances are tos so to speak, humanitys or some sort of self-identity.\nIt's really stunning to me that so many progressives, whether Jewish or not, who were involved in supporting the Civil Rights Movement that took off in the '60s, as you refer to, Marc, are now, unfortunately, in so many cases, winking, nodding, being silent about, or even supporting what, essentially, in the West Bank, for instance, is the Klan running everything, that is a clear parallel of people being terrorized, killed by extrajudicial means. And there's no protection being provided, in that case, by the government, as a matter of fact, the Israeli government's part of it.\nAnd then as, you refer to, the horrendous slaughter going on daily in Gaza, and pretty soon it's going to be the two-year mark, while there are some really terrible things going on in many parts of the world, the reality is that genocide is a very clearly internationally defined definition. So many people grew up with the belief, the understanding that that's actually the worst possible thing that could go on, and yet it is going on. So that's one just beyond upsetting reality.\nAnd parallel to that and intertwined is that it is the United States of America that makes it all possible. And so, when you live in that United States of America, that constantly gives us the question: who the hell are we? And I know as somebody growing up in the United States in the '50s and '60s, I was very frightened by watching The Diary of Anne Frank. And that whole question really hovered, and sometimes it was explicit in the '50s, in the '60s and beyond: How could the German people stand by and allow that to happen?\nAnd I got more than a glimmer of that during the escalation of the Vietnam War because there was so much acceptance, support, or just looking the other way, and more than 3 million people died in Vietnam as a result of that active and passive support. And so that question is still with us here in the summer of 2025: How could people allow genocide to happen when \"their own government\" is doing it?\nMarc Steiner:\nI want to jump on this one thing I think it's important to talk about for a moment, because there's a lot of pushback on the use of the word \"genocide\" when it comes to what's going on in Gaza at the moment. Let's talk about how we, how you define that word and why it's being used in Gaza. People could say genocide is the Holocaust, genocide was what happened in Cambodia, genocide is what this country did to the Indigenous people. Talk about the use of that word in terms of Gaza, because there's a lot of confusion and anger around the use of that word.\nNorman Solomon:\nThere is, and I find it notable that a lot of politicians and others and activists who routinely, over the years and decades, have cited reports from Amnesty International, from Human Rights Watch, as authoritative, as telling us what was going on in Africa or elsewhere in the world, and citing, yeah, Amnesty International has said this or that, or Human Rights Watch. last December, both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International issued hundreds of pages reports definitively, unequivocally saying that what Israel was doing in Gaza, and now is continuing to do, is genocide. There was no watering it down, there was no equivocation. So we have these gold standard human rights global organizations saying it without question. And part of, as I read about it and read the scholars part of it is the intent are the forces, the governments, the authorities intentionally trying to make it, for instance, very difficult or impossible for new births to take place, which is certainly the case in Gaza.\nThe destruction of all the hospitals, the filtering out and blocking of humanitarian aid, medicine, food, nutrition, water and so forth. And also polar in part, trying to destroy the culture and ethnic reality of a particular group. All of that falls directly in line with what Israel's been doing. There are so many smoking guns in terms of what has been said by Israeli officials for almost two years now. This is what they're doing. And unfortunately, Israeli society is mostly there. Hebrew University last month released the results of a poll among Jewish Israelis and found that upwards of 60%, almost two thirds said that they believe there are no innocence in Gaza. There are no innocent people in Gaza whatsoever. And I had to think of some interviews that were done, some of the most heinous, top Nazi criminals who were part of inflicting the Holocaust on Jews, on gays, on gypsies,\nMarc Steiner:\n\nNorman Solomon:\nAnd they were asked there children, you were sentencing to death in those camps. And some of the response was, yeah, but they would've grown up to be adult Jews or gypsies or homosexuals or communists, and we couldn't have that. There's a lot of resonance and echoing of that attitude among not just the right wing leadership of the Israeli government, but among the majority of the population. And one thing I've been thinking about Mark, is that at this point, Israeli society is a genocidal society, and the United States in terms of polling is not in favor of that genocide, but for almost two years now and up through the present moment, the US government is a genocidal government because it's making all this possible.\nMarc Steiner:\nSo there may not be a connection to what I'm saying with there may be, I'm curious, your thoughts. You're seeing an impotent democratic party with no sea muscle or strength intellectually or politically just stand up to this or anything else and kind of going along with it all and not the entire group. I mean, there's a growing strong progressive wing inside the Democratic party that are standing up. So how does that political dynamic play into this moment\nNorman Solomon:\nReally important? Because for one thing, if the Democratic party had been truly lowercase d Democratic and had responded to the viewpoints about Gaza during the first months of the war on Gaza, back when Biden was still running for president and then Kamala Harris, then the position at the top of the Democratic Party would've been for a cutoff of military aid. As long as the slaughter continued in Gaza, they would've said no, an arms embargo on Israel. The polling was clear by early of last year, but because the party is under a hammerlock of the pro-Israel, right or wrong forces, corporate forces and so forth, it basically countermanded and ignored what the public wanted, including the total US public, but certainly even more so among Democrats. So when you have a party that doesn't even pay attention to its base, is afraid of its base, which cares more about the big donors, not the small donors, but the big ones, and also the punditocracy, which has been callous and with few exceptions willing to ratify or at least accept this genocide going on in Gaza, then you have a party that's an elitist party at the top.\nMarc Steiner:\nAs you were saying that, one of the things I thought about because as a bumper sticker I made some 40, 50 years ago when I used to make them called existence is contradiction. And I raise that because when we say the power of the Israeli lobby, the pro Zionist world, while it's real, it also raises the spec of antisemitism, which is always bubbling below the surface just like racism. It's always bubbling below the surface. So I'm curious in the midst of our struggles, I mean there was just a huge convention here in Baltimore with a lot of young Jewish people who were standing up to this, which was really heartening. But the question is how do you respond to that? How do you respond to the danger of antisemitism that could kind of leap out at any moment and what we're facing and how to say we have to stop Israel from committing the slaughter against Palestinians.\nNorman Solomon:\nThe strongest force for antisemitism is the Israeli government, and specifically in the last year and three quarters, the Israeli war on people in Gaza. And so there's this ultimate, in many ways, big life scam that Zionism has more intensely propagated in the world. And that is the scam, is that the Israeli government equals Judaism. And once you buy that absurdity, then as Volter says, when you buy into an absurdity, any atrocity becomes possible because opposition to the Israeli government gets equated with antisemitism. And we've seen that with a vengeance in the last more than a year, the attacks on universities, the attacks on basically free speech where you criticize Israel, you do it fundamentally. You dare to say that the Israeli project has been suppressing the rights of Palestinian people, which is clearly true since the late 1940s. And then you get branded as antisemitic. And I think you're referring to what I read about was a wonderful conference in Baltimore not long ago of a Jewish voice for peace.\nMarc Steiner:\n\nNorman Solomon:\nAnd here's thousands and thousands of Jewish activists who've been doing civil disobedience and protesting the war on Gaza for almost two years now, and they're accused of being anti-Semitic. And that really takes the mask off of the propaganda process that the Israeli government and its allies have been relying on for decades. The reality is that all sorts of bigotry is deadly against Jews, against Muslims, against all sorts of people around the world. So it's really all of one cloth in a sense. We fight against that kind of\nMarc Steiner:\nBigotry. One of the pieces I was reading today that you wrote, you've written so much really good stuff that we'll be linking to here on the page. You can just go through it all. It's worth taking time with it. But you're right about Congressman Connor and about the neo fascism bubbling up right here and how it's really connected, I think, to what's happening in Israel. And you wrote, they're banning all international students from coming to Harvard. Seven of the 18 directors of the NIH have been fired, dismantling medical research, dismantling the FDA, firing people to approve new drugs, firing people in the FAA, and then you have a right wing supreme court. And so moving to the states for a moment, that analysis is you, right? Where does that lead us? Where does that take us? What do you think we're facing?\nNorman Solomon:\nWe're facing tremendous repression and an effort to stamp out the opposition to the bigotry, to the rule of the billionaires. And we're facing autocracy. It's a cult led by Trump. The stakes could not be higher in terms of what has survived and been incubated as democratic processes in this country. We have structures that, it may sound like a cliche, but it's true. People died for the right to vote. People died for some ways that the voices and opinions and desires of people at the grassroots could overwhelm the power of the elites. I ran across a quote from the first chief justice of the US Supreme Court, John Jay, who said that people who own the country should run it. And that's what we're seeing in New York City right now. The rage ha hath no fury, like the corporate power scorned. I\n\nNorman Solomon:\nWe have people like Michael Bloomberg and other gazillionaires, and they can't fathom the idea that Ani who would challenge the power of the big banks and the real estate interests and so forth to run the city that they largely own. It's just unfathomable to those who are in power that you could actually have democratic socialism. And on the one hand, we can say, well, as is true with foreign policy, there's a ruling class and they've always, they're the descendants of a long centuries long process of imperial adventure and enforced by military and economic power. So that's who they are. At the same time, there's a huge split in the ruling class, especially domestically. And while the Democratic and Republican parties are so often just in lockstep in foreign policy, when you get to domestic policy now more than ever, it is a huge difference. And there's a sort of a fringe demagoguery that we hear sometimes on the left that there's no significant difference between the Democratic and Republican party.\nSo tell that to a young woman in Texas who wants to get an abortion, tell it to people who are being disappeared. Just look at the dozens of Supreme Court decisions just in the last few months. And you see that the justices who have been appointed by Republicans are bringing the hammer down on the most basic aspects of civil liberties. So there is a huge, huge difference. And I think part of our challenge is to recognize, and you referred to this I think a few minutes earlier with different words, but it's too bad. It sounds sort of stodgy and stuffy and academic, but dialectics that truths exist in contradiction to each other. And it's our challenge to understand in this moment what those contradictions portend not only for the future that we can anticipate, but what the hell we should do. So while we fight against the US militarism that has so many terrible results overseas, and of course it rebounds here as Martin Luther King Jr.\nSaid what he called the demonic destructive suction tube. A military spending destroys lives here at home by diverting resources. The fact is that here in the United States, we have a fascistic party. It's called the Republican Party, and we have the imperative to defeat it. And while ultimately electoral work is a subset of social movements, it really is crucial who is sitting in the White House, who is running the Congress, whose speaker of the house, who's majority leader in the Senate. And it's ironic when we hear people who are into protesting who say, it doesn't really matter, or we don't want to put energy into electoral results when everything we are demanding ultimately has to be implemented through government action or is being set aside and destroyed through government inaction. So it's like walking on both legs. We have to fight for a strong social movement and build it. And at the same time, we need this electoral work. And concretely, that means we need to take control of the Congress away from Republicans next year.\nMarc Steiner:\nI can hear a lot of people listening to our conversation groaning when they hear that because of the lack of faith in Democrats. And I think about historically where we are now on two levels. If you look at what happened in Germany and Italy in the 1930s and how the neo fascists who were a minority in both countries, the fascists took over, they won the election, they took over the country, and they turned everything around, which is in some ways what's happening before our eyes. And we're not making that comparison just like the fascists because of the colonial heritage have taken over what's called Israel. I mean, and that dynamic is at play. So where do you see the forces coming together to counter that?\nNorman Solomon:\nI think, yeah, we needed a united front. We needed a united front against the Republican party in terms of not only these terrible things being done daily that we see in the news from the Trump regime and from the Republican Congress, but also united front to defeat them in elections. And I think in terms of literature, magical thinking can be wonderful, but in politics, we should be really against magical thinking.\n\nNorman Solomon:\nShould really have our feet on the ground. And there is no way to take the Congress away from Republicans next year except through Democratic party candidates. That is just the reality, the idea that Democrats are inherently the epitome of evil. Well tell it to Ilhan Omar, tell it to Rashida Lib. These are wonderful people who would not be in Congress if they had run on any line other than the Democratic party line. So we have this challenge to keep fighting.\nMarc Steiner:\nI was thinking about what's happening Israel Palestine and the fact that during the sixties in the Civil Rights Movement, which I was a part of, 60 to 70% of all the white people in the movement and giving their lives sometimes were Jews down south. And I think that we have to harken in some ways back to our labor and civil rights roots to make a battle, to save the future. I think we are on that precipice.\nNorman Solomon:\nWe're on a precipice that many people have already been pulled over and have been thrown over and are being destroyed as we speak. And it goes to so many questions of identity and what we believe in and what kind of society we can create. One of the notable things to me, which gets very little publicity is that, okay, you have what, 7 million Jews in this country, increasingly, especially the younger ones, identify as anti Zionist, right? A large proportion of Jews in this country surveyed are saying that they believe the Israeli government is committing genocide. And then the largest Christian Zionist organization in this country has 10 million members, way larger. So there's this terrible bargain that has been struck because many of those Christian Zionists don't like Jews. Some of them are virulently antisemitic, but they have a biblical narrative that says, well, the Jews in Israel and what's called Israel is sort of a stepping stone to where they're headed in terms of their holy journey.\nMarc Steiner:\nThey want us dead so they can take over. Yeah,\nNorman Solomon:\nIt's very cynical, but very sincere. And that kind of alliance reminds me of what happened took shape 20 and 30 years ago where you had corporate power, which going way back to the 1970s, the infamous Lewis Powell memo that said, Hey, we have to really organize as right wingers to crush progressives to make sure that the rich and the corporate people keep running the country. Don't let these black people have more power. And so that was really a blueprint that was effectively followed. And then you had the rise of the so-called moral majority. You had Jerry Falwell and people who were evangelical right-wing Christians. They opposed women's rights, they opposed abortion rights. And those two tendencies that became so strong during the 1970s and eighties, they struck a bargain. And I think that the Wall Street people, the corporate forces, they didn't particularly care about abortion rights one way or the other, or women's rights.\nWhat they cared about is maximizing profits, which is what they always care about, and not have labor unions or others get in the way. And then meanwhile, I think a lot of the hardcore evangelical Christians, they didn't really care about Wall Street one way or the other, but they struck this tremendously powerful deal. And we've seen the results. Now we have this reality that a new configuration of alliances is in place. The Republican Party has its own splits, but there we are. And that's I think we come back to again and again, the need for front, and this is I think, a form of dialectics. There are some people in that necessarily united front that I hope will gain more and more power and defeat Republicans next year. Some of we're going to find odious and we need to keep fighting their militarism and their class war from the top down because the only antidote to that, so to speak, is class war that would be more effective from the bottom up for working people, for wannabe working people, for children, for the elderly. That's the battle that needs to be joined. One of the first steps is you defeat the neo fascists that are already in power. I've heard of a parable attributed to Malcolm X that if you're facing somebody who's pointing a gun at you and you're also facing somebody who's trying to poison you, the first step is to knock the gun out of the hand. Who's pointing the gun at you? We're facing a gun right now, and it's the fascistic Republican party.\nMarc Steiner:\nWe have to have many more conversations. I think what you just outlined on both fronts, what's happening in Israel Palestine at this moment and the rise of neo fascism here are really important. And I think you eloquently put it in a lot of your writing that we'll be linking to, so people who can check out what you're saying, because I think they need to read it. And I think that you raise the issue here, which we can come back to at another time, which is part of the root of this, which is the Powell memo that people have forgotten about. And I remember doing shows about that years back. And I think it's important to understand this history, to understand what we face and how we organized the fight against it. And so I just want to thank you, Norman, for being here today, but also for all the work you've done and the writing you've done and the analysis you give us, it's really important. I look forward to wrestling with more ideas with you very soon.\nNorman Solomon:\nHey, thanks a lot, mark.

These claims are demonstrably false, and Owens knew they were false when she published them. Yet, she published them anyway. And the reason is clear: it is not the pursuit of truth, but the pursuit of fame. After being fired from The Daily Wire, Owens used these demonstrably false claims to promote her independent podcast, Candace. Owens' fan base has grown to 6.9 million followers on X and 4.47 million subscribers on YouTube. The most popular podcasts in the world have discussed her “investigation” into the Macrons' history. She launched a revamped website, CandaceOwens.com, fueled by her desire to make these specific false claims about the Macrons, without adhering to content moderation policies.\n4. This is nothing new for Owens. She has built a brand on provocation,\nnot truth. Owens labels herself as an independent \"investigative journalist\" while\n\n\n routinely peddling misinformation under the guise of legitimate reporting. She has promoted a range of conspiracy theories, including anti-vaccine falsehoods, long- debunked antisemitic tropes such as blood libel, and Holocaust distortion—going so far as to dismiss the atrocities of Josef Mengele's medical experiments as mere “propaganda.” Her content is not intended to inform but to inflame and attract attention through sensationalism and conspiracy theories.\n5. Owens published the Series and related X posts with reckless disregard for the truth. Owens was repeatedly presented with credible, verifiable evidence disproving her claims-including documentation, public records, and direct outreach from the Macrons. Instead of correcting the record, she doubled down. At the time, Mrs. Macron had won French defamation claims against others who pushed these same baseless theories, underscoring both their falsity and defamatory sting. Owens knew this. Yet Owens, fully aware of the truth, has not only declined to retract her statements but has actively expanded on them.\n6. These lies have caused tremendous damage to the Macrons. Defendants have subjected the Macrons to a campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies. Owens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history—twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade. The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale. Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do\n\n\n so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile\nfabrications. It is invasive, dehumanizing, and deeply unjust.\nFaced with this relentless and unjustified smear campaign, the Macrons\nare left with no choice but to seek relief through this Court to set the record straight,\nprevent further harm, and hold Defendants accountable for their conduct.\nPARTIES AND RELEVANT NONPARTIES\n8.

From an early age, he demonstrated intellectual curiosity and emotional sensitivity, nurtured in large part by his close bond with his maternal grandmother, \"Manette,” a schoolteacher who introduced him to literature and progressive political ideals.\nPresident Macron attended La Providence, a Jesuit high school in Amiens, where he first met Brigitte Macron, a French and drama teacher. At the time, Mrs. Macron was an accomplished educator and mother of three. Their early interactions were centered around academic mentorship and a shared passion for\nliterature and theater.\nOn April 13, 1953, in Amiens, France, Mrs. Macron was born Brigitte Trogneux—a woman. She was the youngest of six children in a prominent\nchocolate-making family in Amiens. An image of her birth announcement and family photo featuring Mrs. Macron as a child is below.\n\n\n CARNET MONDAIN\nAnne-Marie, Jean-Claude. Mary- vonne, Monique et Jean-Michel TROGNEUX ont la grande joie de vous annoncer la naissance de leur petite sœur Brigitte.\nAmiens, 1, rue Delambre.\nMrs. Macron married her first husband, André-Louis Auzière, in 1974\nwhen she was 21. They had three children: Laurence, Sébastien, and Tiphaine. A\nphoto from Mrs. Macron's and Mr. Auzière's wedding is below.\nMrs. Macron began her career teaching in Paris and Strasbourg before\njoining La Providence in the early 1990s. There, she taught French and directed the school's theater workshop.\n\n\n 26. Through the school's theater program, President Macron and\nMrs. Macron formed a deeper intellectual connection. During a school production of Jacques and His Master, President Macron played the lead role under Mrs. Macron's direction. He later undertook an ambitious rewrite of another play, The Art of Comedy, to create roles for more students. Mrs. Macron agreed to guide him, and the two began meeting regularly to collaborate on the project.\nAt all times, the teacher-student relationship between Mrs. Macron and President Macron remained within the bounds of the law. But, when President Macron's parents became aware of his strong feelings for his teacher, they decided to transfer him to Lycée Henri-IV in Paris. Mrs. Macron encouraged him to leave and was confident he would fall in love with a peer. Yet, before his departure, he told her, \"Whatever you do, I will marry you.\"\n28. President Macron completed his studies at Lycée Henri-IV and went on to earn a degree in philosophy from Paris Nanterre University, followed by a master's degree in public affairs from Sciences Po. He then attended the prestigious École Nationale d'Administration (“ENA”), which trains France's top civil servants. After graduating, he began his career as a finance inspector at the French Ministry of Economy and Finance.\nOver the years, President Macron and Mrs. Macron kept in touch, and\ntheir love deepened. In 2006, Mrs. Macron divorced her first husband, and in 2007,\n\n\n she married President Macron. Their relationship has remained strong and\nsupportive, marked by a deep intellectual partnership.\n30. In 2008, President Macron joined Rothschild & Cie Banque as an investment banker, where he achieved notable success. His public service career resumed in 2012, when he joined President François Hollande's administration as Deputy Chief of Staff and Economic Advisor. In 2014, he was appointed Minister of the Economy, where he implemented key economic reforms, later known as the \"Macron Law.\"\n31. As Hollande's popularity declined amid economic difficulties and rising nationalism, President Macron began distinguishing his platform from that of the sitting administration. He recognized the need for a new centrist movement to address the challenges of the moment. In 2016, he founded the political movement En Marche! (\"Forward!\"), which he described as a “democratic revolution.” Later that year, he resigned from his ministerial post and declared his candidacy for president. His campaign emphasized pro-European, centrist policies and quickly gained national momentum.\nMrs. Macron joined her husband on the campaign trail, acting as a central figure and key advisor to his campaign. Following the first round of elections in April 2017, President Macron publicly credited Mrs. Macron for his success, saying: \"Without her, I wouldn't be me.\" He went on to win the presidency in May\n\n\n33. Upon assuming office, President Macron formally established an official, unpaid role for the First Lady. In this capacity, Mrs. Macron represents France in diplomatic settings, supports charitable causes, and engages in initiatives related to education, health, disability, and child protection. Her responsibilities are supported by an advisory cabinet and two presidential aides.\nMrs. Macron is a strong, independent woman who has consistently forged her own path. Throughout her life, she has refused to be confined by societal expectations or limited by traditional roles. As First Lady of France, she has made deliberate, thoughtful choices rooted in conviction and purpose. Far from merely supporting her husband from the sidelines, Mrs. Macron has been an active and engaged partner-respected for her intellect, influence, and refusal to simply do as she is told. Her life and work embody a commitment to education, civic engagement,\nand personal agency.\nBrigitte Macron is the target of a vicious conspiracy\ncrafted by those threatened by her influence.\nAround March 2021, Natacha Rey-who describes herself as an independent journalist-published on her now-deleted Facebook profile false and defamatory claims alleging that Mrs. Macron is a transgender woman perpetrating identity theft. These baseless allegations initially failed to attract significant public attention. But that changed when Rey began working with Xavier Poussard.\n\n\n 36. In May 2021, Poussard began publishing a multi-issue series entitled\n\"The Mystery of Brigitte Macron.” That series recycled and expanded on numerous falsehoods, including the defamatory insinuations regarding Mrs. Macron's alleged biological sex—allegations later amplified and expanded on by Owens.\n37. In September 2021, Rey collaborated with Poussard to co-author a publication in Faits et Documents, a fringe magazine reportedly influential within far-right circles in France. Faits et Documents was founded in 1996 by Emmanuel Ratier, a known figure of the French far-right.\n38. On December 10, 2021, Rey appeared on the YouTube channel of Amadine Roy, a self-described spiritual medium. Roy conducted a four-hour interview with Rey, during which Rey reiterated the defamatory claims that Mrs. Macron was, in fact, born as a male named Jean-Michel Trogneux (which is the actual name of Mrs. Macron's brother) who stole the identity of Brigitte Trogneux. They also claimed that Mrs. Macron's first husband never existed and that she did not carry her three children. The video quickly went viral, amassing more than 450,000 views before it was removed by YouTube.\nIn December 2021, the hashtag “#JeanMichelTrogneux\" began\ntrending on X, with users pointing to the fact that there are few public photos of\nAt the time of the posts, X was known as “Twitter.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Macron from her youth and that she often “hides her neck\" as \"proof\" she is\ntransgender. From that point forward, the false narrative was amplified by prominent far-right influencers in France.\nIn September 2024, a French court held that Rey and Roy defamed Mrs. Macron for spreading false rumors that Mrs. Macron was born Jean-Michel Trogneux and later stole the identity of Brigitte Trogneux. The defamation suit confirmed that Rey's and Roy's claims that all documents related to Mrs. Macron's birth, marriage, divorce, and childbearing were forged to conceal her actual sex were false. Jean-Michel participated in the trial. Rey and Roy were fined €500 and ordered to pay €8,000 to Mrs. Macron and €5,000 to her brother in civil damages.\n41. After multiple victories against Rey and Roy at home in France, the Macrons thought these false claims had been put to bed. But, as discussed below, Owens turned this flame into a fire.\nOwens is a far-right conspiracy theorist who thrives on making outrageous claims, prioritizing shock value and follower growth over truth or responsible discourse.\nOwens did not always espouse extreme right-wing ideals. She was born in White Plains, New York, and raised in Stamford, Connecticut. Owens graduated\n5 An interim appellate court overturned the judgment on July 10, 2025, and the case is now on appeal to France's highest court, the Court of Cassation. Importantly, the appellate court did not overturn the judgment on the basis that the statements were true, but on other grounds. Mrs. Macron firmly believes that all the statements included in that proceeding are false and defamatory, and that the highest court will uphold her claims.\n\n\n from Stamford High School in 2007 and attended the University of Rhode Island\nbefore leaving due to financial issues.\n43. Following her departure from university, Owens completed an internship at Vogue magazine and was later hired as an administrative assistant at a private equity firm in New York. In 2015, she left the financial sector to start a marketing agency called Degree180. Degree180's website featured a blog that gained notoriety for publishing progressive, anti-conservative, and anti-Trump content-the exact opposite of her current views.\n44. That all changed in 2016 when Owens launched SocialAutopsy.com, a website that aimed to expose individuals responsible for online harassment by publishing their identities. The project was widely condemned across the political spectrum, with both conservative and progressive voices expressing concerns over privacy and potential misuse. In retaliation, critics shared Owens' personal information online. Owens attributed the widespread criticism and retaliation efforts to two progressives who had attempted to convince Owens to abandon the project. While Owens was being criticized by those who purportedly shared her beliefs, she received support from prominent figures associated with the far-right. Owens publicly stated that this was the catalyst for her ideological shift, remarking, “I became conservative overnight.\" In late 2016, she began expressing support for Donald Trump's presidential run.\n\n\nBy 2017, Owens had completely flipped political sides, aggressively ramping up her online criticism of liberal ideology and policies through her YouTube channel. She further amplified her voice and newfound point of view to young conservatives through her role as Communications Director of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization that advocates for conservative ideals on high school and college campuses nationwide.\n46. In 2019, Owens founded the Blexit movement, which encourages Black Americans to leave the Democratic Party. That same year, she launched The Candace Owens Show, a podcast on YouTube, where she interviewed conservative figures. In August 2019, she married George Farmer, a British citizen and the son of Lord Michael Farmer, a former treasurer of the Conservative Party. When the couple met in December 2018, George Farmer was chairman of Turning Point UK and later became CEO of Parler, a far-right social media platform.\n47. As her visibility grew, Owens also became involved in French far-right politics. She was invited to be the headline speaker at the Convention de la Droite in Paris in September 2019. The Convention was organized by associates of Marion Maréchal, the niece of Marine Le Pen, President Macron's political adversary. During her speech, Owens criticized President Macron, calling him a “weak” leader. Shortly after the event, Owens tagged Maréchal in a comment to an X post showing a video of the two speaking: “In the near future, there will be a deeper alliance\n\n\n between France and the United States. ... Thank you, @MarionMarechal for widening my understanding of the challenges faced by France today.\" Maréchal\nreplied favorably, thanking Owens for her courage. Owens' criticism of President Macron continued and increased after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nOver the years, Owens' network has included prominent conservative figures known for extreme or conspiratorial rhetoric, such as Charlie Kirk, Alex Jones, Nigel Farage, and even Kanye West. During Paris Fashion Week in the Fall of 2022, Owens appeared with West wearing controversial “White Lives Matter” t- shirts a slogan condemned by civil rights groups as a white supremacist response to the Black Lives Matter movement. West posted a photo of him and Owens wearing the shirts with the caption, “Everyone knows that Black Lives Matter was a scam. Now it's over, you're welcome.\" Around this time, West announced plans to buy Parler, Farmer's company. The deal collapsed shortly after Adidas ended its contract with West for making antisemitic comments.\n49. In 2021, Owens joined The Daily Wire, where she hosted her talk show, Candace Owens, until her departure in 2024. Owens left The Daily Wire in March 2024 following public clashes with co-founder Ben Shapiro over her increasingly antisemitic rhetoric. In the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, Owens voiced strong pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel sentiments. Her commentary escalated from political criticism to overt antisemitic conspiracy theories. On her talk show,\n\n\n Owens alleged that secret Jewish \"gangs\" commit \"horrific things\" in Hollywood, and on social media, she repeated the long-debunked “blood libel” myth that Jewish\npeople drink the blood of Christian children. These comments justifiably received widespread condemnation.\nFollowing her departure from The Daily Wire, Owens did not slow down in fact, she seized the opportunity to become even more extreme. In June 2024, she independently relaunched her talk show under the name Candace on YouTube. In September, she posted an interview with Kanye West, during which both claimed that Jewish people control the media. YouTube removed the video and suspended and demonetized her channel for violating hate speech policies. Despite this, Owens persisted in promoting conspiracy theories, including calling Nazi medical experimentation on Jewish people during the Holocaust “bizarre propaganda.\" These actions led the Australian government to deny her a visa in 2025, citing a risk that her presence could \"incite discord\" and concluding that \"Australia's national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere\n51. Despite the inflammatory and demonstrably false nature of many of her public statements, Owens' audience has continued to grow. As of July 2025, Owens has over 4.47 million subscribers on YouTube, and her videos have garnered millions of views. She has 6.9 million followers on X.\n\n\nOwens repeats the outlandish claim that Brigitte Macron was born a man on The Daily Wire precisely because she knew its shock value would boost her visibility.\nIn March 2024, just prior to her departure from The Daily Wire, Owens began promoting the false claim that Mrs. Macron was born a man. On March 11, 2024, Owens published an episode of her The Daily Wire podcast Candace Owens titled \"INSANE. This Is The BIGGEST Political Scandal In Human History,\" which reported on the Brigitte Macron conspiracy theory that was making its way through the courts in France. Owens was the first to bring this theory to the U.S. media and to a global audience. That same day, Defendants announced the video in an X post, repeating that it is “the biggest scandal that has ever happened in politics in human history\":\nCandace Owens ✔\n@RealCandaceO\nStop everything and watch this!

Owens claimed she learned about this theory from a 2021 debunking\nstory published by Daily Mail. Owens falsely claimed the article was recent, despite it being published more than three years ago, likely to make it appear that she just happened upon this story rather than searching for a salacious conspiracy to increase viewership. Shockingly, Owens claimed \"there was no debunking whatsoever.\"\n54. But that is false. The article included multiple photos of Mrs. Macron as a child and informed that separate journalists met both Mrs. Macron's brother, Jean-Michel, and Mrs. Macron's late ex-husband, André-Louis Auzière. Owens\nomitted these facts.\nThe next day, Owens followed up with another defamatory X post, stating that she \"would stake [her] entire professional reputation on the fact that Brigitte Macron is in fact a man.\"\n6 Paul Bracchi and Peter Allen, The proof France's First Lady WASN'T born a man: The true story of Brigitte Macron's controversial background is revealed as wicked slur is spread by the French far-Right to damage the election hopes of her husband, Daily Mail (Dec. 31, 2021, at 18:08 EDT), https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10359625/The-proof-Frances-Lady-WASNT-born-\n\n\n Candace Owens @RealCandaceO\nThis episode is blowing up so I just want to say-After looking into this, I would stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that Brigitte Macron is in fact a man.

France's First Lady Exposed,” repeating and\nexpanding on her false claims.\nFrom the start, Owens could not keep her story straight. For example, on Owens' March 21, 2024, appearance on the nationally syndicated radio show, The Breakfast Club radio show, she said that the Macrons “tried to sell to the press a fake photo which got debunked. It was actually Jean-Michel's daughter.” She has never repeated this claim because it is demonstrably false.\n58. After Owens was dismissed from The Daily Wire on March 22, 2024, the outlet did the right thing and immediately removed Owens' March 11 and 13.\nVideo posted by The Breakfast Club (@BreakfastClubPower1051FM), YouTube, Candace Owens On Black America, Congressional Puppets, Donald Trump, Kanye West, T.I. + More (Mar. 21, 2024), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goIrzPIh8yA.\n\n\n episodes, but each remains available online on other platforms.\nFired from The Daily Wire and faced with clear evidence debunking her claim, Owens continues to push\nthe conspiracy-now from her own podcast.\nDespite the extensive and publicly available evidence confirming the truth about the Macrons' identities and history, Owens persisted in spreading her false and defamatory allegations. Even after her termination from The Daily Wire- reportedly due, in part, to her repeated dissemination of baseless conspiracy theories Owens showed no sign of retracting or tempering her allegations. She continued promoting her preconceived narrative, undeterred by professional consequences or contradictory facts.\nDefendants launched Owens' independent podcast, titled Candace, on\nJune 10, 2024. Knowing her false claims about the Macrons had caught fire in March, Owens seized the moment, recycling them starting the very day she premiered Candace—Defendants took to X, declaring Mrs. Macron was a man. Fueled by sensational claims, the show quickly gained attention, earning the second spot on Edison Research's list of top new podcasts for 2024.\n\n\n Candace Owens\n@RealCandaceO\nVince Langman @LangmanVince Jun 9 Seriously, WTF is Emmanuel Macron married to?\n9:39 AM Jun 10, 2024 -8.2M Views\n61.

On June 17, 2024, Defendants released an episode titled, “So...Is Brigitte Macron A Man?\" to repeat the discredited allegations from Owens' March episodes that had since been deleted by The Daily Wire. Seeking to drive traffic to her new venture and expand her claims, Owens opened by warning that the Macrons were \"going to come for [her] life.\" She then repeated the categorically false claim that the Macrons had deployed the secret service to intimidate and detain journalists to hide the truth of Mrs. Macron's transition and identity theft. Finally, she linked these allegations to a broader, equally baseless conspiracy theory: that the world is being run by a gang of Satanic pedophiles masquerading as Jewish people.\n63. Projecting, Owens claimed the Macrons were not behaving in ways one does \"when you are telling the truth.” She claimed there are no photos from the first 30 years of Mrs. Macron's life, but contradicted herself just moments later by admitting that photos of a young Mrs. Macron had been released; she just does not believe they are real.\n64. The clicks kept coming, so Owens kept going, seizing every opportunity to promote her salacious claims.

Owens went so far as to claim the 2024 Olympic opening ceremony—\na tribute to Greek mythology-was designed to \"honor Brigitte Macron,\" because she is transgender. 13 This claim is not only absurd, but self-defeating: Owens also\ninsists Mrs. Macron's biological sex is a \"state secret,\" making such a tribute impossible even by her own logic.\n13 Candace: The Olympics Exposed Brigitte Macron, Candace Ep. 34 (Apple Podcasts, Jul. 29, 2024), https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-olympics-exposed-brigitte-macron-candace-ep-\n34/id1750591415?i=1000663732510.\n\n\nShe then escalated her rhetoric, falsely alleging that the Macrons are part of \"a very small group of elite oligarchs who routinely practice homosexuality and pedophilia, believe in Baphomet, and worship a transgender deity”14 that controls the world. This is yet another baseless, inherently implausible claim- contradicted by public evidence and common sense.\nOwens bolstered this claim by reposting on X a takedown of the\nOpening Ceremony and Mrs. Macron by another provocative figure, Archbishop Viganò, who had just been excommunicated from the Catholic Church. 15 Yet again, searching for the most controversial spin, Owens posted on X that “Brigitte Macron is a transvestite,\" calling it a \"demonic state secret\" and falsely claiming that Mrs. Macron is a rapist. Owens used the conspicuous tag \"#ChristIsKing\" to garner\neven more attention.\nContinuing to capitalize on the attention of sensational figures and known liars, Owens published a post by Alex Jones- -a notorious defamer who owes $1.5 billion to the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims for his malicious\n14 Baphomet is a Satanic figure depicted as a “winged hermaphrodite with a torch between his horns and a pentagram on his forehead.” James Morgan, Decoding the symbols on Satan's statute, Aug. 1, 2015, https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33682878.\nhttps://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1817912361736392858.\n(@RealCandaceO), X (Jul.\nat 09:17 ET),\n\n\n lies and repeated her false allegations. 16 Jones is one of the most unreliable sources imaginable. Owens stated that \"Brigitte Macron was born Jean-Michel Trogneux. He lived as a man for about 30 years before 'transitioning' to Brigitte. While he lived as a man he fathered 3 children.\" Again, Owens tagged “#ChristIsKing.\"\n70. Yet again aligning with the most controversial figures, Defendants brought on Andrew Tate a self-proclaimed misogynist charged with rape and human trafficking. 17 Owens proved that no amount of credible evidence would convince her to abandon her preconceived narrative when she platformed Tate's claim that the French election was rigged like the 2020 U.S. election. 18 Owens went further, claiming the Macrons are \"being blackmailed and they are being selected for these positions.\" She dismissed all critics by saying \"the matrix” is targeting her for exposing the supposed homosexuality and pedophilia taking place in the world. On August 30, 2024, Owens interviewed Poussard, the publisher of the defamatory Faits et Documents series on Mrs. Macron. 19 Poussard became Owens'\n16 Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO), X (Jul. 29, 2024, at 10:59\nhttps://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1817937998652023085.\n17 Video posted by Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO), YouTube, Andrew Tate x Candace Owens, Candace Ep. 46 (Aug. 15, 2024), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwOXLfVsieA.\nThis fake news has also been debunked. US Dominion, Inc. v. Fox News Network, LLC, No. N21C-03-257 EMD, 2023 WL 2730567, at *21 (Del. Super. Ct.

In the interview, Owens and Poussard agreed that the Macrons are perpetrating fraud regarding Mrs. Macron's identity and President Macron's political independence and integrity. They further claimed that Mrs. Macron's nephew resembles President Macron and inferred that the Macrons' relationship was incestuous. directly accused Mrs. Macron of abuse of a minor, impersonation, and identity theft. Owens endorsed, adopted, and expanded on these claims, linking them to her broader conspiracy theory involving an extensive network of satanic pedophiles.\n72. Every time Owens faced consequences for repeating these outrageous allegations, she refused to take responsibility and instead cast herself as the victim and blamed others. For example, on September 11, 2024, Defendants embedded the August 30 episode in an X post claiming that YouTube removed the video for exposing the media's complicity in covering up pedophilia, when the truth is that Owens did not abide by YouTube's content moderation policies, which are designed to guard against misinformation and hate speech.\nThe Macrons flatly debunk the conspiracy in a retraction demand to Owens-but she mocks their response,\nignores the facts, and doubles down with even more reckless claims.\nThe Macrons, through their counsel, sent a detailed retraction demand\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/5nn9gkM9XQ3W2RfTsoM2Kz?si=dZthIgVGTIqfShzdYw8U\n\n\n letter to Owens via email on December 3, 2024. The December Retraction Demand explained the falsity of Owens' defamatory statements and included an abundance of evidence that Mrs. Macron was born a woman named Brigitte Trogneux; that she was not a blood relative of President Macron; and that the Macrons were not being controlled or blackmailed by any group of people. Owens did not respond to the December 3 email.\n74. Owens then repeatedly ignored multiple additional attempts by the Macrons to engage. The Macrons sent a follow-up email on December 18, 2024, which went unanswered. On January 8, 2025, the Macrons contacted Owens' former legal counsel to facilitate communication but received no response. Next, the Macrons attempted to personally serve the December Retraction Demand on January 9, 2025, but were first ignored, then blocked by Owens' counsel—who ultimately agreed to accept service by email.\n75. The December Retraction Demand explicitly denied each of Owens' claims and presented evidence that conclusively disproved them.\n76. The December Retraction Demand reminded Owens that the very Daily Mail article she cited as support for her conspiracies told readers that the Courrier Picard, a daily newspaper in Amiens, France (Mrs. Macron's hometown), included Mrs. Macron's birth announcement. The birth announcement states that Brigitte Trogneux was born on April 13, 1953, and that her siblings, \"Anne-Marie, Jean-\n\n\n Claude, Maryvonne, Monique and Jean-Michel Trogneux, have great joy in\nannouncing the arrival of their little sister, Brigitte.\"\"\nCARNET MONDAIN\nAnne-Marie, Jean-Claude. Mary- vonne, Monique et Jean-Michel TROGNEUX ont la grande joie de vous annoncer la naissance de leur petite sœur Brigitte.\nAmiens, 1, rue Delambre.\n77. Defendants knew this information, but Owens omitted it from her Series precisely because it contradicted the preconceived narrative she intended to tell. This omission was deliberate and is evidence of actual malice.\n78. The December Retraction Demand reminded Owens that in addition to\na first communion photo and family photo, there are additional publicly available photos of Mrs. Macron as a child. In one such photo, Mrs. Macron is playing in a garden as a young girl. This photo was mentioned in the 2021 Daily Mail debunking article and the December Retraction Demand, but Owens never shared it with her viewers because it does not fit her preconceived narrative.\n\n\n 79. The December Retraction Demand reminded Owens that\nMrs. Macron's marriage to André-Louis Auzière and his existence were well documented. The most obvious proof of his existence is the three children he fathered with Mrs. Macron, all of whom have acknowledged him as their father and adopted his last name. Initially, Owens falsely stated that there were no publicly available photos of Mr. Auzière. The December Retraction Demand reminded Owens that a publicly available photo exists of Mr. Auzière from his wedding to Mrs. Macron. Since then, Owens has found at least one additional photo through\n\n\n her relationship with Xavier Poussard.\n80. To discredit this photo, Owens initially claimed that the subjects are not Mr. Auzière and Mrs. Macron, but Jean-Louis Auzière with his first wife, Susan Spray. The December Retraction Demand reminded Owens that Jean-Louis debunked this claim, stating, \"[w]hen André-Louis got married, I was 8 years older and I was working in Germany. There may be a slight family resemblance, but that's not to say that we are the same person. .”20 Indeed, Jean-Louis has testified in French court that the photo is not of him and won a defamation claim against Rey and Roy on that basis.\n81. When Owens was confronted with this information, she changed her\n20 Julien Lagarde, Trogneux affair: in Normandy, a couple collateral victims of rumors surrounding Brigitte Macron, Le Pays d'Auge, (May 16, 2022, at 19:23 CEST), https://actu.fr/normandie/lisieux_14366/affaire-trogneux-en-normandie-un-couple-victime-\ncollaterale-des-rumeurs-autour-de-brigitte-macron_50917623.html.\n\n\n theory, but rather than accept this photo for what it is (an image of Mrs. Macron from her marriage to Mr. Auzière), Owens concocted a new story. She changed course in the Series to claim that Mr. Auzière is in the photo, but that Mrs. Macron is not. Instead, Owens claimed that it was another woman named Brigitte Trogneux and that Mrs. Macron refused to verify that the image was of her. Another lie.\n82. Owens initially told her audience that no journalists could find Mr. Auzière, but this is plainly false. The December Retraction Demand reminded Owens that another Daily Mail debunking article explained that “[r]eporters for several outlets, including the Mail, tracked André-Louis down to Lille several years ago,\" but he declined to comment.21 That aligns with his family's statements that he was a very private man.\nThe December Retraction Demand stated that Mr. Auzière passed away on December 24, 2019. His and Mrs. Macron's daughter, Tiphaine, spoke about his death afterward and noted that he was buried in “the strictest privacy” and that he was \"a nonconformist who valued his anonymity more than anything.\" Tiphaine ended by stating, “he must be respected.” In her earlier reporting, Owens distorted these words and the family's request for privacy into “a warning, a threat almost, not\nGuy Adams, Revealed: Truth behind the conspiracy theory Brigitte Macron is really a MAN - as the Mail unmasks the woman being sued over the viral rumour, Daily Mail, (Mar. 22, 2024, at 22:12 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13228445/jolly-clairvoyant-viral-\nconspiracy-Macron-deny-wife-Brigitte-MAN.html.\n\n\n to look any further.\" In the Series, after being confronted with proof of Mr. Auzière's existence through his documented death and funeral, she again changed course and distorted the Auzière family's desire for privacy into a plot to coverup wrongdoing.\nThe December Retraction Demand also informed Owens that Jean-\nMichel Trogneux is alive and well in Amiens. Emmanuelle Anizon, a journalist for L'Orbs magazine, reported having contact with him in Amiens in September 2023. This, too, was included in the Daily Mail's 2024 debunking article. 22 In fact, Ms. Anizon wrote an entire book disproving the disinformation campaign surrounding Mrs. Macron.23 Shockingly, Owens cites Ms. Anizon's book in the Series but fails to tell her viewers it completely disproves her central thesis.\nThe December Retraction Demand provided evidence that Jean-Michel has recently appeared in public. He attended President Macron's investitures in 2017 and 2022, and the December Retraction Demand provided links to publicly available videos from those events. Not only was Jean-Michel present, but also in the same frame as Mrs. Macron-conclusive evidence that debunks Owens' demonstrably false claims:\n23 Emmanuelle Anizon, L'affaire Madame: Le jour où la Première dame est devenue un homme: anatomie d'une fake news (2024).\n\n\n11:35 DI ECT\n2017 Investiture²4\n11:56 DIRECT\n2022 Investiture25\nVideo posted by BFMTV (@BFMTV), YouTube, Live Passation de pourvoir Macron/Hollande - Edition Spéciale BFMTV (May 14, 2017), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tJPSCnIO_U.\n25 Élysée, Cérémonie d'investiture du Président de la République., (YouTube, May 7, 2022) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaYB8tlaJk.\n\n\n 86. The December Retraction Demand informed Owens that Jean-Michel's\ndefamation claims against Rey and Roy prove his existence and that he is not Mrs. Macron. At Rey and Roy's June 19, 2024 trial, Jean-Michel's attorney presented both Mrs. Macron's and Jean-Michel's electoral cards to the court, demonstrating that they had both voted in the European Elections on June 9, 2024, in different towns. As a result of that trial, Rey and Roy were ordered to pay Jean- Michel €5,000 in civil damages. This information is also publicly available, but Owens has never informed her audience of these facts, which disprove her claim.\n87. The December Retraction Demand explicitly stated that Mrs. Macron is the biological mother of her three children, proving that she was born as woman and has not engaged in identity theft. In her earlier reporting, Owens claimed that Mrs. Macron fathered her three children with Brigitte Proba-Auzière, whom she falsely claimed was the niece of Jean-Louis Auzière, the uncle of Mrs. Macron's late ex-husband. She accused Jean-Louis of forging the children's birth certificates to hide Mrs. Macron's secret. This is the same Jean-Louis whom she claimed was in the wedding photo of Mrs. Macron and her first husband, and who has successfully sued Rey and Roy for defamation. Owens did not repeat these claims in the Series, but she has never retracted the prior false claims.\nFurther, Owens initially claimed that the photo of Mrs. Macron-in\nwhich she is described as a thirty-six-year-old teacher named Brigitte Auizère-is\n\n\n not actually of her, but rather of the fictitious Brigitte Proba-Auzière. In doing so, Owens recklessly disregarded the facts that the photographed woman in this picture (1) had the same name as Mrs. Macron did at the time; (2) had the same occupation that Mrs. Macron had at the age of thirty-six; and (3) bears a striking resemblance to a younger version of Mrs. Macron. Owens later admitted that this was false but she never removed the episodes including this false claim.\nAUZIERE Brigitte Rue des Coquelicots Professeur de Français\nWhen Owens realized her claims about Mrs. Macron's children (i.e., that she fathered her children with the fictitious Brigitte Proba-Auzière) could not possibly be true, she dropped them—offering no alternative explanation, just a gaping hole. She counted on her audience being too captivated or too unquestioning to notice the gap, let alone call her out on it. The reason is clear: Any theory that claims Mrs. Macron is not the mother of her children recklessly disregards the striking resemblance between her and her daughters:\n\n\n90. The December Retraction Demand reminded Owens that Mrs. Macron, Jean-Michel, and Jean-Louis, along with his wife, Catherine, have sued the originators of this theory, Rey and Roy, for defamation. On September 12, 2024, Rey and Roy were found guilty of defamation and ordered to pay damages to Mrs. Macron and Jean-Michel. Before that, the women were found guilty and fined for lying about Jean-Louis and Catherine. Owens disregarded this credible evidence because it contradicted her preconceived narrative.\nOwens responds with ridicule and doubles down.\n91. On January 10, 2025, Defendants posted on X that the Macrons had sent Owens a legal letter. 26 That post demonstrated Owens' loose relationship with\n26 Candace Owens\n(@RealCandaceO), X (Jan. 10, 2025, at 15:29 ET),\nhttps://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1877814980399030350.\n\n\n the truth. In her X post, Owens claimed that “in mid-November, [she] made contact with a journalist claiming to have a trove of evidence to support the claim that the first lady of France lived as a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux before becoming and transitioning to Brigitte.\" Owens crafted the post to suggest that she had a new source, but the journalist was actually Poussard, whom she had already met and interviewed. Owens claimed that \"just 10 days after [their] initial correspondence,\" the Macrons sent her a legal letter-proving that Owens saw and ignored the Macrons' initial outreach in early December. Owens claimed the Macrons “demanded [she] not publicize\" the letter-in fact, the letter had only a heading stating it was not for publication or attribution, a far cry from the demand she claimed. Most troubling, Owens promised she would publicize the December Retraction Demand, but she never did. And the reason is clear the 33-page December Retraction Demand conclusively debunked Owens' claims and exposed her lies.\n92. Owens knows a media firestorm when she sees one. Sensing an opportunity to amplify her claims and attract more attention, she falsely asserted that Tucker Carlson-a high-profile political commentator-was named in the December Retraction Demand. Defendants tagged Carlson on X, banking on the controversy to draw him in and further spread Owens' false narrative.\n\n\n Candace Owens\n@RealCandaceO\nMentioned in this letter are @TuckerCarlson @TateTheTalisman @ArchbpVigano @RealAlexJones Jimmy Dore and many others.\nAND MR.

Owens claimed the Macrons “strenuously requested” that she not publicize the December Retraction Demand and that the letter said “all over it” that it was not to be shared. Another, at best, gross exaggeration the letter contained only a standard first-page heading: \"Confidential - Not For Publication Or Attribution.\"\n94. Owens continued to refuse to meaningfully engage with the December\n27 Video posted by Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO), YouTube, I Got A Legal Threat From A Sitting\nPresident...,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJtAUKgkqc0.\n\n\n Retraction Demand. Instead, she intentionally led her audience to believe that the Macrons refused to say whether Mrs. Macron was born a woman or address Owens' other claims. But Owens knew that the December Retraction Demand addressed each of her claims and proved them to be false. Owens cherry-picked portions of the December Retraction Demand to read to her audience but did not present the evidence against her claims that it contained-because it contradicted her preconceived narrative. Indeed, Owens told her viewers that she had evidence disproving portions of the December Retraction Demand, but she was \"not going to tell you that today.\" Spoiler: She never presented it.\nOwens leveraged the December Retraction Demand to generate buzz and build anticipation for her upcoming episodes. Again, Owens implied she had a new source with “a trove of evidence,” but that source was Poussard, whom she had already presented to her audience. She then falsely claimed that the timing of the December Retraction Demand demonstrated “the communications of the journalist are being monitored,” but admitted she had no evidence to support this.\n96. Rather than reconsider her false claims, Owens doubled down, blaming the Macrons for her content being removed from YouTube and vowing not to retract what she \"deems to be the truth.\"\nOn January 11, 2025, Defendants posted on X that \"all correspondence\n\n\nbetween our legal teams will be available for the public to read.\" Owens has not lived up to this promise because she knows the legal correspondence contradicts her false claims. As with her other false allegations, she promised “strong evidence\" that the first communion photo was not Mrs. Macron (but never delivered it). She also pretended the Macrons had not definitively denied her claims-ignoring the clear, contradictory evidence they already provided.\n98. Defendants continued to mock the Macrons' attempt to correct the record, demonstrating that Owens was not interested in the truth. She would rather make salacious and false claims to boost her revenue. For example, Defendants reposted and expanded on a post from Alexander Dugin (a far-right Russian philosopher and controversial figure) featuring Mrs. Macron as a Neanderthal and wondering if he, too, would be sent a retraction demand:\n28 Candace Owens\n(@RealCandaceO), X (Jan. 11, 2025, at 13:41\nhttps://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1878150320762548707.\n\n\n Candace Owens\n@RealCandaceO - Jan 11\nWill Emmanuel Macron now send a strongly worded letter to Alexander Dugin?\nHow global is @Emmanuel Macron willing to go?\nAlexander Dugin @AGDugin Jan 11\nWe've made some fact-checking and can certified the first appearance of Briditte Macron from Neanderthalian cave in the South of France.

This was blatantly false, and Owens knew it. The truth was that the\nDecember Retraction Demand pointedly denied that the President was statutorily raped.\n\n\n Candace Owens ✔ @RealCandaceO\nYou will note the lawyers intentionally leave out how old Brigitte was.

On January 12, 2025, Defendants again reposted another claim that the December Retraction Demand admitted that Mrs. Macron raped President Macron and agreed it \"was indeed the most stunning admission from the letter.\" Owens repeated this claim on Defendants' January 13, 2025 episode. Again, Owens knew these statements were false when she made them, but the truth did not matter when there were followers to be gained.\n101. Owens' response to the December Retraction Demand was picked up by other media outlets, who understood from Owens that the Macrons had not provided any denials or evidence against her false claims, including that the Macrons\n\n\n were lying about Mrs. Macron's biological sex, just as Owens intended. 29 Those\nsame outlets described Owens as doubling down on all her claims.\n102. Defendants prioritized profit over truth and used the December Retraction Demand as fuel for even more content. On January 13, 2025, Defendants posted on X that Owens was sharing her legal response to the Macrons- she had not yet sent to them.30 In Defendants' January 13, 2025 episode, Owens promised to upload her entire response to her Locals page yet again, she did not follow through.31\nBrigitte Macron was born a man: Candace Owens spreads crazy conspiracy theory about Emanuel\nIndia (Jan.\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/brigitte-macron-was-born-a-man-candace-\nowens-spreads-crazy-conspiracy-theory-about-emanuel-macrons-\nwife/articleshowprint/117208515.cms; French President Emmanuel Macron Says His Wife Does Not 'Owe' Candace Owens 'Proof' She Is and 'Always Has Been a Woman' in Stern Legal Letter, OK!

At that point, Owens decided to escalate her claims further. In that\nsame episode, Owens falsely implied that the Macrons were responsible for the death of a journalist investigating them. Owens claimed that the Macrons have a “dark side” and “one by one, these independent journalists and researchers begin to suffer.\" Noting that \"this is a true story,\" Owens told her audience about Isabella Ferreira, who was investigating the Macrons' relationship and \"landed upon something bigger\" and \"two weeks later, this Isabella Ferreira is found dead.” The authorities ruled Ferreira's death a suicide, but Owens claimed that was “almost impossible.\" The intended, unavoidable, and false implication is that Ferreira was killed for investigating the Macrons.\n104. Owens repeated that the December Retraction Demand did not \"deny that Brigitte is trans” or “explicitly state that Brigitte Macron was born a biological woman.\" This is false. The December Retraction Demand explicitly stated that the Macrons were not concealing Mrs. Macron's biological sex and that she was born Brigitte Trogneux, a woman.\n105. Owens told the Macrons to \"bring this lawsuit.\" She continued, “[d]on't even waste your money on getting a courier to file. I'll file it for you . . . I'll run down to the courthouse and file the lawsuit for you.” Owens claimed, “I might even cover your legal expenses.\" Owens displayed her ill will toward the Macrons, stating, \"I am disgusted by your relationship. You make me sick, Brigitte.\"\n\n\n 106. On January 16, 2025-several days after publicly referencing its\ncontents Owens finally sent a response to the December Retraction Demand to the Macrons' counsel. Rather than retract her demonstrably false statements, Owens defiantly reaffirmed them. She provided no evidence or justification to support her defamatory claims. Instead, she attempted to trivialize the matter by insisting that the Macrons reframe their denials as responses to 21 questions-an apparent effort to convert her baseless \"investigation” into a publicity stunt. Owens then misled her audience by claiming that, because she had posed these questions, the Macrons could never prove actual malice. 32 She failed to disclose, however, that the Macrons had already addressed the substance of her questions within the December Retraction\nOwens releases an eight-part series pushing the conspiracy, packed with false and defamatory claims she knows are blatantly false.\n107. On January 31, 2025, Defendants premiered the Series. The Series began with an introductory episode, followed by six chapters, and concluded with an epilogue. Throughout the Series, Owens made the false and defamatory allegations that Mrs. Macron, born a man, stole another person's identity to become Brigitte; Mrs. Macron and President Macron are blood-relatives involved in incest;\nVideo posted by Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO), YouTube, OH SNAP!

'I don’t have an MBA but he’s not right that the merger, the $8 billion, is based on reruns of a comedy show, no. \n\n'People are buying the movies and the sitcoms and the sports. They’re not based on reruns of us (CBS Mornings) either, so I think it’s wrong.'\n\nDokoupil then attacked Colbert himself, saying his show and its competitors 'got way way more one-sided than anything Johnny Carson was ever doing'. \n\nHe was referring to talk show icon Carson, whose late night program paved the way for the likes of Colbert and who never shared his political views during his 30 years on air. \n\nHe added: '[Stewart] acknowledged that these late-night shows are what he called like a Blockbuster kiosk inside a Tower Record – so the business is broken.'\n\nCo-host Gayle King ignored Dokoupil while adding that she felt sorry for Colbert, describing it as 'very difficult'.\n\nDokoupil agreed, adding that he felt 'for the whole staff of both those shows, and whatever comes next for everybody'. \n\nDokoupil is no stranger to going against the grain, and last year found himself hauled before CBS' in-house DEI team after clashing with author Ta-Nehisi Coates over his anti-Israel views. \n\nStewart's spiel came during a reflective segment on The Daily Show, which originally aired alongside Colbert's since-cancelled 'Colbert Report' in the 2000s.\n\nHe said Colbert went on to 'exceed all expectations' upon leaving Comedy Central for late-night, before acknowledging the fading format as a whole.\n\n'Now, I acknowledge, losing money, late-night TV is a struggling financial model,' he said. 'We are all basically operating a Blockbuster kiosk inside of a Tower Records.'\n\n'But when your industry is faced with changes, you don’t just call it a day,' joking. 'When CDs stopped selling, they didn’t just go, \"Oh, well, music, it’s been a good run!\".'\n\nHe addressed executives at Paramount - CBS's parent company - directly, accusing them of capitulating to Trump to secure the sale. \n\nHe said: 'I believe CBS lost the benefit of the doubt two weeks prior, when they sold out their flagship news program to pay an extortion fee to said president.' \n\n'At that time, poor Andy Rooney must have been rolling over in his bed,' he joked of the late legendary news writer. 'That's right. He is alive. Andy Rooney is alive.'\n\n'I understand the corporate fear. I understand the fear that you and your advertisers have with $8 billion at stake. But understand this,' Stewart added. \n\n'Truly, the shows that you now seek to cancel, censor, and control? A not-insignificant portion of that $8 billion value came from those f**king shows,' he added.\n\nLast Thursday, CBS announced that the comedian's decade-long run as the host of CBS' late night flagship will end next May.\n\nColbert was paid between $15 million and $20 million a year for his failing show. \n\n'Insiders' immediately maintained to publications like Puck and Variety the top-rated show was canceled due to being a money pit what was losing $40million a year.\n\nThe sudden move sparked immediate backlash from left-wing celebrities and politicians, who claim the decision was strictly politically-motivated. \n\nThe cancellation was revealed two days after Colbert used the term 'big fat bribe' to describe Paramount's $16million settlement with President Trump. \n\nParamount, which owns CBS, decided to settle on the suit over deceptive editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.","summary":"Tony Dokoupil took aim at Colbert and his fellow late night host Jon Stewart on CBS Mornings Wednesday.

'The consensus is that Jon Stewart's interview was awful. It seemed like he hadn't read up on the guy.' \n\nAnother called Stewart's approach 'totally bizarre,' given his reputation for needling guests. \n\n'No questions about [Soon-Shiong] destroying LAT's reputation? Nothing about his sucking up to Trump/RFK?' the insider said.\n\n'Especially coming right after Stewart ripped Paramount, just baffling.'\n\nStewart didn't broach the subject of Soon-Shiong's false claim that his paper does not cover his pharmaceutical business, Status pointed out, noting that an undisclosed advertisement for his business was featured on one of the Times' audio shows in March.\n\nStatus reported on speculation that Soon-Shiong - the inventor of a popular cancer drug - is looking for a clear path for future approval of more drugs.\n\nDuring the conversation, Soon-Shiong also announced plans to take the Times public - a revelation that one angry staffer told Breaker Media served as an example 'of the fly-by-night nature of how this paper is being run.'\n\n'This is indicative of everything with him,' another reporter told Politico. \n\n'He doesn't talk to us. He doesn't have newsroom meetings. We only get a sense of what he's feeling via Twitter rant or when he randomly decides to save some pocket change and fire 12 people.'\n\nImmediately after the presidential election, a longtime Times columnist claimed that a piece for the editorial page's opinion section that was critical of Trump had been spiked by Soon-Shiong.\n\n The columnist and several others quit in protest.\n\nOthers accused Soon-Shiong of pulling the Harris endorsement because he 'wanted to hedge his bets' in case Trump won.\n\nIn February, Status reported on pushback against Soon-Shiong following an appearance on Dr. Drew Pinsky's YouTube show, in which he offered repeated praise for Trump and was briefly challenged by the host over his paper's coverage of him. \n\nOther moves that have been met with pushback include Soon-Shiong hosting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s wife, Cheryl Hines, to the paper's offices in February, for talks about a proposed right-leaning version of The View featuring far-right personalities like Candace Owens and Rob Schneider.\n\nThat same month, Soon-Shiong brought conservative CNN commentator Scott Jennings onto his paper's editorial board. \n\nSoon-Shiong acquired the Times in 2018, as part of a $500million deal. The past three years have been plagued by layoffs, the most recent of which saw at least 115 staffers in the newsroom let go in January. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Stewart's people for comment concerning his oversights.","summary":"'The consensus is that Jon Stewart's interview was awful,' one source reportedly said.

Couples that wanted to attend had to pony up $100,000, and those that sought a place on the “host committee” paid $250,000, the New York Post reported. \n\nAt the center of the festivities was former Putnam Investment Management LLC CEO Bob Reynolds and his wife, Laura. The couple hosted the fundraiser at their home on the island, according to the Nantucket Current. \n\nSo, who is Bob Reynolds? The broad strokes of his biography can be gleaned from a glowing profile that appeared in West Virginia University’s Business Magazine in 2022. Reynolds is a West Virginia native who, along with his wife, funded the construction of WVU’s new 186,000-square-foot business complex aptly named Reynolds Hall. \n\nReynolds grew up in Clarksburg, West Virginia, where his father, Bill, served as mayor and city councilman. Bill Reynolds was a military veteran, and his son initially wanted to attend West Point. But as he waited for admittance there, he began attending WVU and studying finance. \n\nReynolds eventually ended up at Boston-based Fidelity Investments, where he spent more than two decades. He made his name there spearheading Fidelity’s 401(k) business as it grew into a lucrative juggernaut. In 2008, he moved to Putnam. \n\nPutnam was sold to Franklin Resources last year, and Reynolds opted to stay at Great-West Lifeco, a leader in retirement savings products where Reynolds had already been serving as chair. \n\nSpokespeople at Great-West did not respond to inquiries about contacting Reynolds. \n\nReynolds and his wife, who also have lived in Concord, have donated tens of thousands of dollars to political causes over the years, according to Federal Election Commission records compiled by OpenSecrets. Many of these donations appear to be in support of Republicans. \n\nDuring President Donald Trump’s first term, Reynolds actively lobbied Republican lawmakers and White House officials to not meddle with the 401(k) industry. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, he and Laura hosted a fundraiser at their Nantucket home that featured Vance and a number of other high-profile GOP names. \n\nIn the lead up to the 2024 election, Reynolds co-chaired a fundraiser for presidential hopeful Nikki Haley. But in the final stretch of that election season, after Trump had consolidated support and forced Haley to drop out of the race, Reynolds told Nantucket Magazine that a second Trump administration would be more beneficial to the market than a Kamala Harris presidency. \n\nLocally, Reynolds made a splash in recent years when he made major donations to support opponents of the so-called “millionaires tax.”\n\nReynolds has also been active in the world of sports. He officiated high school and college football and basketball games for nearly 20 years and counts himself as a major fan of both WVU athletics and Massachusetts sports teams like the Patriots and Celtics. \n\nIn 2006, Reynolds found himself on the short list of candidates to become the next NFL commissioner and told The Wall Street Journal that he would consider the position if it was offered to him. Patriots owner Robert Kraft told The Boston Business Journal in 2015 that Reynolds impressed the search committee and would likely have been offered the job if Roger Goodell was not in the picture. \n\nReynolds was heavily involved in the failed push to bring the 2024 Olympic Games to Boston, donating at least $100,000 to support the bid. \n\nHe authored a book that was released in 2017. “From Here to Security: How Workplace Savings Can Keep America’s Promise” is marketed as a “balanced, non-ideological guide” to improving America’s retirement systems.","summary":"Bob Reynolds and his wife, Laura, hosted a GOP fundraiser at their Nantucket home where tickets cost $100,000 or more.\n\n\nThe post Who is Bob Reynolds, the host of JD Vance&#8217;s Nantucket fundraiser? appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/23/who-is-bob-reynolds-the-host-of-jd-vances-nantucket-fundraiser/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/https___arcmigration-prdweb.bostonglobe.com_r_Boston_2011-2020_2013_11_24_BostonGlobe.com_Lifestyle_Images_32ndAnnualGala12-6881205b1c57b-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 19:02:04","author":"Ross Cristantiel,Ross Cristantiello","authors":["Ross Cristantiel","Ross Cristantiello"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.265},{"id":344576424,"title":"Apple heiress Eve Jobs rumored wedding venue issued license for civil ceremonies today","text":"Did Eve Jobs’ wedding venue make some very special arrangments for her big day?\n\nPage Six hears that Estelle Manor — the luxue hotel where Steve Job’s daughter is expected to marry British showjumper Harry Charles this weekend — has just been issued a license to hold weddings.\n\n Eve Jobs and Harry Charles are set to tie the knot this weekend in a $6.7 million wedding.

It’s been a big shift culturally in that regard, also for sure,” he said during a tense discussion on the morning show on Tuesday.\n\nDokoupil also torched “Daily Show” host Stewart’s claims that Paramount’s decision to drop “The Late Show” was influenced by “corporate fear.” Stewart’s long-running show airs on Comedy Central, which like CBS is a subsidiary of Paramount.\n\nOn Tuesday’s edition of “CBS Mornings,” co‑host Vladimir Duthiers spotlighted points made in Stewart’s monologue in which he defended “The Late Show,”accusing corporate parent Paramount of feeling its merger with Skydance Media was threatened by Colbert’s work.\n\nAfter the clips of Stewart rolled, Duthiers lamented that despite the “financials” and “reality of where linear television is” he was a fan and hated to see the shows go.\n\n“I know they’re expensive to produce, but they are part of the cultural zeitgeist and they have been part of television since that since the beginning of television, he said. \n\n“So that’s why people are reacting the way that they are.”\n\nAfter an audible sigh, Dokoupil cut in to reject Stewart’s notion that The Late Show represented a significant part of the merger valuation: “No, I understand the emotional views. I don’t have an MBA but he’s not right that the merger, the $8 billion, is based on reruns of a comedy show, no.”\n\n“People are buying the movies and the sitcoms and the sports,” Dokoupil said. “They’re not based on reruns of us either, so I think it’s wrong.”\n\nCo‑host Gayle King interjected, defending Stewart’s claim that Colbert’s show “contributed to” the merger valuation.\n\n“He’s saying it’s all encompassing, the whole package,” Duthiers agreed.\n\nDokoupil, however, doubled down. \n\n“Oh, that already happened in the past and he also acknowledged that these late-night shows are what he called like a Blockbuster kiosk inside a Tower Record — so the business is broken,” Dokoupil said.\n\nThe cancellation of “The Late Show” came just a week after the network made headlines for its $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris that he alleged was deceptively edited.\n\nColbert slammed his bosses at Paramount for what he called a “big fat bribe” that was paid to Trump.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from CBS News, Paramount, Stewart and Colbert.\n\nCBS said last week that it will end “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and retire the entire franchise in May 2026, calling the move “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night” and “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nParamount co-CEO George Cheeks reiterated the financial rationale as industry data show the economics have soured.\n\nBroadcast late‑night ad revenue fell to about $220 million in 2024 from $439 million in 2018, and ad spend on “The Late Show” slid from roughly $121 million in 2018 to about $70 million in 2024 amid shrinking audiences.","summary":"Dokoupil broke with his co‑hosts on Tuesday to blame Colbert’s “one-sided” commentary for his own cancellation.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/23/media/cbs-mornings-co-host-tony-dokoupil-rips-jon-stewart-says-one-sided-stephen-colbert-went-too-left/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-jg219nsqp-1753296182088.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1753281841&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Af0nfcWh-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-23 18:45:08","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":344570618,"title":"Inside Steve Jobs' Daughter Eve's Massive $7Million Wedding — as Apple Heiress Adds Failed Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris and Princess Beatrice to Star-Studded Guest List","text":"Eve Jobs is not going cheap when it comes to her wedding as she is set to spend close to $7million to have her romantic day with Olympic equestrian gold-medalist fiancé Harry Charles, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe 27-year-old Apple heiress also has some head-turning names on her guest list, including failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris, Princess Beatrice, and even a performance by the iconic Elton John.Wedding Details RevealedAccording to sources, the big bash is being described as \"a multi-million-pound fairytale.\"\n\nThey claimed: \"The wedding is being planned like a military operation.

That is evident from its lackadaisical attitude toward these demonstrations in the past few years, from administrators mocking Jewish students who feel unsafe on a campus with roving mobs of terrorist supporters, and from the university’s interim president downplaying the university’s antisemitism crisis as “capital hill nonsense.”\n\nJEWISH COLUMBIA PROFESSOR SHAI DAVIDAI LEAVES SCHOOL AFTER WARNING ABOUT ANTISEMITISM\n\nColumbia did this because Trump won the 2024 presidential election and has pressured the university to address the rampant antisemitism it has fostered on its campus for at least the past 20 years. Trump cut the university’s funding and found that the university violated the civil rights of Jewish students who were being harassed on campus. Columbia has since negotiated to restore its funding, which included the university adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which includes recognizing that holding Israel to a different standard than any other nation is antisemitic.\n\nThis would not have happened if former Vice President Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election, given her sympathy for Hamas and their supporters. Columbia has not had an epiphany or a change of heart. This is only happening because Trump and his administration have moral clarity on the issue that no Democrat other than Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) can provide.","summary":"President Donald Trump&#8217;s election has forced some higher education institutions, such as Columbia University, to grow a spine.

Since then, she has doubled down on these claims and added more, including in an eight-part podcast series called Becoming Brigitte, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe Macrons sought retractions from Owens, the suit says, for the “demonstrably false” claims she has made about them but she instead “mocked them and used them as additional fodder for her frenzied fan base”.\n\n“These outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions included that Mrs Macron was born a man, stole another person’s identity, and transitioned to become Brigitte; Mrs Macron and President Macron are blood relatives committing incest; President Macron was chosen to be the President of France as part of the CIA-operated MKUltra program or a similar mind-control program; and Mrs Macron and President Macron are committing forgery, fraud, and abuses of power to conceal these secrets.\n\n“Because Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys’ repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,” the Macrons said in a statement. “Ms Owens’ campaign of defamation was plainly designed to harass and cause pain to us and our families and to garner attention and notoriety. We gave her every opportunity to back away from these claims, but she refused. It is our earnest hope that this lawsuit will set the record straight and end this campaign of defamation once and for all.”\n\nThe falsehoods have taken a toll on the Macrons, who are now subjected to “a campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. Beyond the reputational damage, they have spent “considerable sums of money to correct the public record”, including on legal counsel.\n\n“Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile fabrications. It is invasive, dehumanizing, and deeply unjust,” the suit says.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the Macrons are willing to appear in court in Delaware for a trial. They are represented by Clare Locke, a heavyweight law firm that has won major defamation cases, including the Dominion lawsuit against Fox News.\n\nThe lawsuit came after the Macrons have sent three separate retraction demands to Owens that included evidence disproving her claims, which she has used to “further taunt the Macrons” and “invent even more damaging lies”, a press release from Locke says.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Owens said the commentator was “not shutting up”. Owens is expected to address the lawsuit on her show on Wednesday.\n\n“This is a foreign government attacking the first amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission. In France, politicians can bully journalists, but this is not France. It’s America.”\n\nIt is unusual for a sitting president to sue a journalist, though Donald Trump has filed multiple lawsuits, some of which have led to settlements, against US media outlets in recent months.\n\nAttacks on Brigitte Macron’s appearance and falsehoods about her gender have circulated for years, though Owens amplified them considerably in the US. Other prominent women in politics, including Michelle Obama and Kamala Harris have faced these kinds of “secretly transgender” social media campaigns, the Wilson Center noted in a 2021 report on the “deeply misogynistic” trend. “These narratives tap into the trope of the duplicitous woman, implying that not only are transgender individuals inherently deceptive, but that this deception is responsible for the power and influence that these women hold,” the report said.\n\nThe Macrons have previously filed legal claims against two women in France over their theory that Brigitte Macron is a biological male. They were initially found guilty of libel, though that was then overturned, which Brigitte Macron has now appealed.","summary":"Owens has claimed that France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, is a man, and that French president is controlled by CIA\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife, Brigitte Macron, are suing the rightwing commentator Candace Owens for defamation.\n\nIn a suit filed on Wednesday in Delaware against Owens and her businesses, the Macrons say Owens has engaged in ongoing defamatory attacks against them in order to elevate her media platform, gain more audience and make money.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/emmanuel-brigitte-macron-candace-owens-lawsuit-defamation","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8efa061148a1eb5720e9b5ab6ddfe9845006868/419_0_6882_5504/master/6882.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 18:10:39","author":"Rachel Leingang","authors":["Rachel Leingang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":344542868,"title":"Trump confronted with Jeffrey Epstein pictures, gives cryptic six-word response after photo bombshell","text":"President Trump issued a furious six-word response when confronted with newly-surfaced photos of the late disgraced financer Jeffrey Epstein\n\nNew uncovered photos and videos published by CNN establish links between the notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump.

Kelly began by referring to the guests who have appeared on Stephen Colbert’s show over the years, saying that the comedian and TV host appears “out of touch.” The political commentator further stated:“It’s the same thing as Kamala Harris parading out those celebrities to try to save her campaign. It didn’t work on Democrats. That’s who he’s trying to appeal to. Didn’t work on Democrats for her, and it doesn’t work on his Democrat audience. For him, it only makes him look like the elitist, out of touch, rich snob that he is.”In the YouTube video, Megyn was also accompanied by journalist and host of After Party, Emily Jashinsky. Meanwhile, Kelly stated that there are almost nine months left for The Late Show to end, adding that it could also happen earlier if Colbert continues hosting in the same way.The political commentator then suggested what Stephen was reportedly trying to do with his show now, as she said:“He brings in all these Hollywood and late night and related stars to try to, I guess, make us cry about his cancellation.”Kelly's video has received more than 190,000 views on YouTube as of this writing, while Stephen Colbert has not shared any response to the same.Stephen Colbert seemingly made fun of the reasons leading to The Late Show's cancellationThe producer and TV host appeared in another episode of The Late Show on July 21, 2025. Notably, the episode grabbed a lot of attention after Colbert questioned the reasons behind his show getting cancelled.Stephen Colbert referred to CBS's statement, where the company claimed that it was a financial decision. The host then questioned how the cancellation was linked to financial issues, considering that his show was in the first spot in terms of ratings.Colbert also addressed the press release by CBS, further displaying the article by the New York Post that included sources claiming the show was reportedly losing somewhere between $40 million and $50 million per year.“$40 million’s a big number. I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million?” the host jokingly questioned. View this post on Instagram Instagram PostThe camera then focused towards the audience, who had red plastic food baskets in their hands, leading to Stephen Colbert joking about how he had previously requested to discontinue offering “unlimited shrimp” to the audience. The comedian and TV host further said:“With those numbers, I got to say, it makes sense we’d be cancelled. I get it, guys. And thanks again, okay? Thanks again to the network.”Meanwhile, multiple celebrities have been reacting to the news of The Late Show’s cancellation ever since it was announced. This includes Jon Stewart, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cusack, Zoe Saldana, Kristin Chenoweth, Jack Quaid, and many others.","summary":"Political commentator Megyn Kelly recently shared her opinion on Stephen Colbert's late-night show, comparing his guests – who include popular personalities – to the campaigning strategies of Kamala H","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/podcasts/news-megyn-kelly-calls-stephen-colbert-rich-snob-compares-celebrity-guests-kamala-harris-s-2024-campaign-tactics","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/07f4a-17532848007161-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 17:09:00","author":"Anupal Sraban Neog","authors":["Anupal Sraban Neog"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":344543062,"title":"FCC Chair rips Stephen Colbert after his show’s abruptly canceled: He ‘clearly doesn’t have it anymore’","text":"FCC Chairman Brendan Carr ripped comedian Stephen Colbert after his late-night show was abruptly canceled, claiming that the veteran TV host “clearly doesn’t have ‘it’ anymore.”\n\nThe head of the Federal Communications Commission is currently weighing a long-awaited deal between Skydance and CBS owner Paramount, which axed “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and blamed it on purely “financial reasons.”\n\nOliver Darcy, the reporter behind the Status newsletter, said he texted Carr about rumors that he will approve the merger this Friday and received a late response from the chairman: “Sorry.

The Macrons filed their 218-page lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware.Macrons sue far-right podcasterThe lawsuit accuses Owens of proliferating “demonstrably false” claims through her platforms, including in an eight-part podcast and on social media, designed to feed a “frenzied fan base” in “pursuit of fame,” the Macrons allege.“These lies have caused tremendous damage to the Macrons,” according to the lawsuit, which names Owens as well her business entities, which are incorporated in Delaware.ALSO READ: Inside Eve Jobs’ lavish $6.7million wedding to Harry Charles: Kamala Harris, Elton John confirmed guestsLive EventsThe lawsuit calls Owens' various claims \"outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions\" and said they had caused \"relentless bullying on a worldwide scale,\" doing \"tremendous damage to the Macrons\".Owens, a popular rightwing podcaster, had posted to X in 2024: \"After looking into this, I would stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that Brigitte Macron is in fact a man.\"She posted an eight-part video series to her YouTube channel, titled Becoming Brigitte, laying out her claims.\"Because Ms. Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys' repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue for remedy,\" said the Macrons in a statement.ALSO READ: $1,390 Stimulus check in 2025: Do Americans need to pay tax on the amount and who needs to apply?What did the Macrons say?The false claims have subjected the Macrons to a “campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies,” the complaint says.“Owens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history — twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,” the complaint alleges. “The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale. Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile fabrications.

Think GameStop and Blackberry in 2021, and a few subsequent instances.Live EventsOften, meme stocks are initially the target of “short sellers,” or investors betting against the stock. If other investors start buying the shares and boost the price, that could prompt the people betting against the stock to buy more shares to cushion their own losses.To out it in simple words, a meme stock refers to the shares of a company that have gained viral popularity due to heightened social sentiment. This is usually due to activity online and particularly on social media platforms. These online communities can dedicate heavy research and resources toward a particular stock.Meme stocks often have heavier discourse and analysis in discussion threads on websites like Reddit and posts on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, according to Investopedia.ALSO READ: Ozzy Osbourne’s massive wealth exposed: How did the legendary rockstar make $220 million?How does meme stock work?With the rise of the internet, chat rooms and online discussion boards focused on investing and stock promotion began to flourish. These platforms played a key role in fueling the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, driving up the prices of internet-related stocks—until the bubble eventually burst, triggering widespread economic fallout.The phenomenon of meme stocks didn’t fully take shape until 2020, emerging from the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets. Unlike traditional investing communities, WallStreetBets became known for its brash, irreverent tone and unconventional approach. Users on this and similar forums that have since emerged collaborate to identify target stocks, promote them, and invest their own money in the process.ALSO READ: Inside Eve Jobs’ lavish $6.7million wedding to Harry Charles: Kamala Harris, Elton John confirmed guestsWhile some argue that meme stock communities intentionally coordinate efforts to move stock prices, the reality is often more chaotic. Meme stock investors tend to be a loosely connected group of independent individuals, each with their own investment strategies and risk tolerance. Yet, despite the lack of formal coordination, their collective actions have at times triggered short squeezes in heavily shorted stocks. This dynamic can push meme stocks far beyond what traditional fundamentals or technical analysis would justify, leading to extreme overvaluations.(With inputs from AP)(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onKrispy Kreme stocksKrispy KremeKrispy Kreme meme stockKrispy Kreme in newsgo pro meme stockwhat is meme stockmeme stockKrispy Kreme newsKrispy Kreme latest newsKrispy Kreme stock trading today\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Lawler had been viewed as a potentially strong challenger to Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul. But another prominent House Republican, Representative Elise Stefanik, also has been eying a candidacy. She said in a statement Wednesday she'll decide after this November's election. Also Read | US Shocker: Montreal Man Kills 9-Year-Old Daughter on Vacation, Hides Body Under Log Before Falsely Reporting Her Missing in New York; Arrested. A second-term Congress member from the Hudson Valley north of New York City, Lawler weighed his options as President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans strive to retain control of the House in next year's midterm elections. Lawler told the “Fox and Friends” morning show that running for reelection to the House was “the right thing to do for me and my family and my district.” Also Read | 'Daal Mein Kuch Kala Hai': Rahul Gandhi Attacks PM Narendra Modi As Donald Trump Repeats India-Pakistan Ceasefire Claim '25 Times'. “Keeping the House majority is critical if we are going to continue to move this economy in the right direction,” he said. His seat has been a crucial swing district in recent elections. He noted Wednesday that he's one of the few Republicans who won a seat in a district Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris won last year. Lawler is now coming off a successful fight to raise the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, a significant pocketbook issue in New York and some other places, primarily on the East and West coasts. Trump's big tax and spending legislation, which he signed into law this month, quadruples the cap on state and local deductions to USD 40,000, for the next five years. It had been capped at USD 10,000 as part of Trump's first-term tax overhaul. Lawler held a series of sometimes raucous town halls in his district over the spring — at a time when Republicans were being advised to skip the forums that were drawing angry questions about President Donald Trump's agenda. Trump in May endorsed Lawler for reelection in the 17th Congressional District, calling him “a Strong Champion, and Highly Effective Representative” in a post on his Truth Social platform. Hochul, a former lieutenant governor, assumed the top office in 2021 after predecessor Andrew Cuomo resigned. Hochul was then elected in 2022. She also faces a challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, amid a feud between the two Democrats. Lawler arrived in the House after defeating former US Representative Mondaire Jones, a Democrat who previously represented part of the district. During that campaign, The New York Times obtained a photo of Lawler wearing blackface in 2006 at a college Halloween party where he dressed as singer Michael Jackson. Lawler said the outfit was intended to be an homage to a childhood idol.

Paramount and Skydance both declined to comment on Trump’s latest social media post.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson referred The Post to its previous statement, which read: “Contrary to some news reports or media speculation, Paramount’s settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs.”\n\n“Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties,” the spokesperson for the media conglomerate said. \n\nTrump sued “60 Minutes” and CBS News last October, accusing the network of deceitfully editing an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Harris to make her sound better. \n\nCBS denied any wrongdoing or doctoring of her comments. The editing became an issue after CBS aired one version of Harris answering a question about Israel on “Face the Nation,” and then aired what it called a more succinct version on “60 Minutes.” \n\nThe legal fight has unfolded as Skydance seeks Federal Communications Commission approval for its deal to acquire Paramount. \n\nEarlier this week, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote Skydance chief executive David Ellison seeking details about any arrangement with Trump beyond the settlement. \n\n“Is there currently any arrangement under which you or Skydance will provide compensation, advertising, or promotional activities that in any way assist President Trump, his family, his presidential library, or other Administration officials?” the letter asked. \n\nPeople familiar with the companies’ thinking told the Wall Street Journal that Paramount and Skydance are anticipating FCC approval before the end of summer now that the settlement has been reached. \n\nLast week Ellison met with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and other senior officials. \n\nIn a regulatory filing recapping the meeting, Skydance said it discussed its “commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS’s editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.” \n\nGasparino reported earlier this month that once Ellison takes control of Paramount, the company’s television properties will run “between $15 million and $20 million of public service ads to promote causes supported by the president,” citing “a source with knowledge of the negotiations.”\n\n“There is an anticipation of a mid-eight-figure sum that will be allocated by the network to PSA advertisements and other broadcast transmissions that support conservative causes supported by President Trump,” the source told Gasparino. Paramount denied any knowledge of a “side deal.” In a statement to On The Money, a spokesperson said that “Paramount knows nothing about the alleged side deal between Trump/Ellison, had absolutely nothing to do with it, nor was it a part of what the board approved, and the mediator sanctioned.”\n\nThe president also sued Disney’s ABC for defamation and received $16 million and an apology after “This Week” anchor George Stephanopolous misstated the facts surrounding a civil judgment against Trump.","summary":"Trump reached a $16 million settlement with Paramount after suing CBS News over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/23/media/trump-says-he-expects-a-total-of-36m-from-60-minutes-settlement/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108592509.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 13:40:13","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":344559722,"title":"Protesters Surround Colbert’s ‘Late Show’ Studio Fuming Over Firing: ‘Colbert Stays, Trump Must Go’","text":"Protesters fuming over the cancelation of Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show surrounded the studio, where they bizarrely chanted, “Colbert stays, Trump must go!”\n\nThe demonstrators also chanted, “Keep Colbert, dump Trump” in reaction to the Late Show host revealing last week that his program will not be renewed for another season and will come to an end in May 2026 — a move that CBS said called a “purely financial decision.”\n\nAdditional video footage shows protestors gathering in what appears to be a pitiful crowd outside of the studio, chanting their sentiments while others nearby engage in seemingly idle chatter as they wait in line to enter The Late Show.\n\nRecently, Colbert noted that CBS’ parent company Paramount reached a $16 million settlement with President Trump — which he called “a big, fat bribe” — over a 2024 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nLeftists, and even some Democrat senators, reacted to The Late Show‘s cancelation by pointing their fingers at President Trump — in typical left-wing fashion — as they tried to connect Colbert’s firing to his recent criticism of Paramount.\n\nThe Breakfast Club star Molly Ringwald, meanwhile, oddly suggested that a “silver lining” in Colbert getting fired is that “he’ll be free to run for president now.”\n\n“Whatever he does, I’m here for it,” Ringwald added.\n\nNotably, the ending of Colbert’s The Late Show represents a significant shift from the era of late-night television in the streaming era, in which younger viewers have opted for new media instead of more traditional programming.\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Most everyone involved has denied her allegations, which drew a rare public rebuke from Obama, albeit through a spokesman. Democrats have been quick to point out that one of the Republican-controlled committees that endorsed the view that Russia sought to help Trump was chaired at the time by Marco Rubio, who is now Trump’s secretary of state.\n\nGabbard was viewed as an unconventional pick for DNI. Republicans were initially cool to her usually dovish foreign policy views, which some characterized as too accommodating of dictators. However, the Senate voted to confirm her 52-48, with only Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) dissenting on the GOP side.\n\nBut not long after Gabbard was confirmed, her standing in the administration was questioned. She appeared to be at odds with Trump over the Iranian nuclear program. “She’s wrong,” Trump said when a reporter cited a Gabbard intelligence assessment on Iran’s progress toward a nuclear weapon. NBC News reported she was sidelined on Israel and Iran while journalists strained to find her in photographs of Trump’s national security team in the Situation Room after he ordered strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nThe White House denied Gabbard was marginalized on policy or missing from the Situation Room, posting an image of her sitting next to CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Allies also maintained that the press were exaggerating the discrepancy between Trump and Gabbard on the intelligence about Iran.\n\nGabbard was brought into the administration to do two things: represent the breadth of the Trump coalition and push back against politicized intelligence that she has long maintained led to U.S. wars such as the invasion of Iraq.\n\nOn the first point, Gabbard was a nontraditional Trump supporter, similar to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and podcaster Joe Rogan. On the second, the combat veteran’s star turn may be pushing back on the bipartisan intelligence consensus on Trump-Russia.\n\nFormerly a progressive Democratic congresswoman, she supported socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, which she sought in the 2020 election cycle. While Gabbard didn’t get very far, she did badly damage Kamala Harris in a 2019 debate. That made Gabbard all the more valuable when she endorsed Trump for president in 2024 rather than Harris, who was then the vice president and then-President Joe Biden’s replacement at the top of the Democratic ticket. Gabbard had also previously stepped down from a leadership position at the Democratic National Committee after accusing party leaders of rigging the 2016 primary process against Sanders.\n\nGabbard is taking the lead on the Trump-Russia reappraisal, which could lead to a criminal investigation, as Attorney General Pam Bondi and others in the administration are being criticized for insufficient transparency on the sex trafficking case against disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The White House and the Justice Department have been playing cleanup on Epstein ever since the DOJ essentially declared the matter closed on July 7 after teasing more information for weeks.\n\nA strangely sourced Wall Street Journal article about an alleged bawdy birthday gift from Trump to Epstein rallied the MAGA troops behind the president but hasn’t put the issue to rest. House Republicans are skipping town before a bipartisan group of lawmakers can preempt the administration by voting to force the release of Epstein-related files. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY), a frequent Trump foil, and Ro Khanna (D-CA) have been pushing a discharge petition on the matter. \n\nGabbard, by contrast, won plaudits for her role in releasing thousands of FBI documents related to the investigation of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. But Trump-Russia is a much more hotly disputed political topic, especially if Gabbard is going to use the t-word about Obama’s team: treason.\n\nThe Epstein fiasco will only increase the appetite within MAGA to see powerful figures held accountable for any Trump-Russia malfeasance. Democrats and much of the press will dismiss it as a distraction from Epstein at best or an unhinged conspiracy theory at worst. “Trump rehashes years-old grievances on Russia investigation after new intelligence report,” an Associated Press headline read. \n\nBut Gabbard could also greatly increase her standing with Trump and influence in the administration by slaying the beast that haunted his first term. Tulsi’s time could be now.","summary":"President Donald Trump singled out Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard while taking a victory lap with Republican lawmakers at the White House on Tuesday night.  “Oh, where’s Tulsi?” Trump asked while introducing people at the East Room reception. “She’s, like, hotter than everybody.

Mike Lawler of New York will seek re-election in next year's midterms in his crucial battleground House district, which covers a large swath of New York City's northern suburbs. Lawler, who announced his news in an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends,\" had been seriously mulling a bid for New York State governor. \"There's no question Kathy Hochul is the worst governor in America,\" Lawler told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade, before adding, \"In 2026, she needs to be defeated. But after months of deliberating over this and really working through it, I've decided the right thing to do for me and my family and my district is to run for re-election.\" His news is seen as a major relief to the White House and congressional Republicans, who are defending their razor-thin House majority in the 2026 midterms. Top House Republicans as well as President Donald Trump had urged Lawler to seek re-election, and Fox News confirmed that Lawler met with Trump last week at the White House to discuss his 2026 plans and other issues. WHY MIKE LAWLER TOLD A HOUSE DEMOCRAT TO ‘F---OFF’ \"While I fundamentally believe I am best positioned to take on Kathy Hochul and offer New Yorkers a real choice for Governor, I have made the decision to run for re-election to the House and continue the important work I’ve been doing over the past two and a half years,\" Lawler shared in a statement with Fox News Digital Wednesday morning. Lawler, who represents New York's 17th Congressional District, is currently one of only three House Republicans who represent seats carried by then-Vice President Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election. Democrats are targeting his district in the midterms as they aim to retake the House majority. Their job in flipping the seat would have been made easier if Lawler had decided to run for governor. TRUMP ALLY STEFANIK SIGNALS RUN FOR NEW YORK GOVERNOR If he had run for governor, Lawler would likely have faced off for the GOP nomination against Rep. Elise Stefanik, who represents a district in northern New York. Stefanik, who is a top House Trump ally, is gearing up for her own campaign against Hochul, who Republicans consider vulnerable. Stefanik released a statement Wednesday morning as the news broke, calling Republicans \"more unified than ever in our mission to fire the Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul in 2026\" and Lawler a \"great, effective, and hardworking Representative for New York’s 17th Congressional District.\" \"As I have previously stated, I am focused on supporting strong Republican local and county candidates on the ballot this November to lay the groundwork with a strong team for next year. I will make a final decision and announcement after this year’s November election which we are all focused on,\" Stefanik added. Trump in May endorsed Lawler's congressional re-election, in a move seen as a likely indicator of the president's support for a gubernatorial run by Stefanik, who represents a red-leaning House district. Lawler, a one-time Republican political strategist, won election in 2020 to the New York State Assembly by defeating a Democratic incumbent. He grabbed national attention in the 2022 midterm elections by narrowly defeating incumbent Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who at the time was chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Lawler, who represents New York's 17th Congressional District, is currently one of only three House Republicans who represent seats carried by then-Vice President Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election. Democrats are targeting his district in the midterms as they aim to retake the House majority. Democrats were quick to criticize Lawler's decision Wednesday morning. \"Mike Lawler caving to Donald Trump before his campaign even starts proves he’s too weak to take on Governor Hochul – and he knows it,\" New York State Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs said in a statement, arguing New York voters will reject Lawler \"no matter where his name shows up on the ballot.\" And Democratic Governors Association (DGA) spokesperson, Kevin Donohoe, trolled Lawler on Wednesday morning, \"Donald Trump has officially killed Mike Lawler’s dream of becoming governor of New York and given the GOP gubernatorial nomination to his top D.C. ally Elise Stefanik.

The result wasn’t stunning given the financial crash, former President George W. Bush’s unpopularity, and late Sen. McCain’s slow and tedious performances on the stump compared to the electric Obama. What stunned was the fact that just a few years prior, Obama was a mere community organizer with no executive experience.\n\nAll of that didn’t matter: Barack Obama knew how to wow a crowd. He was relatable. He was young, capturing the presidency at just 47. His wife, Michelle Obama, was charming and strong. His two young daughters, Sasha and Melia, were adorable. It was Camelot all over again. \n\nBarack Obama’s eight years in office, however, were a profound disappointment, especially given the hype. The economy grew at an average of just 2.3%. Unemployment remained stubbornly high well after the 2008 crash, averaging 7.4% throughout his term. Wars he promised to end slogged on in Iraq and Afghanistan. Guantanamo Bay, to the chagrin of many on the Left, remained open. And the only major legislative accomplishment he could point to was Obamacare, which only succeeded in exploding healthcare costs and insurance premiums. \n\nIn 2010, the GOP won back the House in overwhelming fashion, adding a net gain of 63 seats. In 2014, the GOP took back the Senate. \n\nThe 2016 election, however, provided the fatal blow to the former president’s legacy. He had convinced his vice president, Joe Biden, not to run, instead opting for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. For Obama, it was always about symbolism; handing off the first black presidency to the first female presidency was the ultimate checkmark for a party obsessed with identity. \n\nBut then-candidate Donald Trump, the real estate mogul, reality TV star, and New York tabloid king who had never run for public office, had other ideas. Despite headwinds from a hostile media and Clinton out-raising him 2-to-1, President Trump would defeat her comfortably in the Electoral College by capturing the “Blue Wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. \n\nTrump’s victory, like Obama’s in 2008, reflected what voters wanted most: change. Experience in government was seen as a liability, and the establishment (see: McCain, Romney, and Hillary) was seen as defenders of the status quo. \n\nObama lost the House and Senate during his time in office. Despite being a former first lady, senator, and secretary of state, his handpicked candidate lost a race many thought was impossible to lose. \n\nIn 2009, Obama’s party controlled both chambers of 27 state legislatures. Eight years later, Democrats controlled both chambers in only 13 states. \n\nDuring that stretch, the Democratic Party lost a net total of 13 Governorships and 816 state legislative seats, the most of any president since Eisenhower.\n\nUpon leaving office, Obama didn’t follow in the same footsteps as President Jimmy Carter, who helped build thousands of homes through Habitat for Humanity. He purchased beachfront mansions on Martha’s Vineyard and Hawaii and a home near the White House. At his 29-acre Vineyard estate in 2021, Obama threw himself an elaborate 60th birthday party with hundreds of maskless guests inside a huge tent during the height of COVID-19. The Obamas also captured Emmy nominations for producing various Netflix projects after signing a multimillion-dollar deal. \n\nAs their hometown of Chicago crumbles under bumbling socialist Mayor Brandon Johnson (currently at 14% approval, the lowest in the city’s mayoral history), the Obamas have almost been invisible in any attempt to save their hometown. Thanks to a mass exodus to red states, the Windy City’s population is at its lowest in a century. Its income and sales taxes remain among the highest in the country. Its unemployment rate, 5.2%, is well above the national average of 4.1%. Violent crime continues to be a major problem. \n\nInstead, the Obamas await the completion of their presidential library in Chicago, the biggest boondoggle in presidential history. A project on the city’s poorer South Side, once projected to cost $300 million, will likely eclipse $1 billion to complete. For context, W. Bush’s presidential library cost $250 million and didn’t exceed budget. The Obama library is already raising the rent of many apartments and homes in the surrounding area to the point that some residents have been forced to move out. By the time the center maybe opens in 2026, it will have taken more than a decade to finish and gone impossibly over budget.\n\nAs for the former first lady, let’s just say her podcast has been anything but inspiring, including her odd complaints about how tough life was while living in the White House. “You’re paying for every bit of food that you eat. You’re not paying for housing and the staff in it … but everything, even travel, if you’re not traveling with the president, if your kids are coming on a Bright Star, which is the first lady’s plane, we had to pay for their travel to be on the plane,” she whined recently. \n\nGoodness gracious. Food and first-class travel needed to be paid for? How did the family survive in this Gulag for eight years? \n\nEarlier this year, Michelle Obama also decided not to attend Carter’s funeral services, making her the only spouse not to attend among the Bushes, Clintons, or Trumps. As for the marriage itself and rumors of a possible divorce, Barack appeared on her podcast last week to assure everyone that everything was OK, which was patently awkward to listen to. \n\nOverall, the former first lady’s podcast, cohosted by her brother Craig Robinson, launched this year and, despite major hype, is ranked 78th in listenership on Spotify. For someone who has consistently been voted the most admired woman on the planet, this project is a profound failure. \n\nIn the days leading up to the 2024 election, Barack Obama made the rounds in swing states, imploring black voters to vote for former Vice President Kamala Harris based on her gender and race. It was seen as sanctimonious because it was; Trump won a larger share of the black vote.\n\nThe Obama magic and influence are clearly gone. The Democratic Party is drifting further into the abyss without any true leader, clocking in at 19% approval, per Quinnipiac. \n\nOne is a former president who can’t get anybody elected and wants 1 billion dollars as a shrine to his below-average presidency. The other is now a B-list podcaster.\n\nHow the mighty have fallen.","summary":"&#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s not the fall that kills you.

So if anyone wants a house, it’s a beautiful stone farmhouse!’\n\nThe agent’s marketing material describes the farm as ‘discreetly set at the end of a long private driveway…beautifully reimagined over the past year to an exceptional standard.’\n\nIt continues: ‘The estate blends period character with sleek, modern design across 43 acres of rolling Cotswold countryside. The main house unfolds around a central landscaped courtyard, a lovely focal point that brings light and flow to the interiors.\n\n‘Designed for both grand-scale entertaining and relaxing, the layout combines sharp architectural detail with a contemporary eye for volume, proportion and finish.’\n\nBut it is the astonishing price increase which has surprised some estate experts familiar with the property - even if it has been ‘beautifully reimagined’.\n\nOne estate agent, who was familiar with the initial sale to Ellen back in June of last year simply said: 'Well, £22.5million is an absolutely crazy price.\n\n‘I know Ellen has had some interior decorating work done, and there has been some landscaping too.\n\n‘But she bought the place for £15million 12 months ago. And even then she paid £2.5million over the asking price which was just £12.5million.\n\n‘So £10million has been added to what it was being marketed at 12 months ago. Good luck to her of course. A house is always worth what someone will pay for it!’\n\nThe pricing may seem audacious but history suggests Ellen knows what she’s doing: she has an extraordinary track record as a buyer and seller of real estate.\n\nAccording to US magazine People, DeGeneres is a well-known collector of ‘multi-million dollar homes’ including a £24million property in the Montecito area of California where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also live.\n\nIn 2023, she told one US outlet of having bought and sold ‘over 50 houses’ including a house in Malibu that once belonged to Brad Pitt. Earlier this year it was reported that she had put two homes in Montecito on the market - thought to be among her last remaining properties in California.\n\nEllen has revealed publicly that she has put the farmhouse on the market less than a year after moving there from the US.\n\nThe US talk show host told a 700-strong audience of British fans at a one-off show at Cheltenham’s Everyman Theatre the farmhouse she moved into last year was now for sale.\n\nYet she has also insisted she is staying in Britain ‘for good’ - with the decision to stay confirmed following Donald Trump’s re-election as US president last November.\n\nShe has been living in the UK with her actress wife Portia de Rossi, 52, currently based in a new second home - having left the initial one that is now up for grabs.\n\nDeGeneres, 67, said at the Cheltenham event where she was in discussion with broadcaster Richard Bacon: ‘We decided we needed a different house, and now we are selling that house.\n\n‘To clarify, I’m not selling the new one we now live in. I’m selling the old stone farmhouse.’\n\nSources have confirmed that Ellen has quietly let it be known through her property agent that the farm is now available to the right buyer.\n\nThe stunning farm, which is set in 40 acres among the rolling Cotswolds hills, was bought by DeGeneres and de Rossi in June of last year for £15million.\n\nEllen was so enamoured by the property that she paid £2.5million above the asking price.\n\nHowever, the couple’s new life in the quaint English countryside quickly went dramatically wrong after the field next to the house flooded just days after they moved in.\n\nThey were left virtually marooned after a tributary of the River Thames running beside the property broke its banks.\n\nSpeaking at Cheltenham last week, Ellen told how she had decided to move permanently to the Cotswolds as a reaction to Donald Trump’s second American presidential win last year.\n\nShe said her and Portia had visited the English rural region often and always planned to spend some of the year there while reverting to the US as their main home, but that changed with Trump’s victory over his Democrats rival Kamala Harris.\n\nAsked if she was staying here because of Mr Trump, she said: ‘Yes. We were hopeful for Kamala. We were very hopeful and we thought at least let’s get a place here.\n\n‘The idea was that we would be here for three or four months of the year - but always when we came here we loved it and we thought it was beautiful.\n\n‘We thought when I stopped the show [Ellen’s eponymous US talk show] one day, that it was so beautiful here that we would get a farm here and then go back there.\n\n‘And we got here the day before the election. We woke up to lots of texts from our friends and crying emojis. And we were like, “He [Trump] got in. So we are staying here. We are not going back. We are not leaving”.\n\nSpeaking further about her first year in Britain, DeGeneres pondered on ‘the best thing about life in the UK’, telling her audience: ‘I really like the people. Fish and chips are delicious too.\n\n‘The UK is beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful. We [Americans] are just not used to seeing this kind of beauty.\n\n‘Even in the villages and the towns, I love the architecture and houses. Everything you see here is charming. It is a simpler way of life.\n\n‘It’s clean. Everything here is just better. The way animals are treated, the way people are polite. I just love it here.’\n\nHowever, she did admit the weather was an early issue, adding, ‘We moved here in November, which was not the ideal time’ - prompting laughter from the audience.\n\nShe went on: ‘The winter is tough. I would definitely say the winter is tough. But I still enjoyed it because we are not used to seasons.\n\n‘In California it is pretty much always the same and that gets a little boring - and I like the seasons.\n\n‘There is no worse thing than that [the winter]. I enjoy going to British pubs. Of course we go to pubs. We love pubs.’\n\nShe and de Rossi were pictured and filmed last November enjoying a visit to fellow Cotswold resident Jeremy Clarkson’s pub The Farmer’s Dog.\n\nPutting a positive spin on the winter, DeGeneres has now said: ‘I saw snow for the first time in my life.\n\n‘I had honestly never seen snow before - it was just like a fairytale, it was beautiful.'\n\nThey have now moved to the safety of higher ground in a spectacular new property perched on a hilltop on the edge of a village in Oxfordshire.\n\nIt is about a 30-minute drive from their original home and planning documents show it has a ‘sustainable drainage system’ and is not ‘at risk of flooding’.","summary":"Ellen DeGeneres has put her Cotswolds farmhouse on the market for £22.5million - a staggering £7.5million more than she paid for it just 12 months ago.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14932065/Ellen-Generes-Cotswolds-farmhouse-sale.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/23/11/100490359-0-image-m-30_1753267367970.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/08/2941598951789838510/1024x576_MP4_2941598951789838510.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-23 11:34:39","author":"Editor,Richard Simpson","authors":["Editor","Richard Simpson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.396},{"id":344435002,"title":"Apple Heiress Eve Jobs' £5m wedding plans revealed – including very famous guests","text":"Eve Jobs, 27, who is the daughter of Steve Jobs, is set to wed her British showjumper boyfriend Harry Charles, 26, this weekend. \n\nTipped to take place in Oxfordshire, Eve's mother, Laurene Powell Jobs, has gone all out for the wedding. \n\nAccording to The Sun, the lavish affair is set to cost £5m and will even see Sir Elton John perform for the couple. The publication also revealed that Kamala Harris, who is reportedly very good friends with Laurene, is on the guest list. \n\nAlso reportedly on the guest list are fellow equestrian and daughter of Bruce Springsteen, Jessica Springsteen, Apple designer Jony Ive, and Sofia Abramovich, daughter of Roman Abramovich. \n\nThe pair, who got engaged in September 2024, initially bonded over their mutual love of horses, with Eve herself being an accomplished rider in her own right. She has competed internationally at the Grand Prix level and won a bronze medal at the 2019 Pan American Games in Peru while a student at the university. \n\nAbout Steve Jobs' four children \n\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 after complications from a relapse of a rare form of pancreatic cancer and left behind four children: Lisa, 47, Reed, 33, Erin, 29, and Eve, 27. \n\nThe tech giant first became a father in 1978 when he and his partner at the time, Chrisann Brennan, welcomed their daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Then, in 1991, Steve married Laurene Powell, and the couple welcomed their first child, Reed, that same year. \n\nFour years later, they welcomed a daughter, Erin Siena Jobs. Though she keeps a low profile, in 2011, an authorised biography on Steve Jobs written by Walter Isaacson noted that Erin is \"quiet, introspective\" and has \"a personal sensitivity more mature than her father's.\" \n\nIn 1998, the couple welcomed their youngest child, Eve Jobs. Eve is a Stanford graduate, a champion equestrian, and in December 2020, she added model to her resume when she appeared in Glossier's Christmas campaign alongside Sydney Sweeney and Naomi Smalls. \n\nDespite Steve leaving behind a staggering £7 billion fortune, his four children reportedly did not receive an inheritance. Speaking to The New York Times after her husband's death, Laurene explained the reasoning behind their decision: \n\n\"I'm not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that... Steve wasn't interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.\" \"I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn't care about the accumulation of wealth,\" she continued. \n\n\"I am doing this in honour of his work, and I've dedicated my life to doing the very best I can to distribute it effectively, in ways that lift up individuals and communities in a sustainable way.\"","summary":"Steve Jobs' daughter, Eve Jobs, is set to wed her Gold Medalist equestrian boyfriend, Harry Charles, in a lavish £5m ceremony including an A-list guest list and celebrity performances","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/846060/eve-jobs-harry-charles-wedding-details/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/8ff1174c77a7-eve-jobs-split.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 11:03:22","author":"Georgia Weir","authors":["Georgia Weir"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.295},{"id":344434276,"title":"Dropout: Kamala Harris teases a return to politics with California and the White House in her sights","text":"“One year ago today, I began my campaign for President of the United States,” she said. “Over the 107 days of our race, I had the opportunity and honor to travel our nation and meet with Americans who were fighting for a better future. And today, millions of Americans continue to stand up for our values, our ideals, and our democracy. Their courage and resolve inspires me. Whether you are attending a protest, calling your representatives, or building community: I want to say: Thank you. We are in this fight together.”\n\nHarris was criticized almost immediately for her post, with people on social media reminding her that it was not the flex she thought it was.\n\n“Lol I’m not so sure this is something to uh, celebrate,” conservative commentator Tomi Lahren wrote.\n\nA lot has happened to Harris over the past year.\n\nShe became the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee following the midsummer coup of former President Joe Biden, the party’s own democratically elected nominee. Her campaign blew through $1.5 billion in a 15-week presidential campaign that, at times, looked like a congested Cirque du Soleil performance. Her campaign dished out large sums of money on advertising, social media influencers, staff, celebrity concerts, drone shows, and a town hall featuring Oprah Winfrey.\n\nFor all the time, money, and effort, Harris had very little to show for it. She became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the national popular vote in two decades, falling to President Donald Trump in every battleground state.\n\nHeading home\n\nHarris spent the first seven months of the year settling back into her Brentwood, California, home with husband Doug Emhoff. \n\n“Losses are hard in politics,” Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist who served as senior adviser to Harris and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), told the Washington Examiner. “People put their lives on hold to serve and to run, and she deserves the opportunity to rest, clear her head, and decide what she thinks is best — for herself, for the people of California, for the people of this country, and for her family, for that matter.”\n\nThose close to the former vice president said she has been quietly staging a political return. Some claim that she is considering entering California’s 2026 gubernatorial contest. Others said she’s laying the groundwork for a third White House run. Harris purportedly told people at a pre-Oscars party that she would make a decision on her political future by the end of summer. A bid for statewide office would almost assuredly take a 2028 presidential run off the table, but Harris’s lack of definite answers has put the California contest on hold as other candidates in the race and deep-pocketed donors wait for her to make a move.\n\n“Everyone has been trying to read the tea leaves,” San Francisco-based political strategist April Zaradnik told the Washington Examiner.\n\n‘Good God, get on with it already’\n\nMonday’s X post got everyone talking about Harris again, but still, no one knows for sure what her next steps will be. For now, everything is still a mystery. And for some Californians, it is getting old.\n\n“California is not a consolation prize for losing the presidency, and a Kamala Harris run for governor isn’t going to inspire an electorate that is fed up with the Democratic Party’s staid-and-afraid status quo,” Sacramento Bee opinion writer Robin Epley recently wrote. “That being said, if Harris is going to run for governor of California — good God, get on with it already.”\n\nEpley added that Harris’s will-she-or-won’t-she games “belong to a homecoming queen race, not a gubernatorial race.”\n\nTony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction who launched his campaign in 2023, said the uncertainty with Harris “creates a little bit of a limbo situation.” He told the Los Angeles Times that Democrats in the race all have the same question: “Is she going to run?” The only answer, Thurmond said, is an unsatisfying “We don’t know.”\n\nCalifornia candidates wait on Harris\n\nThe Democrats who are already running for governor lack Harris’s star power and know all too well that her entry could upend the race. The election may be a year away, but the primaries are creeping up, and the candidates need to start focusing on their ground game, courting voters, and donors.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter, who declared her candidacy in March, has repeatedly said Harris would have a “powerful field-clearing effect” if she entered the race. But Porter, a liberal firebrand who harnessed the power of social media and whiteboards in Congress to gain popularity, said she is not going anywhere. She is ready for a fight.\n\nPorter received attention nationwide for taking CEOs of big pharmaceuticals to task, but she was no match for Schiff’s Senate campaign machine. Schiff outmaneuvered her in the state’s dramatic 2024 jungle primary. He made a risky gamble of securing his position by boosting a Republican contender and edging Porter, his toughest competitor, out of the race.\n\nOther Democratic gubernatorial contenders such as former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra have said they will stay in the race regardless of what Harris decides. But others, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Konalakis, who is close friends with Harris, are likely to step aside if the former vice president enters the race.\n\nOne Democratic commentator and alumnus of the Hillary for America digital team is asking Harris to stay on the West Coast.\n\nKaivan Shroff told the Washington Examiner that even though Harris continues to enjoy a “deep loyalty” among women and progressives and commands “unmatched name recognition and fundraising potential,” even her “staunchest allies must acknowledge that another presidential campaign in 2028 would come too soon.”\n\nShroff said having Harris focus on California would allow the party to reset.\n\n“The conditions that made 2024 such an uphill climb haven’t gone away, and trying again too quickly could compound political wounds rather than heal them,” Shroff said. “More than that, it would deny the Democratic Party the much-needed chance to have a fresh, competitive primary, as they struggle to redefine themselves in the wake of President Trump’s victory.”\n\nVoters want answers \n\nShould Harris decide to run in California, it may not be as easy of a win as she thinks or as cushy of a job.\n\nHarris was known as a progressive hero in her home state of California. In 2019, the watchdog site GovTrack named her “the most liberal” member of the Senate and the senator least likely to sign on to bipartisan legislation. When she ran for president, she started to shy away from some of her more extreme positions, quietly erasing her record and turning herself into a centrist Democrat because she thought it would make her more electable. She very publicly changed her mind on fracking, border security, the Green New Deal, and taxes on tips.\n\nThe former vice president would also open herself up to questions about her 107-day sprint to the White House, what she knew about Biden’s declining health, and whether someone who has run unsuccessfully for president twice really wants to be California’s governor.\n\nShe would also inherit a difficult budget situation brought on by fiscal mismanagement and multibillion-dollar gaps due to a flurry of spending by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who is also believed to be considering a 2028 White House run. The new governor would also have to deal with California’s 1.6 million illegal immigrants, costly climate policies, homelessness, inadequate disaster relief, an insurance crisis, and near-constant fighting with the Trump administration.\n\nDespite that, it seems that if Harris wants the job, she could get it.\n\n“It’s telling that so many people are eager to write Vice President Harris’s next chapter for her — when the reality is, she’s one of the most popular and accomplished elected officials in the Democratic Party, with deep roots in California, a powerful fundraising network, and a policy bench that few can match,” Adin Lenchner, founder of Carroll Street Campaigns, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nDROPOUT: JOE BIDEN’S MIXED ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND HIS LEGACY AGAINST AUTOPEN INVESTIGATIONS\n\nHarris would lead the pack in a gubernatorial race, according to a July poll from the University of California, Irvine. The survey also found that 41% of respondents would back the former vice president over an unnamed Republican candidate — highlighting both her early advantage and the potential competitiveness of the race. About 16% of those asked said they didn’t know who they would vote for, while 14% said they would not vote.\n\nOn the national stage, a June Emerson College poll of possible 2028 Democratic presidential primary candidates found former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg surging past Harris. Sixteen percent said they would cast their ballot for Buttigieg in the primary, compared to 13% for Harris. That’s a big change from the Emerson poll in November 2024, which had Harris at 37% and Buttigieg at 4%, a few weeks after Harris’s bruising election defeat.","summary":"President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election on July 21, 2024, sending shockwaves through a race already upended by the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.
