That same month, the network announced the Late Show will shutter next year.\n\nExecutives described the decision to cancel Colbert as a purely financial one, though critics argued the network was bending the knee to appease the Trump administration, which held sway over a then-pending merger between Paramount and Skydance, a media company led by David Ellison, the son of Oracle founder and Trump backer Larry Ellison.\n\nThe merger was approved in August, and CBS News is now led by Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer and founder of the centrist publication The Free Press, a new media outlet that frequently criticizes so-called “woke” topics. \n\nAt CBS, long-time journalists have reportedly expressed skepticism towards Weiss, whose tenure has been marked by immediate layoffs.\n\nWeiss has reportedly used her connections and general acceptability to the right to serve as the network’s “chief booker,” helping secure interviews with Trump allies including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, who played an important behind-the-scenes role in negotiations around the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.\n\nWeiss has also reportedly sought to court high-profile on-air talent to jump to the network such as Fox News’ Bret Baier and CNN’s Anderson Cooper.","summary":"Trump’s feud with CBS lasted for months and set the stage for a controversial merger that sees the network under control of a top ally’s son","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-60-minutes-cbs-lawsuit-b2856483.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/30/16/02/South-Korea-Trump-Asia-66zfeotw.jpeg?crop=6000,4000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xgaaYRH8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 01:16:57","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.174},{"id":374615388,"title":"Trump Returns to '60 Minutes' After Lawsuit Settlement","text":"President Donald Trump is returning to “60 Minutes” this weekend, his first appearance on the show since he settled a lawsuit this summer with CBS News over the newsmagazine's interview with Kamala Harris. Trump was interviewed by CBS' Norah O'Donnell Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air this Sunday. The president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison. CBS News offered few details Friday on how the interview came together, or whether there were any ground rules put in place. O'Donnell, the former “CBS Evening News” anchor, is not one of the show's regular correspondents. Trump walked out of a “60 Minutes” interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl shortly before the 2020 election, complaining of bias, and his team released an unedited transcript of the conversation. Despite invitations, he did not agree to a “60 Minutes” interview during the 2024 election campaign. But he complained that the newsmagazine's interview with Harris, his Democratic opponent, was edited deceptively in order to make her look good. CBS News strongly denied any wrongdoing, but Trump filed a lawsuit against the company. Paramount decided to pay Trump $16 million to settle the case this summer, shortly before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount's merger with Ellison's Skydance Media. In the wake of the Trump lawsuit, “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned this past spring, saying that it was becoming clear that he could no longer run the program independently. Since taking over at Paramount, Ellison has sent signals of a closer relationship with Trump. He hired Kenneth Weinstein , the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to serve in a role investigating complaints that the network had shown bias in its reporting. Paramount also purchased the Free Press website in October and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss reportedly had a role in booking the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and aide Steve Witkoff for a “60 Minutes” interview two weeks ago, talking about the peace deal in Gaza. Flying back from the Middle East on Oct. 12, Trump told reporters that “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They're friends of mine. They're big supporters of mine, and they'll do the right thing.”","summary":"The president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-returns-to-60-minutes-after-lawsuit-settlement-1914041","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/01/1973425-aa-5854143.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:57:41","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":374612514,"title":"The Latest: Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judges rule","text":"Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\n\nThe rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\n\nThe program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n Air traffic controller shortages lead to broader US flight delays as shutdown nears 1-month mark \n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages that were causing flight delays Friday at a number of airports, including in Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas and the Washington, D.C., area. Airports serving the New York City area — John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were also experiencing delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA.\n\nStaffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don’t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems throughout the month.\n\nBut Cirium said the data also showed a “broader slowdown” Thursday across the nation’s aviation system for the first time since the shutdown began Oct. 1, suggesting staffing-related disruptions may be spreading.\n\n▶ Read more about the shutdown and U.S. aviation\n\n Instacart, DoorDash, Gopuff among companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients \n\nInstacart said Friday that it will offer customers who receive SNAP benefits 50% on their next grocery order to ease strain as the government prepares to cut off food aid payments.\n\nthe company said any customer who placed an order in October using a SNAP/EBT card will be eligible for the discount, which will be available even if the government makes payments as planned on Nov. 1. Instacart said it is also expanding the number of food banks it supports through online food drives from 100 to 300.\n\nThe San Francisco-based grocery delivery company said both programs amount to $5 million in direct relief.\n\nInstacart is one of several big companies reacting to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown.\n\n▶ Read more about companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients\n\n Trump back on ’60 Minutes’ for the first time after settling lawsuit \n\nThe president is returning to the weekly newsmagazine this weekend for the first time since the suit, which centered on its interview with Kamala Harris, was settled in the summer.\n\nTrump was interviewed by CBS’ Norah O’Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air Sunday.\n\nThe president has a checkered history with television’s most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.\n\n Trump says he’ll fund SNAP if the courts give more clarity \n\nThe president suggested on social media that the government would comply with court rulings to pay for food aid during the government shutdown but said more clarity is needed first.\n\n“Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump said. Federal funds for the program are expected to be frozen starting Saturday.\n\n“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.”\n\nHe sought to blame Democrats for the delay and urged SNAP recipients to call Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n New Pentagon policy undercuts trans troops’ ability to ask to stay in the military, AP learns \n\nThe policy will severely undercut the ability of transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to peer boards to argue for their right to stay, according to a memo obtained by AP.\n\nIf military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override those decisions, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all services from the Pentagon’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently.\n\nIt is the Pentagon’s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following a presidential executive order. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.\n\nThe new memo also requires that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth. If they do not, their absence can be used against them.\n\n▶ Read more about the policy\n\n Court says Border Patrol official won’t have to brief judge on Chicago-area immigration sweeps \n\nAn appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump administration and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.\n\nThe court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers.\n\nEllis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order, before going further and freezing it Friday.\n\nAlso Friday, advocates in a different case sued over what they called “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.\n\n Senate Democrats urge top Trump national security officials to brief lawmakers on Venezuela strikes \n\nThe renewed request came in a letter Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.\n\n“We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,” the senators said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nSignatories included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.\n\nThe letter said the administration so far “has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information” with some members “while excluding others.”\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have complained that the administration has failed to provide basic information about lethal strikes that U.S. forces have carried out against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific the last two months.\n\n Trump opens the door for sanctions on Nigeria over alleged persecution of Christians \n\nThe president announced Friday that he would designate the West African nation “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that has been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is a step ahead of that.\n\n“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump said via social media. “Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.’”\n\nNigeria vehemently rejects such claims about persecution of Christians. Analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.\n\nTrump said he would ask lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.\n\n Union president for air traffic controllers says ‘end this shutdown’ \n\nThe president of the union representing air traffic controllers is calling on Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, make sure federal workers get paid and then engage in bipartisan negotiation on other pressing issues.\n\nNick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the workers the union represents got no paycheck on Tuesday after receiving a partial check two weeks earlier. He said going without a full month’s pay or more would be unsustainable.\n\nDaniels also said the situation is creating substantial distractions for individuals already engaged in extremely stressful work.\n\n“The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown,” Daniels said in a statement.\n\n Top Senate Judiciary Democrat challenges YouTube’s claims of Biden censorship \n\nAttorneys for YouTube’s parent company Alphabet last month sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter claiming the Biden administration pressed the social media site to delete content during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Sen. Jamie Raskin, the committee’s Democratic ranking member, on Friday publicly questioned that assessment in his own letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.\n\nRaskin wrote that the sworn testimony of 20 Alphabet employees contradicted the claims the company had made. He questioned whether YouTube was coerced to claim censorship by the Trump administration.\n\n“What was Alphabet promised or threatened with in order to dance to this new MAGA tune?” Raskin asked in Friday’s letter.\n\nRepublicans argue the Biden administration illegally censored Americans through coercion to tech companies. Democrats dispute that narrative.\n\n Judge sides with Democratic groups that sued over Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive \n\nThe federal judge ruled that Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.\n\nThe ruling deals a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections.\n\n“Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., wrote in her opinion.\n\nKollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue.\n\n Senators press Hegseth for more information on boat strikes \n\nThe Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide the legal rationale for the U.S. military’s fatal attacks on alleged drug boats off the South American coast.\n\nThe senators also requested the directives Hegseth approved for the military strikes, which have killed at least 61 people in 14 attacks since early September. They also want the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.\n\nThe requests were made in two letters from late September and early October that were released Friday by Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have raised questions about the use of military force without congressional approval. The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats that have been attacked, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes.\n\n Top Democrat says Trump administration must release SNAP funds after judge’s ruling \n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said the court’s decision “confirms what we have said all week: The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”\n\nThe district court’s decision leaves “no excuse to withhold food assistance from Americans,” she said.\n\nIf the administration decides not to issue SNAP funds, she said, “it is purely a cruel political decision, not a legal one. They should immediately act — as the court has required — to ensure food assistance continues to go to families in need.”\n\n Judges in the SNAP payment lawsuits expect updates by Monday \n\nA federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from the bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds — and asked for an update on progress by Monday.\n\nA Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling.\n\nThat process often takes one to two weeks.\n\nThe rulings are likely to face appeals.\n\n Senate Republicans reject Trump’s call to eliminate the filibuster \n\nTrump has long pushed Senate Republicans to get rid of the rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. He posted on social media late Thursday that the Senate should “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!”\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules even as he seeks to end the shutdown, arguing that the filibuster is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.\n\nThe leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call.”\n\n“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.”\n\n Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judge rules \n\nTwo federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\n\nThe rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\n\nThe program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.\n\nThe program costs around $8 billion per month nationally.\n\n Trump says he’s renovated the Lincoln Bathroom \n\nThe president announced the renovation and posted side-by-side photos of the before and after of the rehab of the bathroom attached to one of the most famous rooms in the White House.\n\n“It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump added. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\n White House set to resume public tours in December, after interruption for ballroom construction \n\nThe White House says tours will restart Dec. 2, following their suspension for months due to the construction of Trump’s $300 million ballroom.\n\nThe East Wing was once part of tour routes, but has been demolished as part of the project.\n\nThe White House says it’ll now offer “an updated route offering guests the opportunity to experience the history and beauty of the People’s House.”\n\nTo mark the holidays, December tours feature Christmas decorations curated by first lady Melania Trump on the State Floor.\n\nCongressional offices can begin submitting tour requests for their constituents on Monday. Such requests had been paused since the summer for ballroom construction.\n\n Heritage Foundation head defends Tucker Carlson for hosting white nationalist with antisemitic views \n\nThe president of the Heritage Foundation, a prominent Republican-aligned think tank, defended conservative media personality Tucker Carlson after he offered a platform to a far-right activist known for pushing white nationalist and antisemitic views.\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts posted a video to social media Thursday in which he denied that the group was “distancing itself” from the former Fox News host after Carlson’s podcast hosted Nick Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as trying to preserve America’s white, Christian identity.\n\nRoberts’ video drew sharp rebukes from some prominent Jewish leaders from both parties.\n\nCarlson, one of the most powerful voices on the right, has been critical of the U.S.’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas and has come under fire for his own far-right views, including the white-supremacist theory that says whites are being “replaced” by people of color.\n\n▶ Read more about Carlson and the Heritage Foundation\n\n Trump won’t clarify if the US will conduct tests of its nuclear weapons \n\nThe president was asked if his social media post this week about nuclear tests meant that the U.S. would resume testing its nuclear weapons in underground detonation tests, which it has not done since 1992. He replied: “You’ll find out very soon,” without elaborating.\n\nTrump said, “We’re going to do some testing” and “Other countries do it. If they’re going to do it, we’re going to.” But he then refused to offer more details.\n\nTrump’s comments on nuclear testing have drawn confusion inside and outside the government when the president seemed to suggest on social media that the U.S. would resume nuclear warhead tests for the first time in three decades on an “equal basis” with Russia and China, whose last known tests were in the 1990s.","summary":"Federal judges have ruled that the Trump administration must continue funding SNAP during the government shutdown","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-snap-federal-aviation-administration-tucker-carlson-senate-b2856485.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/01/00/Trump_16556.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:41:49","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":374611246,"title":"Democrats are screaming about the impact of THEIR government shutdown","text":"As Democrats drag the government shutdown on, they’re suddenly caterwauling about one thing they knew for sure their recalcitrance would cause: 40 million Americans on SNAP — food stamps — facing a benefits cliff.\n\nThey’ve even repurposed the “starving babies” meme, from Gaza to this standoff. “Donald Trump . . . thinks starving people help him politically!” shrieks Rep.

Phil Murphy in 2021, is taking on Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat nominee.\n\nWhile New Jersey is a traditionally blue state where Democrats hold a significant registration advantage, recent polls show the candidates are neck and neck.\n\nThe Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, Mikie Sherrill, addresses a campaign event in Westville, New Jersey, on Oct. 11. (Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images)\n\nBeginning in June, New Jersey residents experienced a 20% increase in electricity prices that figures into broader concerns about affordability throughout the state. Ciattarelli affixes the blame for the spike in utility bills on policies Murphy has implemented in Trenton and Sherrill has pursued in Washington.\n\nThe candidates have staked out vastly different approaches on energy policy.\n\nCiattarelli has pledged to withdraw New Jersey from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate carbon tax plan known as “RGGI” (and pronounced as “Reggie”) built around “cap and trade” regulations.\n\nUnder Murphy, New Jersey rejoined RGGI in 2021 after his predecessor, Republican Gov. Chris Christie, pulled the state out of it.\n\nIn addition to delivering regulatory relief, Ciattarelli is also looking to reopen power plants Murphy shut down—and potentially open new ones. The Republican has also expressed support for expanding nuclear power.\n\nFor her part, Sherrill has not specifically endorsed RGGI, but she has expressed support for green energy policies in line with RGGI’s goals. Sherrill has pledged to declare a “state of emergency” on utility costs and freeze utility rates.\n\nSherrill, who has represented the state’s 11th Congressional District since 2019, also supports Murphy’s plan to make New Jersey a 100% clean energy state by 2035.\n\nCiattarelli has spent part of his campaign working to tie Sherrill in with Murphy, who has a minus-9 point negative approval rating in the state, while Sherrill has attempted to weigh her Republican opponent down with voter antagonism toward President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Kenny Stein, vice president of policy for the Institute of Energy Research, told The Daily Signal that the decisive factor could be voter fatigue with green energy mandates that have created upward pressure on energy prices.\n\nSherrill and other Democrats have been critical of Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” claiming that removal of subsidies is responsible for the recent spike in energy prices.\n\nStein disputes that reasoning.\n\n“One big problem with this argument is that it will be several years before these subsidies expire,” he explained. “The One Big, Beautiful Bill ends the Production Tax Credit and the Investment Tax Credit for wind and solar facilities placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, and for those facilities where construction did not begin before July 4, 2026.\n\n“Let’s also not forget there is a carveout for projects that begin construction over the next year or so that could then be eligible for subsidies starting as late as 2030. What’s really key here is what’s happening at the state level and what kind of regulations are going in place locally,” he said, adding: “New Jersey could serve as a test bed for where voters fix the blame for rising costs.”\n\nProperty Taxes, Education\n\nNew Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, with the average homeowner’s bill now hovering around $10,000 a year. Since the state’s public schools are heavily reliant on property taxes, any discussion of tax reform almost always intersects with education policy.\n\nCiattarelli views the current school funding formula as unconstitutional. He argues that it violates the equal benefit provisions of the state constitution.\n\nHe has committed himself to setting “a statewide standard on per-pupil spending” and then allowing “that money to follow the student,” according to his campaign website. He also supports various school choice initiatives, including the expanded use of charter schools.\n\nCiattarelli views Florida’s school choice voucher program as a model for what could be done in New Jersey.\n\nSherrill’s “Affordability Agenda” includes a mix of tax credits and rebates. Her education plan revolves around a transparency initiative she describes as “The New Jersey Report Card” that includes an online portal that points to state-funded payments, contracts, and programs.\n\nSherrill does not support private school choice initiatives, such as vouchers, but has expressed some support for charter schools.\n\nRecent figures show Democrats have a roughly 896,350 voter registration advantage over Republicans, but that figure is down from more than 1 million just a few years ago.\n\nMoreover, Trump made significant gains in the state during his 2024 run and came within 6 points of upsetting then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Then there’s Ciattarelli himself, who finished only about 3 points behind Murphy when the governor’s race was finally called in 2021.\n\nThere’s a historical precedent for tax revolts upending gubernatorial races in New Jersey. Then-Democrat Gov. Jim Florio lost his bid for reelection in 1993 after pushing through a record $2.8 billion tax hike.\n\nRichard LaRossa remembers those days. He is a former New Jersey Republican state senator who represented parts of Mercer County. His surprise victory in the wake of the tax revolts gave Republicans a veto-proof majority in the legislature. LaRossa sees a similar dynamic at work today Ciattarelli is attracting support from independents and Democrats.\n\n“No matter what the party affiliation, it’s hard to not realize how far to the left Democrats have gone and that there are dozens of Democrats who are either changing parties or supporting Jack Ciattarelli,” he said.\n\nCiattarelli has been endorsed by a number of prominent New Jersey Democrats, including mayors.\n\nLaRossa also cites some sobering figures he thinks could help move the needle for Republicans.\n\n“It took 238 years for [New Jersey’s] budget to reach $32 billion,” he said. “But it only took only seven years to reach $57 billion, a 75% increase. It’s simple, no one in New Jersey can afford Democrats any longer. We need fiscal restraint and fiscal accountability. That will only happen with Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey’s governor’s office.”\n\nState figures point to a sizable number of unaffiliated voters in New Jersey. In fact, unaffiliated voters may be the largest bloc of voters, even outnumbering Democrats. Whichever candidate wins over the unaffiliated will most likely win the election.\n\nIn-person early voting in New Jersey began on Oct. 25 for the Nov. 4 election.","summary":"Rising energy prices and record-high property taxes are among the top issues driving voters to the polls in a close, competitive gubernatorial election set for...

Mikie Sherrill.\n\nCiattarelli was largely preaching to the choir on the chilly night as the audience, which included some MAGA-hat wearers, was overwhelmingly Republican.\n\nTrump has loomed large over the race and has been one of Sherrill’s great sources of ammunition against Ciattarelli, marking a contrast from the Republican hopeful’s failed gubernatorial run four years ago, when Trump had somewhat faded into the background after his 2020 election loss. Ciattarelli lost his 2021 race by about 3 percentage points.\n\nNow Ciattarelli is forced to walk a fine line of not alienating Trump’s fervent supporters, who he needs to win, while simultaneously refraining from embracing him too much and scaring off moderates, who are also paramount to his success.\n\n“If Trump wasn’t in the White House, Ciattarelli would be up by 12 points,” Sherrill’s former Democratic primary foe, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, observed to reporter David Cruz on his “Hold That Thought …” podcast earlier this month.\n\nLast year, Trump had spooked Democrats by impressively finishing about 6 percentage points behind former Vice President Kamala Harris in traditionally blue New Jersey, dramatically closer than his roughly 16-point loss there in 2020.\n\nBut the president is still underwater with current New Jersey voters, with a 40% approval to 56% disapproval rating, while Dem Gov. Phil Murphy is hovering at a 45% approval to 47% disapproval rating, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.\n\nDuring their final debate in early October, Ciattarelli and Sherrill were given the thorny question of grading Trump and Murphy, the men whom the two candidates have used as boogeymen against each other. \n\nCiattarelli gave Trump a glowing “A,” while Sherrill carefully gave Murphy a “B.”\n\n“That’s a difficult question for Ciattarelli, because he’s got to say A because he doesn’t want to upset Donald Trump. But Donald Trump is not popular in New Jersey,” said Dan Cassino, a politics professor and executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll, to The Post at the time.\n\n“He really does have to kind of try to obfuscate and try and talk around that, and that’s tough for him.”\n\nCiattarelli has repeatedly been forced to navigate some of Trump’s policies that are unpopular locally, such as his deployment of the National Guard in numerous cities across the country and the scrapping of federal funding for the local Gateway Tunnel project, the latter of which the GOP hopeful has publicly opposed.\n\nWhile Sherrill has campaigned or made plans to stump with her party’s top political stars, such as ex-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), and, on Saturday, former President Barack Obama, Ciattarelli has not had an in-person rally with Trump in the homestretch.\n\nInstead, he did a telerally with Trump last week. Trump has also blasted out Truth Social posts urging his supporters to back Ciattarelli.\n\nCiattarelli, when pressed by The Post whether Trump was hurting him at all, insisted, “Not one bit.\n\n“And by the way, he improved by over 10 points in New Jersey ’20 compared to ’24. And he’s done some really good things for New Jersey,” the Republican candidate said.\n\nCiattarelli pointed to Trump’s fight against New York’s congestion pricing and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to increase the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap as examples of positive moves for New Jersey.\n\n“The motivating factor here is the failure of the current administration,” Ciattarelli stressed, referring to Murphy. “It’s been a failure across the board.”\n\nBackers of Ciattarelli agree. \n\n“The president doesn’t have a lot of effect on the state of New Jersey,” said voter Bill Montanaro of Spring Lake.\n\n“In New Jersey, in all honesty, I’m tired of the carpetbagger governors we’ve had,” he said. “We had [Jon] Corzine from Illinois. We got this hack from Massachusetts, Murphy, who’s an idiot. \n\nAnd now we got another carpetbagger from Virginia,” he said of Sherrill, who was born in the Old Dominion state.\n\nGerald Murphy, 62, from Essex County, who has been to at least 15 Ciattarelli events, said the efforts to bring Trump into the New Jersey governor’s race are tiring. \n\n“[They’re] trying to blame Donald Trump,” he said. “No, take Donald Trump out of the picture. What have the Democrats here in New Jersey done for people?\n\n“They give the black community a hamburger, hot dog, chicken. ‘And I’ll see you in four years for your vote again.’ Enough is enough,” said Murphy, who is black.\n\nHe had been a registered Democrat for over two decades before switching to the GOP last year.","summary":"President Trump has loomed large over the New Jersey governor's race and has been one of candidate and Dem Rep.

This transformation highlights a broader trend where affluent communities have increasingly aligned with Democrats, while working-class individuals have gravitated towards the Republican Party. This shift has resulted in Democrats experiencing advantages beyond mere economic prosperity, including longer life expectancies and reduced risks of death from gun violence or opioid overdoses, when compared to other regions.\n\nThe report, titled “Class Dismissed II: The Secession of the Successful,” was crafted by CGCN, a GOP lobbying and public affairs firm. Released exclusively to a major news outlet before its public debut, the report delves into the data reflecting the realignment of voter coalitions, particularly during President Donald Trump’s campaigns. The authors of the report echo sentiments expressed by former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who, during the Clinton administration, described a phenomenon he referred to as “the secession of the successful”—a trend where the nation’s elite distanced themselves from the broader societal concerns.\n\n“It’s not often we find ourselves in agreement with President Clinton’s former Labor Secretary, Robert Reich. Yet, back in the 1990s, Reich identified an emerging social trend he termed ‘the secession of the successful,'” the CGCN report notes. “By this, he meant the elite withdrawing from the everyday issues facing most people.” This new report builds on CGCN’s previous findings from late 2023, offering fresh insights into this ongoing social shift.\n\n“Our updated census data analysis, following our earlier memo ‘Class Dismissed I,’ confirms Reich’s observations as a solid reality, albeit in ways he might not have imagined,” the report states. “The successful class—defined by income, education, geography, and cultural homogeneity—is increasingly gravitating towards the Democratic Party, moving away from Republicans. This ‘secession’ signifies a move into an insular, elite cultural sphere, detached from the working-class and poorer populations, who face the country’s most severe social challenges. Recent data from CGCN highlights that these social and economic issues are more prevalent in Republican districts than Democratic ones.”\n\nThis report is part of a growing body of literature attempting to dissect the challenges facing Democrats, including their perceived detachment from broader society. Another recent analysis, highlighted by journalist Dave Weigel of Semafor, cautions Democrats against further electoral losses and geographical isolation unless they address the extremism tied to their affluent base. While numerous reports have surfaced, this latest offering from CGCN illustrates the increasing wealth and elitism associated with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe new CGCN report continues by arguing that this is a “party realignment decades in the making,” and that the two parties look much different than they did even a decade earlier.\n\n“The GOP is no longer dominated by Izod-wearing denizens of the Shaker Heights Country Club, and the Democrats are no longer the party of working-class locals in Youngstown’s Royal Oaks Bar and Grill,” the CGCN authors wrote, pointing specifically to the curious case of former Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who spent his entire decades-long career as an elected Democrat portraying himself as a working-class champion only to get absolutely smoked by now-Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) at the ballot box last year. Now, Brown is trying to run again, this time against newly-appointed GOP Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH) — who was picked to fill the spot vacated by now Vice President JD Vance — but is seriously failing to gain traction with the very working-class voters with whom he used to connect. The authors point to what they say are “earth shattering” changes in endorsements, where labor unions across Ohio are now backing Husted instead of Brown’s flailing comeback bid.\n\n“In short, anyone familiar with his decades-long career would know that unionism is in Brown’s DNA,” the CGCN authors wrote. “But in a sign of the times, his opponent, incumbent Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH), just inked substantial endorsements from Ohio’s industrial labor unions, including the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 18 and 66, ‘giving the incumbent support from affiliated unions in all of Ohio’s 88 counties,’ according to Axios. On top of this, in September, the Northwest Ohio Building Trades Council flipped its support from Brown to Husted. This is, in short, earth shattering.”\n\nThe report then quotes a local labor leader explaining why the unions are endorsing the Republican Husted over the Democrat Brown.\n\n“The Mahoning Valley is the backbone of Ohio’s working class,” Jesse DiRenna, business manager for IUOE Local 66, said. “Sen. Jon Husted leads with action not just photo ops. His values align with ours, which is why we support him.”\n\nThe next two pages of the 13-page report have some of the most interesting data unearthed by the CGCN analysts, particularly the economic conditions in Democrat versus Republican strongholds in this era versus previous eras. First off, the report analyzes the share of annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the areas that voted for Trump the last three presidential elections versus the areas that voted for Democrat presidential nominees Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris.\n\n“Consider that Democrats, in fact, represent far wealthier districts and constituents than the GOP,” the report reads. “For example, over the last three presidential election cycles, Democratic candidates won counties with a higher share of aggregate GDP than Donald Trump.”\n\nAstoundingly, just during Trump’s time atop the Republican Party the past decade, this existing trend has grown far more profound. In 2016, the counties that Trump won nationwide amounted to 36 percent of aggregate GDP and the counties that Clinton won represented 64 percent of aggregate GDP. During the 2020 election, Trump’s counties represented 29 percent of aggregate GDP while Biden’s represented 71 percent. In 2024, Trump counties represented 37 percent of aggregate GDP while Harris-won counties represented 63 percent of aggregate GDP.\n\nIt’s even harder core when looking at the wealth among congressional districts and which parties hold seats in the richest parts of America. In fact, the report citing U.S. Census data found that Democrats currently hold more than three quarters — more than 76 percent — of the top 30 wealthiest congressional districts in America.\n\n“According to U.S. Census data, America’s wealthiest districts are overwhelmingly represented by Democrats,” the report reads. “Of the 30 richest congressional districts, only 7 are represented by Republicans, while 23 are represented by Democrats. By contrast, representation among the 30 poorest districts is more evenly split — Democrats represent 18, and Republicans represent 12.”\n\nMany of the most powerful Democrats, like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Ro Khanna (D-CA), and Jerry Nadler (D-NY) represent some of the “wealthiest districts” in the nation, and these names are also “some of the most familiar on cable news.”\n\n“The political and moral burden of representing poor and forgotten Americas now lies with the GOP,” the report continues. “Moreover, the stark divide between the everyday experience of one living in a poor congressional district as compared to a wealthy one explains in good measure why the two parties speak different languages.”\n\nLooking at the income data in the 30 wealthiest districts — again, now mostly Democrats — versus the 30 poorest districts, which are much more evenly split, the difference is profound. The median income in the richest districts per the CGCN report is $133,071, more than double the poorest district median income, which is $52,318. Unemployment is significantly worse in the poorer districts too, at 5.89 percent on average versus just 3.93 percent on average in the wealthy districts that Democrats dominate.\n\nBeyond the economic numbers, several social statistics also demonstrate a much higher quality of life for the very rich Democrats in America.\n\n“Opioid deaths are far more common in the poorest areas,” the CGCN report reads. “There are 19.6233 opioid deaths per 100,000 in the wealthiest districts. This number is even higher in the poorest districts. It jumps to 32.466 opioid deaths per 100,000 in the poorest districts. Firearm homicides are also far more common in the poorest districts. There are 13.39 firearm homicides per 100,000 people in the poorest districts. This number is 3.2 per 100,000 for the wealthiest districts. The poorest districts are trailing in high school completion. The average for the top 30 wealthiest districts is 92.93% with the number dropping to 84.66% for the poorest districts. The poorest districts have a lower life expectancy by about five years. The average life expectancy for the top 30 wealthiest districts is 81.333 years. For the poorest districts it falls to 75.82.”\n\nWhat’s more, Democrats in the House and Senate have become more elitist — and Republicans in both chambers less so — over the last several decades when it comes to education levels.\n\n“In the 93rd Congress (1973-75), 55% of Senate Republicans went to elite universities. In the 117th Congress (2021-2023), that number declined to 34%,” the report reads on a later page. “House Republicans educated from elite universities plummeted from 40% in the 93rd Congress to just 15% in the 117th. In the 117th Congress, over 50% of Democratic Senators had degrees from elite institutions. House Democrats who graduated from Harvard rose from 9% (93rd Congress) to 15% (117th Congress). Democratic senators from Yale University rose from 5% (93rd Congress) to 6% (117th Congress).”\n\nInterestingly, too, the report also found that the vast majority of members of the establishment media are rich, elitist, and white — meaning they have an inherent bias that misses the concerns of working-class Americans, who again are more and more becoming Republicans.\n\n“And whether consciously or not, most reporters strain to understand worlds completely foreign to them,” the CGCN report reads. “Here we mean rural areas and low-income neighborhoods, marred by crime, opioid deaths, and chronic unemployment, with populations who are religious, without college degrees, and overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. Hence, it’s not difficult to see the result: media bias. As conventionally understood, such bias also stems from a well-documented fact — reporters identify far more as Democrats than Republicans. A 2022 study by Syracuse University’s Newhouse School found that 36.3% of journalists identified as Democrats, while only 3.4% identified as Republicans. But in a similar context, the lack of newsroom diversity can also bias coverage.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Life is looking up for the Democratic Party, notably among&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Study Highlights Democrats&#8217; Emergence as the Party of Affluence first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-study-highlights-democrats-emergence-as-the-party-of-affluence/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Analysis-Reveals-How-Democrats-Are-Now-Party-of-the-Rich.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 22:00:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":374589232,"title":"Greg Gutfeld: The White House needed a serious cleaning","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Five October 31, 2025 10:17 \n\n Greg Gutfeld: The White House needed a serious cleaning \n 'The Five' discusses President Donald Trump asking Republicans to ax the filibuster to end the government shutdown as former Vice President Kamala Harris drops f-bombs over the White House ballroom.\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE FIVEV-VIDEODONALD TRUMPKAMALA HARRISMEDIAWHITE HOUSEGOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNREPUBLICANS","summary":"&apos;The Five&apos; discusses President Donald Trump asking Republicans to ax the filibuster to end the government shutdown as former Vice President Kamala Harris drops f-bombs over the White House ballroom.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6384371314112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/01a5064c-9411-4c4c-a1e1-d6a09e4b917b/6b485e40-ed5b-4e99-b613-598e7721c2f7/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 21:50:32","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":374594252,"title":"Jack Ciattarelli confident he’ll ‘deliver a win’ as he votes early in New Jersey election","text":"“As I always like to say, what do championship teams do? We got four days left, let’s finish strong, let’s win, and let’s change the direction of Jersey,” Ciattarelli told his supporters.\n\n“We got two more days of early voting,” he added, quipping that “if you come across anyone you know that’s not voting for me, tell them that Election Day’s Wednesday, Nov. 5.”\n\nCiattarelli is facing Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) in the gubernatorial race, the most competitive of the two taking place on Tuesday. Though Sherrill has held a sizable lead in the historically blue state since she and Ciattarelli won their respective primaries in June, the state has begun to trend to the right and has a track record of periodically electing Republicans.\n\nAn Emerson College poll this week found that Ciattarelli and Sherrill are in a statistical dead heat, giving Sherrill a RealClearPolitics average of a 3.6-point lead. Ciattarelli said he was not shocked by the survey’s results, which put Sherrill at 49% of the vote to his 48%.\n\n“I get up and down the state every day of the week, and it’s confirming what I feel that’s out there,” Ciattarelli said outside the early voting location. “But we’re not done. We’ll finish strong over these last four days, and I really do believe that we’re going to deliver a win for New Jersey on Tuesday.”\n\nCiattarelli hopeful a changing ‘landscape’ will push him to victory\n\nCiattarelli is looking for a comeback this year, hoping the third time’s the charm.\n\nHe lost to former Gov. Chris Christie’s lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, in the 2017 GOP primary race. Then, in 2021, Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) defeated Ciattarelli by roughly 3 percentage points — becoming the first Democratic governor reelected since 1977.\n\nHe said the landscape of New Jersey has changed, which is why he is more confident in a 2025 win than he was in 2021.\n\n“The issues I was talking about in ‘21 were percolating. Today they’re at a complete boil,” he said, pointing to the high cost of living and affordability crises the Garden State is facing.\n\nHe added that he also has the benefit of not facing Murphy, who was seeking reelection and could rely on his incumbent status.\n\n“I’m not competing with a pandemic this time around,” he added. “It wasn’t easy campaigning for governor during a shelter-in-place. I’m not going up against an incumbent. Murphy did leverage the power of incumbency. [Sherrill’s] not an incumbent.” \n\nBut the biggest contrast between the two races is that there’s “a lot less indifference this time around.”\n\n“Back in ‘21, I had too many people inside New Jersey, including Republicans, and people around the country didn’t think I had a shot in hell,” he said. “They now know differently because of our performance in ‘21.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, then a former president, did not endorse Ciattarelli in 2021. The New Jersey Republican was a Trump critic and historically more centrist. This year, however, Ciattarelli coalesced the MAGA vote and earned himself a Trump endorsement.\n\nThe president amped up his support of Ciattarelli in the final weeks of the campaign by holding telerallies for the GOP candidate. Close Trump allies also threw millions of dollars into a pro-Ciattarelli super PAC to help bolster his campaign.\n\nCiattarelli praised the reception he has gotten from Latino voters as “overwhelmingly positive” across the state — a voting bloc that makes up nearly 22% of New Jersey’s population. The minority group historically has supported Democrats, but they shifted significantly to Trump last year.\n\nTrump only lost New Jersey to then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 6 points. Kenny Gonzalez, a Hispanic spokesperson for the New Jersey Republican State Committee, told CNN that the margin was aided by a sizable shift in minority support.\n\n“President Trump could not have done as well as he did without getting Democrat Hispanics to vote for him, and Jack Ciattarelli is not going to win this election without getting Democrat Hispanics to vote for him,” Gonzalez said. “So many Democrats are leaving the Democrat Party simply because the Democrat Party has gone too far left.”\n\nA Fox News poll conducted earlier in October found that a slim majority, 53%, of Hispanic registered voters would cast a ballot for Sherrill. With margins of error, Ciattarelli could see an opportunity to pick up centrist or Democratic-leaning minority voters in the days leading up to Tuesday’s election.\n\n“We only have ‘21 to compare it to,” Ciattarelli said. “I really thought I was going to win that race. You know how close we came, and this one feels very different. Energy up and down the state is electric.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sherrill is holding a rally with Barack Obama on Saturday evening. The former president has made New Jersey a fresh test of his endorsement power as Democrats seek to keep the GOP from gaining a foothold in the Garden State. Sherrill also recently held events with former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and several congressional Democrats who are stumping for her in the bellwether race.\n\nBut Ciattarelli is not fazed.\n\n“This is what I refer to the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of the day, I really believe, especially in New Jersey, the candidate has to win the race,” Ciattarelli said, adding that a good candidate has to get out, shake people’s hands, and talk to them every day.\n\n“I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n\n2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK\n\nTrump supporters throw weight behind Ciattarelli\n\nCiattarelli’s supporters who met him in Bridgewater are no strangers to high-energy situations. A group of them are frequent regulars at “Trump’s Corner,” a spot in Bedminster, New Jersey, at the corner of Lambington Road and I-206.\n\nThere, they wear their Trump and American flag T-shirts, wave flags supporting the president, and try to provide a sense of community for conservatives in the area.\n\nDebbie Allen, 61, who is a member of Trump’s Corner, said it was important for her to come out to Bridgewater Municipal Court because “I love my country.”\n\nShe said she admires that Ciattarelli is “born and bred” in New Jersey. Though Sherrill has a long-standing political career in New Jersey, she was born in Virginia — a fact that put off Allen.\n\n“That proves a lot, [Ciattarelli] knows our state, and that’s important, because I’m a Jersey girl,” Allen said.\n\nShe has four grown children and a grandson, and though they do not live in New Jersey, the election for her is critical because “it’s the future for them.”\n\nFor Donna Whitehead, also a Trump’s Corner member, the election for her is a lesser of two evils.\n\n“My main thing, to be perfectly honest, is it’s kind of like when Trump was running against Hillary [Clinton],” Whitehead said. “I didn’t even like Trump, but I liked Hillary even less, so I only voted for Trump because I hated Hillary. And that’s what this is now. I absolutely don’t like [Sherrill], so that’s why I’m voting for [Ciattarelli].”\n\n“So [Ciattarelli] better freaking perform,” Whitehead added, noting that “all of my eggs are in this basket. “If he don’t, he’s gonna have his feet in the fire, that’s all I got to say.”\n\nDawn Douglas, a community supporter and traditional Republican voter, said taxes are her top concern, and she thinks Ciattarelli’s personality is more approachable than Sherrill’s.\n\n“Jack’s a very people person,” Douglas said. “His personality and working with the people, I think, would be a better fit [for governor]. More personal. … I don’t see that with her.”\n\nRon Cerenzio, of Bridgewater, said he is a “fiscal conservative” who has voted both Democratic and Republican over the years. But lately, he has aligned more with the GOP — particularly as he has seen the cost of living in New Jersey grow with no real change from the Murphy administration, in his opinion.\n\n“I have the perspective of a newly retired person, I know how hard it’s been for retired people and why people leave the state,” because the cost of living is too high, he said. “It’s challenging to live in this state under the current economic status.”\n\nCiattarelli, he said, is the best choice because he has “got a detailed plan as to what he’s going to do to fix it.”\n\n“Mikie, they throw questions at her and she gives these, like, generic responses,” Cerenzio said. “But she doesn’t articulate a specific plan. You talk to Jack about energy, he’s got specific details, and if you talk to him about property taxes, he has specific details. I don’t get any of that from her.”\n\nBoth Whitehead and Terry Beck, who helped lead efforts on the recall campaign for Murphy in 2020 and is the founder and organizer of Trump’s Corner since 2018, said they liked Ciattarelli because of his similarities to Trump.\n\n“They’re both sincere,” Beck said. “When you assess people, you can tell the realness of a person and the fairness.”\n\n2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK\n\nLeaving to cheers and praise of him being a community-first candidate, Ciattarelli had a message for voters.\n\n“Don’t wait til Tuesday,” Ciattarelli said. “Anything can happen. Family emergency, not feeling well, something at work. Get out there and vote. This is really convenient and secure.”","summary":"BRIDGEWATER TOWNSHIP, New Jersey — Despite the blustering winds, overcast sky, and leaves leaping into people’s faces, energy outside the Bridgewater Municipal Court in New Jersey was high as supporters waited eagerly for Republican Jack Ciattarelli to arrive on Friday ahead of the state’s competitive gubernatorial election.

This is what I know: KENNEDY","text":"Did someone order a dumpster? Because they're throwing out the trash at the Tiffany Network.\n\nNew Media baddie Bari Weiss – recently named CBS News editor-in-chief – seems to be taking her mandate to bring balance to the Lefty newsroom (and their bottom line) extremely seriously. And that may mean presenting some pricey scalps to her new boss, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison.\n\nCBS Mornings anchor Gayle King has reportedly been dethroned and she's expected to be roused from her AM roost as soon as next year.\n\nAccording to King, it's all a bunch of hooey, saying on Friday that she has 'no idea' if she'll be booted come 2026. Then CBS News said, 'there have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.'\n\nAs far as denials go, that one's about as weak as Joe Biden's golf game.\n\nAfter all, King's compadre CBS Evening News anchor Nora O'Donnell was recently toppled. O'Blabbel received an Oprah Winfrey-narrated highlight reel as a sendoff on her final broadcast in January. I wonder what Gayle – Oprah's life-long (platonic) partner – would get?\n\nIt would make sense to me that King's massive salary (reportedly north of $10 million) and lackluster ratings aren't cutting it with Queen Weiss. \n\nGayle's news squad has been getting shellacked by ABC's Good Morning America and NBC's Today Show and 'making the podium' isn't quite as impressive when you're in third place… out of three.\n\nI met Gayle King once. She carries herself with the royal air of a politician or a moneyed Scientologist. She has the megawatt smile and thousand-yard stare of someone who has perfected the art of seeming genuine even when they see right past you. \n\nIt's impressive to behold, but there's an emptiness about her that viewers seem to have gravitated away from.\n\nOf course, that wasn't the experience of my Fox News' colleague Jesse Watters. He and Gayle made mile-high headlines when they sat next to each other on a recent flight and posted about their pairing on social media.\n\nWatters tells me he was positively giddy, almost smitten, over his time with Ms. King. But Gayle's liberal followers were absolutely disgusted that she didn't shiv him with her first-class butter knife.\n\nPerhaps Gayle was reading the writing on the wall. (You've got to be savvy to last in Oprah's orbit for so long… just ask Meghan Markle.)\n\nCould it be that Gayle was trying to cozy up to a conservative celebrity like Jesse, hoping a bit of the star dust sprinkled on her? \n\nWho could blame her for trying?\n\nWeiss (former New York Times dissenter and founder of the Free Press) has her sights fixed on CBS's big egos and diminishing returns.\n\nThis week, newsy nepo baby and CBS veteran John Dickerson escorted himself out the building, announcing he'll resign at year's end. His mom Nancy was CBS' first female correspondent. But he met the estrogen-drenched buzzsaw of another lady pioneer when Ms. Weiss took over.\n\nAnother one who should be looking over his shoulder is 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. He put a target on his own back when he delivered a tantrum/sermon at the Wake Forest commencement in May, chucking a few thinly veiled grenades at President Donald Trump and wailing about 'truth seekers' being made to 'live in fear.'\n\nNow, he's reportedly got something to really be scared of: a pink slip.\n\nPelley's 60 Minutes colleague Bill Whitaker is also said to be out of favor with the new regime. His botched, softball interview with Kamala Harris resulted in a $16 million payout to the Trump Presidential Library.\n\nSo, is Gayle really headed for the garbage heap? Only time will tell. And I wouldn't put it past Winfrey's bestie to have a few tricks up her stockings. But if you see her 'accidentally' sitting next to Sean Hannity on his next flight, you'll know something is up.\n\nNo matter what happens, one thing is certain: Weiss is right to demand objectivity at CBS, to stop that newsroom from operating like a political action committee and to return the network to good old fashioned storytelling.\n\nMirror, mirror\n\nShe's rich, famous, insufferably woke and blessed with glossy tumbles of long dark hair.\n\nNo wonder permanently smug, unemployed soy boy Justin Trudeau said that he thinks Katy Perry is 'perfect.'\n\nShe has all the qualities that he values most: his own!\n\nOfficer Undies\n\nA Detroit cop is going viral after appearing for a virtual court hearing in police officer's shirt and underwear\n\nWhen the judge asked, 'You got some pants on, officer?' the red-faced arrester replied, 'No sir' before adjusting his camera away from his Motor City man parts.\n\nSomewhere Jeffrey Toobin is saying: 'See, it happens to everyone.'\n\nOne small step…\n\nNoted astrophysicist Kim Kardashian thinks the moon landing was faked.\n\nShe cited debunked conspiracy theories like the bogus claim that moonwalking American hero Buzz Aldrin's once said, 'It didn't happen.'\n\nHey Kim, why not have a rover land on your booty?\n\nSome say that's fake too.\n\nGoodnight Zohran\n\nOn a podcast this week, NYC mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani couldn't identify Billy Joel as the artist who sang 'New York State of Mind.'\n\nNewsflash, Zohran: The Piano Man has sold out Madison Square Garden 150 times!\n\nIf Mamdani is elected, then I'm… Movin' Out.\n\nDouble trouble\n\nA braless Sydney Sweeney showed off her twin talents at Variety's Power of Women Award show in LA this week.\n\nI'm talking about her beauty and style, of course.\n\nIf only folks could focus on them.\n\nMusician Billie Eilish railed against billionaires while accepting an award at the _WSJ Magazine _Innovator Awards on Wednesday.\n\n'Love you all, but there's a few people in here that have a lot more money than me,' Eilish told the crowd which included Mark Zuckerberg and George Lucas. 'If you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but yeah, give your money away, shorties.'\n\nBillie – you're worth an estimated $50 million.\n\nYou don't need all that money, do you?\n\nMeghan and Harry were loudly booed at Dodger Stadium as they took in a World Series game on Tuesday night.\n\nWhen the 'Kiss Cam' caught the pair, the crowd seemed to say, 'Kiss my ***.'\n\nThe pair was sitting in front_ _of two legends of Los Angeles sports: Magic Johnson and Sandy Koufax.\n\nThose dudes are true royalty.\n\nReady to rumble\n\nCongressional rodeo clown Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to be a guest on The View next week.\n\nIf you thought that Maury Povich's paternity test reveals made for good daytime TV… this one might be for you.\n\nFor once, Whoopi might seem like the sane one.","summary":"I met Gayle once.

Four contests, in particular, are in the spotlight: the New York City mayoral race, the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, and California’s Proposition 50. NYC Mayoral Race Arguably the most watched of the four, the New York City mayoral election has captivated voters across the nation. Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani stunned the political establishment by defeating Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, campaigning on affordability and lowering the cost of living. Cuomo, despite his loss and hampered sexual misconduct scandals from his time as governor, entered the general election as an independent. He has since won the backing of incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and several influential Democrats, including Rep. Tom Suozzi. Meanwhile, Gov. Kathy Hochul, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Sen. Bernie Sanders have endorsed Mamdani, who holds a commanding lead in polls and is widely expected to win on Election Day. Virginia In Virginia, Democrats are looking to reclaim the governor’s mansion, pinning their hopes on Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who faces incumbent Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Polls show Spanberger maintaining a steady lead over Earle-Sears. The Attorney General race is also drawing attention. Incumbent Republican Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been dogged by controversy after 2022 texts resurfaced in which he fantasized about shooting then–House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones has apologized for what he called a “grave mistake,” but the scandal has clouded his campaign. Analysts expect Democrats to regain control of the governor’s office, lieutenant governorship, and legislature, while Miyares is narrowly favored to hold on to his post. New Jersey New Jersey, which has leaned Republican in recent elections, including the 2024 presidential and 2021 governor’s race, is again a battleground. Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has President Donald Trump’s endorsement. The race remains tight: an Emerson College poll puts Sherrill at 49% and Ciattarelli at 48% among likely voters. The contest is considered a toss-up, with Democrats slightly favored. California Prop 50 While other races remain close, California’s Proposition 50 appears headed for a decisive outcome. The measure, championed by Democrats, seeks to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional map in response to Texas’ recent redistricting, which added five Republican-leaning seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Because California’s constitution requires voter approval for changes to its independent redistricting commission, the proposal, which will give Democrats an advantage in 5 seats, must pass at the ballot box. Polls suggest it will, by a wide margin. Governor Gavin Newsom, joined by Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, has campaigned heavily for Proposition 50. Reports indicate Republicans have largely withdrawn funding from efforts to oppose it, acknowledging an uphill battle.

Life is so much better for these rich Democrats, on so many more accounts than just economically. They’re less likely to die from shootings or opioid overdoses, and their life expectancy is longer than those living in other parts of the country. But this all comes at the expense of the actual working poor, who are now by and large Republicans — while the elitist rich enclaves in the United States have switched from Republican to Democrat.\n\nThe report, titled Class Dismissed II: The Secession of the Successful, was compiled by GOP lobbying and public affairs firm CGCN. CGCN, which has partnered with Breitbart News on major events this year featuring key members of the president’s cabinet and team including several upcoming events in November, provided the report exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release. In it, the firm analyzes data that captures and proves the political realignment seen in the coalition that President Donald Trump assembled to win the White House and then again to later win it back. The CGCN authors point to a phenomenon that former Labor Secretary Robert Reich — who led the Department of Labor under Democrat President Bill Clinton in the 1990s — first identified back then that Reich called “the secession of the successful” from the rest of society.\n\n“It’s not every day that you find us agreeing with President Clinton’s former Labor Secretary, Robert Reich. But back in the 1990s, Reich captured an emerging social phenomenon, which he called ‘the secession of the successful,’” the CGCN authors wrote. “By that he meant the nation’s elite removing themselves from everyday people and their concerns.” This Class Dismissed installment is an update on CGCN’s earlier such report released back in late 2023 and also exclusively reported on by Breitbart News.\n\n“Our latest review of census data, updated from our previous memo, ‘Class Dismissed I,’ confirms that Reich’s assessment is now hard fact, but maybe not in the way he envisioned it,” the CGCN authors wrote in this latest report. “The ‘successful’ class — defined not just by income, but by education, geography, and cultural homogeneity — is seceding in large part to the Democratic Party and away from Republicans. By ‘secession,’ we (and Reich) mean moving into a hermetically sealed, elite cultural bubble, set apart from the working class and poorer populations, which are increasingly afflicted by the nation’s most crushing social pathologies. According to the latest data, uncovered by CGCN researchers, those most beset by social and economic maladies — with some exceptions — are far more prevalent in Republican, rather than Democratic, districts.”\n\nThis latest report is one of many recent such pieces of expert literature seeking to explain what went wrong for Democrats last year, and just how wayward the Democrats remain as a party. Another recent report, first unearthed by Dave Weigel of Semafor, was put together by top Democrats and warned their own party they are set to continue losing and becoming more and more geographically limited if they do not drop the extremism that has come with the Democrats’ isolation into rich elitism. There have been countless others, too, but this latest one from Republican consultants at CGCN fills in the blanks with new data showing how Democrats have become wealthier and more elitist.\n\nThe new CGCN report continues by arguing that this is a “party realignment decades in the making,” and that the two parties look much different than they did even a decade earlier.\n\n“The GOP is no longer dominated by Izod-wearing denizens of the Shaker Heights Country Club, and the Democrats are no longer the party of working-class locals in Youngstown’s Royal Oaks Bar and Grill,” the CGCN authors wrote, pointing specifically to the curious case of former Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who spent his entire decades-long career as an elected Democrat portraying himself as a working-class champion only to get absolutely smoked by now-Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) at the ballot box last year. Now, Brown is trying to run again, this time against newly-appointed GOP Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH) — who was picked to fill the spot vacated by now Vice President JD Vance — but is seriously failing to gain traction with the very working-class voters with whom he used to connect. The authors point to what they say are “earth shattering” changes in endorsements, where labor unions across Ohio are now backing Husted instead of Brown’s flailing comeback bid.\n\n“In short, anyone familiar with his decades-long career would know that unionism is in Brown’s DNA,” the CGCN authors wrote. “But in a sign of the times, his opponent, incumbent Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH), just inked substantial endorsements from Ohio’s industrial labor unions, including the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 18 and 66, ‘giving the incumbent support from affiliated unions in all of Ohio’s 88 counties,’ according to Axios. On top of this, in September, the Northwest Ohio Building Trades Council flipped its support from Brown to Husted. This is, in short, earth shattering.”\n\nThe report then quotes a local labor leader explaining why the unions are endorsing the Republican Husted over the Democrat Brown.\n\n“The Mahoning Valley is the backbone of Ohio’s working class,” Jesse DiRenna, business manager for IUOE Local 66, said. “Sen. Jon Husted leads with action not just photo ops. His values align with ours, which is why we support him.”\n\nThe next two pages of the 13-page report have some of the most interesting data unearthed by the CGCN analysts, particularly the economic conditions in Democrat versus Republican strongholds in this era versus previous eras. First off, the report analyzes the share of annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the areas that voted for Trump the last three presidential elections versus the areas that voted for Democrat presidential nominees Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris.\n\n“Consider that Democrats, in fact, represent far wealthier districts and constituents than the GOP,” the report reads. “For example, over the last three presidential election cycles, Democratic candidates won counties with a higher share of aggregate GDP than Donald Trump.”\n\nAstoundingly, just during Trump’s time atop the Republican Party the past decade, this existing trend has grown far more profound. In 2016, the counties that Trump won nationwide amounted to 36 percent of aggregate GDP and the counties that Clinton won represented 64 percent of aggregate GDP. During the 2020 election, Trump’s counties represented 29 percent of aggregate GDP while Biden’s represented 71 percent. In 2024, Trump counties represented 37 percent of aggregate GDP while Harris-won counties represented 63 percent of aggregate GDP.\n\nIt’s even harder core when looking at the wealth among congressional districts and which parties hold seats in the richest parts of America. In fact, the report citing U.S. Census data found that Democrats currently hold more than three quarters — more than 76 percent — of the top 30 wealthiest congressional districts in America.\n\n“According to U.S. Census data, America’s wealthiest districts are overwhelmingly represented by Democrats,” the report reads. “Of the 30 richest congressional districts, only 7 are represented by Republicans, while 23 are represented by Democrats. By contrast, representation among the 30 poorest districts is more evenly split — Democrats represent 18, and Republicans represent 12.”\n\nMany of the most powerful Democrats, like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Ro Khanna (D-CA), and Jerry Nadler (D-NY) represent some of the “wealthiest districts” in the nation, and these names are also “some of the most familiar on cable news.”\n\n“The political and moral burden of representing poor and forgotten Americas now lies with the GOP,” the report continues. “Moreover, the stark divide between the everyday experience of one living in a poor congressional district as compared to a wealthy one explains in good measure why the two parties speak different languages.”\n\nLooking at the income data in the 30 wealthiest districts — again, now mostly Democrats — versus the 30 poorest districts, which are much more evenly split, the difference is profound. The median income in the richest districts per the CGCN report is $133,071, more than double the poorest district median income, which is $52,318. Unemployment is significantly worse in the poorer districts too, at 5.89 percent on average versus just 3.93 percent on average in the wealthy districts that Democrats dominate.\n\nBeyond the economic numbers, several social statistics also demonstrate a much higher quality of life for the very rich Democrats in America.\n\n“Opioid deaths are far more common in the poorest areas,” the CGCN report reads. “There are 19.6233 opioid deaths per 100,000 in the wealthiest districts. This number is even higher in the poorest districts. It jumps to 32.466 opioid deaths per 100,000 in the poorest districts. Firearm homicides are also far more common in the poorest districts. There are 13.39 firearm homicides per 100,000 people in the poorest districts. This number is 3.2 per 100,000 for the wealthiest districts. The poorest districts are trailing in high school completion. The average for the top 30 wealthiest districts is 92.93% with the number dropping to 84.66% for the poorest districts. The poorest districts have a lower life expectancy by about five years. The average life expectancy for the top 30 wealthiest districts is 81.333 years. For the poorest districts it falls to 75.82.”\n\nWhat’s more, Democrats in the House and Senate have become more elitist — and Republicans in both chambers less so — over the last several decades when it comes to education levels.\n\n“In the 93rd Congress (1973-75), 55% of Senate Republicans went to elite universities. In the 117th Congress (2021-2023), that number declined to 34%,” the report reads on a later page. “House Republicans educated from elite universities plummeted from 40% in the 93rd Congress to just 15% in the 117th. In the 117th Congress, over 50% of Democratic Senators had degrees from elite institutions. House Democrats who graduated from Harvard rose from 9% (93rd Congress) to 15% (117th Congress). Democratic senators from Yale University rose from 5% (93rd Congress) to 6% (117th Congress).”\n\nInterestingly, too, the report also found that the vast majority of members of the establishment media are rich, elitist, and white — meaning they have an inherent bias that misses the concerns of working-class Americans, who again are more and more becoming Republicans.\n\n“And whether consciously or not, most reporters strain to understand worlds completely foreign to them,” the CGCN report reads. “Here we mean rural areas and low-income neighborhoods, marred by crime, opioid deaths, and chronic unemployment, with populations who are religious, without college degrees, and overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. Hence, it’s not difficult to see the result: media bias. As conventionally understood, such bias also stems from a well-documented fact — reporters identify far more as Democrats than Republicans. A 2022 study by Syracuse University’s Newhouse School found that 36.3% of journalists identified as Democrats, while only 3.4% identified as Republicans. But in a similar context, the lack of newsroom diversity can also bias coverage.”","summary":"A new in-depth analysis demonstrates how the Democrat party has become the party of the rich and the elite, a remarkable political realignment in recent years that has Democrats in Congress now representing more than 75 percent of the wealthiest congressional districts in the country.\n\n\nThe post Exclusive &#8212; Realignment: In-Depth Analysis Reveals How Democrats Have Become the Party of the Rich, Elites appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/31/exclusive-realignment-in-depth-analysis-reveals-how-democrats-have-become-the-party-of-the-rich-elites/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/GettyImages2167846694-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 20:16:36","author":"Matthew Boyle","authors":["Matthew Boyle"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":374571712,"title":"Harris Says Biden ‘Greatly Disappointed’ Her, Weighs Future Run in Podcast","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she was “greatly disappointed” and “angered” by former President Joe Biden at points during the 2024 campaign and has not decided whether she will run again in an interview released Oct. 30 on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast.\n\nThe interview, which tracked themes in her recently released memoir, “107 Days,” touched on Harris’s relationship with Biden and the behind-the-scenes dynamics.

Crockett’s potential candidacy would shake up the Democratic primary, where several prominent lawmakers are already vying for the nomination.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nCrockett, first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2022, has garnered national attention for her opposition to President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Former Vice President Kamala Harris named her as a Democrat who is “authentic” when discussing future leadership of the party.\n\nShe told Politico’s Dasha Burns this week that she is mulling a potential Senate bid.\n\nRepresentative Jasmine Crockett speaks during a press conference in Washington, D.C. on March 20, 2024.\n\n“I am seriously weighing it to the extent that I am about to spend a lot of money to get data,” she said. “I’m a data-driven person. I will tell you that I personally believe that Texas needs to do something different if they want a different result. That’s just the bottom line.”\n\nCrockett said she has had “multiple” conversations with a potential campaign director and is weighing who will be the Republican nominee. She does not believe any Democrat could defeat incumbent GOP Senator John Cornyn.\n\nIf she runs, she would face off against state legislator James Talarico and former U.S. Representative Colin Allred, the Democrats’ 2024 Senate nominee, in the primary. Representative Joaquin Castro and former Representative Beto O’Rourke have also been floated as potential candidates, though neither has jumped into the race yet.\n\nCrockett led the most recent poll of the Texas Democratic primary race, which found her with 31 percent. Talarico and O’Rourke followed with 25 percent each, while 13 percent said they would vote for Allred. Six percent were unsure of who they would support.\n\nIn the general election polling, Crockett trailed Republican candidates.\n\nCornyn led Crockett by 6 percentage points (50 percent to 44 percent), while Attorney General Ken Paxton held a 2-point lead against her (49 percent to 47 percent). Representative Wesley Hunt led Crockett by 5 points (50 percent to 45 percent).\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,650 respondents from September 19 to October 1, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.41 percentage points.\n\nO’Rourke held a lead over Crockett in a University of Texas at Tyler poll. Thirty-one percent said they’d vote for the former Congressman, while 29 percent said they would cast their ballots for Crockett. Allred had 25 percent support, while Castro had 13 percent.\n\nIt surveyed 1,032 registered voters from September 17 to September 24 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nA Texas Public Opinion Research poll showed similar results. In that poll, 27 percent of respondents said they’d back O’Rourke, while 26 percent said they’d vote for Crockett.\n\nAllred, Talarico and Castro followed at 13 percent, 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nThe poll surveyed 843 registered voters from August 27 to August 29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.\n\nKalshi’s betting market gives Talarico the best chance of winning the party’s nomination at 50 percent. It gives Crockett a 25 percent and Allred a 22 percent chance of winning the primary.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nCrockett told Politico’s Dasha Burns: “By the time we start spending money, I think it’s less about people learning, ‘Oh there’s a Jasmine Crockett. Who is she?’ And it’s more about, ‘Do we like her enough to go out and knock doors, to make phone calls, to send text messages, to tell our neighbors, to get people riled up?’”\n\nMark Jones, fellow in political science at the Baker Institute and political science professor at Rice University, told Newsweek earlier in October: “Both in rhetoric and actions, Crockett and O’Rourke are seen as really fighting against the Trump administration and Republicans more generally. That’s something that endears them to Democratic primary voters, who don’t really want to see a pragmatist.”","summary":"Crockett said she is &quot;seriously&quot; weighing whether to run in the Texas Senate race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jasmine-crocketts-chances-flipping-gop-senate-seat-texas-polls-10973283","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2099489255.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 20:01:45","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":374573674,"title":"Karl Rove: Jasmine Crockett is ‘kidding herself’ if she thinks she’ll win the Senate","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nAmerica Reports October 31, 2025 04:31 \n\n Karl Rove: Jasmine Crockett is ‘kidding herself’ if she thinks she’ll win the Senate \n Fox News contributor Karl Rove weighs in on the latest moves from top Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep.

The exit comes just days after Platner’s campaign manager, Kevin Brown stepped down after less than a week on the job, and two weeks since the campaign’s political director, Genevieve McDonald, left. (RELATED: Democratic Maine Senate Candidate Graham Platner’s New Campaign Manager Lasts Less Than A Week) \n\n“I joined this campaign because I believed in building something different — a campaign of fresh energy, integrity, and reform-minded thinking in a political system that often resists exactly those things. Somewhere along the way, I began to feel that my professional standards as a campaign professional no longer fully aligned with those of the campaign,” Holmes wrote. “I wish the campaign and the voters in Maine well as they continue forward with selecting a nominee who they believe is best suited to meet the moment and flip this critical must win seat for us to take back the U.S. Senate in 2026.”\n\nHolmes previously worked as the deputy campaign manager and finance director for Democratic New York Rep. Josh Riley‘s successful 2024 campaign as well as the national finance director for 2026 Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Swanson, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nA spokesperson for Platner’s campaign told Politico the team will continue to focus on fundraising efforts. The campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\n“Ron helped the campaign reach out to big dollar donors, and we appreciated his efforts. But the reality is our campaign’s fundraising success has come largely from small dollar donors,” the spokesperson said. “Nearly 90 percent of what we’ve raised has come from small dollar donations and online donors which has been and [continues] to be run by our digital fundraising director.”\n\nPlatner’s campaign saw over $3.2 million in donations within its first six weeks, likely boosted by his high-profile endorsement from Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in August. However, the left-wing candidate’s hot streak came to a halt in October when old Reddit posts made by the oyster farmer and Marine veteran were unearthed.\n\nPlatner, in his posts, appeared to downplay sexual assault in the military, self-identified as a communist, encouraged political violence as a tool for social change and made offensive comments toward black people. McDonald had resigned from the campaign claiming she could not look past the Senate candidate’s past comments. Platner apologized for the posts, claiming he wrote them at a time when he was “struggling deeply.”\n\nThe candidate’s controversies continued when an old video of Platner surfaced, revealing a chest tattoo that appeared to be connected to Nazi symbolism. Platner has denied the tattoo was related to Nazism and has since covered it with a new design, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSanders continued to stand by Platner throughout the chaos, telling reporters Tuesday that he still sees the oyster farmer as “an excellent candidate” and is looking forward to him “becoming the next senator from Maine.”\n\nPlatner is running in Maine’s Democratic Senate primary against term-limited Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills, the party establishment favorite. The winner of the Democratic primary will likely face incumbent Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who has held the seat since 1997. Collins is the only Republican senator to currently represent a state former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in 2024.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

There's also reportedly talk she could potentially produce her own programming for the network.Bari Weiss Cleans HouseFormer New York Times opinion writer Weiss, 41, was brought in by Donald Trump supporter and new Chairman and CEO of Paramount, David Ellison, to jolt the network news division out of its left-leaning reporting.\n\nShe's now charged with \"aggressively\" getting rid of the \"woke\" mainstays in favor of bringing balance back to the ratings-challenged shows that chased away moderate and Republican viewers.\n\n\"We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home,\" Ellison stated in her October 6 hiring announcement, calling The Free Press founder a \"proven champion of independent, principled journalism.\"\n\nWeiss reportedly called a meeting of the 60 Minutes staff shortly after her hiring and bluntly asked, \"Why does the country think you’re biased?\" leaving the room in stunned silence.\n\nIn August, CBS and Paramount agreed to pay Trump, 79, a whopping $16million to settle a lawsuit in which the president claimed \"deceptive conduct\" by the longtime news magazine, alleging it edited an interview with his 2024 campaign opponent, Kamala Harris, to make her responses seem more intelligible.John Dickerson's DepartureIf she is out of a job, King won't be alone on the CBS unemployment line. CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson announced on Monday, October 27, that he would be stepping down as well at the end of the year.\n\nThe 57-year-old stunned fans when he announced he would be leaving the Tiffany network after 16 years, giving not-so-subtle hints about where his political allegiances stood.\n\n\"I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me – the work, the audience’s attention, and the honor of being a part of the network’s history – and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who’ve made me a better journalist and a better human. I will miss you,\" the anchor wrote in an Instagram announcement.\n\nBut Hollywood Insider Rob Shuter wrote in his Substack the decision may not have been Dickerson's to make.\n\n\"Let’s be clear – he didn’t quit, he was pushed,\" dished one senior network insider. \"Bari is making it impossible for the old guard to stay.

In our conversation, which was recorded for The New Yorker Radio Hour, Stewart was clear about his intentions at Paramount. In fact, we began by showing a clip from the show he did in reaction to Kimmel’s suspension: Stewart appeared dressed in a black suit and Trumpian red tie on a Trumpian gilt set. And, feigning DEFCON 1 alarm, he played the role of a nerve-wracked TV news anchor under totalitarian rule. He was a pool of anxiety and flop sweat. The crowd at Webster Hall laughed hard at this show of comic cowardice, but the sense of alarm was there, too. The conversation that followed has been edited for length and clarity. The one or two obscene jokes that have been excised can be seen in the video version. They didn’t quite work on the page, and we thought that Stewart, who is fastidious about his comedy, would appreciate the edit.\nI want to begin with what happened not long ago when Jimmy Kimmel was tossed off the air. You had to come up with a response to something very serious. And, by the way, you weren’t alone: Stephen Colbert also responded, John Oliver as well. Was there any sense of coördination or conversation?\nNo, I don’t even have their numbers. [Laughter.]\nNo, we do have a text chain. Look, we all understand that none of us are owed a platform. But we also understand that it’s a meaningful luxury, and that there is a certain amount of strength in a society that is able to withstand the smallest of ridicule. When that goes away, when the leadership becomes, you know . . . I have a friend who did a show very similar to mine in Egypt, and he was exiled.\nIn America, we sort of assumed that satire was settled law. To find out that it, along with Dobbs, was going to be revisited—what we considered stare decisis—I think it rattled everyone to some extent, but it also presented a great opportunity. And so I don’t know that we’ve had as much fun as we did that Thursday morning coming up with all the stupid little shit that you see there—including gold pictures and red ties. It gave us some purpose.\nThat being said, I want to be clear. The victims of this Administration are not the comedians. We are a visible manifestation of certain things, but the victims are the victims—they’re the people who are struggling to have any voice and are being forcibly removed from streets by hooded agents. Those are the victims of this Administration.\nI’m not sure Hitler cared about satirists, but I think this guy does. I don’t think he likes being made fun of.\nTrump doesn’t like being made fun of?\n\nI’m going to tell you something, and I’m going to go out on a limb here: I’m starting to sour on this Presidency. [Laughter.]\n\nYou know me, I was all in, ten toes in, man.\nYou say that this is not the issue. But I remember when Vladimir Putin came to power, in 2000. The first thing he did was take a satirical program about politics called “Kukly,” “Puppets,” off the air. And people said, “Oh, he took the puppets off the air.” Within a couple of weeks, the uncensored news was off the air.\n\nIsn’t it possible that this political assault, however herky-jerky and back and forth it might be, is tantamount to something else?\nSure. Are we comedians, as I’ve said earlier, like a banana peel in a coal mine? I think that’s possible. And it can certainly go there.\nI will say, when seven million people show up in America on a weekend for anything—I mean, honestly, anything—you know something’s going on. And they are attempting to graft, I think, an alien culture onto this country. We’re not Russia and its history of autocracy or dictatorship. This is an alien culture to us and it is uncomfortable, and that discomfort may be our saving grace. I don’t think we’re going to wear that well.\nThat doesn’t mean we’re not going to be in some kind of soft autocracy where news is controlled. But we have a lot of different avenues. And suppression creates opportunity, and a populace that is thirsty for inspiration and leadership and morality and integrity and lack of corruption—that’s fertile ground for that opportunity. So as bad as this is—and it’s fucking bad . . .\nYeah. You know how bad it is? David Ellison—\nThat’s my new boss.\n—just bought Paramount.\n\nNot only does he—forgive me—own your enterprise, but he could also affect it. And he has just hired Bari Weiss to run CBS News. So tell me what this means.\nThis is not happenstance. This began with Richard Viguerie doing a mail-in to try and get people to be conservative. This began with people buying AM-radio stations and converting them to conservative talk radio. This began with Roger Ailes and the Nixon White House going, “We will never allow this to happen to a Republican politician again.”\nAll of the institutions—education, media, news, academia, and all those things that we have relied on as a solid tent post by which to build a decent society—they were, like, Yeah, no. They have built a parallel universe of think tanks, education, and media so that they could at some point flip a switch and move us over onto that track.\nBecause what do these institutions have? They are the reference point for our decisions. What do you do? You quote, “Well, there’s a study done by,” and you use data and the scientific method and other things to try and make as informed a decision as you can. But, if you’re a political movement that believes that investing those institutions with authority is against your cause, the best thing you can do is build organizations that either tear down the credibility of those institutions or you build your own.\nBut, with respect, Jon, this is different. This is markedly different. It’s one thing to have the Brookings Institution that was kind of liberal, and then you have the rise of the American Enterprise Institute. It’s one thing to have a liberal newspaper and then a conservative newspaper. Fine. In fact, all the better, in some ways.\n\nWhat’s going on now is different. And you’re going to face it potentially with Paramount and “The Daily Show.”\n\nWhat do you do?\nYou don’t compromise on what you do, and you do it till they tell you to leave. That’s all you can do. That’s all you can do.\nI think the line that you gave before was “I’m not giving in. I’m not going anywhere—I think.”\nWell, I’m neurotic, still. [Laughter.]\nYour contract comes up in December. Are you going to sign another one?\nI mean, we’re working on staying. Look, the other thing to remember is it’s not as clear-cut as all that. The business—\nIn other words, if it’s up to you, you’re staying?\nOh, yeah, sure.\nHow do you think CBS News will be affected? Does evening news even matter at this point, in the mediasphere that we live in?\nI don’t know. We are projecting things that we do not know. The ecosystem has changed. The monetization of it has changed. It’s a different ethos. But one thing we have to remember, and this is the hardest truth for us to get at, is that the institutions that we spoke about earlier have problems. They do. And if we don’t address those problems in a forthright way then those institutions become vulnerable to this kind of assault. Credibility is not something that was just taken. It was also lost. And that is a part of this equation that has to be considered. And the Democrats have to consider that as well.\nThere’s a reason Donald Trump came to power. And that is that, in the general populist mind, government no longer serves the interests of the people it purports to represent. That’s a broad-based, deep feeling. And when someone comes along and says, “The system is rigged,” people go, “Yeah, it is rigged.” Now, he’s a good diagnostician. I don’t particularly care for his remedy.\nTell me why you think Trump won.\nBecause of the dissatisfaction of an analog system in a digital world. The distance between how you feel about the world and the actual world has never been larger. We are victims of the circadian rhythms of social media. And social media is incentivized to what? Not to connect us! I’ve seen the Facebook commercial. And, yes, it’s true. If you do like a certain kind of cat, there will be other people who like that certain kind of cat, and you will connect with one another.\nBut the purpose of social media is to keep you on its platform. That’s it. That’s all these companies fucking care about. They want you on that platform. They want you on there as long as they can possibly have you. And the way that they have rigged our brains to figure it out is that outrage, and anger, and hate, and hostility are much stronger drivers of engagement than anything else.\nNow, on the flip side of that, we have a political system designed as an analog—what is the Senate? It’s the cooling saucer of democracy. And what’s Twitter? The thing that makes you want to fucking rip people’s eyes out. You put those together and it’s not a good mix. And so [Trump] was able to harness the anger and catastrophizing of that as a way of taking over that other thing that we have.\nAnd you didn’t find Joe Biden and Kamala Harris a good remedy for that?\nI thought they were great. [Laughter.]\nLook what’s going on with Zohran Mamdani. You’ve finally got a guy in New York City who is getting people to vote in the affirmative for his positions, who is inspiring people and giving a certain amount of leadership. And what does the general status quo of the Democratic Party do with that? “The guy is a communist.” Like, the Party goes along with the caricature of this man.\nLook, we’re in a bad situation, but it’s not just the shittiness of Trump. It’s the passivity of the Democratic Party to stick with a status quo that most people felt was not working.\nIn January, about a week after Trump was inaugurated, you did a monologue on “The Daily Show.” It was critical of Trump, but you didn’t go after him so much as you went after a lot of his critics, or at least the more hypocritical and pearl-clutching ones. You seemed to be saying that, instead of crying wolf, calling him a fascist for every executive order was, you know, to his benefit. Do you think you underestimated how bad this would get?\nNo, I stand by it, because in that moment that’s how I felt. And it didn’t need to go in that next direction. It may have stopped there. It may not have overstepped. I think that, ultimately, you can’t judge this moment by that moment, because you don’t know just how far either corporate America will acquiesce or how far Congress will abdicate, or how far the executive.\nWhat I’m saying is the seeds of this destruction were not sown this year. They were sown by Citizens United. They were sown by “corporations are people.” They were sown by a Democratic Party that thinks it’s okay for its Senate to be an assisted-living facility. Like, respectfully, I mean, I could kick the shit out of the Senate.\nI don’t mean this cynically, I mean this idealistically. I mean this as: we’d better get real about this very fast. And it’s coming from a perspective of having worked with our government to try and get certain things done.\nOver the past twenty years, I was stunned by certain Republicans who would tweet out, “Never forget the heroes of 9/11,” versus how they would vote for their medical care. But I was also stunned by the passivity of the Democratic Party’s leadership, and being told over and over again, “No, no, no, you have to go through regular order when we have this congressional hearing. I don’t want you to be confrontational. You have to be nice. And then what we hopefully will get to do is have the first responders and the victims of 9/11 be able to put their health care into the transportation bill. Unless Mitch McConnell thinks he wants to trade that for the import-export tax that he really wants on petroleum.” And I would go, “That’s fucking crazy.” And so this is coming from a place of: I’ve lived with this.\nWell, we’re in the middle of a government shutdown, which shows a different attitude this time than the last time.\nThat’s right.\nDoes that make Chuck Schumer any braver now than he was before?\nNo. What Chuck Schumer has been told is “You’re losing, and people like your glasses to be higher up on your nose.” And so here’s what they’re doing with us now. The strategy is authenticity. Suddenly, people in Congress are cursing.\nI’m over it all, man. I’m over it all. And I understand why people wanted to blow it up, and why it’s so vulnerable to being taken over by a charismatic person who says, “I understand how this is done.”\nLike, even with the shutdown—I’m glad that the Democrats stood up for something, but I still think the Affordable Care Act is playing the Republican and the corporate game. It’s basically just subsidies to insurance companies when what we actually need is health care. And the A.C.A. doesn’t give you health care. It gives you subsidies to get a coupon that maybe you can take to someone who then will give medical care to you, and then there’ll still be a deductible. Forty per cent of people in this country go without basics like food and other things because of their medical debt. And so when the Democrats announce that they got the pharmaceutical companies to allow us, out of the grace of their heart, to negotiate the price on ten different medicines—only ten—and that’s a victory when we’re subsidizing these motherfuckers by billions of dollars a year? No, no more. I’m done with it.\nWe both grew up in New Jersey, but I grew up with another Jersey comedian, Bill Maher. I used to play basketball in a driveway with him.\nYou know, there’s nothing better than playing basketball with short Jews, I have to tell you. [Laughter.]\nBill Maher is the comic political voice of the notion that the biggest problem the Democrats have is wokeism. How do you respond to Bill’s approach to the world?\nWell, I don’t know if that’s just Bill’s.\nIt’s shorthand for it. Is wokeness something that enters your analysis of things?\nNo. I’m not even sure I know what it is. And I would be able to answer it better if I had a clearer determination of the metric. Like, What’s the spectrum? There is a real pressure people feel on issues that they don’t quite understand and where they don’t want to offend, and it can have a censorious effect on discourse. I’ve seen it. And the left certainly has its—like, when someone says to me “pregnant people,” I do go, Well, it’s—I understand, but, like, come on.\nBut it doesn’t make you crazy?\nLike, you’d be better to be, like, “pregnant women and Dave”—you know what I mean? So, yeah, that gets a little out of control. But the idea that this has the same effect on the world as a rich country that isn’t able to give its people health care—that’s where I take exception.\nThe most politically effective advertisement for the Trump campaign was the one about trans people. “She is for them, he is for you.” That was extremely effective—\nBut the answer to that commercial is simple as well. Like, yes, Donald Trump is for you if you are a convicted sex trafficker who should get transferred to a less bad prison because you’re not going to name him. Donald Trump is for you if you have a jet that you will give him. Or Donald Trump is for you if you give billions to his campaign.\nLike, my problem is people on the left don’t know how to fight that effectively. They do not realize the game they’re playing.\nHow do you mean?\nThere is a relentlessness and bad faith to the social-media algorithm. If you go to a restaurant and the food is delicious, it’s probably because they add a little extra butter, or they throw a little salt in there, a little umami in there. Maybe they throw a little sugar in the marinara. You know what I mean? And you eat it and you’re, like, Wow, that’s decadent and beautiful, and I would like to come back here. But it’s still within the realm of what we understand as the earthly tricks we play on one another.\nBut there are guys in lab coats who work for Kraft, who are figuring out how to take the gland of, like, a beaver’s anus and turn it into strawberry flavoring. And then there’s a bunch of other dudes who are checking the consistency of it, and they’re designing it to get past the prehistoric reptilian wiring of your brain so that you no longer understand that two bags of chips and a quart of ice cream might not be good for you in the long run. Social media is that.\nWhat we do is we communicate. And we sometimes use hyperbole, and we sometimes use puns, and satire, and parody to convey something. And it’s cheating a little bit, but social media is ultra-processed speech in the same way that Doritos are food. It’s designed to bypass the parts of your brain that keep you off it, that keep you from diving into those holes, from radicalizing yourself. So that’s what you’re up against. These guys are designing these things in the lab to bypass our ability to collaborate and coöperate.\nWhen did these guys get so bad?\nThey’ve always sucked.\nAh. But wait a minute. We believed, or half believed, that these guys, because they wore jeans and sneakers, and they were kind of cool and said things like “Don’t be evil,” and so on and so forth—\nIsn’t that something someone evil would say? Peter Thiel is always going on about Satan. “Satan, it could be amongst us. It could be Greta Thunberg.” Or it could be a guy who runs a company called Palantir. [Laughter.]\nBut hold on. You’re forgetting the early part of these guys’ careers. Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin were going to make it possible—if you’re sitting in the desert somewhere where you didn’t have access to a library, now you could read Shakespeare on your phone. And this was amazing. Everybody was going to be connected and this would also democratize the press.\nRight. Yes.\nAnd they believed it. And a large part of us believed it.\nNo. They all want to be the next guy. They all just want to be the next Elon Musk. They want to be the next person. Look, we suffer from the same thing in that we’re people. Like, everything that we have that’s great can be weaponized against us. Nuclear power is—you know, as Robert Oppenheimer once famously said, “What could go wrong?”\nJon, you’ve been on Joe Rogan a couple of times?\n\nWhat did you think of that experience?\nI enjoyed being on Rogan. I think he’s an interesting interviewer. You know, there are right-wing weaponized commentators whose sole purpose is to manipulate things to the benefit of the Steve Bannon project or Project 2025. Rogan’s not that guy.\nWhat is that guy? How would you describe him?\nThat guy is a curious comic who fell into this thing that got fucking enormous. He has opinions all over the political spectrum, but has tendencies that, for people on the left, do not fit the aesthetic. He’s a—\nWell, in fairness, he’s had people on who are kind of Nazi-curious. That’s not good.\nI mean, I’ve interviewed Henry Kissinger, and he was carpet-bomb-curious. Like, I don’t know what to say. It’s very easy to castigate those where we’re, like, But he had an opinion a few years back that’s, you know, corrosive.\nBut the difference is when he was carpet-bomb-curious you didn’t say, “Oh, yeah, that’s awesome.” And what happens with Rogan sometimes is that he’ll hear somebody who’s on the dangerous end of the spectrum and he’ll just kind of soak it in.\nAnd I think this is a great point. He will just kind of soak it in. And whoever thinks that that information is dangerous—it’s their job to fight to get their point of view out there to counter what they think is misinformation. It’s not enough to deputize other people to be you. You can’t just deputize people to say he should have known better and he should have prosecuted that point.\nBut the reality is, Jon, that it might be my job, or the New York Times’ job, or even your job, but I don’t have the audience that Joe Rogan does.\nThen get it. Then go on that show. Then do those things. Like, it’s not acceptable to just say, “Well, I don’t like what he does.” Then do it better, beat them at their own game. We have to be relentless, tenacious. It’s not enough to just complain that that guy has a platform and “Don’t platform that guy.” There’s no one in this world right now that isn’t platformed.\nAnd my biggest frustration, honestly, with a lot of scientists is that they all go, “R.F.K., he’s so fucked up. That’s terrible information.” Oh, O.K. What’s the information? Nothing. Where are they? Get out there. Fight.\nI got in a little trouble—I was giving an interview to a German magazine. I said, “I would interview Hitler.” And I thought that was kind of noncontroversial. Is there anybody whom you wouldn’t interview?\nI think it depends in part on what the expectation is for the interview. Because, remember, we’re falling into that trap—that a good interview will solve the problem. We think if we could just have a good interview, maybe this misinformation would stop.\nI’ve been on the side of the good interview. I’ve been on the side of the bad—I interviewed Donald Rumsfeld. I lost more sleep over that interview than he did over the entire fucking war. And you know what he did afterward? He wrote me a note saying, “That was fun.”\nJon, what did you think of the business of comedians going to Riyadh and being paid a lot of money?\nI don’t touch other people’s money, and, you know. . . . It’s hard, man. I want to fix my house. I want to operate with integrity, but I don’t want to gatekeep. Like, I don’t go to the tree of hilarity and get visited by the fathers of—and I think a lot of comics who came out and really shit on those guys, like, I know a couple of them, and I know them actually to be, like, garbage humans.\nI would have preferred if they would have just come out and said, “It’s money,” and not, like, “It’s a way to start a conversation.” Like, would you have started the conversation for twenty-five hundred dollars? Well, then that’s the difference.\nBut I think back on my career and I’ve, you know, I’ve done certain gigs that don’t reach the level of—\nWhat did you do? Go to Turkmenistan and sing at a wedding?\nLook, I worked for Apple. There are a lot of people who believe that Apple is exploitative in a way that’s horrific. We all have our lines that we are willing to cross. Like, none of us are Diogenes. We get into a problem when we’re unforgiving in any way, we offer no grace. And that doesn’t mean that I don’t have lines that I draw. But I do try to not be so rigid—\nDo you know where the lines are ahead of time?\n\nBecause, I mean, as we said at the start of the conversation, you’re facing a complicated situation at Paramount.\n\nAnd you know what you won’t do. But if you see something else happening in the company—do you know where those lines are? Like with the news?\nYeah, that’s a great point. They’ve already done things that I’m upset about. But then, if I had integrity, maybe I would stand up and go, “I’m out.” Or maybe the integrity thing to do would be to stay in it and keep fighting in the foxhole.\nLike, I love a good argument. I love differing points of view in all facets of things, but I also love grace. I’ve got people in my family who are to the right of Attila the Hun. And when people tell me, like, “How can you platform that person on your show?” I go, “I platform my uncle every fucking Thanksgiving.”\nAnd, by the way, I love him. He’s a three-dimensional human being who has qualities that I really admire. And we’ve lost that. We’ve lost the ability to love people because we litmus-test at every point, in every single moment.\nJon, you’ve always struck me as an idealist, an American idealist. And I remember around 9/11 you said that the view from your place was the towers. And then you said, “Now I have a view of the Statue of Liberty.”\nIt was a terrific terrace.\nAnd that was a really idealistic thing to say about America in many ways, small and large.\nI believe it.\nYou still do?\nAbsolutely. And how can you not believe it? Think of the amazing people whom you see every day. Think of the quiet activism of living pleasantly. There’s more good than bad. I always will believe that. I always will believe that the odds are in our favor. Always.\nYou mentioned idealists in the Democratic Party and figures who are just not up to the task. You mentioned Mamdani, for one. Who do you see on a national level with promise as a leader?\n\nYou have twenty minutes.\n\nSomebody in the audience just said you.\nHave we really gotten to that point? You know what’s interesting—that’s also a function of frustration.\nA cry of desperation.\nYou know what it is? Because I’m other. I’m none of the above. Years ago, I won a poll. It was “Most Trusted Newsman in America.” The poll was, like—I can’t remember who it was. But I’m “none of the above.” A dildo rolled in glitter could have won that poll.\nI have never, in the audiences that come into the show, seen them so thirsty for leadership. The Democratic Party is ripe for what happened to the Republican Party in 2016. But, hopefully, it will be somebody who uses that power for good, and not for self-aggrandizement and not for their own, you know, gratification.\nAs someone—I think Elaine once said to Jerry—on the “fringe of the humor business,” do you think Donald Trump is funny?\nFunny, like, ha-ha? [Laughter.]\nUm, I think he has a performer’s cadence. And it would be funnier if he didn’t also control the Army.\nBut what’s the gift? Because it’s not nothing. There is something that works for him with an audience.\n\nWhat has he got?\nHe knows how to channel the frustrations of an audience. He knows how to read a room. He knows what the room is feeling, and he can articulate it back to them. There is an undeniable connection between him and his audience, to the point where the normal rules of engagement don’t apply. And the Democrats, unfortunately, continue to be Wile E. Coyote in the Acme, and they always think they got him.\n“Oh, if he’s convicted of thirty-four felony counts, there’s no way he’ll win.” “Oh, we got him now. He just got indicted on . . .” And every time Donald Trump just walks in and goes, “Meep meep. Pew.”\nSo what catches the Road Runner? What puts an end to this?\nWhat catches the Road Runner is to offer something other than not him, is to offer something that’s not just the negative. It’s not just negative space. We are stuck in a pattern where the Democratic Party has bought into an agenda over the course of forty years that has also bought into supply-side economics and the general neoliberal vision of how things go. And that the only way workers are ever going to get anything is just—“You just got to unionize better. Poor people just need better lobbyists.” You know, the Democrats need a coherent vision. For whatever you think of Donald Trump, he presents to his audience a coherent vision. It’s not one that I want to live in. It’s not one that I think makes America great. It’s not one that I think is even endemic to how America ever really was.\nSo this is a question from the audience. “Jon and David, you’ve both been sounding the alarm about the state of American democracy since 2016. After nearly a decade of saying ‘the sky is falling,’ do you think that people are hearing you at all?”\n[Pause.] Why not just, “Dear David and Jon, why don’t you just die? Why do you even get up in the morning?”\nThe thought occurs to me. You got an answer?\nIt doesn’t matter. I control what I can control. People say, “Do you think what you do is effective?” I have no fucking idea. I just do what I have to do. If you don’t develop a barometer for morality or integrity for yourself and let that inform how you live, then you’re at the whim of how you think other people view you. And I have no control over that. I have no control over how people view me.\nDo you think by going into other forms, podcasts in particular, you’ve reached different audiences? Do you think that you’re reaching them in a different way?\nI don’t know. That’s the thing about communication—I don’t know. The only people I talk to live in my house. People say, like, “What’s it like to be on TV?” And you’re, like, “It’s like not being on TV. You can see me, but I can’t see you. I don’t know how I affect you.” You just don’t know. I wish I knew. Or maybe I don’t. It actually could be hurting. I don’t know.\nWhat’s it been like for you to think and talk about what’s been happening in Gaza for the last two years? How have you been affected by it?\nSuper fun at Passover.\n\nIt’s a really fraught and complicated emotional issue, obviously, for a lot of Jews. But, again, I try to speak as best I can, in my opinion, as honestly as I can, and if that means upsetting certain people—I’m always open to the conversation. But I have very strong opinions about the horror of what I see over there, on all sides. I’m on team human.\nLook, I grew up, man, as David. We were all David. Not Remnick, obviously, but biblical. And I think feeling like David became Goliath was a hard thing to counsel for myself. And a lot of people disagree. You bring this up and immediately, you know, “You’re ignoring . . . in 1954, they really . . .” Like, I get it. But I’m, like, right now there’s death and sadness and starvation and horror. And I don’t think it’s human. And I don’t know what happened. I don’t know how we can do that. It’s a failure of the world, and it’s a failure of humanity, and it’s the saddest thing that I can think of.\nAnd, by the way, the same shit’s going on in Sudan and in the Congo, and in all kinds of other places that don’t have access to the kinds of information and light that we see. And it’s going on in Ukraine. And, like, you know, this is it. Like, this is all we got. And, if we can’t figure this out, it’s mind-boggling.\n“This” being life on Earth?\nRight. But, when you get to be older, you do start thinking, like, Oh, I won’t be here. But how are we fucking this up this badly?\nFinal question.\nSagittarius. [Laughter.]\nWhat accounts for your love for the Mets?\nI’m a loser. And losers love to lose. [Laughter.]\nMy family is from Brooklyn and the Bronx. And so it was really a birthright more than it was . . .\nWell, as a Yankee fan, I wish you all the luck in the world.\n\nJon Stewart, thank you. ♦","summary":"The comedian talks about the suppression of political speech under Donald Trump, why social media doesn’t mix well with democracy, and the future of “The Daily Show.”","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/will-paramount-cancel-jon-stewart","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/69039518aafbd224d5bc33ea/16:9/w_3840,h_2160,c_limit/RADIO_HOUR_Jon_Stewart_FINAL_10_28_2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 18:00:00","author":"David Remnick","authors":["David Remnick"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":374536676,"title":"‘Babies are starving!’: Kamala Harris explodes over Donald Trump’s $300 million ballroom — watch","text":"Former vice president Kamala Harris went on a furious rant on President Donald Trump, slamming his decision to build a new $300 million ballroom at the White House, demolishing the East Wing, while millions of Americans face the loss of food aid during the ongoing government shutdown.Speaking on The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart podcast, Harris accused Trump of prioritising luxury over lives. “Are you f--king kidding me?” she said angrily. “This guy wants to create a ballroom for his rich friends while completely turning a blind eye to the fact that babies are going to starve when the SNAP benefits end in just hours from now. Come on.”She went on to criticise what she described as Trump’s obsession with image and excess. “I’m not going to be distracted by, ‘Oh, does the guy have a big f--king hammer?’ What about those babies?” Harris said, drawing a contrast between the lavish project and struggle of low-income families.The MAGA chief's ballroom project is estimated to cost around $300 million and involves tearing down the East Wing of the White House to make way for a 90,000-square-foot hall. The White House has maintained that the expansion is funded entirely by private donors and no taxpayer money is used, but Democrats have denounced it as wasteful and tone-deaf amid the cost-of-living crisis.The shutdown has already jeopardised federal food assistance for nearly 40 million Americans and threatens to raise healthcare costs as subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire.Harris urged action on behalf of working families, pointing out what she called Trump’s misplaced priorities. “It costs $8 billion to keep SNAP going for poor children? Come on. And taxpayer dollars, by the way,” she said, referencing Trump’s earlier $20 billion bailout to Argentina.","summary":"Kamala Harris fiercely criticized Donald Trump's plan for a new $300 million White House ballroom, deeming it a luxury project while millions face food aid loss due to the government shutdown.

Harris didn’t appear to have many ideas besides vowing to continue whatever President Joe Biden was doing. I didn’t find the inflation thanks to Bidenomics to be particularly enjoyable and anyone who thinks price controls is a good idea can’t be taken seriously.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of specific policy actions I can generally appreciate. His administration ordered 10 regulations be repealed for every new one issued. He also ensured the income tax cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act were extended, which is great, since I’d rather waste my own money than have the government waste my money. All good so far.\n\nAnd intangibly, it appears his election popped the woke bubble that engulfed the culture the last several years. The Democratic Party lost its mind over the last decade and became fixated on skin color and genitals to the detriment of its (formerly) working-class base. Meanwhile, the wokesters got busy destroying every institution they touched, from amateur sports to entertainment to media to tech. And if you dared point that out, you had to prepare to be called a racist, sexist, transphobe, all that. So, good riddance to that.\n\nThat’s basically my list of positives: He’s not Kamala Harris, he popped the woke bubble, he’s done some deregulatory things and cut some taxes.\n\nBut what’s on the other side of the ledger?\n\nWell, the biggest problems with the second Trump term are the horrible precedents he’s setting that will definitely be abused by future administrations.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nWell, he started his presidency very early on with a mass firing of U.S. inspectors general. These are the people specifically tasked to serve as independent watchdogs within federal agencies. Call me naive, but I’m pretty sure you want people in place to investigate reports of waste, fraud and abuse. What could go wrong?\n\nHe appointed well-established conspiracy theorists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to positions of authority and takes advice from conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who, among other things, spread the idea the “deep state” engineered a winter storm during the 2024 Iowa caucuses to help Nikki Haley. When there are no more standards, beyond loyalty to the president, how can one ever effectively criticize future administration picks?\n\nThere are also his trade policies. He’s unilaterally imposed and threatened to impose steep taxes on goods from all over the world, which incentivizes businesses and countries to woo him, the president of the United States, to get special carveouts and special treatment. That’s a blatant invitation for cronyism and corruption. It’s allowed him to essentially shake down companies for the privilege to do business, like his 15% tax on Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in exchange for “allowing” them to do business in China.\n\nImagine if Barack Obama or Joe Biden did that? I can imagine the Glenn Beck “Obama is a Kenyan Communist” charts already. The same people who are defending Trump for doing this would be declaring the Bolsheviks have taken over if Obama imposed tariffs on everything.\n\nThen there’s his war on the media, specifically the legacy media because he’s a boomer and thinks they still have the sway they had decades ago. Now, look, I get it. Mainstream media outlets have definitely leaned left and have definitely treated Trump far more critically than they treated Biden or Obama. But, ultimately, so what? Legacy media outlets, from newspapers to television broadcasters, are just a shrinking piece of a vast media market. Podcasters and streamers get more views than television networks, while partisan propaganda outlets like the Daily Wire and niche Substackers draw subscription numbers rivaling or exceeding nationally recognized newspapers.\n\nWith or without this context in mind, the Trump administration has threatened broadcast licenses (remember the ridiculous Jimmy Kimmel saga?) and Trump has personally sued media outlets for things as frivolous as editing an interview with Kamala Harris for broadcast. For a supposed champion of “free speech,” he’s sure been happy to flex his muscle to crack down on speech he doesn’t like.\n\nEven more pernicious is the chilling effect government crackdowns have on the press. If media institutions that strive to be objective start pulling their punches, that’s only to the benefit of the powerful. Imagine the hypocritical outrage to come when President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cracks down on right-wing outlets for misinformation and sues conservative podcasters into submission.\n\nThen there’s the militarized and thuggish execution of immigration enforcement policy Trump has unleashed. ProPublica documented 170 instances of American citizens held by immigration agents. As they reported, “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them.”\n\nAn America where Americans are numb to seeing masked federal agents disappear people for showing up to work on a house at a day labor site is an America that’s no longer recognizable.\n\nRemember when even right-wingers got mad at Obama for signing a National Defense Authorization Act that included indefinite detention powers? Remember when right-wingers at least had a part of them that got mad about what the government did at Waco and Ruby Ridge? Suddenly, many of these same people are happy to embrace the idea of federal agents running around arresting disabled American teenagers (yes, this happened) and trying to deport kids with cancer.\n\nWhen the right — ostensibly the faction most inclined to resist federal tyranny — suddenly thinks unleashing federal agents is the key to a better America, we’re definitely heading toward Big Government authoritarianism.\n\nThis column is getting long, but I could keep going.\n\nSo far, Trump has done a good job of eviscerating the apparently quaint ideas of capitalism, limited government, fiscal responsibility. The next time Democrats come to power, will Republicans and young conservatives even remember what any of those ideas are? They’ve spent so much time on their mental gymnastics this past decade — will they even have the memory to offer conservative-ish, free market-ish, limited government-ish critiques of Democratic overreach?\n\nSal Rodriguez can be reached at salrodriguez@scng.com","summary":"How’s it going? ","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/31/sal-rodriguez-the-maga-hangover-will-be-brutal/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/OCR-L-POM-1124-07.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 17:44:42","author":"Sal Rodriguez","authors":["Sal Rodriguez"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.083},{"id":374575164,"title":"WATCH: Kamala Harris Wants Voter Age Lowered to 16 Because Gen Z Has 'Climate Anxiety'","text":"“I think we should reduce voting age to 16.

Rather than say something normal like “That is a private matter for her” or “I support her Hindu faith,” Vance, inevitably, made it uncomfortable.\n\nHe started by saying that his wife grew up in “not a particularly religious” Hindu family, as if that makes a demand for conversion to Christianity somehow better. Then, he made it worse: “As I've told her, and I've said publicly, and I'll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.”\n\nImagine your partner getting up in front of thousands of people and saying this garbage.\n\nIt’s clear that, even without a forced conversion for his wife, Vance has already imposed his Christianity on his family. He makes sure to tell everyone that they are raising the children Christian already, and two of the three attend Christian schools, because of course.\n\nAnd Usha already goes to church with Vance, which he presents as a joyful thing, where his wife is “closer to the priest who baptized me than maybe I am. My attitude is, you figure this stuff out as a family, and you trust in God to have a plan.”\n\nDunno, buddy. Sounds like your wife is doing everything to accommodate your faith while you do nothing in return, so your only plan is to make her discard her faith.\n\nVance isn’t just a Christian. He’s a Christian nationalist who believes the nation should be under the thumb of people like him. Gotta be weird to come home to that if you are Usha.\n\nAnd then there are his biracial kids. At minimum, Vance wants to just disappear the fact that they are indisputably biracial, with the whole “I don’t see color” sort of thing, explaining that he and Usha “were taught to think about people as people and not as whatever artificial, superficial skin color they had.”\n\nHonestly surprised he didn’t deploy the out-of-context Martin Luther King Jr. quote that is a favorite of racist conservatives everywhere: “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”\n\nWhile Vance has deployed references to his biracial children when it suits him, he also happily defended President Donald Trump’s attacks on former Vice President Kamala Harris for her biracial identity, saying that Trump’s comments were “totally reasonable.”\n\nPal, Trump said that Harris “happened to turn Black.” There’s no world where that’s totally reasonable.\n\nRelated | Racist Young Republicans f-ck around and find out\n\nAnd when fellow Republicans are deeply, disgustingly racist, like the Young Republicans in those leaked chats, Vance defended the racists, of course, saying these were jokes from “kids.” Yeah, kids who are, like, 35 years old. \n\nOr how about when Marko Elez, one of the vicious tweens that comprised the first wave of Department of Government Efficiency employees, was fired for posting things like “I was racist before it was cool” and “normalize Indian hate.” Did Vance call out this racism that was literally directed at people like his wife and his children? Nope. He demanded that Elez be rehired.\n\nHe did a mushy little “I obviously disagree with some of Elez’s posts,” but gosh, “stupid social media activity” shouldn’t ruin the kid’s life, right? The real problem, per Vance, was people who wrote about Eloz’s racism: “We shouldn’t reward journalists who try to destroy people. Ever.”\n\nVance is a professional racist and Christian chauvinist, and he’s not going to be happy until he warps his wife and children—and the whole of America, really—into becoming just like him.","summary":"Man, can you imagine being married to Vice President JD Vance or being one of his children?

If approved by voters, the new map could help Democrats gain as many as five House seats, potentially shifting the balance of power in Congress. With Republicans holding a narrow 219-213 majority, even a small shift could alter which party controls legislative priorities and the fate of President Donald Trump’s administration’s agenda.

Previously, in February, his approval rating among Americans ages 18-29 stood at 50%, with just 42% expressing disapproval.\n\nNow, 75% of 18-29-year-olds disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president. Fifty-five percent strongly disapprove. \n\nOn the way Trump is handling the economy, 72% of 18-29-year-olds disapprove. For his handling of inflation, 72% also disapprove.

The unemployment rate among young Americans is trending upward. College graduates (even those with more practical degrees) are having a tougher time finding a job as the labor market slows down.

Newsom trounces republicans with $120 million Prop 50 campaign haul","text":"By Eliyahu Kamisher, Bloomberg\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is betting his political future on a controversial ballot measure that would redraw the state’s congressional maps to favor Democrats. A coalition of super wealthy and working people is giving him a big financial advantage.\n\nOver the past 11 weeks, Newsom and his allies brought in more than $120 million for Proposition 50, about three times the total raised by the proposal’s opponents. The governor’s backers include billionaires George Soros, Michael Moritz and Reed Hastings, as well as the state’s influential nurses, teachers and public employee unions and an army of small donors.\n\nRELATED: Proposition 50: Will it enhance or hinder representation in California\n\nA flood of contributions “broke the seal” and helped dispel initial concerns over donor fatigue after Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential loss and worries that Newsom supporters would hold back because of the potential for White House retribution, said campaign consultant Juan Rodriguez. The campaign also got a big boost from House Majority PAC, which is supporting Democrats nationwide.\n\nThe lopsided haul has enabled the governor to blitz the airwaves ahead of the Nov. 4 vote on the ballot measure, an initiative that has propelled his rise to become a top Democratic antagonist of President Donald Trump. Newsom, a potential presidential contender in 2028, has championed Proposition 50 as a way to neutralize a move by Texas Republicans to grab as many as five extra seats in the US House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe spending spree appears to be having an impact. An Emerson College poll of likely voters conducted last week found increasing favorability for the redistricting measure at 57%. That was comparable to the 56% support in a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nA poll released Thursday from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, showed that 60% of likely voters backed the proposal, compared with 48% of registered voters surveyed in August.\n\n“Certain demographic groups that were hesitant to support the measure last month have come around to support Prop. 50, such as Black voters, whose support increased from 45% to 71%,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement.\n\nNewsom is asking voters to temporarily override a hard-won independent commission that draws California’s congressional district maps in favor of a partisan revamp designed to flip five Republican-held seats to Democrats – and improve the odds of a Democratic takeover of the House.\n\nRELATED: New poll finds support for Proposition 50, ‘extraordinarily high’ voter awareness of redistricting measure\n\nCalifornia’s effort is a direct response to an unusually timed redistricting drive in Republican-dominated Texas. After a push from Trump, Republicans redrew Texas congressional maps in such a way as to favor the GOP in five Democratic-held districts. Other Republican states are also following the Texas example in a redistricting battle that has spread across the country.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a 219-213 majority in the US House, which also has three vacant seats. A loss of control by the GOP next year would go far in blunting Trump’s power.\n\n“Californians are up in arms and they understand that we only have one play right now and that is to get Prop 50 passed and put a check on unfettered power by a would-be dictator,” said California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, a prolific Democratic fundraiser who last month hosted a soiree in her San Francisco apartment that yielded more than $200,000.\n\nThere’s a hole in Newsom’s fundraising web: Silicon Valley.\n\nTech leaders, long a wellspring of Democratic support, have increasingly backed Trump. Cooper Teboe, who connects tech tycoons donors with Democrats, cited Reid Hoffman, Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz as notable names who aren’t backing Newsom’s redistricting plan.\n\n“The list of who is missing is so much longer than the list of who is supporting,” Teboe said. “You’re missing some really big dogs.”\n\nBut Newsom’s war chest is large enough to fuel a surge in advertising. The campaign has lavished more than $51 million on digital ads, compared with $18 million for the “no” side, according to AdImpact. In the final two weeks, Newsom’s team is expanding into Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese and Korean, as well as onto WhatsApp and other nontraditional platforms.\n\nThe ad battle is pitting former President Barack Obama against former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In one ad, Obama tells voters that “Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election.”\n\nSchwarzenegger, an architect of California’s independent redistricting commission, has emerged as the best known opponent of Proposition 50.\n\n“Yes, they are fixing the elections in Texas, but that does not mean California should fix the elections because of that,” he said in an interview. “This is a scam.”\n\nCharles Munger Jr., an heir to the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. fortune and another big backer of the independent redistricting commission, has spent more than $30 million on an opposition campaign to Proposition 50. But outlays have tapered off recently, support from national Republicans has lagged and Trump himself has largely stayed out of the California debate.\n\nThe GOP can still brag about forcing Newsom to spend heavily on Proposition 50 after the Texas redistricting effort required no expensive campaign effort.\n\n“We have to get creative, we have to get incredibly targeted,” said Jessica Patterson, who heads a No on 50 campaign co-led by former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. “That’s what we have to do when we’re outspent.”\n\nA few prominent supporters of the ballot initiative have used Newsom’s campaign to grab some of the political limelight for themselves.\n\nTom Steyer, a billionaire climate investor, spent more than $12 million backing the measure with prime-time television ads featuring himself. Billionaire mall magnate Rick Caruso, who is considering a run for Los Angeles mayor or California governor, paid for mailers encouraging people to vote yes on Proposition 50 – alongside his own picture.\n\nThe fundraising bonanza has put Newsom in the unusual position of telling donors that the campaign has enough money.\n\n“You can stop donating now,” he said in a mass email. “Thank you.”\n\n–With assistance from Romy Varghese.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","summary":"A coalition of super wealthy and working people is giving Newsom a big financial advantage. ","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/31/newsom-trounces-republicans-with-120-million-prop-50-campaign-haul/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LDN-L-NEXTMAPS-0823-01.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 15:49:23","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.07},{"id":374552722,"title":"Lifelong Democrat C-SPAN Caller Says Party ‘Makes’ Him ‘Sick,’ Announces He’s Leaving","text":"An Oklahoma C-SPAN caller who said he was a lifelong Democrat and voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 declared on Friday that he was sickened by his party and plans to leave it.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s favorability stands at just 34.7%, according to the RealClearPolling average. The caller, speaking on “Washington Journal,” particularly expressed dissatisfaction with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, suggesting they should both retire. (RELATED: Fetterman Tells Democrats To ‘Cut The Sh*t’ After His Colleagues Tanked Bill To Pay Troops)\n\n“I’ve been a Democrat all my life. I’m 78 — and my folks were too — but this party has changed so damn much,” the caller said. “It makes me sick. I’m going to move out of it. It’s terrible. Schumer, he needs to be in a home. Take Pelosi with him.”\n\nThe caller asserted he supported Harris solely due to party loyalty.\n\nA Democratic Pennsylvania caller also said on “Washington Journal” Tuesday that she was done voting for Democrats amid dissatisfaction with the party over the ongoing government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 after Schumer rallied nearly every Senate Democrat to tank a bipartisan funding bill.\n\n“I have a problem with my party, and I’m not going to change my party,” she said. “I just won’t vote for a Democrat.”\n\nMoreover, three Democratic callers on “Washington Journal” rebuked their party during an August segment regarding whether they were pleased with its trajectory. They cited reasons including weakness, an obsession with attacking President Donald Trump and moving too far left.\n\n“I’m registered Democrat, but I hate my party. I haven’t voted for a Democrat really in the elections in quite a while. And yes, I voted Republican many times because I like the policies better. Democrats have had terrible policies,” one caller said. “And now we have the rise of the so-called progressives. They’re really regressives. People like the Squad and [Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez and now [Zohran] Mamdani, who might become the mayor of New York City — he’s a proven socialist and Marxist as well as an antisemite.”\n\nFurthermore, a New York Times analysis of voter registration data published in August found that the Democratic Party experienced a drop of about 2.1 million registered voters between 2020 and 2024, while Republicans gained about 2.4 million.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

His struggling performance and stumbling over words effectively ended his reelection bid and reshaped the presidential race.\n\nBut according to Kamala Harris, the warning signs appeared well before Biden took the debate stage.\n\nSpeaking on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast on Thursday (October 30), the former vice president revealed she sensed 'something was off' with Biden months earlier.\n\nHarris pointed out a specific phone call from Biden while he was at debate preparation camp that concerned her.\n\nDuring the call, Biden reportedly seemed feeble and forgetful, often stumbling over his words.\n\n\"He called me from debate camp [...] and I could tell something was a little off,\" Harris recalled. \"And I was concerned about - I just, I don't think he wanted to debate, is my point.\"\n\nShe explained: \"He didn't want that debate. And you know, it's like any competition you go in, whether it's you're bidding for something, if it's sports, you gotta want it, right?\n\n\"If you don't wanna be in the competition, it will absolutely have an impact on your performance. I'm pretty sure he did not want to debate.\"\n\nWhen Bartlett asked her how she knew, Harris replied: \"Well, we had conversations about it. I think he got talked into it.\"\n\nThe Democrat said she deliberately watched the debate that evening with only a small team in Los Angeles so she could 'be candid' in her reaction, adding that 'there is no such thing as a perfect debate'.\n\nShe added: \"There will be something to clean up, and I expected that. And then, you know, we saw what we all saw.\"\n\nBiden ultimately dropped out of the presidential race in July 2024, with Harris securing the Democratic nomination.\n\nLooking back, Harris now questions whether she should've told Biden not to run for reelection. In her recently published memoir, 107 Days, which chronicles the 2024 election and her historic presidential campaign, Harris reflects on the dilemma.\n\nAt the time, she worried such advice would seem 'self-serving' coming from the vice president who would naturally benefit from his decision to step aside, Harris told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow last month.\n\nMaddow pressed Harris about a part of the book describing how everyone in the administration maintained that he and then-First Lady Jill Biden alone should determine whether he should run for reelection.\n\n\"We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,\" the former VP wrote. \"Was it grace, or was it recklessness?

She recalled that she was “angry” with the then-president when she hung up the phone, as she expected him to cheer her on right before the debate.\n\n“I’m in my hotel room with Doug, my husband, and the president calls and I was told that he wanted to call me so that I’d be ready and I was so sure it was to buck me up and ‘go get em,'” Harris said. “And he did say that for the first beat, and then he went on to talk about a group of people in Pennsylvania who are saying bad things about me because they heard I was saying bad things about him and when I hung up the phone, I was just, it was unbelievable. And I was, yes, I was angry and deeply disappointed. It was just so unnecessary.” (RELATED: Kamala Harris Says Her Grief From Losing To Trump Compared To The Day Her Mother Died)\n\nThe former vice president stated that Biden “greatly disappointed” her at times ahead of the election.\n\nThe host, Steven Bartlett, suggested that Biden did not want the best for Harris based on that call.\n\n“If someone called me in the lead-up to debate prep and said something like that to me, I would assume that they don’t want the best for me,” Bartlett said.\n\n“My takeaway is that his motivation was all about himself,” Harris said. “Yeah right, obviously, right.

Another anonymous adviser to a prospective 2028 candidate said that Harris “chose to write a gossip book that prioritizes the pettiness of her politics.”\n\nThe former vice president assured that Biden was mentally fit to serve another term in office, though she admitted that she had reservations about his ability to run another successful campaign.

As demolition continues, critics say he has ignored the urgent issues caused by the ongoing government shutdown, which has led to food insecurity and financial hardship for millions of Americans. What’s more, what has added to the people’s frustration are reports of this incumbent ballroom being funded entirely by private donors, while millions of people are impacted with half salaries, pay cuts, and more financial trouble due to the shutdown.\n\nFor the unversed, Trump’s ballroom project is said to be based on a massive investment of $300 million, which will be a vast space crafted to welcome distinguished guests for events on an enormous scale. Considering the layout of the White House East Wing before the demolition, there have been widespread questions raised about the felling of historic trees, disrupting heritage property, and more, with the kind of extensive renovation that is taking place. At a time when the rest of the country is dealing with a real-time crisis, Trump’s elaborate plans to craft a place of his dreams aren’t exactly fitting the bill with his image of being the U.S. President. \n\nKamala Harris has a total MELTDOWN over the White House ballroom..\nlmaoo pic.twitter.com/ld8z0SeusV\n— American AF 🇺🇸 (@iAnonPatriot) October 31, 2025\n\nAttacking these points itself, former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris launched a direct rant against Donald Trump and his alleged self-serving dreams of the ballroom. Expressing sheer rage on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show podcast, she could be seen losing it mid-rant, infuriated by the kind of politics being acted out by the reigning federal government, which surely had absolutely no thought for the well-being of the citizens in the first place.\n\nSpeaking on Trump shifting priorities to create a ballroom in place of distributing food aid benefits to those in crisis, she said, “Are you f—— kidding me? This guy wants to create a ballroom for his rich friends while completely disregarding the fact that babies are going to starve when the SNAP benefits end in just hours from now. Come on! I’m not going to be distracted by, ‘Oh, does the guy have a big f–king hammer!?’ What about those babies!?”\n\nHarris appeared visibly frustrated when asked whether Democrats could learn from Trump’s aggressive, “bulldozer-style” approach to governing. In response, she hastily remarked, “It’s important we not conflate disruption with destruction.” For the unversed, the demolition of a historic space like the White House East Wing has been the first-ever revamp that the place has undergone since its foundation, about 83 years back. The wave of criticism directed at the Trump administration for approving such an extensive project mirrors the scale of the physical demolition itself.\n\nIn the meantime, with the shutdown still in place for weeks now, SNAP benefits for the citizens have been a recent privilege that has been curtailed. Over 40 million Americans are said to rely on the SNAP benefits, which are now threatened with the shutdown in place, since the payments will not be issued from November 1 onwards. While 25 American states have already planned to sue the Agriculture Department over these suspensions, there has been no postponement of it at all yet.\n\nStarting Saturday, millions will see health costs skyrocket because of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”\nNow, unbelievably, Trump is prepared to let children go hungry by illegally withholding SNAP benefits Congress approved.\nDisgusting. Fight back. We can’t allow that to happen. pic.twitter.com/MZBLfYivl2\n— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 30, 2025\n\nThe Senate Democrats, in retaliation for the suspension of SNAP benefits, claimed that there could be an easy and straightforward solution that could ensure that no one would lose out on their food assistance. Speaking to The Post, Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated, “The simplest way to end it and the simplest way to make sure that people are getting the food assistance they need is to pick up the bill and give us five votes.” Unfortunately, despite the plea, the Senate failed to reopen the government in a 54-45 vote.","summary":"Kamala Harris has a direct rant against Donald Trump overlooking food crisis in the name of ballroom plans in White House","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/are-you-kidding-me-kamala-harris-goes-on-a-blistering-rant-against-trump-and-his-300m-ballroom-plans","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cover-82.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 14:21:31","author":"Srijony Das","authors":["Srijony Das"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.019},{"id":374507500,"title":"INGERSOLL: Elissa Slotkin’s New Trump Conspiracy Theory Is Just The Old One On Ozempic","text":"Below is State of the Day, a morning newsletter by Daily Caller Editor-at-Large Geoff Ingersoll.

Elissa Slotkin. I truly can’t get over how perfect she appears to be to a political left reeling from its own excesses. CIA analyst. Tours to Iraq. Childless and divorced. Look for her to run as a “real combat veteran” against Vance.\n\nThe main trouble for everyone involved is she’s still captured by the same delusional inversion as the rest of the party. She, like the Bulwark is to Rational Never Trump Conservatism, is just a cleaner, speed-limit version of all the same foolishness facing the party. \n\nShe’s just liberal mass hysteria at a resting heart rate.\n\nStarting with the obvious: Here she is saying Trump is preparing to never leave office. We’ve heard this before. Trump will demand loyalty and consolidate power. Trump will use it against his political enemies. Trump is an “authoritarian.” When the “tipping point” comes, he’ll pull out all stops to stay in power. \n\nAgain, we’ve heard all this before. What’s more, we’ve actually seen it in action, except not from Trump.\n\nIt was Democrats who set up a sprawling, multinational censorship, surveillance and suppression apparatus. It was Democrats who attempted to ban certain questions under penalty of financial and reputational ruin. It was Democrats who formed and funded domestic paramilitary groups, and Democrats who looked the other way as those groups routinely assaulted common conservatives in the streets. It was Democrats who investigated, probed and arrested conservatives, big and small, on trumped up charges. It was Democrats who throttled loyal members of the judiciary in order to summarily subvert the Democratic process. It was Democrats who abused power to remove Trump’s name from ballots. It was Democrats who turned the tools of the intelligence community and the Justice Department on their own countrymen, to map and suppress not just official party opposition but even wine moms running Pro-Trump Facebook pages.\n\nAnd now, when conservatives fight back, when they seek actual justice for the injustices they’ve suffered, it’s Democrats howling about all the above.\n\nI’m sorry, folks, but facing the consequences of your actions is not persecution.\n\nI know I’m not your real dad, but nevertheless, you’re grounded.\n\nNow go to your room and think about what you’ve done.\n\nWHAT I’M READING\n\n“I intend to plead not guilty and win,” she says as video rolls of her committing a felony in broad daylight.\n\n‘Did She Just Sign Off?’: Indicted Democrat Ditches Interview When Confronted With Video Of Herself Impeding ICE\n\nDid Republicans do “Arctic Frost”?

It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the 1 October shutdown when the new fiscal year began.\n Trump’s call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional deal-making operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday. \n Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.In a separate post on Truth Social, Trump wrote about his meetings and said it “was a great honor” to “see that America is respected again”. He also claimed that “money is pouring into our Country because of Tariffs and, frankly, the Landslide Results of the 2024 Presidential Election”.Switching back to the filibuster issue, Trump wrote:\n It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!\nMore on this in a moment. First here are some other key developments:\n\n A (small) handful of US Senate Republicans issued a legislative rebuke to president Donald Trump’s world-rattling trade tariffs in a rare alignment with their Democratic counterparts. Four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – joined the opposition party, voting 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs on more than 100 nations that the president put into place via executive order.\n\n The Trump administration is going to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the United States next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans. The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.\n\n New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, on Thursday declared a state of emergency to free up funds so that she could issue $65m in assistance to food banks because federal funding for the national food stamp program is set to lapse on 1 November. Oregon and Virginia have also issued emergency declarations to release state cash to go towards emergency food assistance as the federal government shutdown imperils Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits for nearly 42 million Americans.\n\n More than half of Americans disapprove of Trump’s demolition of the White House’s East Wing and the construction of a new ballroom, according to a new poll from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos. The survey was conducted between 24 and 28 October and indicates 56% of the respondents disagree with Trump’s recent move while 28% are in favor of it. Most of the survey’s respondents were white, one-third of them voted for Donald Trump and another third for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has urged the Trump administration to suspend its immigration crackdown in his state from Friday to Sunday, to allow children to “spend Halloween weekend without fear”.\nKey events26m agoMike Johnson doubles down on refusing to bring back House until shutdown ends1h agoHouse Republicans increasingly frustrated with Johnson over shutdown tactics2h agoFBI thwarts potential terrorist attack, says Kash Patel3h agoUN human rights official says US strikes on alleged drug boats are 'unacceptable'3h agoUS Senate votes to reject Trump’s global tariffs on more than 100 countries3h agoTrump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdownUS House Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated this morning that he will not bring the chamber back into session until the government shutdown ends.Speaking to Fox News on Friday, Johnson said: “We are anxious to get the house back to regular legislative session, but we have to get the lights turned back on. Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate have got to reopen the government. Again, it’s the most fundamental responsibility of congress is to have the government operate and work for the people. That’s the number one priority right now and we cannot deviate from that.”The government is on day 31 of shutdown today. The senate adjourned on Thursday without resolving demands by Democrats to negotiate on healthcare subsidies for insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The senate won’t meet again until Monday, extending the shutdown into at least its 34th day, equaling the longest in US history.Meanwhile, health insurance exchanges enter an open enrollment period tomorrow. An early peek at prices without subsidies suggests that the cost of many plans will double or more. Paychecks for most government employees will not go out tomorrow. And the government will not pay Snap food benefits that would normally land on prepaid cards tomorrow, leaving about 42 million beneficiaries – mostly children and disabled elderly recipients – searching for ways to pay for food.The president of the Heritage Foundation has denied the suggestion that the conservative thinktank should distance itself from former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, after interviewing white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who made antisemitic statements during the two-and-a-half hour video.“Christians can critique the State of Israel without being anti-Semitic, and of course, anti-Semitism should be condemned,” said Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, in a video on X yesterday. “[C]onservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.”Roberts said: “The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won’t start doing that now. We don’t take direction from comments on X, though we are grateful for the robust free speech debate.”House Republicans are increasingly expressing frustration with the chamber’s moribund activity and the legislative backlog piling up as speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana keeps Congress out of session during the government shutdown.Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia confronted speaker the speaker during a House GOP conference call to criticize his tactics to negotiate the shutdown, according to a piece in the Hill today.Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas has also been critical of the shutdown’s effect on the legislative agenda, Axios reported.The FBI has made multiple arrests to avert a potential terrorist attack in Michigan, FBI director Kash Patel announced on X this morning, promising additional details.Those arrested “were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend”, he wrote. No other details have yet been presented.Kennedy Center ticket sales for orchestra, dance and theatre performances are at the worst they have been since the pandemic, analysis by the Washington Post has found.Back in September, the Guardian reported that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center had continued to plummet following Donald Trump’s takeover of Washington DC’s premier performing arts venue.Since then typical ticket sales are down from 93 per cent in late 2024 to about 57% this year, according to the Post.Audiences are “voting with their feet to skip out” on shows that would once have been packed, in protest at the US president inserting himself into the center’s management and operations as its new chair.A federal judge has indicated that she would order the Trump administration to use reserves to partially fund food assistance for about 42 million Americans in November, reports the Washington Post. If the order goes ahead, it could delay a cutoff in benefits during the government shutdown.US grocers and food companies ranging from Walmart to Smithfield Foods are bracing for a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits lapse for the first time due to the ongoing government shutdown.The shutdown has imperiled next month’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, which serves nearly 42 million people.Neither Congress nor the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acted to fund the benefits beyond Saturday. The gap could mean an $8bn revenue drop for grocers, declining sales for their suppliers and reduced hours for workers as it drives Snap recipients to reduce spending, trade groups, companies and a union said this week, reports Reuters.Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of health, nutrition and food studies at New York University said:\n It’s not only poor people who are on Snap who are going to be affected. It means the places where they spend the money aren’t going to get that money.\nThe National Grocers Association said on Wednesday that Congress should reopen the government and fund Snap to avoid instability for customers and retailers, warning of “serious consequences for local grocers, their employees, and the food supply chain.”“Retailers are going to be in a terrible situation here trying to manage costs and inventory,” said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, adding stores could see unsold perishable goods go to waste.A USDA spokesperson called the benefit lapse “an inflection point for Senate Democrats”. The agency has repeatedly blamed Democrats for the shutdown, most of whom have withheld votes on a spending bill in an attempt to keep healthcare costs from increasing for many Americans.A US Republican senator is asking President Donald Trump’s administration to help the Malaysian government prevent US artificial intelligence chips from being smuggled through the country to China, according to a letter seen by Reuters.Reuters has previously reported that US officials believe Malaysia is among a handful of countries where organized smuggling operations have worked to get US chips into China that would otherwise be banned from export to China.Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, wrote a letter to US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick saying Malaysian officials had begun cracking down on such activity and the Trump administration should aid Malaysian officials in the effort by helping the country develop screening programs to ensure chips are not being diverted to China.Cotton, who along with the Trump administration has supported the idea of requiring US chips to contain technology that would verify their location to prevent smuggling, said chips with such technology should be given a green light for export to Malaysia, reports Reuters.Cotton wrote in an 30 October letter:As is often the case, US companies are at the forefront of developing creative and innovative technical solutions, which will help add layers of assurance against illegal diversion.Cotton said:\n To support the semiconductor industry in their efforts, it may be beneficial for US and Malaysian officials to develop priority customs clearance procedures for shipments of advanced U.S. chips with anti-diversion mechanisms.\nMalaysia, China’s largest trading partner in Southeast Asia, announced in July it was requiring permits for all exports, trans-shipments and transits of US-made high-performance chips, such as those made by Nvidia.The UN high commissioner for human rights said on Friday that US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.Volker Türk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization, reports the Associated Press (AP). Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for Türk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular UN briefing:\n These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\nShe said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law”.\n President Donald Trump has Justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region. \n US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61, reports the AP.\n Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.\n Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. Shamdasani added:\n Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.\nThe strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.The US Senate took a stand against Donald Trump’s global tariffs affecting more than 100 countries on Thursday, voting to nullify the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.Four Republicans joined with all Democrats to vote 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs that the president put into place via executive order.It was the third time the Republicans have voted alongside Democrats on a tariff resolution this week, previously rallying to end tariffs targeting Brazil and Canada.Going against Trump is rare for Republicans in his second term. But Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the opposition party.The vote came as Trump is wrapping up a week in Asia, where he struck a deal with China to lower tariffs on Chinese goods into the country and get China to buy up US soya beans, a pain point of the trade wars that had farmers on edge, among other concessions.Despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote.The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention.Kaine said:\n I did learn in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior.\nUS Senate votes to reject Trump’s global tariffs on more than 100 countriesRead morePresident Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.\n Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social:\n THE CHOICE IS CLEAR – INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER.\nThe filibuster is a longstanding tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running.

A NewsBusters study released this summer revealed that from January to July, the show featured 102 left-leaning guests and zero conservatives. \"I look forward to joining the ladies on ‘The View’ on Tuesday!\" Greene posted to X on Thursday. Greene's announcement on X was met with excitement by some conservatives who have been waiting to see someone with a different political viewpoint challenge the liberal co-hosts.

They're scared of us,\" Behar claimed. BROADCAST BIAS: JOY BEHAR HAS SKEWED ‘VIEW’ OF REALITY, THINKS REPUBLICANS FEAR HER SHOW The co-host's assertion prompted conservatives to flood social media with receipts showing that they had requested to appear on the show and found no success. Fox News Digital obtained emails showing a booker for \"The View\" either denying or dodging offers to feature prominent conservative guests including Outkick's Riley Gaines, The Daily Wire's Matt Walsh and New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz. Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer was told there wasn't \"room at the moment\" when a representative pitched him appearing on Veterans Day next month. Gaines, who became prominent for her advocacy to protect women’s sports, posted earlier this month, \"When I was pitched to go on, they said no,\" to accompany a viral clip of Behar claiming Republicans \"don’t want to come on\" the daytime talk show. A 2023 report from NewsBusters revealed that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had been on the show in the past, requested to appear on \"The View\" during a promotional book tour but was turned down. Cruz quoted Gaines' X post slamming the show for rejecting her request, writing, \"Me too!\" ‘THE VIEW’ FACES MOCKERY FOR BOOKING 102 LEFT-LEANING GUESTS AND ZERO CONSERVATIVES IN 2025 Cruz wasn’t the only Republican to criticize the show for rejecting requests to appear. \"Hey @TheView, my offer still stands. I'm ready when you are!\" Florida Rep. Byron Donalds posted to X, quoting a post from RNC Senior Advisor Danielle Alvarez, who noted that Donalds' bid to appear on the show was rejected. A variety of conservative guests have appeared on the program over the years, including Cruz, Caitlyn Jenner, Donald Trump Jr., former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. Critics of the show say supporters of President Donald Trump are represented. The only conservative, Alyssa Farah Griffin, has been largely critical of the administration along with her co-hosts, all of whom supported Kamala Harris for president in 2024.

The president did, Biden did. And I could tell something was a little off,’ Harris told Steven Bartlett, host of the podcast ‘The Diary Of A CEO.’\n\n‘And I was concerned about… I don't think he wanted to debate is my point. He didn't want that debate.’\n\nBiden dropped out of the race just 24 days after his first and only debate with Trump. The former president faced mounting pressure from leaders in the Democratic party over his health and electability.\n\nHarris, also during the podcast interview, revealed her greatest campaign regret.\n\nJoe Rogan in the final weeks of the presidential election invited Harris and Trump for separate interviews on his famous podcast.\n\nHarris, citing scheduling issues with campaign events, declined the interview but Trump accepted.\n\nRogan’s interview with Trump went viral acquiring more than 60 million views in the final days of the campaign.\n\n‘I wanted to do it. So let me just say that,’ Harris said. It would have been great to do and I think it would have been helpful to do.’\n\n'I regret that we didn't do it. I definitely regret that we didn't do it,' she conceded.\n\nHarris also refused to directly answer whether she believed Biden was unfit to be on the debate stage against Trump.\n\nThe former Democratic nominee said that Biden did not appear to have motivation to win the debate.\n\n‘You know, it's like any competition you go in, whether it's you're bidding for something, if it's sports, you got to want it,’ she added.\n\n‘If you don't want to be in the competition, it will absolutely have an impact on your performance. And I don't think he, I'm pretty sure he did not want to debate,' she went on.\n\nBartlett asked Harris whether there were signs indicating Biden would have a poor debate performance.\n\n‘Well, we had conversations about it.
