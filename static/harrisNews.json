The Japan Business Federation made the opinion public in a rare statement regarding specific corporate activity after U.S. reports said President Joe Biden's administration is in the final stage of rejecting the offer by Japan's largest steelmaker to acquire the Pittsburgh-based firm. The buyout plan \"has garnered significant interest among Japanese companies, especially those considering investing in the United States,\" the federation said. \"We sincerely hope that the review procedure will be conducted with the utmost integrity and fairness in accordance with the law,\" it said. An official of the federation, also known as Keidanren, said, \"We don't understand why (the U.S. government) is trying to block the deal. If rejected, the reason should be a focus.\" U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee running to succeed Biden, has opposed the planned acquisition by Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-largest producer in the 2023 World Steel Association tally, of U.S. Steel, the 24th-largest. She said at a recent rally in Pittsburgh that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and operated. Former President Donald Trump, Harris' Republican rival for the White House, and his running mate JD Vance have also been critical of the deal. U.S. Steel, founded in 1901, and the United Steelworkers union are both headquartered in the city, which is located in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.

Inclusion of the citizenship requirement is a nonstarter in the Senate, complicating prospects for the spending bill's passage.At least one Republican, conservative Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana, indicated he opposed the measure. And the bill is not supported by House Democrats, who favor a shorter-term bill.The Rules Committee plans to take up the temporary funding bill — known as a continuing resolution — on Monday, which could tee up a floor vote next week. Lawmakers are returning to Washington next week after their August recess. A stopgap spending measure will be needed to keep the government running after the end of September because they're not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund the agencies during the next fiscal year.\"Today, House Republicans are taking a critically important step to keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election process,\" Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. \"Congress has a responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American citizens can decide American elections.\"But in a joint statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray said avoiding a shutdown requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party.\"If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans' hands,\" Schumer and Murray said.Johnson's decision to add the proof of citizenship requirement to the spending measure comes after the House Freedom Caucus called for it in a position statement last month. The group of conservatives, banking on a win by Republican nominee Donald Trump, also urged that the measure fund the government into early next year so Republicans could get more of their priorities in legislation. Some GOP leaders had wanted to pass the final spending bills by the end of this Congress so that the new president, whether it be Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, could focus more on getting staffed and pursuing their own top priorities rather than dealing with spending disagreements.The bill would fund agencies at current levels until March 28, though there's also money to help cover additional security costs associated with Inauguration Day and $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund.","summary":"House Republicans released a bill to avoid a looming partial government shutdown at the end of September.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-republican-cr-continuing-resolution/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/06/c86d4361-3c6a-4ba6-83ad-f6ff10d38c7a/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8a0f6e3ef79f7ed8ee890b330829410a/gettyimages-2162706308.jpg?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/09/06/2369815619552/3175207_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-07 00:17:57","author":"House Democrats","authors":["House Democrats"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":255835400,"title":"Liz Cheney's Four-Word Message for Texas Voters","text":"Former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney had a short and direct message for any Texans who are \"discouraged\" by the state's political leader's \"embrace\" of former President Donald Trump.\"Vote for Colin Allred,\" Cheney told attendees during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Friday, throwing her endorsement behind the Democrat running against Texas Senator Ted Cruz this November.Cheney, a once high-ranking Republican, has been increasingly vocal against the former president as the 2024 election inches closer. During an appearance at Duke University on Wednesday, the former congresswoman announced her intent to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. At Friday's event, she said that her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, plans to do the same.Elaborating on her endorsement for Allred, Cheney said from the stage in Austin that \"you might not agree on every policy position, but we need people who are going to serve in good faith.\"\"We need people who are honorable public servants, and in this race that is Colin Allred, so I'll be working on his behalf,\" Cheney added, according to a report from Dallas Morning News. Cruz, who has endorsed Trump for president, shot back at Cheney's comments in a statement to Dallas Morning News, calling her the \"poster child of flip-flopping.\" Cheney was one of two Republicans who served on the House Special Committee tasked with investigating the riots at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. That committee ultimately recommended the Justice Department investigate Trump's actions related to the riots.While serving on the January 6 Committee, Cheney lost her district's Republican primary in 2022 to Trump-backed candidate Harriet Hageman, who currently represents Wyoming's at-large congressional district. Cruz's team told Dallas Morning News, \"Two years ago, the voters of Wyoming overwhelmingly rejected her, just like the voters of Texas will overwhelmingly reject Colin Allred this November. But hey, misery loves company.\"Cheney has warned that the former president poses a \"danger\" to the U.S. Constitution if reelected to the White House, and her father, who served under former Republican President Georgie W. Bush, gave a similar sentiment in a statement Friday regarding his endorsement for Harris.\"In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Chloe Louise For Mailonline Published:00:24 BST, 7 September 2024 |Updated:00:41 BST, 7 September 2024 e-mail 12 shares 4 View comments Strictly Come Dancing's cast and crew are reportedly furious over the return of professional dancer Aljaž Škorjanec, as it's claimed he was involved in backstage row with a female dancer. The Slovenian dancer, 34, is set to return to the BBC show for its new series, two years after an altercation on the 2022 live tour, according to The Sun. Two years after his exit, it's reported that Aljez departed the show after an alleged 'shocking' incident with a fellow female professional dancer on the nationwide tour. The decision to bring back the star to the BBC show has reportedly raised eyebrows, especially given a string of scandals that have beset the show in recent weeks. A source told the publication: 'Has the BBC learned nothing from the past ten months? Strictly Come Dancing's cast and crew are reportedly furious over the return of professional dancer Aljaž Škorjanec The Slovenian dancer, 34, is set to return to the BBC show for its new series, two years after an altercation on the 2022 live tour (pictured with celebrity partner Sara Davies in 2021) 'Amid ongoing furore around the behaviour of its male pros, they actively recruited a dancer who left under a cloud. 'Aljaž was touted as an unproblematic, returning legend but that couldn't be further from the truth.' The source claimed the crew and cast were 'relieved' to see his departure two years ago and are now 'aghast' to see him back on the show They revealed he allegedly got 'very drunk' on a night out on tour two years ago which led him being involved in a 'very serious, pretty shocking altercation' with a female. The incident was said to have made the female dancer feel 'deeply uncomfortable'. Aljaž's scene has been reportedly discussed backstage at length since and the decision to bring him back has 'baffled' the crew. 'Execs would have to be living in a cave not to have heard the rumours', the source added. According to the publication, the BBC denied an official complaint was made over the incident, and it had been previously stated that Aljaz left of his own accord. The BBC declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline, and told The Sun that they did not recognise the claims against Aljaz. MailOnline has reached out to Aljaž's representatives for a comment. At the time, Aljaz reportedly agreed to exit the show after an alleged 'shocking' incident with a fellow female professional dancer on the nationwide tour Aljaz is married to fellow Strictly pro and It Takes Two host Janette Manrara, and sources claim that after his 2022 altercation, the crew are 'aghast' bosses have invited him back The return of the professional dancer, who is married to fellow Strictly pro and It Takes Two host Janette Manrara, is the latest drama to hit the BBC show, as several allegations of abuse from professionals have come to light. The scandal erupted when actress Amanda Abbington quit the show last year before claiming that her partner Giovanni Pernice was abusive towards her - later leaving the show. Giovanni has vehemently denied the claims. Amanda, 50, abruptly left the BBC show citing 'personal issues' and hasn't been seen on screen since, even quitting social media last month in the wake of her former dance partner's sacking. Giovanni, 33, was suspended while a BBC probe is underway over allegations made by Amanda and two other former celebrity partners. Sources previously claimed Amanda, Ranvir Singh and Laura Whitmore had an 'emotional summit' where they 'compared notes' about their time working with Giovanni on the show. Amanda quit Strictly due to 'personal reasons' before reports she had demanded footage of their rehearsals after the experience in the competition left her with PTSD. Meanwhile Ranvir complained about Giovanni to producers back in 2020, during their time on the show, while Laura said she 'cried every day' and felt 'uncomfortable' while dancing with him in 2016. The BBC are currently believed to be scouring through nine years of Strictly footage to confirm or deny claims from three celebrities. Giovanni has not returned for the show's 2024 season. Soon after, it emerged that Graziano Di Prima had been sacked for 'kicking' his partner, Love Island star Zara McDermott. Strictly bosses then announced plans to introduce chaperones during training, and the appointment of two new welfare producers, after Graziano's shock sacking from the show. Love Island star Zara broke her silence on the scandal as she wrote on Instagram on Tuesday morning that while much of her time on Strictly 'was everything I could have dreamt of' inside the training room with Graziano there were 'particular incidents which are incredibly distressing'. 'I felt it was right that I post something regarding the recent media reports,' Zara began. 'Strictly is one of the most magical shows on TV and one that I dreamt of being on since I was a little girl.' He reportedly agreed to exit the show and competition after an alleged 'shocking' incident with a fellow female professional dancer on the nationwide tour (pictured in 2019) despite the show''s controversial months, Aljaž - who was accused of upsetting show staff with 'aggressive and pompous behaviour' in 2022 - is set to return (pictured in 2019) Zara explained that she didn't report the incidents at the time as she was 'scared' of backlash. New reports then emerged claiming that Zara also suffered a leg fracture during training, and continued to dance. She picked up the nasty injury while preparing to dance and despite being in agonising pain, pushed through to compete in the dance-off. Zara is thought to have told BBC bosses of the 'rigorous' training sessions she endured while paired with Graziano on the show. However, a source close to Graziano told the publication that he encouraged her to take breaks, and she wanted to continue training despite her pain. Then an unnamed female Strictly dancer was brought into the scandal after it was reported that they screamed in their male partner's face and berated him off-camera. The Daily Mirror reported that the household name's allegations do not include physical abuse. A source said: 'The man in question felt very much victimized by the behaviour of his Strictly partner. 'He alleges that on several occasions she flew into a real fury when he couldn't get the steps right, and on one occasion screamed full in his face. They rowed every single day. 'He was left upset, struggling to sleep, and feeling isolated in the process. But even worse, he felt totally unsupported by Strictly. When he suffered the setback, it was clear he was struggling, but he felt there was no duty of care. After leaving the show, he was not contacted again, even by phone.' The source said he had been in a bad place and feared a public -backlash if he spoke out. And despite the show''s controversial months, Aljaž - who was accused of upsetting show staff with 'aggressive and pompous behaviour' in 2022 - is set to return. Aljaz, who the series before was paired with Dragon's Den star Sara Davies, revealed in 2022 that he would be leaving Strictly, with sources adding he was 'on the fence' about leaving before deciding to move onto other projects. A source told The Sun that members of the crew were left 'really upset' by 'incidents' involving Aljaz during Strictly's previous series. They added: 'He verbally lashed out at various staff members behind the scenes in what some thought was an unnecessarily aggressive manner. 'Aljaz was seen by some as arrogant and pompous too – and it left a bad taste in some of the staff's mouths. Not many people will miss him.' However a representative for Aljaz told the publication: 'Aljaz has the utmost respect for everyone working on the show and it is untrue to say he was forced out or acted in an aggressive manner at any time. 'It was Aljaz's decision to leave the show after an incredible 9 years.' Sarah James, Executive Producer of Strictly Come Dancing said at the time: 'We are so sad to be saying goodbye to Aljaž after almost a decade as a professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing. 'Since lifting the glitterball with Abbey Clancy in his debut series he has become a firm favourite with viewers across the country. 'During his nine series he has provided us with some unforgettable moments on the show through his incredible choreography, passion for dance and heart of gold. 'He will be missed by his Strictly family, both on and off the dancefloor, and we wish him only the very best as he embarks on his next chapter.' It came after sources revealed that Aljaz had made his decision to leave Strictly 'a little while ago' having pondered for some time, and is grateful to the show for allowing his 'dream become a reality'.

Senate Democrats say they're wasting precious time","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans unveiled on Friday their legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and fund the government into late March, when a new president and Congress would make the final decision on agency spending and priorities for fiscal year 2025. Republicans are also adding a hot-button immigration issue to the measure by requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, when someone registers to vote. Inclusion of the citizenship requirement is a nonstarter in the Senate, complicating prospects for the spending bill’s passage. Lawmakers are returning to Washington next week following a traditional August recess spent mostly in their home states and districts. They are not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that will fund the agencies during the next fiscal year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. “Today, House Republicans are taking a critically important step to keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election process,” Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. “Congress has a responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American citizens can decide American elections.” But in a joint statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray said avoiding a shutdown requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party. “If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans’ hands,” Schumer and Murray said. Johnson’s decision to add the proof of citizenship requirement to the spending measure comes after the House Freedom Caucus called for it in a position statement last month. The group of conservatives, banking on a win by Republican nominee Donald Trump, also urged that the measure fund the government into early next year so Republicans could get more of their priorities in legislation. Some Republican leaders had wanted to pass the final spending bills by the end of this Congress so that the new president, whether it be Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, could focus more on getting staffed and pursuing their own top priorities rather than dealing with spending disagreements. Republicans say requiring proof of citizenship would ensure American elections are only for American citizens, improving confidence in the nation’s federal election system. But opponents say the available evidence shows that noncitizen voting in federal elections is incredibly rare and such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans who don’t have the necessary documents readily available when they get a chance to register. What remains to be seen is what happens if the bill passes the House this week and the Senate declines to take it up or votes it down. The bill would fund agencies at current levels until March 28, though there’s also money to help cover additional security costs associated with Inauguration Day and $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans unveiled on Friday their legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and fund the government into late March, when a new president and Congress would make the final decision…","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/house-republican-unveil-bill-to-avoid-shutdown-senate-democrats-say-theyre-wasting-precious-time/article_e9d4d034-cc9c-55d2-8cfb-22d3f27a5009.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/5a/f5a868ea-63a4-5980-b2ed-cc52766d3430/66db93fd0f413.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C90&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:39:50","author":"Kevin Freking The Associated Press,Wire Content","authors":["Kevin Freking The Associated Press","Wire Content"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":255835162,"title":"Republican former VP Dick Cheney says he will vote for Kamala Harris","text":"WASHINGTON - Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney said Friday he will vote for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris over Republican former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. elections, following a similar statement made by his daughter Liz Cheney this week.Trump and Harris are locked in a tight race for the vote and face off in a debate next week.Some Republicans upset with Trump's control over their party and his actions have recently thrown support behind Harris, including dozens of former staffers of former Presidents George H.W.

Lemon, 58, made his plea to DailyMail.com as he walked the streets of Greenwich Village in New York City on Friday. He was predicting her endorsement would encourage younger voters to cast their ballot for Harris come November Swift, who has almost 500 million followers between her social media accounts has more recently steered clear of politics preferring instead not to intervene so as not to alienate her fan base, known as ‘Swifties’, although she did speak out in 2020. But as far as Lemon is concerned, time is of the essence and believes Swift should make her political allegiances clear once again. ‘Taylor Swift needs to step forward. She’s very influential. She can move an election,’ Lemon said. ‘If she believes in women’s reproductive rights and a women’s right to choose – and in democracy, I would say that Taylor Swift needs to come through. It would be a wasted opportunity if she does not use her platform for good,’ Lemon said. Swift has previously criticized the GOP nominee and vowed to ‘vote [him] out’ ahead of the 2020 election after being left ‘completely blindsided’ by his 2016 victory. Ahead of Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton, Swift kept quiet on her political leanings leading some to suspect she was actually a secret Republican. But during the 2018 midterms, she voiced strong support for Tennessee Democrats including Senate candidate Phil Bredesen and House candidate Jim Cooper. She explained in an Instagram post: ‘In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. ‘I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.’ In 2020, the Blank Space singer came out in full support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. ‘I will proudly vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in this year’s presidential election,’ she said. ‘Under their leadership, I believe America has a chance to start the healing process it so desperately needs,’ she said in an interview with V Magazine ahead of the election.’ She also tagged Trump in an X post blasting him: ‘After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’??? We will vote you out in November.’ In her documentary, Miss Americana, which came out in 2020, Swift addressed her decision to speak publicly about politics further saying: ‘I need to be on the right side of history.’ Swift has been a close ally of the LGBTQ community. She also slammed the United States Supreme Court after it overturned Roe v Wade ending the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022. The Swifties have mobilized to throw their support behind Vice President Kamala Harris with the ‘@Swifties4Kamala’ X account already attracting 76,000 followers. During last month’s Democratic National Committee convention in Chicago, the event even paid homage to Swift with stations where DNC attendees could make friendship bracelets – which are traded by Swifties at concerts and fan meet-ups. The New York Times reported earlier this year that Joe Biden’s campaign had been actively seeking Swift’s endorsement. Trump has previously questioned whether Swift is ‘legitimately liberal’ or if it’s all an act. The former president discussed the megastar in an interview with Variety co-Editor-in-Chief Ramin Setoodeh for his book Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass which was released in June. ‘She is liberal, or is that just an act?’ Trump asked. ‘She’s legitimately liberal? It’s not an act?’ He added: ‘It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.’ Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 following a short and disastrous run as a morning show host. His sudden downfall came months after he had said then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was past her prime. CNN chairman and CEO at the time Chris Licht announced that they had ‘parted ways.’ Lemon characterized it as a firing and said it was surprise to him. ‘After 17 years at CNN I would have thought someone in management would have the decency to tell me directly,’ Lemon said. CNN offered no public explanation for Lemon’s dismissal. During the discussion which ultimately led to his departure alongside co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins about the ages of politicians, he said that Haley was not ‘in her prime.’ A woman, he said, was considered in her prime ‘in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s.’ Harlow challenged Lemon, trying to clarify what he was referencing: ‘I think we need to qualify. Are you talking about prime for childbearing or are you talking about prime for being president?’ ‘Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just saying what the facts are,’ Lemon responded.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOusted CNN anchor Don Lemon is urging pop superstar Taylor Swift to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, urgently requests action from Taylor Swift before the election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/don-lemon-former-cnn-anchor-urgently-requests-action-from-taylor-swift-before-the-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Ousted-CNN-anchor-Don-Lemon-issues-urgent.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:36:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.302},{"id":255834344,"title":"Dick Cheney says he’s voting for Kamala Harris, and Trump ‘can never be trusted with power again’","text":"(CNN) — Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Friday that he will vote for Democrat Kamala Harris over fellow Republican Donald Trump in the November election, warning that the former president “can never be trusted with power again.” “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a statement. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.” “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he concluded. Cheney’s daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, first revealed earlier in the day that her father would be voting for the Democratic ticket during remarks at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas. The former Republican congresswoman said Wednesday that she would be voting for Harris, citing “the danger that Donald Trump poses.” In her remarks Friday, Cheney unleashed a torrent of criticism against the Republican presidential ticket, calling Trump “a depraved human being” and labeling him and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, “misogynistic pigs.” “Every Republican, anybody who’s contemplating casting a vote for that ticket, you know, really needs to think about what they are enabling, what they’re embracing and the danger of electing people who will only honor election results if they agree with the outcome, and who are willing to set aside the Constitution,” she said in Austin. “And you know in the case of Donald Trump, promote, provoke, exploit violence in order to seize power.” The former congresswoman, who previously told CNN was committed to doing what was necessary to stop Trump from returning to the White House, said Friday that she expected to campaign against the former president in battleground states this fall. And she suggested that her father shared her views about Trump. “If you think about the moment that we’re in and you think about how serious this moment is, you know, my dad believes – and he said publicly – that there’s never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,” she said. Dick Cheney’s support for Harris represents a stunning move for the staunch conservative who was vice president to George W. Bush and a longtime congressman from Wyoming who held several leadership roles in the House Republican Caucus. The former vice president was critical of his party and Trump in the wake of the January 6 attack. In campaign ads for his daughter’s 2022 reelection effort, he called Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward.” “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” Dick Cheney said of the former president in the ad. His daughter’s outspokenness against Trump and the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election – including her vote to impeach him led to her losing her leadership position as the No. 3 House Republican. The GOP caucus ousted her as conference chair in May 2021 and replaced her with New York’s Elise Stefanik, a top Trump defender, several months after the January 6 attack. Liz Cheney went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot and ultimately lost her seat in Congress to a Trump-backed Republican primary challenger. She argued Friday that Trump and Vance were “doing everything they can to drive Reagan Republicans away” and that the duo “certainly do not reflect the importance of that Reagan philosophy of peace through strength and a strong national defense.” Cheney said she watched parts of the Republican National Convention in July and took away that “it isn’t just that the party is trying to whitewash what Donald Trump did … the party is embracing it.” Speaking about her decision to support Harris, Cheney said while she has “serious policy disagreements on a whole range of issues,” she feels that “those of us who believe in the defense of our democracy, in the defense of our Constitution, and the survival of our republic have a duty in this election cycle to come together to put those things above politics.” In addition to backing Harris, Cheney also endorsed Democratic Rep. Colin Allred’s effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.","summary":"“In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a statement.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/09/06/dick-cheney-says-hes-voting-for-harris-in-november-and-trump-can-never-be-trusted-with-power-again/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Liz_Cheney_says_Dick_Cheney_is_voting_for_Kamala_Harris1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:26:52","author":"Cnn Com Wire Service","authors":["Cnn Com Wire Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":255834364,"title":"With voters weary of crime, Harris and Trump both tout law enforcement support","text":"On a stage festooned with American flags and Fraternal Order of Police banners in North Carolina on Friday, former President Trump accepted the backing of the country's largest police union. National Fraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes said the \"enthusiastic endorsement\" reflected the \"overwhelming collective will\" of the group's more than 375,000 members nationally. \"We stand with you, and we have your back,\" Yoes said, promising the group's members would \"make the case\" for Trump to Americans across the nation over the next two months. \"This is a big endorsement for me,\" Trump said. \"Boy, that's a lot of protection.\" Prior to Trump's event, the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris held a call with her own law enforcement supporters. First to speak was former U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who was at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters attacked the building on Jan. 6, 2021. Dunn said Trump's promised support for law enforcement was nothing but a play for votes — and a lie. \"He's going to tell my fellow officers that he's their ally, he's their friend, and he's [the] candidate of law and order,\" Dunn said. \"After what I experienced on Jan. 6, I can assure you that he is not.\" Dunn said he knows many officers who are \"appalled by the FOP even entertaining endorsing\" Trump, given his felony convictions, his actions on Jan. 6 and his recent promise to pardon the insurrectionists who attacked police officers that day. \"He abandoned us,\" Dunn said. \"Law and order and the democracy I vowed to protect — he abandoned that.\" With two months until the election, both the Trump and Harris campaigns are trotting out their law enforcement backers as a means of attracting voters in a race in which crime — along with the economy and immigration — has become a major issue. Despite downward trends in many crime categories nationally, voters are nonetheless weary of retail crime, drug offenses and violence, and looking for solutions. A recent UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, co-sponsored by The Times, found that a majority of voters in liberal California support stiffer penalties for crimes involving theft and fentanyl. Both Trump and Harris have said they take such issues seriously and would bring solutions as president, while their opponent would only exacerbate the problems. Trump has cast Harris, a former prosecutor and California attorney general, as soft on crime and anti-police, including by pointing to persistent crime issues in cities like San Francisco, where she once served as district attorney. Trump has advocated for more aggressive policing, and for less federal oversight and more military equipment for local police departments. Harris has cast Trump, a felon, as a fraud who solicits law enforcement support when it is convenient for votes, but is otherwise hostile toward law enforcement — especially when they've been investigating him. She has advocated for responsive but constitutional policing and for stronger federal oversight and less military equipment for local police departments, and has touted the Biden administration's record funding for law enforcement through COVID-19 relief funds. Trump's event Friday was not his first with law enforcement, but it was a major one, as the police union has members all across the country — including some 17,000 members in California. The group does not represent the biggest law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file LAPD officers, said it is not weighing in on the national race and is instead focused on ousting progressive L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gascón. After being introduced by Yoes, Trump spoke for nearly an hour. He said law enforcement officers face \"more danger and threat than ever before,\" and that \"we have to give back the power and respect that they deserve.\" He said crime was the No. 1 issue that people ask him about, and that he would bring back \"stop-and-frisk\" and \"broken windows policing\" to bring it to an end. He also repeated many of his stump speech lies and grievances — some aimed at Harris, many to applause from the gathered law enforcement officers. He claimed violent and other crime is \"through the roof,\" when data show the opposite is true in many parts of the country. He falsely alleged Harris made it so that \"you can steal as much as you want up to $950\" in San Francisco and \"nothing happens to you, no matter what the hell you do.\" He mocked the 2022 attack on Rep. Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, at their home in San Francisco, to laughter in the crowd. The event followed a Trump campaign call where campaign officials and law enforcement officials in swing states praised Trump's record, blamed Harris for crime problems in California and accused her of being \"pro-crime\" and \"coddling criminals.\" The Harris campaign this week has also touted law enforcement support, including by releasing an endorsement letter from more than 100 former and current law enforcement officers and leaders. The letter cited a spike in homicides during Trump's presidency and a sharp decline during the Biden administration. It described Harris as someone who has \"spent her career enforcing our laws,\" and Trump as someone \"who has been convicted of breaking them.\" On the call with Dunn, Sheriff Clarence Birkhead of Durham County, N.C., said there that Trump tries \"to portray himself as a friend of law enforcement, but we know it's not true.\" He said Trump would use federal law enforcement to go after his political enemies instead of investing resources in local law enforcement, and use plans set out in the conservative Project 2025 to withhold even more — \"making it nearly impossible for us to keep our communities safe from violence.\" He said Harris, by contrast, \"has spent her entire career fighting for people and standing with local law enforcement like me,\" which is why officers like those who signed the letter are \"lining up\" to support her. Sheriff Javier Salazar, of Bexar County, Texas, said he was confused by the Fraternal Order of Police endorsement of Trump, whom he called \"a person that wouldn't qualify to be a law enforcement officer,\" given his felonies. Salazar said Trump \"uses cops as nothing more than a photo opp, or a television prop,\" and that he \"purports to support law enforcement until we get in his way — until we stand in the way of him doing exactly what he wants to do. He proved it on Jan. 6.\" Dunn said Trump's only allegiance is to himself. \"The truth is that he doesn't care that he put my life and the lives of my fellow Capitol Police officers in danger on Jan. 6,\" Dunn said.","summary":"Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump touted support from law enforcement this week as crime remains a prominent issue in the presidential race.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-09-06/with-voters-weary-of-crime-harris-and-trump-both-tout-law-enforcement-support","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ea3b67/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3262x1713+0+233/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F31%2Fa7%2F553d16d0409791b428214f24983f%2Fap24250752786655.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:20:23","author":"Kevin Rector","authors":["Kevin Rector"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":255835578,"title":"Strictly pros reveal their predictions for scandal-plagued programme's future as bookies reveal new odds on show being axed","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Sep 7th 2024 1AM 15°C 4AM 14°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Lee Carsley shockingly admits he will NOT sing the national anthem when he takes charge of England against Ireland in Dublin... with calls for him to be SACKED coming before his first team takes the field Another sticky situation for Meghan Markle's American Riviera Orchard business as its swirly logo gets a thumbs down from trademark chiefs in latest blow for the duchess's beleaguered brand Bar worker reveals 'reason' Shia LaBeouf squared up to group of drinkers in Edinburgh Every university in Britain ranked from best to worst: Our definitive interactive guide scores all 129 on every subject, quality of student life and graduates' earning potential.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline Published:00:05 BST, 7 September 2024 |Updated:00:18 BST, 7 September 2024 e-mail 16 shares View comments The Strictly Come Dancing professionals have voiced their predictions for the show after it was plunged into crisis. In recent months, the dancing competition has been hit by a wave of scandals, with Giovanni Pernice being probed after his celebrity partner Amanda Abbington accused him of abusive behaviour, while Graziano Di Prima was sacked over reports he verbally and physically abused Zara McDermott during rehearsals. Bookmakers have since revealed new odds on the show being scrapped - saying the fate of the show hangs on this year's series. Yet with the new series set to air and in honour of it being the show's 20th anniversary, this year's professionals have revealed what they think the show will be like in 20 years. Aljaž Škorjanec, who returned to the show this series after a two-year hiatus, has grand plans for the programme, predicting technology will overhaul the format. The Strictly pros have revealed their predictions for scandal plague's programme's future as bookies reveal new odds on show being axed (pictured: Aljaz Skorjanec) Amy Dowden said: 'I think it will always keep its element of Ballroom and that's the beauty of this show, and what makes it so iconic but it will continue to develop' He shared: 'I can’t wait for the show to start using things like holograms and AI. It’ll be tricky to know what’s real and what’s not, but that might be the next technical step.' Yet he warned against making too many changes, adding: 'I think what makes Strictly so successful is that it’s stuck to its original format watching dances that people love and then learn to love themselves. 'Let’s be honest, most people watching Strictly haven’t been in a dance class or studio themselves, but even watching it feels the same. 'That’s why people get more invested each year. So, keep the format exactly the same, but just add even more to the production.' Amy Dowden - who is also returning after taking a year off while she battled breast cancer - shared: 'I think it's quite exciting to see how much it’s evolved. The costumes, the set, the dance, the dancers, the music and also the show keeps evolving by adding couple’s choice, Argentine Tango, Charleston. 'I think it will always keep its element of Ballroom and that's the beauty of this show, and what makes it so iconic but it will continue to develop. I think it’ll still be the nation's favourite show.' Carlos Gu brushed off any rumours of the series being axed as he predicted: 'I genuinely think the show will go on for as long as possible. 'Every year, we have different new, fresh celebrities. It’s always a new experience for people who watch the show, so you never find it cliché and it never feels like, \"Oh, I’ve seen this before.\" 'Every year is a new experience for us Professional Dancers as well as for the celebrities.' Carlos Gu brushed off any rumours of the series being axed as he predicted: 'I genuinely think the show will go on for as long as possible' He was echoed by Dianne Buswell who shared: 'I honestly think it is still the best show and will continue to be the best show on TV for many years to come' Gorka Marquez wasn't sure when he was asked about the future but said: 'I don't know but I do hope I am still here in 20 years' time. I will be 53 but hopefully I’ll still be here' Johannes Radebe predicted things will only get better, saying: 'The show has evolved so much since it started' Jowita Przystal reasoned that the nature of the show makes it hard to change, explaining: 'I never thought we could get better and better each year' He was echoed by Dianne Buswell who shared: 'I honestly think it is still the best show and will continue to be the best show on TV for many years to come. 'I hope in 20 years time they’ll look back at stuff I've done with my partners and think that was cool. I hope that they look back with fond memories just as we look back on Strictly series one so fondly.' Gorka Marquez wasn't sure when he was asked about the future but said: 'I don't know but I do hope I am still here in 20 years' time. I will be 53 but hopefully I’ll still be here.' Johannes Radebe predicted things will only get better, saying: 'The show has evolved so much since it started. But now, every year, the show keeps topping itself. How we do that, I don't know. 'Honestly, at the end of every series, I think, \"This was the best,\" and then the next year comes, and I think, \"No, this is the best one.\" So, in 20 years, who knows?' Jowita Przystal reasoned that the nature of the show makes it hard to change, explaining: 'I never thought we could get better and better each year because we use the same foundation of ballroom dancing. 'We can’t change the rules; we can’t change the steps. But if you watch Strictly, year by year, it’s just getting better and better.' Karen Haeur's view differed, as she pointed out: 'The show has been evolving over the past few years. We get different dancers, different choreographers' Kai Widdrington said: 'I think it's going to be bigger and better, probably with more glitter, and filled with weird and wonderful things' Katya Jones added: 'I imagine that there'll be more glitter and more glamour and more incredible dancing' Lauren Oakley praised the traditional format, sharing: 'The beauty of Strictly is that we know what we’re getting. It’s always the same, and that’s comforting' Karen Haeur's view differed, as she pointed out: 'The show has been evolving over the past few years. We get different dancers, different choreographers. The public is so used to what we offer. 'The best thing about Strictly is that it keeps its magic. It doesn’t change too much, which is nice people like that. It's like the warm blanket you had growing up. I think that will always stay. 'Strictly is the beating heart of television; it keeps everyone coming back. It ’s a nice feeling, and I think that’s what it’ll continue to do. It’ll keep bringing joy, continue to bring exciting new ideas, but it will always stay the same in essence. 'There’s a tradition we’ve never lost, and I think that will always remain. Of course, everything else changes as the world changes, and we keep up with the times, but I don’t think it needs to change very much because it’s already a beautiful show.' Kai Widdrington said: 'I think it's going to be bigger and better, probably with more glitter, and filled with weird and wonderful things.' Katya Jones added: 'I imagine that there'll be more glitter and more glamour and more incredible dancing. 'We're going to keep bringing entertainment to the nation and give everybody an opportunity to gather around the TV in their living rooms, all of the generations together, because that's what would do best.' Lauren Oakley praised the traditional format, sharing: 'The beauty of Strictly is that we know what we’re getting. It’s always the same, and that’s comforting. You know what you’re getting on a Saturday night, but it gets bigger and better every year. 'It’s always about watching someone fall in love with dance and have their life transformed, and I think that’s what people love about it. Even in 20 years, I hope it stays the same, with new music and new fashions.' Luba Mushtuk had few words, stating: 'I think there will be more sparkles, more glamour and more wonderful people coming into the show. Michelle Tsiakkas mused: 'I’ve got great hopes for the show because, honestly, I just feel like it keeps getting better and better' Nadiya Bychkova revealed she hoped her seven-year-old daughter, Mila would be able to follow in her footsteps in 20 years time Luba Mushtuk had few words, stating: 'I think there will be more sparkles, more glamour and more wonderful people coming into the show.' Michelle Tsiakkas mused: 'I’ve got great hopes for the show because, honestly, I just feel like it keeps getting better and better. 'Every year, we keep topping what we did the previous year. And that’s obviously thanks to the amazing team we have: the choreographers, people behind the scenes, cameras, costumes, dancers just everybody. 'I think we’re all at the top of our game, which makes it such an amazing show. So, I’m quite certain that the show will just keep getting better and better every year.' Nadiya Bychkova revealed she hoped her seven-year-old daughter, Mila would be able to follow in her footsteps in 20 years time. She shared: 'I think the show is just growing in so many ways. With the way our lives and industry are developing, it's more accessible to more people. We can probably reach an even bigger audience because of social media. 'I think all of us are working on ourselves, and people are working to make sure the whole show is better and really accessible to anyone. So, I think it will just keep on going , keep on growing. 'Who knows, maybe in 20 years, my daughter will be on the show dancing with another celeb! Maybe the next generation will take over.' Nancy Xu predicted big change, saying: 'It might be completely different from what we’re doing now. The show is based on Latin and Ballroom dance at the moment' Neil Jones had high ambitions, saying: 'I can't imagine myself still dancing on the show in 20 years' time. That would make me 62, you never know! Maybe I’ll be a judge by then' Nikita Kuzmin mused: 'I hope it always preserves its core essence and stays true to what it means to people. The show is joyful, it’s family. It’s the people’s show' Vito Coppola did not provide an answer to the question Nancy Xu predicted big change, saying: 'It might be completely different from what we’re doing now. The show is based on Latin and Ballroom dance at the moment. 'This is my sixth year, and when I look back at what I’ve seen in terms of video aspects, group dances, and wardrobe, everything has gone up a level and taken different directions. 'Who knows what the future holds, but I’m very excited.' Neil Jones had high ambitions, saying: 'I honestly think it's still going to be here. It's going to keep growing and developing. 'I can't imagine myself still dancing on the show in 20 years' time, as much as I would love to, I don't know if my body will handle that. That would make me 62, you never know! 'Maybe I’ll be a judge by then....' Nikita Kuzmin mused: 'I hope it always preserves its core essence and stays true to what it means to people. The show is joyful, it’s family. It’s the people’s show. 'In my mind, Strictly is like a warm blanket, or a comforting hug. I hope it remains that way for everyone. Our job is to distract people or cheer them up I think and I hope that feeling will still be there in 20 years.' Vito Coppola did not provide an answer to the question. In recent months, the dancing competition has been hit by a wave of scandals , with Giovanni Pernice being probed after his partner Amanda Abbington accused him of abusive behaviour Graziano Di Prima was sacked over reports he verbally and physically abused Zara McDermott during rehearsals The remarks come as Betfred released fresh odds on the show's future. Analysis shows odds of Strictly being axed entirely after this year is 33.3 percent probability, whereas, odds for Strictly to be cancelled next year and for the show to take a break is 55.6 percent probability. Speaking on behalf of Betfred, Showbiz Specialist Kayley Cornelius said: 'This year’s series of Strictly Come Dancing will be crucial in determining the show’s future. 'After a year of ongoing scandals, the BBC will undoubtedly be feeling the pressure to ensure everything runs smoothly, as the series may not survive another significant blow. 'While the current odds of 4/2 suggest it's unlikely that Strictly will be fully axed, the odds of the show taking a break next year are a more convincing 4/5. 'These odds could shorten in the coming weeks as more details emerge regarding the investigation into former pro-dancer Giovanni Pernice’s case.' Strictly's launch show airs Saturday 14 September at 7.20pm on BBC One and iPlayer.

Kennedy Jr. has won his judicial appeal, resulting in the North Carolina State Board of Elections needing to remove his name from ballots, including those already printed. The board, in a Friday evening release, said it would appeal the North Carolina Supreme Court decision. Pending that decision, the board said it would work through the weekend to recode the 2,348 different ballot styles statewide for the 2024 general election. Absentee by mail ballots were statutorily scheduled to be mailed out on Friday by the 100 county boards of elections. More than 2.9 million ballots had already been printed, the release said. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director for the board, asked counties to try and have ballots into the mail by Sept. 21. None are to be mailed, she instructed, until a date is determined for all counties, the release said. More than 136,300 voters have requested absentee by mail ballots. That includes about 12,700 military and overseas voters. Kennedy was to be on the ballot as representative of the We The People Party. The Democratic Party, on July 26, filed the second of what so far is six lawsuits over 43 days to reverse the state board’s decision to allow him onto the ballot. On Aug. 23, Kennedy suspended his campaign and began to request his name be taken off ballots in the battleground states. He subsequently endorsed Republican former President Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. North Carolina is among the seven battleground states representing 93 electoral college votes. Pennsylvania has 19, North Carolina and Georgia 16 each, Michigan 15, Arizona 11, Wisconsin 10 and Nevada six.","summary":"(The Center Square) – Robert F.

Now, it’s got a new angle: paying Americans to do the work. This week’s indictment of two Russian state media employees on charges that they paid a Tennessee company to create pro-Russian content has renewed concerns about foreign meddling in the November election and revealed the Kremlin’s latest tactic in a growing information war. If the allegations prove correct, they represent a significant escalation, analysts say, and likely capture only a small piece of a larger Russian effort to sway the election. “We have seen the smoke for years. Now, here’s the fire,” said Jim Ludes, a former national defense analyst who now leads the Pell Center for International Relations at Salve Regina University. “I don’t wonder if they’re doing more of this. I have no doubt.” According to prosecutors, the two employees of RT, a Russian outlet formerly known as Russia Today, funneled $10 million to the U.S. media company, which then paid several popular right-wing influencers for their content — in one case $400,000 a month. Two of those influencers said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. Intelligence officials and private analysts say Russia’s disinformation campaigns are designed to cut off American assistance to Ukraine, clearing the way for a rapid Russian victory after more than two years of bitter conflict. In the presidential race, Russia supports Donald Trump as the candidate perceived as the least supportive of Ukraine, intelligence officials say. Trump has openly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized NATO. On Thursday, Putin wryly claimed he was pulling for Vice President Kamala Harris. During a briefing with reporters on Friday, intelligence officials noted that Putin’s public comments often do not reflect Russia’s actual intentions. The RT campaign was part of Moscow’s efforts “to influence voter preferences in favor of the former president” and hinder Harris’ chances, said an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity under rules set by the agency. A secondary goal of Russian disinformation, officials have said, is to increase political polarization and distrust as a way of eroding American confidence in democracy. This summer, intelligence officials warned that Russia was using unwitting Americans to spread its propaganda by adapting it to fit existing social debates within the U.S. Instead of creating new conflicts, Russia has found success by identifying and exaggerating existing divides, tailoring disinformation accordingly. When successful, Russia can get Americans to spread its talking points for free, without them even knowing their source. When an Ohio train derailment caused massive environmental damage last year, Russian voices tried to steer the debate with anti-government posts that were quickly reposted by Americans. Some U.S. websites picked up the Russian propaganda and reposted it without attribution. This year, Russian state media and networks of fake accounts began to amplify claims about immigration on platforms used by Americans. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Russian state media claimed without evidence that the virus was the product of American bioweapons experiments and that the U.S. maintained biological laboratories in Ukraine. English-language posts soon started showing up on American social media sites. Four years later, the conspiracy theory still reverberates on far-right message boards. “What if Covid was created in a Ukraine biolab, and the War has been to keep that a secret?” a poster wrote last week on the social platform X. The company hired by RT was identified as Tenet Media by two of the right-wing content creators it paid — Tim Pool and Benny Johnson. Both men said on social media Wednesday that they had no knowledge of Tenet’s relationship with RT and that if the allegations are true, they are victims. Pool posted that no one told him what to say in his podcast and condemned Russia: “Putin is a scumbag.” Pool has a long history, however, of espousing pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian views as well as conspiracy theories about Democrats and American democracy. On one podcast, he said “criminal elements” within the U.S. government were directing the war against Russia and that Ukraine was the real enemy. “Ukraine is our enemy, being funded by the Democrats,” Pool said. “Ukraine is the greatest threat to this nation and to the world. We should rescind all funding and financing, pull out all military support, and we should apologize to Russia.” Trump said on Truth Social that the case amounted to “election interference” by federal prosecutors, who he said were “resurrecting the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and trying to say that Russia is trying to help me, which is absolutely FALSE.” His comments referred to concerns about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, when groups linked to the Kremlin used social media networks and paid ads on Facebook and other platforms to support Trump. Russia also sought to help Trump in the 2020 election. China and Iran have mounted their own campaigns to use social media to shape American views. Iran covertly supported protests over the war in Gaza and was recently accused of trying to hack into the campaign systems of both Trump and Harris. Russia, however, remains the chief threat, intelligence officials say. Russian officials have repeatedly bragged about their ability to shape American views. RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, who has been sanctioned over her ties to the Russian government, detailed how Moscow tries to hide its fingerprints from U.S. intelligence. “We create many sources of information that are not tied to us,” Simonyan said recently on a Russian talk show. “While the CIA tries to figure out that they’re tied to us, they already have an enormous audience. This is how we chase each other. It’s actually fun.” AP writer Alan Suderman contributed from Richmond, Virginia.","summary":"The company hired by RT was identified as Tenet Media by two of the right-wing content creators it paid — Tim Pool and Benny Johnson.

Congress must address the negative impact that pharmacy benefit managers are having on patients’ access to prescription drugs. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission began investigating PBMs and their impact on patient access in 2022 and just released an interim report detailing its findings. Unsurprisingly, that report revealed a range of profit-driven, anti-competitive practices that PBMs use to wield enormous power over patients and smaller, independent, community-based pharmacies. That includes restricting patients from accessing lower-cost medications and steering patients away from local pharmacies and toward larger PBM-affiliated chain pharmacies. That exposes patients to being overcharged for prescriptions and is forcing smaller drugstores out of business for good, irreparably harming our communities, particularly in rural parts of the state. The FTC’s actions to hold PBMs accountable highlight the dire need for Congress to act swiftly and pass PBM reform immediately. I hope Californians can count on our congressional delegation to ensure that happens. Austin Wang Owner, McKee Pharmacy San Jose People are best served by helping themselves Re: “Why we shouldn’t demean Trump’s supporters” (Page A7, Sept. 4). Nicholas Kristof describes a woman who turned to addiction and became homeless with extended family members who ended up similarly devastated from the exodus of good-paying jobs to the outside. Instead of sitting on the couch becoming brain dead from watching “The Simpsons” and getting addicted to drugs, they should have gone back to school to learn a trade or a profession where there were job openings. We should be there to help these people who are angry and feeling hopeless with their poor livelihoods because factories closed down; I’m willing to pay more taxes for our government to help them. But they also need to help themselves by not blaming everybody else around them for their misery. Go to school for a trade or a profession, move to where the jobs are and ask the government for assistance. Guy Vigier San Jose Harris’ tax plans are sensible and fair Re: “Harris’ economic plans show that she’s unfit” (Page A6, Sept. 5). Brian Kennedy argues that Kamala Harris’ tax plans make her unfit to govern — perhaps, but only for the wealthiest. Corporations got their rate cut to 21% in 2017, and to no one’s surprise, the gains went to the top 10% of earners rather than reinvestment in labor and productivity. Then there is the scam he wants to preserve that is the step-up tax basis — wealthy individuals never pay taxes on their lifetime gains, and their heirs get to reset the gains to market value at the time of death. Explain to me why regular taxpayers should subsidize generational wealth for the very rich. For too long corporations and wealthy individuals have gamed the system. Harris’ tax plans are sensible and fair. J Higgins Sunnyvale Law of the jungle is bad public policy Re: “Freedom too steep a cost for equity” (Page A6, Sept. 5). In response to Pete Campbell, should people be free to take advantage of the less fortunate while the government stands by and does nothing? Citizens United makes billionaires free to buy legislation. Is this a good thing? If the government does not take from one and give to another, we have might makes right and nothing for the common good. The ultimate freedom is anarchy and the jungle, so actually less freedom can bring joy to someone other than the top predator. William Gascoyne San Jose Time for us to act on gun control is now Re: “Student, 14, fatally shoots 4 at school prior to surrender” (Page A4, Sept. 5). The tragic shooting that occurred at Apalachee High School in Winder, Ga., where a 14-year-old student decided to take the lives of four innocent individuals, gives us a reminder of the urgent need to address gun violence in the United States. This heartbreaking event underscores the vulnerability of our schools and the need for gun control measures. As a community, we must advocate and call for stricter background checks, responsible gun ownership and better mental health support. The main priority is to provide safety for our children, and it is crucial we take steps to prevent any more tragedies. We cannot afford to wait for another to strike to prod us into action. We need our lawmakers to prioritize the safety of our children and to implement policies to protect our community from gun violence. Kyle Dang San Jose Why aren’t Israel critics condemning Hamas?

Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will face off for the first time on Tuesday in Philadelphia, in a debate moderated by ABC News. But in a Friday press conference, Trump said ABC is \"very hostile territory\" for him, implying it will favor Harris because of her relationship with a senior executive. \"I’m going into very hostile territory shortly on a debate with ABC, George Slopodopoulos [sic] and that group. And ABC, I think, is the worst of everybody. I think they’re the worst, they’re the nastiest. They’re as bad as you can be,\" he said. \"They’re worse than NBC, which is saying a lot.\" TRUMP, HARRIS CAMPAIGNS CLASH OVER DEBATE RULES: ‘WE SAID NO CHANGES’ Trump is suing ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for defamation after the host incorrectly said several times on air that the former president was \"found liable for rape\" during a March 10 interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. On Friday, Trump also slammed other aspects of the network before the debate, saying \"the reason I’m doing it is because that’s the only one that [Kamala] would do it with, because her best friend is the head of ABC or ABC News, and her husband’s best friend is married to that one.\" Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Harris' \"extraordinary friends,\" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s. Trump also noted, \"Donna Brazile is there.

CNN announced in a statement soon after the email became public that Brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it days after the controversy over Brazile tipping off the Clinton campaign initially broke. Trump said even though he thinks the network will aid Harris, he will still outperform her at the debate.

The former president's team has motioned to dismiss the guilty verdict entirely after justices found that presidents are immune from facing criminal charges for actions they took within their official duties.Merchan wrote on Friday that if Trump's motion to dismiss is denied on November 12, \"the law requires the imposition of sentencing following a guilty verdict without unreasonable delay.\"\"The public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion,\" the judge continued, highlighting the rising distrust in America's court systems in recent years.In the same vein, Merchan added that \"if one is necessary, the Defendant has the right to a sentencing hearing that respects and protects his constitutional rights.\"Trump reacted to Merchan's decision in a post to his Truth Social account Friday afternoon, writing, \"The Manhattan D.A. Witch Hunt has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was NO CASE, I DID NOTHING WRONG!\" The former pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts against him in the case and has repeatedly accused Manhattan prosecutors of attempting to interfere with his reelection campaign.\"It is a political attack against me by Comrade Kamala Harris and other Radical Left Opponents for purposes of Election Interference, and is a case that should have never been brought,\" Trump wrote in his post. \"Nothing like this has ever happened in the United States of America – IT IS STRICTLY THIRD WORLD, BANANA REPUBLIC 'STUFF.'\"The former president noted, however, that he \"greatly\" appreciated the words \"if necessary\" being used by Merchan in the decision when discussing the sentencing date.\"I greatly appreciate the words 'if necessary' being utilized in the Decision, because there should be no 'if necessary,'\" Trump wrote to Truth Social. \"This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country.\"Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in May in connection to a $130,000 payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 campaign.

He also opined on the nature of September, saying it is usually a rough time for the market. \"This is just a rather unforgiving moment until stocks go low enough to attract real buyers, not traders, and we get close to the end of September,\" he said. \"Until then, you can try your hand at being nimble on any rip up and do some selling.

Oracle will report after the market close that day, and Cramer said the company has done well to incorporate artificial intelligence into its products. He said positive earnings from Oracle and the new Apple product together could \"staunch the tech blood flow,\" but noted that the Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Alphabet also begins that day. GameStop will report on Tuesday, and Cramer said there is usually hype in the runup to its earnings but the company needs to show a long-lasting business plan or the quarter will \"land with a thud.\" He also noted that Vice President Kamala Harris will debate former President Donald Trump on Tuesday night. Cramer said he is not sure how much of a role the economy will play in the debate, but doubts that anything specifically market moving will come out of the event. On Wednesday, the Labor Department will release August's consumer price index, an important inflation metric. According to Cramer, as long as inflation stays consistent or decreases, the Federal Reserve has \"plenty of leeway\" to cut rates and prevent the recession that many investors fear. Thursday brings earnings from Signet Jewelers, Kroger and Adobe. Cramer said the diamond retailer was posting solid quarters until the last one, suggesting that the stock is relatively inexpensive but \"not for the squeamish.\" Kroger will likely continue to discuss its ongoing effort to merge with Albertsons, which has been hampered by the Federal Trade Commission, he said.

Pritzker's future? Or maybe a Cabinet position?","text":"“It seems crazy, but it’s true that when I serve out the end of this second term, I will be the longest-serving Democratic governor in the history of Illinois,” Gov. JB Pritzker said last month during the Democratic National Convention. I looked it up and it’s true. Pat Quinn served about six years as governor, replacing Rod Blagojevich, who also did six years before doing time in prison. Dan Walker served four years before he also went to prison. Otto Kerner left before the end of his second term to become a federal judge, then went to prison. Sam Shapiro filled out the remainder of that term. Adlai Stevenson did one term and then ran for president twice. Henry Horner died before the end of his second term, which John Stelle completed. Edward Dunne, John Peter Altgeld and Joel Matteson were all one-termers. Augustus French served seven years because of a change in the new state constitution. The five Democrats before that served one term or less. The state’s earliest governors were members of the Democratic-Republican or Republican-Democratic parties. None served more than four years. What people wanted to know last month, though, was whether Pritzker wants to try for a third term in two years. Unemployment is on agenda I’m told that one priority for a potential third term could be finally addressing why Illinois has historically lagged the nation in employment. The state’s unemployment rate in July was 5.2%, which is widely considered to be “full employment” but was still almost a point higher than the national average. And that’s consistent with history. Pritzker in a recent interview with me pointed to the state’s relatively high labor force participation rate as a reason, but our participation rate really isn’t that much different than lots of other states that have lower unemployment rates. The governor talked about a third term during a state delegates’ convention breakfast, but cautioned his audience that his wife, MK, was his “term limit,” explaining that if people want him to run again they’ll first have to convince her. MK grew up in a political household. Her father was chief of staff to South Dakota Gov. Richard Kneip and then ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. She was a U.S. Senate staffer in D.C. when she met the future governor. This stuff is in her blood. Mrs. Pritzker has kept a fairly low profile the past six years, fiercely guarding her family’s privacy, particularly during the pandemic. She’s probably best known for throwing huge, swanky parties (including convention week’s Salt Shed soiree featuring John Legend) and for finishing the task of decorating the governor’s mansion and publishing a book about the official residence. But she made a rare appearance at a bill-signing event this summer to talk about her involvement with incarcerated women. The bill her spouse signed into law provides free identification cards for newly released inmates. Mrs. Pritzker took up the cause of incarcerated women at the beginning of the Pritzker administration. MK helped set up an ID pilot program at Logan Correctional Center back in 2020 and told reporters at the event that she’d visited women’s prisons more than a dozen times since Gov. Pritzker was sworn in. She said her focus since her first prison visit in January 2019 “has been on ensuring incarcerated Illinoisans are treated with respect and dignity, and that they are given a real opportunity to rehabilitate and return to post-incarceration life with a chance at avoiding recidivism and making positive change.” There are no current signs that Mrs. Pritzker is ready to move on to private life. And her spouse clearly appears to be enjoying his current job, regardless of what just happened to his national ambitions with Vice President Kamala Harris’ elevation to presidential nominee. So, does MK want to move back to Washington, D.C., if Harris wins and if Pritzker is offered a Cabinet position? Or, would she want to continue her work here in Illinois? And would Pritzker himself be happy working for someone else after years of leading a large state? Or does she just want it all to end? Those are a lot of ifs, starting with Harris’ election and then an actual Pritzker appointment, and if he’d want it. I’ve gone back and forth on this.

(AP) — Donald Trump accepted a key endorsement from one of the nation’s most influential law enforcement lobbies on Friday by offering a sweeping indictment of the U.S. legal system that has convicted him of almost three dozen felony counts and indicted him in three other pending cases. The Fraternal Order of Police convention in the battleground state of North Carolina was billed as a way for Trump to pitch himself as a law-and-order figure and cast his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and California attorney general, as weak. But in between remarks about crime and law enforcement, the former president and Republican nominee celebrated a New York judge’s decision earlier in the day to postpone his sentencing on 34 felony counts in a business fraud case until after Election Day. He repeated his false assertions that the U.S. election system is rife with massive voter fraud and that his 2020 defeat was rigged — arguments rejected in dozens of state and federal courts. He promised to crack down on “Marxist prosecutors,” and he seemed to suggest that domestic police forces could more actively prevent voter fraud because people are scared of them. Trump’s latest broadsides and untruths also underscored the unusual circumstances of a national law enforcement group embracing a political leader who has repeatedly denigrated U.S. institutions and championed a mob of his supporters who assaulted law enforcement officers at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — a siege at the core of Trump’s continuing legal peril as he attempts a comeback bid. But on Friday, top of mind was the New York case, which he mentioned early on in his remarks. “Big news today is the Manhattan D.A. witch hunt against me has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was no case — because I did nothing wrong,” Trump said. Patrick Yoes, the FOP’s national president, said Trump had tamped down the “defund the police” movement and supported law enforcement in the summer of 2020 during nationwide protests against police brutality after the murder of George Floyd. “During his time in the White House, we had a partner and a leader,” Yoes said. “We have your back.” Despite Trump’s status as the only U.S. president in history to be charged or convicted with a felony, the former president used the room of law enforcement officers as a backdrop to attack Harris over crime. “American cities, suburbs and towns are totally under siege. Kamala Harris and the communist left have unleashed a brutal plague of bloodshed, crime, chaos, misery and death upon their land,” Trump said, adding that police are “not allowed to do your jobs.” Trump pledged unyielding support for police, including expanded use of force: “We have to get back to power and respect.” And he seemingly encouraged police to use their power in the upcoming election to “watch for voter fraud,” which is rare in the United States despite his insistence to the contrary. “I hope you as the greatest people … watch for voter fraud,” he said. “I hope you can watch and you’re all over the place. Watch for the voter fraud. Because we win. Without voter fraud, we win so easily. Hopefully, we’re going to win anyway. But we want to keep it down. You can keep it down just by watching. Because believe it or not, they’re afraid of that badge. They’re afraid of you people.” For her part, Harris has showcased her status as a one-time top prosecutor in her home state, regularly saying “I know Donald Trump’s type” after she talks about the “perpetrators of all kinds” in her former roles. She’s had some help with that messaging from two officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and have become surrogates for the Democratic ticket. “Donald Trump is still that threat,” former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn told a group of voters in Arizona this summer. “His deranged, self-centered, obsessive quest for power is the reason violent insurrectionists assaulted my coworkers and I.” Ahead of Trump’s North Carolina trip, the Harris campaign organized a press call with current and former law enforcement officials, including Dunn, who said Trump only supports police when they’re loyal to him. “He put my life and the lives of my fellow Capitol Police officers in danger,” he said. The Harris campaign also issued a letter signed by more than 100 law enforcement officials across the country, lauding Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as “the only candidates we trust to keep our communities safe” and arguing that Trump “will sow chaos, defund critical law enforcement agencies, and put all Americans at risk.” The FOP joins other police groups that have already lined up behind Trump, including the National Association of Police Organizations and International Union of Police Associations. Trump’s support from law officers also butts up against sympathies he has shown for those who have defied the orders of police, including his pledge to pardon those charged with beating officers during the Capitol siege. Judges and juries considering those cases have heard police officers describe being savagely attacked while defending the building. All told, about 140 officers were injured that day, making it “likely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement” in American history, Matthew Graves, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has said. Over 900 people have pleaded guilty to Jan. 6 crimes, and approximately 200 others have been convicted at trial. More than 950 people have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds getting time behind bars — terms ranging from a few days to 22 years. Trump has long expressed support for Jan. 6 defendants. “Those J6 warriors, they were warriors, but … they’re victims of what happened,” Trump said at a rally in Nevada this summer. He falsely claimed that police welcomed rioters into the Capitol by saying, “Go in, go in, go in, go in.” Trump’s misrepresentation of what happened did not concern his ardent supporters gathered in Charlotte. “I wish they could let them all out of jail,” said Janice Moody, a retired fingerprint technician with the Las Vegas Police Department and spouse of a retired Las Vegas officer. “I don’t think they did it on purpose,” she added.

The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) announced earlier in the day that it was choosing Trump as its favored candidate in the 2024 contest, support the 78-year-old said he was “deeply honored” to accept as he stood alongside union president Patrick Yoes at a gathering in Charlotte. “We know all about you and the great job that you do and the people of this country respect you greatly for it,” Trump said. “So I just want to thank you on behalf of everybody because I see it.” “Unfortunately, we were talking a little while ago,” he added, “it’s probably also a profession that’s under more danger and threat than ever before, which we hate to see.” As of July 31, the FOP reported, 223 officers have been shot in the line of duty, a slight dip of 2% from the same point in 2023, and 31 officers have been killed by gunfire. A record-high 378 men and women in blue were shot in 2023, and 46 were killed. “I visit a lot of families of police officers who are no longer with us, and we have to get back the power and respect that they deserve more than anybody,” Trump recounted. “And we’re gonna do that.” The former president also claimed to have been endorsed by “New York’s finest,” despite no public announcement to that effect by any NYPD union. “They’re not supposed to. They said we don’t care — we’re endorsing you anyway,” he bragged. Trump contrasted his plans to “launch a war on crime in America” — including promises to protect qualified immunity to protect officers from lawsuits, a pledge to back the death penalty for cop killers and a wide-scale crackdown on drug gangs and their leaders — with what he called “Kamala’s crime wave.” “As we gather today, American cities, suburbs and towns are totally under siege,” Trump told FOP members. “Kamala Harris and the communist left have unleashed a brutal plague of bloodshed, crime, chaos, misery and death upon our land.” “Other than that,” he joked, “they’re doing actually quite well.” Trump went on to recount cases of cops being shot on the job just the night before in Milwaukee, before describing the “filth,” “graffiti” and rampant retail theft that the “law-abiding citizen is forced to live” with. “The new thing in New York, you go to a pharmacy to buy aspirin, to buy a toothbrush and it takes you 45 minutes to get a clerk to open up the glass because people are walking in and just taking it as much as they want,” he recounted, before pivoting to attack Harris for her record as a San Francisco district attorney who lightened penalties for thieves. “She destroyed San Francisco,” he said, referring to Harris in front of the officers as “our opponent.” “But she came up with a great idea. You can steal as much as you want up to $950 and nothing happens to you after that,” he went on. “So guys are walking in with calculators,” Trump joked again. In a swipe at House Speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), he also pointed out the “big wall wrapped around her house … didn’t help with the problems that she had,” apparently referencing her husband Paul Pelosi being bludgeoned by a madman at their San Francisco residence in fall 2022. On a press call earlier Friday, Michigan Police Officers Association President James Tignanelli noted that his state’s attorney general, a Democrat who has endorsed Harris, had indicted “between 10 and 15 police officers” while in office. “That doesn’t help attract your candidates,” Tignanelli told reporters. Dr. John Lott, the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, also shared startling statistics about the rise in unreported violent crimes during President Biden and Harris’ tenure. “If you look at total violent crime during the Trump administration, it fell by 17% and it’s increased by 43% under the Biden administration,” Lott said, citing data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. “There’s no time in our history where we’ve had recorded data for total violent crime that we’ve seen such a large increase,” he added, pointing to the last report on criminal victimization released by the DOJ bureau in 2022. Before 2020, Lott explained, both the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the FBI “generally moved along together” in the numbers that were reported, but have since “moved in opposite directions each year, often by very large amounts.” “While the FBI showed a 2% drop in reported violent crime, the national crime victimization data showed a 42% increase in violent crime,” he said citing 2022 figures. Trump was nevertheless in a celebratory mood Friday after Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan pushed the sentencing date for his “hush money” conviction until Nov. 26, meaning he won’t face potential imprisonment before Election Day. The case “has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was no case because I did nothing wrong,” he crowed. “It’s an attack by my political opponents in Washington, DC and Comrade Kamala Harris and radical left opponents for purposes of election interference.” “We will restore public safety to our streets. We will bring back law and order to our nation,” he vowed to the FOP attendees. “You’re gonna have the backup like you never had it before when you had it four years ago.”","summary":"The former president also claimed to have been endorsed by \"New York's finest,\" despite no public announcement to that effect by any NYPD union.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/trump-says-cops-in-more-danger-than-ever-from-kamalas-crime-wave-as-he-touts-union-endorsement/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89095533.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hHrB5Na9-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:40:31","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":255832952,"title":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney says he will vote for Kamala Harris","text":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a lifelong Republican, will vote for Kamala Harris for president, he announced Friday. Liz Cheney, who herself endorsed Harris on Wednesday, first announced her father’s endorsement when asked by Mark Leibovich of The Atlantic magazine during an onstage interview at The Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. “Wow,” Leibovich replied as the audience cheered. Like his daughter, Dick Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, notably during Liz Cheney’s ill-fated reelection campaign in 2022. Dick Cheney put out a statement Friday confirming his endorsement, which read almost entirely as opposition to Trump rather than support of Harris. “He can never be trusted with power again,” the statement said. “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.” Asked for comment, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said, “Who is Liz Cheney?” The campaign confirmed Cheung was being sarcastic by also pointing to a comment Liz Cheney posted online four years ago in which she called Harris a “radical liberal.” Dick Cheney, 83, has made few if any public appearances over the past year or more. He has dealt with heart issues since his 40s and underwent a heart transplant in 2012. Dick Cheney’s statement Friday was similar to a 2022 campaign ad for Liz Cheney as she sought a fourth term as Wyoming’s lone congressperson. In it, he called Trump a “coward” for trying to “steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.” The ad did little good for his daughter in a deep-red state that once held the Cheney family dear but is now thoroughly in Trump’s corner. By a more than 2-to-1 margin, Liz Cheney lost her Republican primary to Trump-endorsed attorney Harriet Hageman. Dick Cheney has been friends with Democrats over the years but never supported one for president. Both Cheneys backed Trump in 2016, but after Liz Cheney criticized Trump foreign policy decisions and Trump criticized the “endless wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq launched when Dick Cheney was vice president, their support waned. If either Cheney supported Trump in 2020, they were mum about it. Meanwhile, their home state of Wyoming that year delivered Trump his widest margin of victory. By 2021, Liz Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump and her investigation into him for the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot made them irredeemable to Trump — and soon most of the GOP. There were exceptions. One was Cheney ally Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a Republican Trump critic who earlier this year endorsed Biden and spoke in support of Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August. Several other top Republicans have come out in support of Harris while some, including Sen. Mitt Romney and former Vice President Mike Pence, say they won’t be voting for Trump.

Just remember that. If they win, Israel is gone,” Trump told the crowd via live video feed on Thursday. “You can forget about Israel, that’s what’s going to happen. So they have to get out on Nov. 5 and they have to vote for Trump. If they don’t, I think it’s going to be a very terrible situation.” He also claimed Jews who vote for Democrats need to have their “head examined” and wondered: “How do they exist?” He also claimed if Harris becomes president, “you’re not going to have an Israel...Israel will no longer exist.” During the speech, the former president appeared to initially misstate the last name of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israel-American hostage killed by Hamas, as “Goldman.” Goldberg-Polin was one of six hostages found dead in Gaza last week, which prompted widespread protests across Israel as residents demand faster progress on returning the remaining Hamas captives, and ending the war nearly a year after the militant group’s initial October 7 invasion. The Republican presidential candidate’s remarks to the group in Vegas were met with a mix of praise and criticism. A longtime member of the RJC told The Dispatch that the room largely viewed Trump as the superior candidate to Harris. “People may have lingering concerns or they wish maybe their preferred primary candidate would have prevailed,” the member said. “But everybody here I think is—not everybody, but the vast majority of people are—practical, living in the real world, and they understand that it’s a binary choice and most people think that’s a very easy choice.” Caroline Glick, an Israel-based policy expert and political commentator, said on X after the speech Trump was “on fire” at the RJC event. Others argued that Trump’s remarks, which echo claims he has made on the campaign trail, were both inaccurate and antisemitic. The Harris campaign says it will strongly support Israel if the Vice President wins the White House in November, while also pushing for a ceasefire with Hamas and the return of hostages. The Democrat’s campaign accused Trump of being an insincere ally to Jewish people. “Donald Trump openly demeans Jewish Americans, proudly dined with a neo-Nazi, and reportedly thinks Adolf Hitler ‘did some good things,’” Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said in a statement to Politico. “He has said the only people he wants counting his money are ‘short guys wearing yarmulkes,’ and praised neo-Nazis who chanted ‘Jews will not replace us’ as ‘very fine people.’” Others echoed that criticism. “For centuries antisemites have depicted Jews as existential threats lurking inside the countries they inhabit,” Rob Eshman wrote in the Forward, a Jewish news publication. “Trump makes the same charges, not against all Jews, just against the ones who refuse to vote for him — which is most Jews.” He added: “There’s a word for hatred directed at Jews you disagree with. The word is: antisemitism.” Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, had a similar view, tellingThe Washington Post, “This is antisemitism, plain and simple, and if any other elected official or candidate said these things even once — let alone on a nearly daily basis — they would be condemned as antisemitic.” In office, Trump’s actions on Israel won praise from the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, but did not earn him the support of most U.S. Jews, nearly three-quarters of whom identify as Democrats. Many young Jewish people have also been at the forefront of pro-Palestinian activism across the U.S. since October 7, and are unlikely to side with Trump on Israel issues. During the Trump administration, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the Israeli capital; formally recognized Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights; and pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. The Trump administration also helped usher in the Abraham Accords, through which the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain became the first Gulf states to formally normalize relations with Israel.","summary":"Trump claimed Jews who vote for Democrats need to have their ‘head examined’ and wondered: ‘How do they exist?’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-israel-jewish-republicans-harris-b2608537.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/06/20/AP24249705873122.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YAvzsJTJ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:22:02","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":255832220,"title":"Former vice-president Dick Cheney confirms he will vote for Kamala Harris","text":"You've been blocked by network security.

But advocates say justice for US citizens killed by Israeli soldiers has long proven elusive, with many accusing the administration of President Joe Biden of applying a double standard to Israel and its military. Friday’s shooting claimed the life of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a dual US and Turkish citizen who was taking part in a demonstration against an illegal Israeli settlement on Mount Sbeih in Beita, a town south of Nablus. During the protest, witnesses said an Israeli soldier shot Ezgi Eygi in the head, and she collapsed in an olive grove. She later died of her wounds at Rafidia Hospital in Nablus. Palestinian American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was among the first US officials to respond to the killing, and she called on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to “do something to save lives”. Blinken himself was asked about the killing at a news briefing later in the day, where a journalist pressed him on the military aid the US continues to provide to Israel. “I just want to extend my deepest condolences, condolences of the United States government, to the family of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi,” Blinken responded. “We deplore this tragic loss.” He said the Biden administration would “gather the facts” and “act on it” as necessary. “I have no higher priority than the safety and protection of American citizens, wherever they are,” Blinken added, echoing a similar statement made by US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew. .@SecBlinken: Do something to save lives! https://t.co/2g4hKCa330 — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 6, 2024 Elusive justice? But advocates have questioned the US government’s commitment to American safety overseas, particularly in the occupied Palestinian territories. They pointed to a string of high-profile killings by Israeli forces that they say Washington has not sought accountability for. Earlier this year, for instance, an off-duty Israeli police officer and a settler opened fire and killed 17-year-old US citizen Tawfiq Ajaq near his ancestral village of al-Mazraa ash-Sharqiya in the West Bank. An investigation into the case is ongoing. In 2022, an Israeli sniper also shot US citizen and Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was reporting at the time in the West Bank’s Jenin refugee camp. The Israeli military later admitted its soldier fired the fatal bullet but deemed the killing an accident and declined to punish any individual involved. While the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened an inquiry nearly two years ago, it too has offered no updates or resolution. That same year, 78-year-old Palestinian American Omar Assad died after being detained by Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint near his home in Jiljilya. The US ultimately declined to cut funding to the soldiers’ unit, despite its track record of abuses. Other examples stretch back more than a decade. In 2010, teenager Furkan Dogan, another dual US and Turkish citizen, was killed when Israeli commandos boarded a ship trying to deliver aid to Gaza. And in 2003, an Israeli soldier driving a bulldozer crushed Washington resident Rachel Corrie to death as she protested the destruction of Palestinian homes. Her name is Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, and she’s not the first US citizen to be killed by the IDF whilst peacefully protesting Israel in Palestine, or whilst simply doing her job there. From Rachel Corrie to Shireen Abu Akleh, this sad list is growing. https://t.co/yOxTAxNpNq — Monica Marks (@MonicaLMarks) September 6, 2024 White House reaction In the case of Friday’s killing, the Biden administration indicated it would rely on Israel to look into the incident. “We have reached out to the government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident,” White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said. He added that the administration was “deeply disturbed by the tragic death”. For its part, the Israeli military issued a statement saying its forces had “responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces who posed a threat to them”. It said it was looking into reports “that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area”. Israel is one of the US’s closest allies in the Middle East, and critics fear that has led to a reticence towards pursuing justice in cases in which its soldiers appear to be at fault. On Friday, for instance, the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) underscored the lengthy delays in seeking accountability. “For years, American Muslim and Palestinian-American organisations have been calling for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to address crimes against Palestinian-Americans killed by Israeli government and adjacent actors,” Robert McCaw, CAIR’s government affairs director, wrote in an open letter. A double standard The US was the first country to recognise Israel as a country in 1948, and it has maintained tight relations with its government ever since. Washington provides $3.8bn in military aid to the country each year. That number has increased since Israel’s war in Gaza erupted in October, with the Biden administration pledging additional weapons and support. The war started with an attack on southern Israel by the armed group Hamas. About 250 people were taken captive during the attacks, and some have since been killed in Gaza. Among them was Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old US citizen. Advocates on Friday questioned whether the Biden administration would pledge to seek the same accountability in Ezgi Eygi’s case as it had in Goldberg-Polin’s. “There was — rightfully — outrage and sadness when an American hostage was killed last week in Gaza,” Yohan Lieberman, the co-founder of IfNotNow, an American Jewish advocacy organisation, wrote on the social media platform X. But Lieberman wondered whether the same outrage would greet Ezgi Eygi’s death. “Will [Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris] even acknowledge her?” he asked. Political analyst Omar Baddar also pointed to the public statements Biden made after Goldberg-Polin’s killing. “Remember: when Hersh Goldberg-Polin was killed, Biden said ‘Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes.’ We’re about to get another demonstration of who can kill Americans with impunity,” Baddar wrote. Biden had not yet responded to the killing as of Friday afternoon. Open an FBI investigation and seek extradition of the murderer. #dosomething https://t.co/3tkibOtO5a — Mike S. Omer-Man (@MikeOmerMan) September 6, 2024 What does accountability look like? Several advocates took to social media to demand concrete steps be taken to bring Ezgi Eygi’s killer to justice. “Open an FBI investigation and seek extradition of the murderer,” wrote Michael Omer-Man, a director of research at the Washington, DC-based advocacy group Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN). CAIR, meanwhile, called on the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute all “Israeli officials, soldiers and illegal settlers” responsible for killing not just Ezgi Eygi but other Americans like the journalist Abu Akleh. It noted the department unveiled charges of terrorism, murder conspiracy and sanctions evasion earlier this week against the leaders of Hamas. “Now that the Department of Justice has demonstrated its ability and willingness to prosecute Hamas crimes against Israelis and Israeli-Americans in the Middle East, it is imperative that the Justice Department bring the same uncompromising legal rigor to bear in prosecuting crimes committed against Palestinian Americans by Israeli soldiers and settlers,” McCaw, CAIR’s government affairs director, said. “The DOJ must act swiftly and decisively to uphold justice for all American citizens, regardless of their ethnic background.” Omer-Man went one step further, calling for the US to seek accountability for all human rights abuses, no matter whom they are directed at. He noted a 13-year-old Palestinian girl had also been killed by Israeli forces near Nablus in a separate incident on Friday. “Just a reminder not to base the value of a life or the criminality of taking that life based on what passport the victim might be carrying,” he said.","summary":"In the wake of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi&#039;s fatal shooting, critics question whether the US will seek justice from Israel.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/6/advocates-demand-justice-after-us-protester-killed-in-israeli-gunfire?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AFP__20240906__36FM8R7__v2__HighRes__PalestinianUsTurkeyIsraelConflict-1-1725647459.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:20:22","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":255835582,"title":"Ben Affleck beams amid Jennifer Lopez divorce drama... as he avoids awkward run-in with ex at Unstoppable premiere","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Sep 7th 2024 1AM 15°C 4AM 14°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Lee Carsley shockingly admits he will NOT sing the national anthem when he takes charge of England against Ireland in Dublin... with calls for him to be SACKED coming before his first team takes the field Another sticky situation for Meghan Markle's American Riviera Orchard business as its swirly logo gets a thumbs down from trademark chiefs in latest blow for the duchess's beleaguered brand Bar worker reveals 'reason' Shia LaBeouf squared up to group of drinkers in Edinburgh Every university in Britain ranked from best to worst: Our definitive interactive guide scores all 129 on every subject, quality of student life and graduates' earning potential.

The Hollywood couple spent months trailed by feverish speculation that their marriage was on the verge of collapse, culminating in Jennifer finally filing for divorce on their second wedding anniversary, August 20. The Argo director, 52, has been repeatedly spotted in public since the news broke, often with a radiant smile on his face. His latest sighting Friday was no exception, as he was seen sharing a laugh with another gentleman as they strode through a parking lot. Ben was dressed in snappy business attire, including a well-fitted navy suit and a lighter blue dress shirt, worn without a tie in a nod to California chic. Ben Affleck glowed with happiness when he was spotted leaving work this Friday amid his ongoing divorce drama with Jennifer Lopez Read More George Lopez SLAMS Jennifer Lopez for posting 'a selfie with her ass' amid divorce from 'miserable' Ben Affleck The outing comes as Jennifer returned to the red carpet in a sideboob flashing silver gown for the premiere of her ex's film Unstoppable. She wowed in the risque number as she promoted the film Ben produced and she stars in - while Ben remained in LA. George Lopez claimed Ben looked 'miserable' during his marriage and slammed Jennifer for posting risque snaps in the wake of her divorce. In the days after she filed to dissolve her marriage, Jennifer posted a sizzling Instagram snap in a high-cut swimsuit that hinted at her derriere. Comedian Lopez, 63, said in Thursday’s episode of iHeartRadio’s Politickin' podcast: 'You look at Ben Affleck — you never seen one dude more miserable and being married. 'And Jennifer Lopez posting a tweet … a selfie with her a**, it’s almost like, next!' He added that he believes Jennifer 'can't survive' the backlash she received over the selfie while still married to the actor. He said: 'The minute their divorce isn’t even final, they’re already taking pictures of their a**. Like, next!' He also likened Ben and Jen's marriage to Amazon mogul Jeff Bezos' romance with fiancee Lauren Sanchez - saying they are both 'Latinas who have been married twice.' He said: 'You can find anything on Amazon. You could probably find a Latina with no kids, you know? Ben was dressed in snappy business attire, including a well-fitted navy suit and a lighter blue dress shirt, worn without a tie in a nod to California chic The outing comes as Jennifer returned to the red carpet in a sideboob flashing silver gown for the premiere of her ex's film Unstoppable Jennifer, who is pictured with Ben at the Golden Globes this January, filed for divorce last month on the couple's second wedding anniversary George Lopez has taken aim at Jennifer for posting risque snaps in the wake of her divorce from 'miserable' Ben J-Lo , 55, filed for divorce from Affleck, 52, on their two year wedding anniversary last month - and set pulses racing with a cheeky swimsuit snap in the days following 'So the idea that the richest man in the world would go in, I mean, to me, that’s off. The last thing any smart Latina wants to be is a stepfather.' Jennifer flashed her toned backside in a sexy mirror selfie last week, slipping into stunning white strappy swimwear. JLo appeared to take a sly dig at Ben within her slew of summer pictures she shared with fans - over a week after she filed for divorce from him. Within her album of snaps, JLo modelled a string of stylish outfits perfectly fitted to emphasise her knockout physique. JLo was surrounded by loved ones in the pictures, including her 16-year-old twins Max and Emme and her younger sister Lynda, 53. But it was the memes sprinkled throughout the album that appeared to deliver a blow at Ben - combined with a mischievous message in her caption. 'Everything is unfolding in divine order,' read one meme, while another showed the words: 'she's in bloom and unbothered out of reach and at peace' on a t-shirt. JLo, who listed her date of separation from Ben at the end of spring on April 26, also suggestively captioned the album: 'Oh, it was a summer.' Amid the news of his divorce Ben has reportedly been spotted hanging out with RFK Jr.'s daughter Kick in recent weeks. He previously enjoyed a brief fling with Kick, before he rekindled his relationship with now-estranged wife Lopez, sources have revealed. Insiders have revealed to DailyMail.com that Kick and Ben are 'enjoying spending time' together but the writer is remaining 'tight-lipped' about their connection because she doesn't want to be seen as a 'mistress'. 'Ben and Kick had a fling before he got back together with JLo,' the source began. 'They met because Ben is from Boston and when you live in Boston, the Kennedy family is royalty.' Meanwhile Lopez is 'doing as well as she can' even though she 'didn't want a divorce' from the actor, a source told People on Monday. 'It's been incredibly difficult for her that Ben chose to pull away from their marriage and move on with his life, leaving her behind,' the insider shared. 'She didn't want a divorce. She wanted to figure things out. They love each other. Jennifer is not the type to just give up. It's been almost torture for her to wait around.' Jennifer and Ben were married in an intimate ceremony on July 16, 2022, but they later tied the knot a second time for family and friend at Ben's estate in South Carolina on August 20, 2022 — two years to the day before she filed for divorce 'After filing for divorce, she seems relieved,' the source shared. 'Her family and friends agree that it was the right decision. She's surrounded by a lot of love and support. She'll be fine. She's strong and always comes out on top.' Notably, Jennifer filed the divorce paperwork herself, and she did not have an attorney listed as representing her, though she may have an attorney listed in the future. She cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the divorce filing. Although she was the one to file, and Ben appears to have opted not to do so, Us Weekly reported on Friday that he was allegedly well aware of her plans. According to an insider, the estranged couple had 'already agreed to these terms before she filed.' They said the two had 'had gone through all the details' of the filing in advance, describe it as a 'planned' event, rather than a filing designed to take Ben by surprise. 'JLo finally pulled the trigger because that was their agreement that she would file, and she was the one who ultimately made the decision,' the source added. The reporting is largely in line with the couple's decision to fake a healthy marriage for months with occasional public outings together, despite having already split behind the scenes. The source noted that both parties 'came in with significant assets of their own,' so they allegedly don't plan to fight over their wealth, leaving their massive Beverly Hills mansion as their only significant shared property that needs to be sold off. Ben and Jennifer first got engaged at the end of 2002 but broke it off a year later before calling quits on their relationship for good in 2004 Accordingly, Jennifer requested no spousal support from her ex, and she asked the court to deny it for Ben. She listed the date of their separation as April 26. Jennifer and Ben were married in an intimate ceremony on July 16, 2022, but they later tied the knot a second time for family and friend at Ben's estate in South Carolina on August 20, 2022 — two years to the day before she filed for divorce.

In a decision Friday, Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan delayed Trump’s sentencing until Nov. 26, three weeks after the final votes are cast in the U.S. presidential election. The sentencing had been scheduled for Sept. 18, about seven weeks before Election Day. The delay is the latest bit of good fortune for Trump in an election season that has been laden with legal perils for him. The new date means voters will choose their next president without knowing whether the Republican nominee is going to jail, nor whether he will even be sentenced at all. Merchan now plans to rule Nov. 12 on Trump’s request to overturn the verdict and toss out the case because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s July presidential immunity ruling. Merchan explained that he was postponing the sentencing “to avoid any appearance – however unwarranted – that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.” “The Court is a fair, impartial and apolitical institution,” he added, writing that his decision “should dispel any suggestion” otherwise. Trump – fresh from watching appellate arguments in a sexual abuse lawsuit against him in a nearby federal court – heralded the hush money sentencing delay. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he called the case a “witch hunt” and a “political attack” and reiterated that he’d done nothing wrong. “This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country,” he wrote. Prosecutors said they stood ready for sentencing on the new date. “A jury of 12 New Yorkers swiftly and unanimously convicted Donald Trump of 34 felony counts,” said Danielle Filson, a spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He is a Democrat. Trump’s lawyers pushed for the delay on multiple fronts, petitioning the judge and asking a federal court to intervene. They argued that punishing the former president in the thick of his campaign to retake the White House would amount to election interference. Prosecutors didn’t take a position on Trump’s delay request, deferring to Merchan. A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Trump’s request to have the U.S. District Court in Manhattan seize the case from Merchan’s state court. Trump is appealing the federal court decision and has asked appeals judges to halt postconviction proceedings. Trump entered this election year facing the possibility of multiple criminal trials after he was indicted four times since March 2023. But a string of decisions in the last two months, culminating with Friday’s sentencing delay, has largely cleared his legal calendar. The hush money case is the only one to have gone to trial. In July, a judge dismissed a federal case in Florida charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents. The Supreme Court’s immunity decision has ensured significant delays in a separate federal case in Washington, D.C., in which Trump is accused of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. A Georgia election case also remains idled. The immunity ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors from pointing to official acts as evidence that a president’s unofficial actions were illegal. Election Day is Nov. 5, but many states allow voters to cast ballots early, with some set to start the process just a few days before or after Sept. 18. Trump is the first ex-president convicted of a crime. A jury in May found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels claims she and Trump had a sexual encounter a decade earlier after they met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Prosecutors cast the payout as part of a Trump-driven effort to keep voters from hearing salacious stories about him during his first presidential campaign. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels and was later reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as legal expenses. Trump maintains that the stories were false and that the reimbursements were for legal work and logged correctly. He has pledged to appeal the verdict, but that cannot happen until he is sentenced. Democrats backing their party’s presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, have made his conviction a focus of their messaging. In speeches at the party’s convention in Chicago last month, President Biden called Trump a “convicted felon” running against a former prosecutor. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, labeled Trump a “career criminal, with 34 felonies, two impeachments and one porn star to prove it.” Trump’s 2016 Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, inspired chants of “lock him up” from the convention crowd when she quipped that Trump “fell asleep at his own trial, and when he woke up, he made his own kind of history: the first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions.” Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years behind bars. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge, which would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment. Trump’s case “stands alone, in a unique place in this Nation’s history,” Merchan wrote. The public’s confidence “in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion,” he wrote. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price in New York and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed reporting.","summary":"The delay is the latest bit of good fortune for Trump in an election season that has been laden with legal perils for him.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/06/judge-delays-donald-trumps-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-until-after-november-election/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Trump_Columnist_Lawsuit_13813_8a8d4b.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:14:41","author":"Michael R.

Event host and lawyer Jon Bunge said the money would go to creating campaign offices in swing states. Emhoff, a lawyer himself who met Harris through a client in 2013, spoke to a crowd of about 200 in the Cultural Center’s ornate Tiffany Dome Friday afternoon, taking swings at Trump and his vice presidential candidate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. “Democracy literally is the client here — our way of life, our existence,” Emhoff said. “Treat this like the trial of your life.” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Sen. Dick Durbin opened up the event ahead of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder — who helped vet Harris’ vice presidential picks — and former deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., also attended. The tab for attendees ran between $1,500 to $100,000, according to an invite obtained by the Sun-Times. Emhoff said the Trump-Vance campaign is running on “authoritarianism and misogyny,” centering his attacks on Trump’s legal issues and his role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade, as well as several of Vance’s remarks regarding women and child care. He also touted Liz Cheney’s recent endorsement of Harris and called Project 2025 “900 pages of things that will destroy our country.” Drafted by the Heritage Foundation thinktank, Project 2025 is a set of conservative policy proposals, some of which were crafted by former advisers to Trump during his presidency. “As my new best friend Tim Walz says, ‘Stay the hell out of there,’” Emhoff said to laughs. The fundraiser came just days ahead of Tuesday’s debate between Trump and Harris. Emhoff said Harris is preparing for the showdown with Trump while continuing to work with President Joe Biden and Durbin on a plan to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. “She’s been working on this issue even while she’s preparing for the debate,” he said. “They’re working tirelessly to bring the hostages out and get this deal done.” Emhoff also said the Harris campaign’s legal staff has been focusing on fighting disenfranchisement efforts and anticipating Republican challenges to the Nov. 5 election results. “There’s no more important fraud cases than standing up to these bogus election challenges we know are coming,” said Emhoff, who also encouraged those in the crowd to campaign in other states. Quoting Michelle Obama’s speech during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Emhoff said, “We need to vote in numbers to get rid of any doubt.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/09/06/doug-emhoff-chicago-fundraiser-kamala-harris-donald-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/468a604/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6093x3478+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7e%2F61%2Fb5b5fb274875adc0df36e33cfcdf%2Fdnctu-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:11:04","author":"Violet Miller","authors":["Violet Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.019},{"id":255831784,"title":"Ex-GOP strategist 'shocked' by 'Darth Vader Dick Cheney’s' bombshell Harris endorsement","text":"After endorsing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race, arch-conservative former Rep.

Al Sharpton. \"And in that ad, he said: In our nation's 246-year-history, there's never been an individual that was ever been a greater threat than Donald Trump.… I mean, that's as straightforward as it gets.

Preparation, pitfalls and breaking the fourth wall: Takeaways from a decade of Harris debates By Bridget Bowman and Ben Kamisar Tuesday’s ABC News debate will be the first time Kamala Harris and Donald Trump come face-to-face — and only the third time she will face a Republican in a debate. But her past debate appearances going back to 2010 provide some clues on how she plans to make her case against Trump and for her own candidacy — what techniques and tics she leans on, her potential vulnerabilities and other common threads stretching across years of state and national debates. She previewed some of her go-to Trump criticisms during the 2020 presidential race, calling the then-president “corrupt” and “unpatriotic,” chiding his “weird” obsession with erasing Barack Obama’s accomplishments as president, and saying that Trump “doesn’t understand what it means to be honest” while looking directly at Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, during the 2020 vice presidential debate. “I’m speaking,” Harris repeated during that debate as Pence spoke over her. And she often appears to come prepared with memorable one-liners and scores of statistics to make her case — and to make a moment that might get attention long after the debate finishes. Harris has been diligently preparing for Tuesday’s debate between campaign stops and her White House duties, strategizing how to derail Trump and how to navigate his expected attacks. “She knows that every word matters, every facial expression matters and the stakes are very high at this level,” said Brian Brokaw, a former Harris campaign aide. One key theme across Harris’ past debates: It’s clear how much she prepares, often coming armed with highly specific policy and statistical details or attacks on her opponents. That preparation has paid off with some big moments for Harris — as well as some that have fallen flat. Kristen Welker breaks down the different paths to 270 electoral votes By Kristen Welker Steve Kornacki, other NBC News colleagues and I have broken down some different scenarios on our website about how Harris and Trump can get to 270 electoral votes to win the White House. And you can do your own scenarios by clicking this link. But I wanted to highlight four of my own different paths — and why they’re worth thinking about. Harris’ Sun Belt path As Steve Kornacki notes, Donald Trump’s direct path to 270 votes is through the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But Harris has a counterattack — through the Sun Belt. Say Trump wins in both Michigan (15 electoral votes) and Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes) — where the polling remains close. Well, Harris can still get above 270 electoral votes by winning Georgia (16 electoral votes), Nevada (6 electoral votes) and North Carolina (16 electoral votes). Or say Harris also loses Nevada. She can still make up for it by winning Arizona and its 11 electoral votes. Trump climbs the blue wall But say Harris wins Nevada and North Carolina. Even in that scenario, Trump still has a path to 270 electoral votes — by sweeping Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and winning either Arizona or Georgia. Harris’ dream path If Harris really is Obama 2.0 and can keep her summer momentum going, she could end up with a map similar to Obama’s from 2008 and 2012. In that scenario, she wins the 2020 Biden expansion states of Arizona and Georgia — as well as Florida (which Obama won in 2008 and 2012) and North Carolina (which Obama won in 2008). This gets Harris to a dream scenario of 348 electoral votes. Trump’s dream path By contrast, Trump’s dream scenario is his 2016 map — plus Nevada, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Virginia. This path — which seemed more possible when Biden was still in the race, but feels far less likely now — gets him to 339 electoral votes. Check out our full “Road to 270” tool here.

Pero en esta ocasión, algo cambió de “Tu historia”. Este es su material pandémico, lanzado en 2022 y producido por el cantautor y productor chileno Álex Anwandter y el que es la pieza central de lo que presenta en esta gira actual que la trae al área, pero no como ya lo tocó antes. “Somos un grupo de cuatro personas en el escenario y encontramos una manera de tocar las canciones tanto viejas como nuevas con el estilo que actualmente tenemos como grupo”, dijo a La Voz en entrevista. En este punto de su carrera, a Venegas le interesa que el público conozca y reconozca sus canciones con nuevos estilos y arreglos para presentar versiones renovadas que vayan con su propio cambio. “Me gusta estar creando dinámicas nuevas en el escenario. Pienso en lo que voy a hacer más que en lo que ya hice. Siempre pienso lo que me gusta ver como público y hemos hecho cambios de sonidos pero no de dinámica. Este show surgió del sonido del disco nuevo que tiene sintetizadores, pianos y acordeones”, compartió. En el evento de Ravinia también se presentará la agrupación La Santa Cecilia, originaria de Los Ángeles. Venegas precisó que no tienen planeado hacer nada juntos, pero tampoco lo descartó. “Todo puede pasar”, agregó. Como una de las intérpretes y figuras de la música mexicana de la escena musical desde hace tres décadas en varios géneros que van desde el rock alternativo, el folk rock y el pop, Julieta Venegas siente el cambio que está cambiando en la sociedad donde la mujer tiene más presencia. Más en un tiempo que México tendrá a su primera presidenta, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo y que Estados Unidos tiene a una candidata a la presidencia, Kamala Harris, y en el terreno de la música, que México realizará a finales de agosto el Festival Hera, el primer festival musical donde se presentaron sólo mujeres. “Es muy bueno ver todas esas señales pero todavía hace falta”, reflexionó. Le parece que aún en la sociedad hay una negación a aceptar los cambios y en la manera de ver a las mujeres en los roles que ocupan. “Las que estamos generando el cambio somos las mujeres”, aseguró. Radicada en Argentina desde hace algunos años, Venegas compartió que en dicho país el feminismo ya se hizo de un lugar en la sociedad y no es marginalizado, como todavía sucede en México donde las cifras de feminicidios no disminuyen. Espera que con la llegada de una presidenta al poder en México exista un cambio. “Es importantísimo lo de Claudia. La respeto mucho, espero que sus decisiones comprueben lo que han demostrado otras mujeres al poder: que cambian la dirección de los países que dirigen. Espero que esto lleve al país a un rumbo más luminoso”, compartió. Venegas reflexionó que en México se creció bajo una sombra paternalista y machista y que a veces hay quienes ni se han dado cuenta de ello. “Es un proceso lento”. En su escena, la de la música, reconoció que desde hace mucho tiempo ya no existe esa competencia entre mujeres por ganarse un lugar. Asegura que hay una hermandad que permite conocerse y aprender las unas de las otras, un espacio que también les da más libertad para crear y producir su música por su cuenta, sin esperar la aprobación de un productor como antes. “Es lindo que las redes sociales y plataformas ayudan a que la música sea más amplia, no te tiene que firmar la disquera ni la radio tiene que opinar. Es todo más directo”. Julieta estará girando hasta noviembre de este año con “Tu historia”. Ya está empezando a escribir canciones para nuevos proyectos. “Siempre estoy pensando en lo que sigue, en nuevas cosas, nuevos arreglos”.

Bush, similarly called Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward” in a 2022 campaign ad for his daughter during her failed House re-election bid. “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual that was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Dick Cheney declared in the ad. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters rejected him. He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters,” the former vice president went on. “He lost his election, and he lost big. I know that he knows it and deep down, I think most Republicans know it.” The former defense secretary and White House chief of staff concluded by touting his daughter’s effort to ensure “Donald Trump is never again in the Oval Office.” The Trump campaign responded to Liz Cheney’s announcement by sharing a clip of the Republican nominee slamming the decision to invade Iraq as “a big fat mistake” during a February 2016 primary debate. Dick Cheney is widely considered to be one of the architects of the Iraq War and responsible for convincing Bush to invade the Middle Eastern country and topple the late dictator Saddam Hussein. Liz Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol Building. She later joined former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), another outspoken critic of Trump, as the only other Republican member on the House select committee that investigated the riot. Cheney, 58, lost her 2022 GOP primary to Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) in a landslide, mustering only 29% support in the deep-red state. The former congresswoman endorsed Harris for president on Thursday. Liz Cheney also announced Friday that she would be supporting Democrat Colin Allred in the Texas US Senate race over incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).","summary":"“In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" read a statement from Dick Cheney released Friday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/former-gop-vice-president-dick-cheney-will-vote-for-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-aubz0b9rk-1725659337774.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725645027&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5clWAo1K-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:01:51","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.097},{"id":255830914,"title":"Gov.

Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., cautioned hosts of ABC's \"The View\" on Friday that former President Trump will prove a worthy opponent for Vice President Kamala Harris in their upcoming presidential debate. Trump and Harris will face off in Philadelphia for the first time on Tuesday, in a debate moderated by ABC News. While Harris taking on the mantle of the Democratic Party’s standard-bearer has indeed shaken up the race, Shapiro told hosts on Friday that doesn’t change Trump’s skillset, one that even his critics should acknowledge. \"Listen, as much as we want to criticize Donald Trump — he’s a liar, he’s all these things … People know Donald Trump.

But this is going to be a tough debate.\" Earlier in the same segment, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin noted, \"Kamala Harris is running a very different campaign than she did when she ran in the 2020 cycle.

She’s walked back previously held positions like calling for banning fracking.\" HARRIS PREPS FOR DEBATE WITH GOOGLE LAWYER, CREATING 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST,' TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS She then asked the governor, \"She’s gearing up to do this must-watch debate with former President Trump on Tuesday, do you think it’s a strategic mistake that she hasn’t explained some of these positions she’s changed on more ahead of the debate… because she’s obviously going to get challenged on some of these on a debate stage?\" Shapiro responded by suggesting, \"I think it’s a sign of strength when you evolve on a position,\" citing his own political experience.

He’s a weird guy. JD is not weird. He’s a solid rock. I happen to be a very solid rock. We’re not weird. We’re other things perhaps, but we’re not weird. But he is a weird guy. He walks on the stage.

They are truly punching air,\" someone noted. Meanwhile, Vance insisted that the Minnesota governor was the 'weird' one, “Tim Walz gave his wife a nice, firm Midwestern handshake, and then tried to sort of awkwardly correct for it,” Vance said. “I think what it is, is two people, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who aren’t comfortable in their own skin because they’re uncomfortable with their policy positions for the American people,” he added. “And so they’re name-calling instead of actually telling the American people how they’re going to make their lives better.","summary":"&#34;Calling them weird has been the most effective thing used against the MAGA yet.

The “Server for an Hour” fundraiser, hosted by One Fair Wage and chaired by Teigen, was meant to “highlight the urgent need to raise wages, end the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, and improve conditions for the millions of waiters, waitresses, bartenders, bussers and other tipped workers who earn suppressed wages,” according to a release. A slew of celebrity servers, including Keegan-Michael Key, June Diane Raphael, Jesse Tyler-Ferguson, Matt Bomer, Ike Barinholtz and more, took to the floor of West Hollywood restaurant LadyHawk to take orders and serve food. “A lot of us here come from a background of the restaurant industry. I was a hostess,” Teigen told The Hollywood Reporter at LadyHawk just before the event. “For the past 30 years, people have literally, the sub-minimum wage has been $3.13. It’s disgusting. It’s crazy.” The cookbook author emphasized that the industry is taking advantage of workers, which was a theme throughout the night’s speakers — which included Meena Harris, CEO of Phenomenal Media and niece of presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, One Fair Wage’s Saru Jayaraman and Teigen. “Since Chrissy started this event last year, we were able to raise enough money to win a big wage increase for 1.2 million people in Michigan who got their wages raised from $3.87 to $15 an hour plus tips,” Jayaraman told THR. “We calculated how much money that’s going into workers’ pockets, and it’s about 10 billion a year going into low-wage workers’ pockets,” she continued, explaining what that actually translates to for workers. “It means for a waitress who works on $3 in Michigan, a single mom, that instead of working three jobs, she might be able to work one job, which means she might be able to spend time with her children,” she said. “She might be able to actually have the time to go vote.” Throughout the evening, the celebrity service workers were seen trying their hardest. Key was spotted learning from the restaurant’s staff, concentrating and taking notes on how to put orders into the system, meanwhile, Raphael jumped right into trying her hand at getting orders in. The restaurant’s workers helped the guest servers throughout the evening. Teigen picked several things she loved about the event and almost all came back to her love for the industry. “We’re all going to be working together tonight, and the best part is everyone that’s here and enjoying the food is enjoying the night. They’re not coming because we’re going to be great at what we do,” she laughed. “That’s why we have so much respect for those people that are in this industry.”","summary":"Chrissy Teigen led a group of celebrity servers in West Hollywood to raise money for One Fair Wage Thursday night.

Kennedy's bid to remove his name from 2024 ballots to help Donald Trump.Kennedy suspended his campaign last month and endorsed the former president, quickly drawing a rebuke from siblings and other members of his famous Democratic family for backing the GOP nominee.While Kennedy urged supporters to vote for him in states where his name remained on the ballot, he vowed to withdraw from ballots in swing states where he believes he could act as a \"spoiler\" and help Vice President Kamala Harris defeat Trump.In North Carolina, where Harris is hoping to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win since 2008, already printed absentee ballots were ready to be put in mailboxes on Friday before an appeals court granted Kennedy's last-second request to force election officials to remove his name.An appeals court in Michigan issued a similar ruling on Friday, ordering state officials to remove Kennedy's name even though Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson previously declined to do so because the request was made after a state deadline.Political analyst and Dillard University Professor Robert Collins told Newsweek that he did not think Kennedy's name being on or off the ballot in either state was \"going to make very much difference at all at this point in time.\"\"It's important to keep in mind that RFK voters are primarily anti-establishment, anti-two-party-system people who did not like either candidate,\" Collins said. \"I argue that a large chunk of those people are simply going to stay home and not vote.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to Kennedy via email on Friday.Benson has vowed to appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court. Ballots have not yet been printed in the state, but some are scheduled to be sent out on September 21, while the deadline for making any changes to ballots was Friday.North Carolina officials are complying with the order to hold off on sending out ballots, but so far have not decided on whether to launch an appeal to a higher state court.State law in North Carolina requires that absentee ballots be sent out no later than 60 days before Election Day, leaving officials with no time to print new ballots and meet the deadline.North Carolina Democratic Party Chairwoman Anderson Clayton told CNN that Kennedy's name should remain because \"ballots were supposed to go out today,\" while denouncing \"great corruption in our court of appeals with the Republican takeover.\"Both appeals court decisions on Friday reversed previous rulings that denied Kennedy's requests to remove himself from the ballots.While the impact of Kennedy's name being taken off the ballots is debatable, if a significant number of would-be Kennedy voters back Trump instead, it could prove to be a decisive factor in battleground states decided by razor-thin margins.Political analyst Craig Agranoff told Newsweek on Friday that \"even a small shift in voter turnout or preferences could make a difference\" in swing states.However, Agranoff expressed some doubts about whether Kennedy being off the ballot would benefit Trump or Harris, arguing that \"it could hurt either campaign depending on how they pivot to capture those now-available votes.\"An average of recent polls compiled by polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight shows that Trump is leading Harris in North Carolina by just 0.6 percent as of Friday, putting the Tar Heel State within Democrats' reach.In 2020, Trump defeated President Joe Biden in North Carolina by fewer than 75,000 votes, or a little more than 1 percent of the total vote.The election is also expected to be close in Michigan, a state that Biden won by around 154,000 votes, or just under 3 percent, in 2020. The FiveThirtyEight average shows Harris leading Trump by 2 percent.Meanwhile, a judge denied Kennedy's request to block a decision that would keep his name on the ballot in Wisconsin on Friday, although further hearings on the matter are scheduled.","summary":"Last month, Kennedy said he was suspending his presidential campaign and endorsing Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-jr-donald-trump-swing-states-boost-election-1950151","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2466266/rfk-jr-trump-ballots-north-carolina-michigan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 21:42:18","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.482},{"id":255830084,"title":"Former vice-president Dick Cheney confirms he will vote for Kamala Harris","text":"The former vice-president Dick Cheney, a lifelong Republican, will vote for the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, in November’s presidential election, he said in a statement on Friday. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said of the former president and Republican nominee. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.

Jean Carroll sex abuse suit","text":"Veering from the campaign trail to a courtroom, Donald Trump quietly observed Friday (local time) as his lawyer fought to overturn a verdict finding the former president liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The Republican nominee and his accuser, E. Jean Carroll, a writer, sat at tables about five metres apart, in a Manhattan federal appeals court. Trump didn't acknowledge or look at Carroll as he passed directly in front of her on the way in and out, but he sometimes shook his head, including when Carroll's attorney said he sexually attacked her.

John Sauer told three 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals judges that the civil trial in Carroll's lawsuit was muddied by improper evidence. \"This case is a textbook example of implausible allegations being propped up by highly inflammatory, inadmissible\" evidence, Sauer said, noting that jurors saw the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump boasted in 2005 about grabbing women's genitals because when someone is a star, \"you can do anything.\" Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, told judges the evidence in question was proper, and that there was plenty of proof in the nearly two-week-long trial of Carroll's claim that Trump attacked her in a luxury department store dressing room decades ago. She said the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, as the trial judge had noted, could be viewed as a confession. \"E. Jean Carroll brought this case because Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in 1996, in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, and then defamed her in 2022 by claiming that she was crazy and made the whole thing up,\" Kaplan said. Carroll, standing with Kaplan outside the courthouse afterward, declined to comment. Trump left court in a motorcade, then delivered a lengthy diatribe against the case at Trump Tower, where he said again that Carroll — and other women who had accused him of sexual assault — were making everything up.

Carroll first spoke publicly about her encounter with Trump in a newly published memoir in 2019. In remarks to reporters Friday, Trump repeated many claims about Carroll that a jury has already deemed defamatory, and added some new ones, like suggesting that a photograph of him and Carroll together in 1987 was produced by artificial intelligence. It was unclear whether his comments could lead to a new defamation lawsuit by Carroll. \"I've said before and I'll say it again: all options are on the table,\" Kaplan said after Trump's news conference. The three-judge panel, if it follows the pattern of other appeals, would be unlikely to rule for weeks, if not months. A jury found in May 2023 that Trump sexually abused Carroll. He denies it. That jury awarded Carroll $5 million. READ MORE: Online criminals target young people in 'sadistic sextortion' crimes Trump did not attend the trial and has expressed regret that he was not there. The civil case has political and financial implications for Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has jabbed at Trump over the jury's verdict, noting repeatedly that he had been found liable for sexual abuse. And last January, a second jury awarded Carroll another $83.3 million in damages for comments Trump had made about her while he was president, finding that they were defamatory. That jury had been instructed by the judge to accept the first jury's finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Trump, 78, testified less than three minutes at the second trial and was not permitted to refute conclusions reached by the May 2023 jury. Still, he was animated in the courtroom throughout the two-week trial, and jurors could hear him grumbling about the case.

Carroll, 80, testified during both trials that her life as an Elle magazine columnist was spoiled by Trump's public comments, which she said ignited such hate against her that she received death threats and feared going outside the upstate New York cabin where she lives. The Associated Press does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done. During Friday's arguments, Trump's attorney said testimony from witnesses who said Carroll told them about the 1996 encounter with Trump immediately afterward was improper because the witnesses had \"egregious bias\" against Trump. Sauer also attacked the trial judge's decision to let two other women testify about similar acts of sex abuse they say Trump committed against them in the 1970s and in 2005. Trump denies those allegations too. EXPLAINED: The difference between brand-name medicines and their more affordable generic counterparts Kaplan said that in each instance of sex abuse, including one that occurred on an airplane, Trump followed a similar pattern in which he would engage in \"pleasant chatting\" bordering on flirtation and then \"all of a sudden out of nowhere, he would, for lack of a better term your honor, pounce.\" She added: \"Once these three brave women came forward and said what had happened to them, he said the same thing about all three of them.\" Perhaps foreshadowing the eventual decision, Circuit Judge Denny Chin warned Sauer that the 2nd Circuit generally gives \"great deference\" to lower court judges on evidentiary issues. \"It's very hard to overturn a jury verdict based on evidentiary rulings,\" Chin said.","summary":"Veering from the campaign trail to a courtroom, Donald Trump quietly observed Friday (local time) as his lawyer fought to overturn a verdict finding the former president liable for sexual abuse and defamation.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/trump-in-court-as-lawyers-fight-to-overturn-verdict-in-e-jean-carroll-sex-abuse-suit/2cf8d1e9-4634-43c1-802e-264935a89ef2","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Y0vwalpbVNwAjM0hBVg6fuJRPsw=/0x129:1024x705/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fb25baeca-5f53-4633-a932-6d75eae33ce2","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 21:41:37","author":"9News,Mikala Theocharous","authors":["9News","Mikala Theocharous"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.376}]}
