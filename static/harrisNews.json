Both CNN and NBC called the race just before 8 p.m. ET. \n\nAt the time the race was called, Spanberger led with 54.9 percent of the vote to Winsome-Earles’ 49.4 percent with 35 percent of the vote reported. \n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe Virginia gubernatorial race served as a key bellwether for the mood of the electorate ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when Democrats are hoping to flip seats nationwide. Spanberger, who served in Congress from 2018 through 2024, cast herself as a more centrist Democrat on the campaign trail, while Earle-Sears aligned closer to President Donald Trump.\n\nSpanberger’s victory could boost Democrats’ optimism about the midterm elections, as the party has continued to face questions about its future following former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss last November.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nHer victory brings the seat back into Democratic control for the first time in four years. In 2021, incumbent Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin flipped the seat.\n\nSpanberger will be the first woman to serve as governor of Virginia.\n\nAbigail Spanberger speaks during a rally in Norfolk, Virginia, on November 1, 2025.\n\nNational politics loomed over the race. The ongoing government shutdown and President Donald Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government were particularly important issues in Northern Virginia’s D.C. suburbs, which are home to a large concentration of federal workers.\n\nVirginia was once a swing state but has drifted toward Democrats over the past few decades.\n\nTrump, however, managed to narrow his margin in Virginia in 2024 compared to his 2020 performance. Five years ago, he lost the state by about 10 points to President Joe Biden. Last November, Harris carried the state by fewer than six points.\n\nRepublicans sought to tie Spanberger to the Democrats’ attorney general nominee Jay Jones, whose polling dipped after text messages appearing to show him suggesting political violence against a Republican lawmaker leaked. Earle-Sears also attacked Spanberger over her support for transgender rights.\n\nVirginia Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears arrives on stage before addressing supporters at a rally in Richmond on June 17, 2025.\n\nWhy Didn’t Glenn Youngkin Seek Reelection? \n\nYoungkin was ineligible to run for reelection again due to term limits that prevent a governor from being elected to two consecutive terms in office.\n\nHe won in 2021 by just under 2 percentage points, defying the state’s political lean. He has remained fairly popular in office—an Emerson College poll released just days before the election showed him with a +10 approval (49 percent approving to 39 percent disapproving). It surveyed 880 likely voters from October 30 to 31 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nJeff E. Schapiro of Sabato’s Crystal Ball wrote in an October 29 update: “A Spanberger victory—consistently suggested by independent political polling that occasionally has her leading Earle-Sears by double-digits, a 2-to-1 advantage in fundraising, organizational and message discipline, as well as the counter-cyclical quirkiness of Virginia gubernatorial politics—would, as a rejection of Trump in a suburban-dominated, two-party-competitive state, not be interpreted only as a mini-referendum on the Republican president.”\n\nRepublican Winsome Earle-Sears wrote in a Fox News opinion piece published Monday: “Throughout this campaign I have met parents, small business owners, veterans and young people who are all asking for the same thing. They want leaders who listen, who lead with principle and who remember that common sense still matters. They do not want mealy-mouthed politicians.”\n\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger said during a campaign event: “When the polls close, we will get the results of this election. This journey has been an incredible one because I have traveled all across Virginia, meeting Virginians, talking to Virginians. Listening to their challenges, their dreams, their concerns and their worries.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nSpanberger will take office in January 2026.","summary":"Polls leading up to the race showed Spanberger with an advantage over Earle-Sears.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/virginia-election-results-abigail-spanberger-winsome-earle-sears-governor-10985260","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2244499310.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 00:59:42","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":375813786,"title":"Polls close in Virginia as voters choose state's first female governor","text":"Richmond, Nov 5 (AP) Polls have closed in Virginia, where voters were deciding whether to keep the governor’s mansion in Republican hands by electing Lt Gov Winsome Earle-Sears or flipping it to Democratic control under former US Rep Abigail Spanberger.\nThe race, in one of two states where voters are picking governors this year, is seen as a snapshot of voter sentiment nine months into the Trump administration.

Bush dies \n\nBy TOM LEONARD, US CORRESPONDENT\n\nPublished: 00:23 GMT, 5 November 2025 | Updated: 00:34 GMT, 5 November 2025\n\nMost politicians try to avoid a reputation for villainy. But Dick Cheney relished his nickname in Washington: 'Darth Vader'.\n\nIn later life, when questioned about his ominous image, he'd point to a badge of the Star Wars baddie he'd fixed on his huge Ford pickup truck. 'I'm rather proud of that,' he'd say. In 2016, key Trump ally Steve Bannon offered an even more sinister comparison: 'Dick Cheney, Darth Vader, Satan: that's power.'\n\nWith his cultivated image as a strong, silent Westerner – complete with cowboy hat – Cheney was the driving force of the ill-fated Iraq War of 2003 to 2011, and a shadowy political operator widely regarded as the most powerful vice president in US history.\n\nLike the Vader comparison, he was proud, or at least unrepentant, of much in his career, even if it left plenty of his fellow Americans appalled.\n\nAs 'Veep' to the far less experienced George W. Bush, he was effectively the architect of the fateful 'War on Terror' that the US declared after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 – and in which some 4.6 million people are believed to have died.\n\nHe was unapologetic about his efforts in pursuing that conflict – judged a ruinous and destabilising misadventure by most historians – from waterboarding suspected terrorists even while critics insisted the practice was torture, to imprisoning Islamic radicals for years without trial in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nA leading light of the so-called 'neocons' (neo-conservatives) whose hawkish views on the primacy of defending American and Western civilisation dominated US foreign policy at the beginning of the 21st century, he always argued America had to be strong abroad and shouldn't hesitate to go to war.\n\nDick Cheney, the former US Vice President, died at the age of 84, his family said\n\nPresident Dick Cheney and his wife Lynn at the Stars and Stripes Gala in 2005\n\nCheney has died aged 84 from what his family described as complications of pneumonia, and cardiac and vascular disease. He'd already survived at least five heart attacks – the first when he was just 37 – and had a heart transplant in 2012.\n\nHe served three Republican presidents but, in Donald Trump, he finally found that there were limits to his loyalty.\n\nTrump, he said, was a 'coward' and a 'threat to the republic' who, he insisted, had tried to steal the 2020 election. Last year, Cheney publicly voted for Democrat rival Kamala Harris. Say what you like about Cheney – and the Left had plenty of objections to the conservative with the unnervingly crooked smile – but according to admirers he was a man who stuck to his principles and showed a moral backbone often missing in today's opportunistic and increasingly venal Republican Party.\n\nHe was fiercely anti-abortion but he staunchly supported his daughter Mary after she came out to the family as gay while in\n\nhigh school, many years before gay rights were a remotely mainstream cause in the US. 'Freedom means freedom for everyone,' he later said.\n\nHe said his favourite virtue was integrity, and his idea of happiness was fly fishing on Wyoming's Snake River. His image as a countryman took a knock in 2006, however, when he accidentally shot another hunter in the face, neck and torso – thankfully not fatally – during a quail hunt.\n\nThe victim, a 78-year-old Texan lawyer, suffered a heart attack several days later. Cheney never formally apologised.\n\nBorn in Nevada, he moved with his family to Wyoming when he was 13, where his father worked as a minor agricultural official. He met his future wife, Lynne Vincent, with whom he had two daughters, including politician Liz Cheney, at high school.\n\nCheney is seen with Joe Biden and his wife Jill at the Capitol in 2009 \n\nCheney won a scholarship to Yale University but was asked to leave after his grades slipped. Back in Wyoming, he began working as a line repairman for an electrical company before enrolling at the University of Wyoming, majoring in political science. It was Lynne who has been credited with encouraging him to pursue a political career.\n\nAfter starting as an aide to the Wyoming governor, he soon made his mark in Washington, where at just 34 he was made chief of staff (the youngest in American history) to President Gerald Ford.\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nFormer US Vice President Dick Cheney dies aged 84\n\nCheney rejected some of the perks of the job, continuing to drive around in his ten-year-old Volkswagen rather than using a chauffeur-driven limo. As a Wyoming US Congressman for a decade, he established himself as a hardline conservative and Cold War warrior who opposed Nelson Mandela's release from prison, condemned gun control and referred to Soviet officials as 'pigs in suits'.\n\nHe joined George Bush Snr's cabinet as defence secretary in 1989, unflappably overseeing the 1989 US invasion of Panama and the 1991 operation to liberate Kuwait from Saddam Hussein. The older Bush cemented Cheney's reputation for toughness by nicknaming him 'Old Iron Ass'.\n\nCheney left politics in 1993 – when Bill Clinton led the Democrats to power – to go into business, two years later taking over Halliburton, one of the world's biggest energy corporations.\n\nIn 2000, he was asked to help George W. Bush choose a running mate in his presidential campaign but, instead, 'Dubya' selected him. Cheney's heart issues – he'd had a quadruple bypass in 1988 – and lack of personal charisma made some Republicans reluctant to put him on the campaign trail, while he himself had dismissed the vice presidency as a 'cruddy job'. But he accepted and 'Bush/Cheney' won.\n\nIt soon became clear that, unlike other VPs, Cheney was intent on accumulating and exercising power himself – albeit subtly. Biographer Barton Gellman said: 'Dick Cheney played a paramount role in decisions that ranged from war and peace to the economy, the environment and the meaning of the law. His hand was often unseen even by colleagues.'\n\nBefore his vice presidency, Cheney (right) held a number of high ranking positions in the Republican party\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, he championed the so-called Cheney Doctrine, a national security strategy that argued that the US needed to attack anyone who conceivably posed a threat.\n\nThe idea was influential in Bush's decision – championed against domestic opposition by Tony Blair – to widen the War on Terror to include Iraq, which played no role in 9/11. Cheney remained unbowed even as US casualties mounted into the thousands and the 'weapons of mass destruction' used to justify the invasion failed to materialise.\n\nHis refusal to ever express any regret about the Iraq War fuelled suspicions that he'd had ulterior motives for pushing for it – a theory that gained traction when his old company, Halliburton, swiftly won major contracts to supply the US military in the field. Critics claimed Cheney had a personal financial interest in pursuing the invasion.\n\nBy the time he'd ended his tenure as VP, his public approval rating had sunk to 13 per cent. But he continued to heckle the Democrats from the sidelines, in particular raining criticism on Barack Obama.\n\n'Dick Cheney said I was the worst president of his lifetime,' Obama quipped. 'Which is interesting – because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime.'\n\nCheney's legacy will probably never overcome the Iraq War, in which up to a million people are estimated to have died and which laid the seeds for the rise of Isis and much else.\n\nIn 2018, Christian Bale played Cheney – unflatteringly – in a satirical feature film, Vice.\n\nCheney recalled that his granddaughter went to see it.\n\n'I said: 'What did you think?' She said: 'Well, it says you are a real badass. And that's cool.'\n\nHe would surely have been delighted.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDick Cheney was the chief architect of the catastrophic War on Terror who never apologised - even after he shot an elderly man in the face on a quail hunt\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Most politicians try to avoid a reputation for villainy.

Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, and perennial Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, who is trying to land a massive upset.\n\nA victory for Mamdani would give the city its first Muslim mayor and its youngest leader in generations, while elevating the democratic socialist to political stardom and giving his brand of economic populism one of the most visible political perches in America.\n\nIf Cuomo comes out on top, he will have staged a remarkable political comeback four years after resigning as governor over a barrage of sexual harassment allegations.\n\nFor Sliwa — the creator of the Guardian Angels crime patrol group and a longtime New York tabloid fixture — a win would put a Republican in charge of the nation’s largest city at a time when many New Yorkers are seeking a leader who can keep President Donald Trump at bay.\n\nMeanwhile, Polls have closed in Virginia, where voters were deciding whether to keep the governor’s mansion in Republican hands by electing Lt.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears or flipping it to Democratic control under former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger.\n\nThe race, in one of two states where voters are picking governors this year, is seen as a snapshot of voter sentiment nine months into the Trump administration. That is especially true in Virginia, which has a concentration of federal workers in the north who have been impacted by the president’s cuts to the workforce and the government shutdown.\n\nVoters in Virginia have favored Democrats in recent decades but the state in 2021 chose Republican Glenn Youngkin and in 2024, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris won the state by only a modest margin. One thing that is for certain is that the winner will be the commonwealth’s first female governor.\n\nVoters elsewhere were casting ballots to choose a new governor in New Jersey and a mayor in New York City. In California, voters were deciding whether to approve a new congressional map that is designed to help Democrats win five more U.S. House seats in next year’s midterm elections. The measure is a response to President Donald Trump’s efforts to aggressively gerrymander districts to favor Republicans in states where the GOP is in power.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nVirginia’s polls have closed\n\nPolls across the commonwealth’s counties and cities were open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Voters in line at a polling place at 7 p.m. can still cast ballots.\n\nVirginia voters are choosing a new governor and lieutenant governor. They’re also deciding whether Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares should get another term or if Democratic challenger Jay Jones should replace him. All 100 seats in the House of Delegates also are up for election.\n\nThere are well over 6 million registered voters in Virginia. The last time these statewide races were on the ballot in 2021, overall voter turnout was 55%.\n\nThis year, nearly 1.5 million people have cast absentee ballots, mostly through the mail or in person.\n\nNYC’s outgoing mayor warns voters not to mess things up\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters he cast his ballot for Cuomo, telling voters not to screw up the city by electing Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani.\n\n“The only message I can give to New Yorkers as I go to the next leg of my journey: I’m leaving you a good city,” don’t mess it up, he said, using an expletive.\n\nAdams abandoned his own reelection campaign earlier this year after failing to politically recover from his now-dismissed federal corruption case. He endorsed Cuomo last month.\n\nMamdani volunteers pledge to continue door-knocking ‘until the very last minute’\n\nWith three hours until polls closed, a few dozen Mamdani supporters were gathered in the dark corner of a Brooklyn park, preparing to set out on their final canvas launch of the long campaign.\n\n“We will deliver Zohran a mandate tonight, but we have to keep pushing,” Austin Dilley, a 26-year-old line cook and field coordinator for the campaign, told the group of volunteers. “Your job is to find the people who still haven’t voted and get them to the polls in time.”\n\nAs volunteers — some in bright yellow Mamdani beanies — sipped hot chocolate and chalked the candidate’s name on the pavement, Dilley said the group planned to continue talking to voters “until the very last minute.”\n\n“There’s folks we’re talking to here in the park who had questions about the agenda that we could answer,” he said. “I think we’re still changing hearts and minds.”\n\nNew York City’s Board of Elections puts out another turnout update\n\nAs of 6 p.m., 1.7 million people have voted in the mayoral election.\n\nThat’s the biggest turnout in a New York City mayoral election in at least 30 years. Just under 1.9 million people voted in the 1993 race, when Republican Rudy Giuliani ousted Mayor David Dinkins, a Democrat.\n\nA Trump supporter says he still cast his ballot for Sliwa despite president’s call to vote for Cuomo\n\nDamian Koszalka, a carpenter from Queens, says he knew Trump wanted supporters of Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa to back Cuomo. But Koszalka wasn’t swayed, saying, “You have to go with your own guts.”\n\n“I don’t give a damn, you know, if Trump or whoever, is telling me I have to vote for this guy because that’s the less evil, or this and that,” he said after casting his ballot. “It doesn’t work that way.”\n\nTrump reluctantly endorsed Cuomo on the eve of the election, saying Mamdani would bring “disaster” to the city.\n\nKoszalka voted for Sliwa in 2021 when he ran for mayor that year. Koszalka says Sliwa, the creator of the Guardian Angels crime patrol group, is the only candidate on the ballot this year who “actually did something for the city,” referring to Cuomo and Mamdani as “parasites.”\n\nSome voters outside Sacramento say California should redraw its map to fight Trump-backed redistricting in red states\n\nKalinda Jones, who teaches social work classes at Folsom Lake College, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, supports the ballot measure that would implement a new congressional map that could flip as many as five U.S. House seats from Republican to Democratic control.\n\n“This is a legitimate response to what happened in Texas,” said Jones, a 53-year-old who’s not registered with any political party. “I want California to respond. I think it’s ridiculous that we have to respond.”\n\nAaron Samson, a 29-year-old Democrat who takes science classes at Folsom Lake College, said he planned to vote “yes” on Proposition 50.\n\n“I think it’s unfair what the Republican side is doing,” he said. “I wish we didn’t have to be in this situation.”\n\nFACT CHECK: Why some candidates appear multiple times on NYC’s ballot\n\nFor many years, New York voters have found candidates listed twice, three times or even more on their ballots when they go to the polling booth.\n\nIt isn’t an error — it’s a practice known as fusion voting that allows candidates to appear under multiple political parties if they are nominated by multiple parties.\n\nBut such intentional duplications on the New York City ballot this year, along with other layout choices, have some outside observers around the country wondering whether they are seeing evidence of rigged voting, including billionaire X owner Elon Musk.\n\n“The New York City ballot form is a scam!” he wrote in an X post. “No ID is required. Other mayoral candidates appear twice. Cuomo’s name is last in bottom right.”\n\nBut there is nothing amiss about the ballots, which are in keeping with New York’s voting laws.\n\nFusion voting “occurs pretty frequently and it enables the Democratic candidate to get the votes of people who don’t normally vote for Democrats and Republicans to get the vote of people who don’t vote Republican etc.,” said Richard Briffault, an expert on election administration and a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nCuomo is in the eighth spot because he filed to run as an independent later in the process.\n\nHouston voters say they are frustrated they’ve been without a voice in the US House for 8 months\n\nVoters are only deciding on Tuesday who will be Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner’s successor after the former Houston mayor died in March, just weeks into his first term.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said he set the election for November out of concern for what he described as Harris County’s history of election problems. Democrats accused Abbott, a Republican, of keeping the seat empty to help the GOP maintain their thin House majority.\n\nDistrict resident Jose Saucedo said not having representation has worried him.\n\n“The lack of leadership is concerning,” the 54-year-old design professor said. “I hope that we can get a very strong leader for us, to represent us all.”\n\nSixteen candidates are running in the district. If no candidate reaches 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters will advance to a runoff.\n\nSome Virginia Dem supporters describe themselves as former Republicans who no longer align with the party\n\nVoters in northern Virginia mentioned economic uncertainty, healthcare costs, anti-immigration rhetoric and Republican extremism as reasons they were siding with Democrats on Tuesday.\n\nAccountant Sherry Kohan, 56, voted at the Aurora Hills Library in Arlington on Tuesday morning. She said she split her ticket — voting for Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger for governor while choosing Republican nominee Jason Miyares for attorney general.\n\nKohan said she used to think of herself as Republican but hasn’t felt aligned with either party since Trump’s first term. Her vote for Spanberger was a vote against Trump. She blamed Republicans for the government shutdown.\n\n“They have the majority and they should be able to get something done,” she said. “But I mean, there’s a little part of me that says, ‘Fire them all, get rid of all of them.’”\n\nSchumer stays out of the NYC mayor’s race\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday declined to say who he voted for in New York City’s mayoral election, telling reporters only, “I voted, and I look forward to working with the next mayor to help New York City.”\n\nThe powerful New York Democrat has largely stayed out of the contentious race to lead America’s biggest city, choosing not to endorse Mamdani or Cuomo.\n\nMamdani has slowly picked up a slew of endorsements from many of the state’s Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Gov. Kathy Hochul.","summary":"NEW YORK (AP) — New York City’s voters are deciding the outcome of a generational and ideological divide that will&#8230; Continue reading Mamdani vs. Cuomo in New York’s Fierce Mayoral Battle, as Virginia Awaits a Historic First Female Governor\n\n\nThe post Mamdani vs. Cuomo in New York’s Fierce Mayoral Battle, as Virginia Awaits a Historic First Female Governor appeared first on The National Herald.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/mamdani-vs-cuomo-in-new-yorks-fierce-mayoral-battle-as-virginia-awaits-a-historic-first-female-governor/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Election-2025-America-Votes5-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 00:27:57","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":375812086,"title":"Bomb Threats in New Jersey and Trump Warnings for California Mark Election Day","text":"Bomb threats to New Jersey polling stations, a voter roll mishap in Pennsylvania potentially affecting thousands of voters and warnings by President Donald Trump against California’s mail balloting system marked the final day of voting in an off-year election with several nationally prominent races.\n\nVoting otherwise appeared to go smoothly Tuesday across the U.S., as voters cast ballots in the first significant election since Trump won the White House for a second time.\n\nThey were deciding governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia, a mayor’s race in New York, Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania, and voting and gun control measures in Maine. A redistricting initiative in California that was a response to Trump’s push to redraw congressional lines in GOP-controlled states ahead of next year’s midterm elections has been of particular interest to the Republican president.\n\nHis Department of Justice sent election monitors to five counties in California, a state Trump has lost three times and whose mail balloting system he has often criticized despite no evidence of any widespread fraud or other voting-related problems. In a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state’s voting process “RIGGED” and warned that it was “under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!”\n\nClaims of election rigging are almost routine for Trump in the run-up to elections and sometimes on the day of voting itself. On Election Day last year, before he was declared the winner, he claimed without providing any details or evidence that there was “talk about massive cheating in Philadelphia” and said law enforcement was on the way. He continues to lie about his loss in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been championing the redistricting initiative, responded to Trump with his own social media post calling the president “A totally unserious person spreading false information in a desperate attempt to cope with his failures.” Secretary of State Shirley Weber called it “another baseless claim.”\n\n“The bottom line is California elections have been validated by the courts,” she said in a statement. “California voters will not be deceived by someone who consistently makes desperate, unsubstantiated attempts to dissuade Americans from participating in our democracy.”\n\nIn New Jersey, law enforcement and election officials acted swiftly as voting began to secure polling places following a series of bomb threats.\n\nLt. Gov. Tahesha Way, who also serves as the state’s top election official, said the threats had been emailed to seven counties, including Passaic, a key swing county. It also is the only county outside California where the Department of Justice had sent election monitors, in both cases at the request of the Republican parties in each state.\n\n“Law enforcement has determined that there are no credible threats at this time,” Way said. “We are doing everything in our power to protect voters and poll workers and coordinate closely with state, local and federal partners to ensure a smooth and safe election.”\n\nLater in the day, authorities arrested a juvenile suspect in connection with some of the bomb threats. The potential charges were not immediately released.\n\nThe threats came as the final day of voting began in New Jersey’s closely-watched race for governor and a year after a series of bomb threats disrupted voting during last year’s presidential election, mostly in battleground states. Bomb threat hoaxes also circulated in Springfield, Ohio, last year after Donald Trump during the campaign amplified false claims of Haitian immigrants there abducting and eating pets.\n\nThe threats Tuesday involved nearly two dozen polling places in Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean and Passaic counties, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement. Some polling places reopened quickly, he said, while voters at others were directed to nearby locations to cast their ballots.\n\n“Law enforcement officers have responded at each affected polling place, and they have worked swiftly to secure these polling locations and ensure the safety of every voter,” Platkin said.\n\nThe FBI’s Newark office said it was aware of the reports and was assisting the state and local agencies. “This Dept. of Justice is committed to free, fair and safe elections,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post related to the bomb threat investigation.\n\nPassaic County received three threats and redirected some affected voters to other locations early Tuesday, county spokesperson Lindsay Reed said in an email. One location, a school building, was cleared and voting resumed.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, nearly 20% of voters in Chester County were left out of the poll books originally provided to polling locations Tuesday, county officials said. That included voters registered as anything other than a Republican or a Democrat, including those registered with the Green or Libertarian parties or independents with no party affiliation. The category includes about 75,000 registered voters out of roughly 385,000 countywide.\n\nA Chester County judge later extended voting by provisional ballot to 10 p.m. at all polling locations.\n\nElection officials in the Democratic-leaning county located about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) west of Philadelphia became aware of the problem just after polling places opened and had provided supplemental poll books to all 230 polling locations by late afternoon. There will be a formal review.\n\nA majority of Chester County voters backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump in last year’s presidential election. Voters on Tuesday were weighing in on local offices, as well as on members of Pennsylvania’s highest court. Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court were running in nonpartisan retention elections, in which voters give a “yes” or “no” on whether they serve another term.\n\nThird-party and independent voters who came to cast ballots before supplemental poll books arrived were offered a provisional ballot. County review boards consider the status of provisional ballots within seven days of Election Day.","summary":"Bomb threats to New Jersey polling stations, a voter roll mishap in Pennsylvania potentially affecting thousands of voters and warnings&#8230; Continue reading Bomb Threats in New Jersey and Trump Warnings for California Mark Election Day\n\n\nThe post Bomb Threats in New Jersey and Trump Warnings for California Mark Election Day appeared first on The National Herald.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/bomb-threats-in-new-jersey-and-trump-warnings-for-california-mark-election-day/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Election-2025-America-Votes-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 23:57:03","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":375811874,"title":"Trump’s shadow looms as US voters pick New York mayor, state governors","text":"Voters in New Jersey and Virginia will choose their next governors on Tuesday in a pair of races that will serve as an early gauge of the American electorate’s mood after US President Donald Trump’s norm-shattering nine months in office.\nIn New York’s mayoral race, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, faces 67-year-old Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat running as a more centrist independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary, four years after resigning as New York state’s governor in disgrace.\nThe campaign has laid bare the Democratic Party’s generational and ideological divides as it seeks to rehabilitate its damaged brand.\nAnd in California, voters will decide whether to give Democratic lawmakers the power to redraw the state’s congressional map, expanding a national battle over redistricting that could determine which party controls the US House of Representatives after next year’s midterm elections.\nPolls close first in Virginia at 7pm, followed by New Jersey, New York and California throughout Tuesday evening.\nDemocrats will be watching Tuesday’s results carefully, with the party locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find consensus on the best way to oppose Trump, a Republican, and find a path out of the political wilderness.\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama, still the party’s most popular figure, headlined 11th-hour rallies over the weekend in New Jersey and Virginia, exhorting voters to elect Democrats to counter what he branded Trump’s lawlessness.\nIn interviews at polling stations on Tuesday, some voters said Trump’s most contentious policies were on their minds, including his efforts to deport immigrants in the US illegally and impose costly tariffs on imports of foreign goods, the legality of which is being weighed by the US Supreme Court this week.\nMore than 3 million people voted early in Virginia, New York and New Jersey, in each case far exceeding the totals from four years ago. In New York City, there were 735,000 ballots cast, according to the city elections board, more than four times the number in 2021.\nThe New Jersey race is the most hotly contested campaign, with opinion polls showing Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a congresswoman and former Navy pilot, holding a narrow lead over her Republican challenger, former state lawmaker and small-business owner Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nA spate of hoax bomb threats sent by email briefly closed down New Jersey polling stations in seven counties in the morning, state officials said.\nIn Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, a former Democratic US congresswoman, held a comfortable opinion polling lead over the state’s Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican.\nTrump was not on the ballot but he was on the minds of voters in Stafford, Virginia, which Democrat Kamala Harris won by less than one point in last year’s presidential elections.\nJuan Benitez, a self-described independent, was voting for the first time. He backed all of Virginia’s Democratic candidates because of his opposition to Trump’s immigration policies and the federal government shutdown, for which he blamed Trump.\nBenitez, a 25-year-old restaurant manager, said he would be open to voting for Republicans in next year’s midterm elections but because of Trump’s first months in office, “I’m more inclined for Democrats.”\nJennifer Manton, 47, said she had voted for Trump all three times he ran for president, and backed Republican candidates on Tuesday, citing Trump’s tariffs as a major issue.\n\nIn New York, Mamdani, who was a little-known lawmaker in New York’s state legislature only a few months ago, has led by double digits over Cuomo, with Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, 71, a distant third in most opinion polls.\nCalifornia’s ballot measure, Proposition 50, which would install a new Democratic-backed congressional map that aims to flip five Republican seats in response to a similar move by Texas, is also widely expected to pass.\nWhile Tuesday’s results will offer some insight into the mood of American voters, the midterm elections are a year away, an eternity in politics.\n“There’s nothing that’s going to happen in Virginia or New Jersey that’s going to tell us much about what will happen in a congressional district in Missouri or a Senate race in Maine,” said Douglas Heye, a Republican strategist.\nFor Democrats, Tuesday’s candidates offer a chance to assess differing playbooks.\nSpanberger and Sherrill, both moderate Democrats with backgrounds in national security, have put Trump front-and-centre seeking to harness anger at the president’s no-holds-barred agenda.\n\nIn New York, Mamdani has proposed ambitious left-wing policies, including freezing rents for nearly a million apartments and making the city’s buses free.\nA day after endorsing Cuomo, Trump said on Tuesday that any Jewish New Yorker who voted for Mamdani, a critic of the Israeli government who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor, was a “stupid person”.\nIt was the latest in a string of comments over the course of the US president’s career suggesting that Jewish-Americans vote against their own interests. Mamdani, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, rejects Republican accusations of antisemitism.\nFor Republicans, Tuesday’s elections will test whether the voters who powered Trump’s victory in 2024 will still show up when he is not on the ballot.\nBut Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears, each running in Democratic-leaning states, have faced a conundrum: criticising Trump risks losing his supporters, but embracing him too closely could alienate moderate and independent voters who disapprove of his policies.\nTrump remains unpopular: 57 per cent of Americans disapprove of his job performance, a Reuters/Ipsos poll shows. But Democrats are not gaining support as a result, with respondents evenly split on whether they would favour Democrats or Republicans in 2026.","summary":"Voters in New Jersey and Virginia will choose their next governors on Tuesday in a pair of races that will serve as an early gauge of the American electorate’s mood after US President Donald Trump’s norm-shattering nine months in office.\nIn New York’s mayoral race, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, faces 67-year-old Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat running as a more centrist independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary, four years after resigning as New York...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3331548/trumps-shadow-looms-us-voters-pick-new-york-mayor-state-governors","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/11/05/0bf89300-927c-4c38-8934-376efe478962_a199829e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 23:52:25","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.025},{"id":375813712,"title":"Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in U.S. history, dies at 84 - Washington Times","text":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served multiple Republican presidents before helping President George W. Bush lead the country into the global war on terrorism, died Monday, his family said.\n\nMr. Cheney, 84, laid claim to being one of the most powerful vice presidents in American history.\n\nHe was also a deeply polarizing figure. His critics, and some admirers, viewed him as the power behind the Bush White House, pushing the aggressive retaliations that became the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and engulfed much of the Middle East.\n\nMore recently, he split with the party that once embraced him — as a congressman, a defense secretary and running mate to Mr. Bush — by decrying the ascendance of President Trump and siding with his daughter, Liz Cheney, in her losing battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\n\nThe break was so extreme that Mr. Cheney pointedly announced last year that he would vote for the Democratic Party nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, instead of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Cheney’s family said he died from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity deaths in 2025: The famous faces we've lost\n\n“Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness and fly fishing,” the family said in a statement Tuesday announcing the death. “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”\n\nMr. Bush called Mr. Cheney a “decent, honorable man” and a “calm and steady presence.”\n\n“History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation — a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,” the former president said.\n\nMr. Cheney was chief of staff to President Ford. In the late 1970s, he won a seat in Congress from Wyoming and served until President George H.W. Bush appointed him as defense secretary. He oversaw the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the first war against Iraq’s Saddam Hussein.\n\nHe pondered a run for president in 1996 but decided against it.\n\nMr. Cheney emerged again in 2000 as a critical adviser to Mr. Bush. He led the search committee to select a vice presidential candidate before ultimately becoming the nominee himself, lending what at the time was deemed “gravitas” to the Republican ticket.\n\nHe was an unusual figure for a vice president. He expressed no ambition to succeed the president and instead claimed a large portfolio for himself.\n\nHe said the arrangement was Mr. Bush’s wish, and for years it seemed to work for both men.\n\nThe deal faltered in Mr. Bush’s second term as Afghanistan reconstruction stalled and the insurgency in the Iraq War worsened, costing more American lives. The debate over the engagements turned politically sour in Washington.\n\nMr. Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, was convicted of lying and obstructing justice in the outing of a CIA officer, Valerie Plame. Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush later had a falling-out over the president’s decision to commute the sentence but not pardon Mr. Libby.\n\nMr. Cheney was one of the first prominent Republicans to embrace an openness to same-sex marriage. He broke with Mr. Bush’s position during their 2004 reelection campaign.\n\nMr. Cheney’s other daughter, Mary, was in a same-sex relationship, and he said, “People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want.”\n\nYet it was the war on terrorism that defined Mr. Cheney and, to a large extent, the Bush presidency.\n\nIn the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks, Mr. Cheney’s whereabouts were closely guarded, and he was said to be at an “undisclosed location.” That became the subject of intense comedic interest and was even featured in a “Saturday Night Live” sketch.\n\nHe became seen as the most prominent defender of harsh interrogation tactics such as waterboarding that were used on terrorism suspects.\n\nYears after he left office and after the government had renounced some of those tactics, Mr. Cheney still defended them, though he said he didn’t consider them to cross the line into “torture.”\n\n“I’d do it again in a minute,” he said in a 2014 interview with NBC, in which he revealed just how searing the 2001 terrorist attack was for him.\n\nTorture, he said, “is an American citizen on his cellphone making a last call to his four young daughters shortly before he burns to death in the upper levels of the Trade Center in New York on 9/11.”\n\nMr. Cheney also made unfortunate headlines in 2006 when, while on a quail hunting trip in Texas, he shot a fellow hunter, 78-year-old Harry Whittington.\n\nBy the time Mr. Trump emerged as the Republican Party’s undisputed leader after the 2016 election, Mr. Cheney was a man without a political home.\n\nLiz Cheney won a seat in Congress in 2016, continuing the family’s political legacy, but she was ousted from the Republican congressional leadership over disagreements with Mr. Trump and lost her seat in the 2022 elections.\n\nMr. Cheney’s endorsement last year of Ms. Harris was met with derision on both the right and the left. Some Democrats cringed at having the support of a man they had derided as torturer in chief.\n\nFlags at the White House were lowered to half-staff Tuesday morning to honor Mr. Cheney, who is survived by his wife, Lynne, and two daughters.\n\nThe White House was otherwise reticent.\n\nPress secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump was “aware” of the death and said flags had been lowered “in accordance to statutory law.”\n\nThose who worked with Mr. Cheney recalled a highly capable and determined, though personally reserved, politician.\n\nRep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who served as a staffer in the Bush White House, said Mr. Cheney “spoke sparingly” but said “the few words he offered were usually the most insightful ones in the room.”\n\n“Everyone respected him,” Mr. Arrington said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who worked with Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush to rescue the war effort in Iraq in the second term, called the former vice president “one of the smartest people I’ve ever known.”\n\n“He had a unique ability to handle criticism from all corners of the political spectrum,” Mr. Graham said. “This is best explained by his tremendous sense of confidence in who he was and what he believed. When that self-confidence clashed with members of both parties, he was unshaken.”\n\nSen. John Barrasso hailed his fellow Wyomingite as a “towering figure.”\n\n“His unflinching leadership shaped many of the biggest moments in domestic and U.S. foreign policy for decades,” the Republican said.","summary":"Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in U.S. history, dies at 84  Washington Times","url":"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/4/former-vice-president-dick-cheney-dies-84/","image":"https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/11/04/Obit_Cheney_04914.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 23:37:30","author":"Stephen Dinan","authors":["Stephen Dinan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.352},{"id":375815234,"title":"Bekas Naib Presiden Amerika Syarikat, Dick Cheney meninggal dunia","text":"WASHINGTON: Bekas Naib Presiden paling berkuasa dalam sejarah Amerika Syarikat, Dick Cheney, yang berkhidmat sebagai orang kanan George W Bush meninggal dunia akibat komplikasi radang paru-paru, penyakit jantung dan saluran darah, semalam.\n\n Cheney berusia 84 tahun, antara pemimpin berpengaruh dalam jawatan ketika era serangan 11 September, peperangan di Afghanistan serta Iraq.\n\n Dibenci ramai pihak di sayap kiri politik, Cheney membuat perubahan pendirian yang mengejutkan pada akhir hayatnya apabila beliau menentang kempen Donald Trump untuk kembali ke Rumah Putih pada tahun 2024.\n\n Anaknya, Liz Cheney, bekas ahli kongres dari Wyoming, berkata bapanya yang sangat berpegang teguh pada prinsip Republikan dan mengundi calon Demokrat, Kamala Harris, dalam pilihan raya berkenaan. \n\n \"Cheney, yang juga pernah menjadi ahli kongres dan Setiausaha Pertahanan, \"meninggal dunia akibat komplikasi radang paru-paru serta penyakit jantung dan saluran darah,\" menurut kenyataan keluarganya.\n\n Sebagai Naib Presiden ke-46, Cheney berkhidmat selama dua penggal dari 2001 hingga 2009. \n\n Jawatan itu sering mengecewakan ahli politik bercita-cita tinggi, namun kemahiran politiknya yang licik memberinya pengaruh besar.\n\n Beliau membantu memperkenalkan fahaman eksekutif yang agresif, mempercayai presiden sepatutnya dapat bertindak hampir tanpa sekatan daripada pihak perundangan atau kehakiman, terutamanya ketika waktu perang.\n\n Pendekatan itu menyebabkan Bush terbabit dalam konflik panjang di Afghanistan dan Iraq, serta mencetuskan kontroversi besar terhadap kesannya ke atas kebebasan sivil.\n\n Dilahirkan di Lincoln, Nebraska pada 30 Januari 1941, Cheney dibesarkan di Wyoming dan pernah menuntut di Universiti Yale tetapi tidak menamatkan pengajian, sebelum memperoleh ijazah sains politik di Universiti Wyoming.\n\n Cheney berkhidmat 10 tahun di Kongres sebagai wakil Wyoming sebelum dilantik sebagai Setiausaha Pertahanan oleh Presiden George H W Bush pada 1989.\n\n Beliau mengetuai Pentagon semasa Perang Teluk 1990–1991, yang mana pakatan tentera pimpinan AS menyingkirkan tentera Iraq dari Kuwait.\n\n Sebagai Naib Presiden, Cheney membawa ideologi neo-konservatif ke Rumah Putih dan memainkan peranan lebih besar dalam membuat keputusan dasar utama berbanding kebanyakan pendahulunya.\n\nCheney juga antara penggerak utama keputusan untuk menyerang Iraq selepas serangan 11 September 2001 oleh kumpulan Al-Qaeda di New York dan Washington.\n\n Dakwaannya yang tidak tepat mengenai Saddam Hussein yang memiliki senjata pemusnah besar-besaran mencetus kepada perang menjelang pencerobohan AS ke atas Iraq pada tahun 2003.","summary":"WASHINGTON:  Bekas Naib Presiden paling berkuasa dalam sejarah Amerika Syarikat, Dick Cheney, yang berkhidmat sebagai orang kanan George W Bush meninggal dunia akibat komplikasi radang paru-paru, penyakit jantung dan saluran darah, semalam.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/amerika/2025/11/1467675/bekas-naib-presiden-amerika-syarikat-dick-cheney-meninggal-dunia","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/BH5DICK-O_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1762299084.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 23:31:31","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.846},{"id":375807318,"title":"Sen. Alex Padilla rules out run for California governor","text":"Sen. Alex Padilla finally put the rumors about a potential run for California governor to rest: He’s not running.\n\n“It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I’m choosing to not run for governor of California next year,” Padilla said in a speech at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, Nov. 4.\n\nRELATED: Kamala Harris will not run for governor of California\n\n“I choose not just to stay in the Senate. I choose to stay in this fight because the Constitution is worth fighting for. Our fundamental rights are worth fighting for,” Padilla said.\n\nPadilla had brushed aside growing speculation in recent weeks that he would jump into the race for California’s chief executive, saying his focus was on Proposition 50, the redistricting ballot measure before California voters on Tuesday.\n\nWithout a clear, strong frontrunner emerging in the race for California governor yet, Padilla was considered to be a formidable candidate should he have gotten in the race.\n\n“Current contenders can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Matt Lesenyie, an expert in political psychology who teaches at Cal State Long Beach.\n\n“His entry would have been devastating to their prospects,” Lesenyie said.\n\nBut Padilla ended that speculation Tuesday, chastising the Trump administration and the president’s policies in his speech.\n\n“Countless Californians have urged me to do everything I could to protect California and the ‘American dream’ from a vindictive president who seems hellbent on raising costs for working families, rolling back environmental protections, cutting access to health care, jeopardizing reproductive rights,” said Padilla.\n\nThe U.S. senator also recalled the now infamous press conference in Los Angeles held by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials in June, amid the administration’s ramped-up immigration enforcement efforts in Southern California.\n\nPadilla was forcibly removed from the press conference when he tried to ask questions. Video showed Padilla kneeling on the ground after being removed from the room, before officers pushed him to the ground and handcuffed him with his arms behind his back.\n\n“As alarming as that experience was, not just for me and my family but for most people who have seen the video, countless people have told me I’m glad you’re fighting for us. I’m glad you’re there, Padilla said.\n\nPadilla, 52, was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 when the seat was vacated by then-Sen. Kamala Harris to become the country’s vice president. He ran for, and won, a full six-year term in 2022, becoming California’s first Latino to hold a full-term seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRaised in Pacoima, the son of Mexican immigrants, Padilla’s entry into politics in the early 1990s was fueled by the politics of the late 1980s and early 1990s San Fernando Valley and L.A., amid the city’s growing Latino base.\n\nThose politics were defined in part by another intense era of anti-immigrant sentiment. Proposition 187, a 1994 California ballot initiative approved by voters, aimed to deny undocumented immigrants access to public services, including education, health care and social services. It also required reporting of suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\nThe courts ultimately struck it down, but the fervor propelled Padilla and many in his generation into public service. He would join protests against Proposition 187 in the early ’90s, ultimately finding a path into politics and government, managing political campaigns for several legislative candidates and serving as a field representative for then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nA foray into the governor’s race for Padilla would have been one of his first competitive contests in a while, said Lesenyie, the Cal State Long Beach professor.\n\n“Even winning would have meant weakening his political brand by weighing in on minor differences between him and the Democratic field,” Lesenyie said. “He also would have been pulled into relatively meaningless culture war fights from his Republican challengers.”\n\n“As for staying in the Senate, it’s a long commute but a safe seat. Padilla is exceptionally talented,” Lesenyie added. “He’s sharp. You can tell he reads his briefings and is well-versed in whatever policy he opines on.”\n\nNow that Padilla is not running — and with Harris also forgoing a run — attention turns back to those who have already declared their candidacies.\n\nFormer U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, former Fox News host Steve Hilton, former Rep. Katie Porter, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa have been trending toward the top of recent polling, although no one has boasted a massive lead.\n\nRyan Carter contributed to this report.","summary":"Without a clear frontrunner in the race for governor, the U.S. senator was considered a formidable candidate should he have run.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/04/sen-alex-padilla-rules-out-run-for-california-governor/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sut-l-padilla-court-005.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 23:15:31","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn,Kristen Crowe","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn","Kristen Crowe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.176},{"id":375810812,"title":"TV Ratings: ‘60 Minutes’ Trump Interview Draws 14 Million Viewers","text":"Skip to main content\n\nNovember 4, 2025 3:03pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nPresident Donald Trump on ’60 Minutes’ on Nov. 2, 2025.\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s first 60 Minutes interview in five years drew the newsmagazine’s largest audience in several years.\n\nSunday’s edition drew 14 million viewers, according to Nielsen’s big data plus panel ratings. That’s the highest same-day total for 60 Minutes since January 2021 and well ahead of the show’s season average of 8.93 million viewers. Norah O’Donnell’s interview with Trump took up about half of the show’s running time, edited down from a 90-minute session.

CBS’ broadcast of the Buffalo Bills’ win over the Kansas City Chiefs drew 30.84 million viewers, the second-largest NFL audience of the season so far.\n\nCBS also says Sunday’s show has accumulated 144.9 million viewers across 60 Minutes social platforms (with a “view” meaning anything longer than a second of watching a video on platforms like Instagram and X and 30 seconds on YouTube).\n\nTrump’s sit-down with 60 Minutes is notable because it came four months after he settled a lawsuit with CBS over a similarly edited interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. Trump claimed that by not airing the complete, unedited interview, 60 Minutes engaged in what amounted to “election interference.” CBS parent company Paramount, which was then in talks to merge with Skydance, settled the suit for $16 million in a move widely seen as a gesture to get regulatory blessing for the merger; CBS News lawyers had argued the complaint was baseless and that editing interviews is a universally accepted practice in journalism.\n\nTrump had initially been scheduled for a 60 Minutes interview during the 2024 campaign as well but pulled out.\n\nCBS News did not apologize as part of the lawsuit settlement but did agree to publish full transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates after they air.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\n“The Worst TV Show of the Year”: What the Critics Are Saying About ‘All’s Fair’\n\n‘Nobody Wants This’ Renewed for Season 3\n\nElection Day 2025: Where to Watch the Results Live Online Without Cable for Free\n\nTed Danson Goes Back Undercover in ‘A Man on the Inside’ Season 2 Trailer\n\nTeyana Taylor\n\nSarah Paulson Reveals Why Teyana Taylor Calls Her ‘All’s Fair’ Character the “Menace” of the Series\n\nPrime Video\n\nAustralia to Force Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video to Spend 7.5 Percent of Revenue on Local Content\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

Wes Moore announced Tuesday that his office will be launching an advisory commission that could lead to redrawing congressional maps to better represent the will of the voters. \n\nThe announcement comes as President Donald Trump and the GOP are attempting to gerrymander red states to lock in Republican majorities as the public loses confidence in the party.\n\n“President Donald Trump and his allies are trying to rig the system and are handpicking Republican states to go through redistricting processes,” Moore said. \n\nHe also noted that Trump is losing popularity with an agenda favoring the wealthy while raising costs for families, and that his redistricting efforts are designed to insulate the GOP from voter backlash.\n\nMoore said that Trump’s campaign is an “assault on our most basic promise of our democracy” and that “while other states are determining whether or not they have fair maps, so will Maryland.”\n\nIn a statement from the governor’s office, it was announced that the commission will soon begin holding public hearings across the state and would then make recommendations to Moore’s office and the Maryland General Assembly.\n\nRepublicans are already in a precarious position in Maryland, which has historically been one of the strongest states for Democrats. In the 2024 election, Maryland voters supported Kamala Harris by a margin of 62.62%, with just 34.08% support for the Trump/Vance ticket. \n\nThe state’s current congressional delegation consists of two Democratic senators, seven Democratic representatives, and only one Republican, Rep. Andy Harris. Redistricting could completely eliminate Harris’ seat.\n\nMoore’s decision echoes other Democratic efforts to reexamine maps in response to Republican gerrymandering.\n\nCalifornia’s Proposition 50, which would allow redistricting before the census, will be voted on in Tuesday’s election, and passage of the bill is currently leading in most polling. \n\nSimilarly, Virginia has also approved a constitutional amendment that would allow the governor to redraw districts. That legislation is likely to go into effect if Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger wins the gubernatorial race.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are undertaking efforts to purge Democratic seats in states they have a hold on, like Indiana, to insulate themselves from voter backlash against Trump’s agenda.\n\nAs Trump’s approval continues to collapse and Democrats work to counter GOP gerrymandering, Republicans could soon face a critical loss of power.","summary":"Maryland Gov.

He defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the county with 95,000 votes to her 89,000. \n\nThe shift of the once-blue stronghold to a district won by Trump baffled many in the days after the November general election. Harris ultimately won New Jersey, but she was the first Democrat since 2004 to win it by single digits. \n\nIn 2024, the area’s culturally conservative Latino population helped deliver Trump’s victory in the county. The county’s Hispanic population sits at 45%, with 38% white and 15% black as of November 2024. The “two or more races” category is the largest racial group in the county, per census data.\n\nBoth the general election results and Passaic County’s ballot count, in particular, signaled that New Jersey may be moving red — and put Sherrill on a path to have one of the most competitive gubernatorial races the state’s seen in years.\n\nThe Washington Examiner visited five polling locations in Passaic County on Tuesday. Foot traffic was low, given the state’s early in-person and mail-in voting. Over 700,000 people voted early in the 2025 cycle, not quite hitting the record turnout set last year.\n\nIn Passaic County, Republican voters have a wide range of reasons to support Ciattarelli in the 2025 election.\n\nMargaret Kearney, of Wayne, told the Washington Examiner after exiting the polls that she voted for Ciattarelli for one reason: he was endorsed by Trump.\n\n“I voted for Donald Trump three times,” Kearney said. “If he runs again, I’d love to vote for him again. He’s doing great things for America, and I’m very hopeful today that New Jersey turns red.” \n\nWhen asked about specific policies of Ciattarelli’s that she likes, she just said the “fact that he’s a Republican” and that the president threw his support behind him.\n\nTuesday’s election will be a test of political influence for both Trump and former President Barack Obama, who endorsed and stumped for Sherrill in the final days of the general election season. \n\nOne of the biggest gambles of Ciattarelli’s campaign was tying himself to Trump. On one hand, it would hopefully drive out Trump voters in an off-year election cycle, when the GOP historically does not fare well in terms of turnout. But, aligning his policies to mirror the president’s could backfire when trying to attract centrist and even some Democratic voters.\n\nCiattarelli has brushed off concerns that he won’t win, noting that he’s received endorsements from over a dozen prominent Democrats and has been well-received by minority populations.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI CONFIDENT HE’LL ‘DELIVER A WIN’ AS HE VOTES EARLY IN NEW JERSEY ELECTION\n\nKearney, who is from Peru, said she thinks the country and the state are going through a “difficult time” when it comes to politics.\n\n“I think this is our time, now, for us to make a change,” Kearney said.\n\nFor Grigoriy Kats, also of Wayne, his decision to vote Republican came from his experiences living and visiting other countries.\n\nKats is a dual citizen of the United States and Brazil, where his family currently lives as his spouse works to obtain a green card. He said he has been going back and forth for years for personal and business travel, and in his opinion, “nothing is getting better.” \n\nWhen asked about specific Ciattarelli policies he liked, he said education and school choice were his biggest motivators.\n\n“I believe he can definitely bring this state to a better place, because what we have in New Jersey, it’s not improving,” Kats said.\n\nHe said he’s also concerned with what he’s seeing happening in New York with self-described socialist Zohran Mamdani on track to win the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday.\n\nHe has a personal experience with communism, which GOP opponents have alleged Mamdani will bring to New York City if elected, having been born in Uzbekistan, and is Jewish. Along with his business travel, he said he has seen the way communism and socialism have affected countries.\n\n“So, I don’t want that to happen to New York City,” he said of a Mamdani win. “But New Jersey, you know what? Even if we lose, and Mamdani wins, New Jersey is just gonna go up, because they’re gonna run away from New York City.”\n\nLike Kearney, he’s hoping to see a change from the last two terms of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration. With Democrats in charge, and Sherrill representing the state in Washington, in his opinion, “we’re nowhere near better than we were.”\n\n“Change is always good,” he added. “Is it gonna be better? I hope so. Is he gonna do what he says he’s gonna do? I hope so.”\n\nThomas Ramirez, 27, of Passaic, is a registered independent. He said he decided to vote for Ciattarelli because of the candidate’s performance in the debates. \n\n“One thing about Jack, I gotta give him a lot of credit: He’s born and raised in New Jersey, been here his whole life, so he knows what’s going on,” Ramirez said. “And at the same time, he has specifics, like he really, whatever question you give him, he’ll give you specifics for it.”\n\n“That’s what we need,” he added. “We need certainty.” \n\nWhen it comes to Sherrill, Ramirez said “you can only deflect questions for so long” — a nod to her first debate performance, where she gave an honest answer that she was “not going to commit to anything right now” regarding a sales tax. Less than 24 hours later, her campaign released a statement committing not to increase the sales tax.\n\nBut for Ramirez, who watched the debates to learn more about the candidates, that answer told him enough.\n\n“A lot of people go off of their instincts, not like what the media gives them, but if you watch the debate, sometimes you can see something different,” Ramirez said. “We need clarification and we need certainty. You can only be black or white for so long. You can’t — you have to get out the gray area.” \n\nCiattarelli’s campaign motto, “It’s time!” resonated with Ramirez.\n\n2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK\n\n“Jack is right. For 25 years, the Democrat Party has, you know, ran over, took over, and look where it’s got us today,” Ramirez said.\n\nPolls are open in New Jersey until 8 p.m. with results to follow. New Jersey’s race is considered the most competitive of the three major elections this cycle, followed by Virginia’s gubernatorial and New York City’s mayoral races.\n\nSydney Topf contributed to this report.","summary":"PASSAIC COUNTY, New Jersey — In the Garden State’s governor’s race, nowhere is voter turnout more important than in Passaic County, a population of over 526,000 that a decade ago didn’t receive a second thought, but has since turned heads for its rightward shift in 2024.

Miles Coleman, a longtime election researcher who serves as associate editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ nonpartisan newsletter. “I think if they don't, that would catch my attention.”Because Tuesday’s races represent the first general election of Trump’s second term, voices on both sides of the aisle are already trying to draw conclusions about what the election results might mean for the long term. Campaign strategists and media politicos will be watching election margins and specific county results closely, eager to discern trends about voters’ attitudes and behaviors heading into next year’s crucial midterm elections.To be sure, every election reflects a unique time and place, and some experts cautioned not to read too much into any one race too much.“I never take away much from these despite/because of all of D.C. overrating them,” Doug Heye, a Republican political strategist who worked in the George W. Bush administration, told Scripps News. “Only three off-off year elections since the 1960s saw one party take both [Virginia] and [New Jersey], then go on to sweep the following midterms: 1993, 2005, and 2009. Since 1976, the party that loses the White House has won the Virginia governor’s race every time but once.”“No grand conclusions to draw,” Heye noted.Still, which candidates over- and under-perform will surely impact party leaders’ approach to subsequent races. As such, Scripps News spoke with political strategists and experts of all political stripes to hear what they expect to glean from Tuesday’s contests.Will Democratic successes drive Republican moderation?Both Republican and Democratic strategists expect Democrats to win the governors’ mansions in Virginia and New Jersey, and most think voters will approve California’s controversial redistricting measure, too.But how big a win they earn and whether those expected victories should be attributed to growing Democratic enthusiasm or merely the dynamics of the local races remains an open question.\"I expect Dems to win in New Jersey, Virginia and the California redistricting. But that’s because Democrats usually win there,” said Heye. “[Virginia’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail] Spanberger is a good candidate, [GOP nominee Winsome Earle] Sears is not.\"Simon Rosenberg, a prominent Democratic strategist and media commentator, argued the national environment significantly favors Democrats currently.“Trump is failing politically. He's unpopular. His agenda is even more unpopular than he is,” Rosenberg told Scripps News. “Between 60 and 70% of the country is not on board most of [Republicans'] agenda. And the Republican candidates in 2026 have to run on that agenda, not on Trump. And that agenda is much more unpopular than he is.”To that end, experts on both sides of the aisle pointed to Democratic candidates’ strong messaging about the economy and affordability. Whereas 53 percent of voters in key swing states said they believed Trump was better poised than then-Vice President Kamala Harris to address economic issues in the 2024 presidential race, according to exit polls, voters’ perceptions of Trump’s handling of the economy since he assumed office have soured significantly, with more than six-in-ten voters now saying his policies have worsened economic conditions.Strategists pointed to the fact that Trump, though vocal on social media, has been far less active campaigning for Republican candidates this cycle than he has been previously. The president never formally endorsed Earle-Sears, nor campaigned in person for New Jersey Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli.Moreover, though the Republican National Committee invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into key races, according to RNC officials, Trump’s personal SuperPAC didn’t appear to invest in any races in 2025, FCC records show.Some strategists argue this represents a tacit acknowledgement by the White House and Republican leaders of the president’s unpopularity.Trump is in a “weakened place, and it's getting harder for [Republicans] to ignore the failures of his government and his escalating unpopularity and his increasingly erratic behavior in the White House,” Rosenberg argued.“[Republicans] are going to have to find some way to kind of break from Donald Trump at least a little more in [next year’s] general election,” echoed Miles Coleman.Asked what Tuesday’s elections might signal about voters’ perceptions of Trump’s job in office, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt demurred.“I'm not at liberty to talk about the election results, and I certainly won't get ahead of them,” she told reporters Tuesday. “I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals that may or may not happen tonight. We'll have to watch and see. I'm sure you'll hear directly from the President tomorrow.”Should the elections go as expected, Rosenberg predicted Republican officeholders might become more emboldened to break from the president.“My general view about all this is that [Republicans’] thing is weaker and more broken than the conventional wisdom, and that perhaps the election could crystallize all this a little bit more for the national discourse,” he said. “If the election comes out the way it looks right now, and Trump is perceived to be in a weakened state, will there be an effort in the next few months to for Republicans to course-correct on some of the more most unpopular and damaging things to give them a better chance of being competitive in the elections next year?”Can Democrats find winning messages and messengers? Though national polling shows voters souring on Trump, opinions about Democrats aren’t much better.Just 29 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party, a recent CNN/SSRI poll found, with 55 percent viewing the Party unfavorably – the worst numbers for Democrats in at least 20 years.Should Spanberger, Democratic New Jersey gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherill and New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani each win in their respective races, will they be looked to as the “future” of the Democratic movement?Already, Republicans are working to elevate Mamdani – a Democratic socialist who’s been highly critical of party establishment – as a foil representing all Democrats. Trump has referred to him as “communist” and threatened to cut off federal funding to New York should he win, while Republicans throughout the country have referenced his campaign and platform in their own messaging.Spanberger and Sherill, conversely, are seen as more moderate candidates. Both were first elected in the 2018 Democratic “wave” that saw suburban women push Democrats to victory, and both have relied on their national security backgrounds to bolster their credentials.If all three win, which direction should the Democratic Party go? Like most questions in politics, it depends on who you ask.If Spanberger and Sherill “overperform” in their races but Mamdani narrowly ekes out a win, that might be a sign for Democrats to stick to a “moderate type of lane,” Miles Coleman argued. Conversely, if Mamdani surges while the other candidates narrowly win, that might signal Democratic voters’ eagerness for more progressive policies.Even still, framing the question as “moderate versus progressive” is not entirely accurate, experts said. Though Spanberger and Sherill might not identify as Democratic socialists, they’ve still staked out fairly liberal policy positions; “she’s not [former U.S. Sen.] Joe Manchin,” Coleman said of Spanberger.Moreover, some expect Tuesday’s elections to break less on ideological lines than on voters’ perceptions of Democratic candidates’ electability and willingness to stand up to Trump. In that sense, there might be lessons to be gleaned from all the candidates.“You talk to a lot of mainstream Democrats, and they'll at least say, ‘Okay, well, I don't agree with all of Mamdani’s policy prescriptions, but he is right to be talking about affordability.’ Or, ‘I admire that he's going to run around every street campaigning, and I admire his energy,’” Coleman said.“I think there are some things like that that, you know, the more kind of moderate Democratic campaigns could learn from.”Others, meanwhile, cautioned against leaning too hard into Tuesday’s election results.“I remember when [New York City Mayor] Eric Adams was the future of the party, and [former mayor Bill] De Blasio before that,” Heye remarked. “There is a constant in our politics and media to immediately set narratives in stone, whether they’re true or not.\"One thing everyone agreed on? The Democratic brand needs a victory, and Tuesday’s elections were likely to deliver it in one way or another.“Democrats need a win,” Rosenberg said. “Just winning is going to be really important. And I think that, whatever flavor of Democrat you are, you're going to have something to point to as something that you're excited about if the wins come way we think they will.”","summary":"After a stinging loss in 2024 and close to a year of near-powerlessness in Washington, many Democrats are heading into Tuesday’s elections with something they haven’t felt in some time: hope.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/what-tuesdays-elections-could-mean-for-trump-the-gop-and-democrats-future","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8bf3bfb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3431x1801+0+243/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F0e%2F71c156a042d1abe7000084bfbaa6%2Fap25307028611846.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 22:43:11","author":"Jacob Gardenswartz","authors":["Jacob Gardenswartz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":375800934,"title":"Donald Trump Claims He 'Hates' Taylor Swift, but Uses 'Fate of Ophelia' in His Video","text":"Donald Trump once claimed that he dislikes Taylor Swift.

As vice president under George W. Bush, Cheney wielded unprecedented influence—shaping foreign policy, expanding executive power, and redefining the role of the vice presidency. Yet his personal convictions often clashed with his public persona, revealing a man whose political life was marked by contradiction as much as conviction.\n\nArchitect of War and Surveillance\n\nCheney was the chief strategist behind the Bush administration's post-9/11 'war on terror,' pushing for military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. He insisted that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and maintained ties to terrorist networks—claims later discredited by U.S. intelligence and a presidential commission.\n\nHe also championed controversial counterterrorism tactics, including waterboarding and warrantless surveillance. Cheney defended these measures as necessary tools to protect the homeland, famously calling the use of enhanced interrogation 'a no-brainer'.\n\nA Conservative Who Supported Gay Marriage\n\nDespite his hawkish stance on national security, Cheney broke with his party on LGBTQ rights. In 2004, while Republicans pushed for a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, Cheney publicly supported legalization. His daughter Mary is gay, and Cheney's position was rooted in personal conviction: 'Freedom means freedom for everyone,' he said during a town hall in Iowa.\n\nThis divergence from GOP orthodoxy was one of the earliest signs of Cheney's willingness to defy party lines when it came to family and principle.\n\nThe Hunting Incident That Shaped Public Perception\n\nIn 2006, Cheney accidentally shot his friend Harry Whittington during a quail hunting trip in Texas. The incident, which resulted in Whittington suffering a mild heart attack, became a media spectacle and late-night punchline. Cheney took full responsibility, saying, 'I'm the guy who pulled the trigger and shot my friend.'\n\nThough Whittington later expressed sympathy for Cheney, the episode reinforced public perceptions of the vice president as secretive and unapologetically blunt.\n\nBreaking with Trump and Endorsing Harris\n\nIn his final years, Cheney became a vocal critic of Donald Trump. After the January 6 Capitol attack, he and his daughter Liz Cheney condemned Trump's actions and rhetoric. Liz, who served on the House committee investigating the insurrection, lost her primary race in 2022 after refusing to back Trump.\n\nCheney went further, endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election—a historic move for a lifelong Republican. 'As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution,' he said in a statement.\n\nA Legacy of Power and Paradox\n\nCheney's career spanned decades, from serving as Gerald Ford's chief of staff to leading the Pentagon under George H.W. Bush. But it was his vice presidency that cemented his reputation as a master of behind-the-scenes influence. He expanded the powers of his office, shaped global conflict, and challenged constitutional norms.\n\nYet he also stood by his family, defied his party on key issues, and ultimately rejected the populist wave that overtook the GOP. His legacy is not easily categorized—defined by both the wars he waged and the freedoms he defended.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"Dick Cheney, who died at 84, was a driving force behind the Iraq War and domestic surveillance—but also broke with his party to support gay marriage and oppose Donald Trump.

Bush — similar to the arrangement former President Gerald Ford, Cheney’s former boss, sought to join the 1976 Republican ticket with former President Ronald Reagan (Reagan demurred) — he was the most powerful vice president in history. \n\nMainly a symbolic job with only the constitutional duty to preside over the Senate while the president is alive and well, the vice presidency steadily gained in influence after former President Harry Truman was forced to assume the presidency with World War II raging, after former President Franklin D. Roosevelt died unexpectedly during his unprecedented fourth term. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the vice president should at least be in the operational loop to be prepared to take the top job in an instant.\n\nCheney was originally tasked with leading Bush’s vice presidential search committee before taking on the assignment himself. One of the reasons Cheney was selected was that he wasn’t planning on running for president, having passed on a bid for the GOP nomination in 1996, and was unlikely to change his mind due to his age and health. That meant, Bush hoped, that Cheney’s counsel wouldn’t be influenced by his political ambitions. \n\nAs it turned out, Cheney and his aides were deeply involved in decisions that defined, and turned public opinion against, Bush’s presidency. But former Vice President Kamala Harris suggested in her 2024 campaign memoir, 107 Days, that she shied away from the more ambitious names on her veep list and picked Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) at least in part because he wouldn’t outshine her.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden had a somewhat awkward, though publicly friendly, relationship with Harris precisely because she ran against him in the Democratic primaries, scoring a memorable debate moment at his expense in 2019, and wanted to be president. As the oldest person ever to serve as president, Biden had to be prepared for Harris to succeed him, whether he wanted her to or not.\n\nBiden did take some steps to groom Harris for the top job. She held calls with top foreign leaders, and the White House often released readouts of them. Official communications frequently referred to the “Biden-Harris administration.” Biden endorsed her as his replacement quickly, although not immediately, after he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nBut Harris’s allies often disliked the roles she was given by Biden, worrying she was being set up to fail. “I want to see her be used more effectively, and I think her being in charge of voting was important, but I question her other assignments,” Al Sharpton told the Root in 2021, adding that he planned to meet with Biden about it. The commentator Bakari Sellers called Harris’s policy portfolio “trash.”\n\nHarris complained in 107 Days that she did not feel adequately supported by Biden or his staff. “Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well,” she wrote. “That, given the concerns about his age, my visible success as his vice president was vital. It would serve as a testament to his judgment in choosing me and reassurance that if something happened, the country was in good hands. My success was important for him. His team didn’t get it.” She recounted that Biden personally interrupted her presidential debate preparation with an unhelpful phone call.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama picked Biden as his running mate in 2008 for Cheney-like reasons. Biden had more foreign-policy experience, a much longer track record in Washington, D.C., and seemed unlikely to run for president. That last bit obviously turned out not to be true: Obama had to dissuade Biden from launching a campaign to succeed him in 2016 and continued to have misgivings as his former two-term vice president was actually elected president four years later. Obama later played a role in pushing Biden to abandon his reelection bid.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance enjoy a close relationship. Trump, who is term-limited, has gone further in preparing Vance to succeed him, even giving the vice president access to the GOP’s financial operation, while musing about the possibility of seeking a third term or Secretary of State Marco Rubio running. Trump famously had a rift with his first vice president, Mike Pence, over the 2020 election, which appears to have ended the latter’s career in electoral politics. Pence’s campaign for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination went nowhere.\n\nVance and Pence were part of another Cheney tradition: they had longer-standing ties to the conservative movement than the president they served. Pence was supposed to balance the 2016 Republican ticket, reassuring evangelicals and other more traditional conservatives. Vance represented a kind of MAGA doubling down.\n\nFORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY DEAD AT 84 \n\nNevertheless, both Vance and Pence, in their own way, joined Cheney, Paul Ryan, Jack Kemp, and former Vice President Dan Quayle as protectors of the Republican ticket’s right flank. This tradition arguably goes back to Richard Nixon under Dwight Eisenhower and was continued by Nixon with Spiro Agnew, though Reagan broke it by picking an establishment figure in George H.W.

His descent came about because of his own disastrous mistakes, and dramatic changes in Republican Party politics (which were themselves partly a result of his mistakes).\n\nHe figured briefly in the 2024 elections, when Kamala Harris touted his endorsement, hoping it would lure enough anti-Trump Republicans to give her the edge. But it turned out Cheney no longer had any standing (Harris won just 5 percent of GOP voters, fewer than Joe Biden had won four years earlier), and Harris’ praise of him—her claim to be “honored” by his endorsement—may have moved more of her fellow Democrats to stay home.\n\nCheney was officially President George W. Bush’s No. 2 from 2001–09, but in fact dominated the administration through the first of his two terms in office. He played especially key roles in the invasion of Iraq, the launching of the global war on terror, and various decisions to exploit what he saw as America’s “unilateral moment”—its Cold War victory over the Soviet Union—by expanding U.S. power while brushing aside traditional allies and downplaying (sometimes sabotaging) peaceful diplomacy.\n\nHe was, and still is, often called a leader of the “neoconservative” moment, but in fact, there was nothing “neo” about him. He more closely fit the mold of a classic nationalist-imperialist of the 18th or 19th century.\n\nWhatever you might call him, his approach to changing world politics, for the most part, went badly.\n\nMuch of that approach and his appetite for power were formed during Richard Nixon’s presidency, when the White House chief of staff, Donald Rumsfeld, recruited him as deputy. After Nixon resigned and Gerald Ford, his successor, nominated Rumsfeld as secretary of defense, Cheney moved up as chief of staff—at age 34, the youngest ever.\n\nRumsfeld and Cheney both had a close-up view of Nixon’s harsh decline during the Watergate scandal and the impending impeachment. But they took away not the standard lesson of the time—the dangers of an “imperial presidency”—but rather its opposite: a distrust of legislative power and a felt need to expand executive-branch power.\n\nAfter Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976, Rumsfeld went off to the corporate world, emerging occasionally to chair special commissions on policy. Cheney went home to Wyoming, ran for Congress, rose to top GOP positions in the House, and took part in “continuity-of-government” drills in case of nuclear war.\n\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush nominated John Tower, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to be his defense secretary. Remarkably, Tower’s own colleagues rejected him, mainly due to reports of his frequent drunkenness. Bush nominated Cheney: He’d known him from the Nixon days, and he figured—correctly—that the nomination of a popular, well-informed, straight-arrow congressman would go quickly.\n\nI covered Cheney’s tenure in the Pentagon as defense reporter for the Boston Globe. He had been a right-wing congressman, opposing every socially progressive measure, even recognition of Martin Luther King’s birthday and sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid government. But he turned out to be a competent manager of the defense establishment, especially during the first Gulf War. He listened to well-informed tacticians and strategists, endorsed Bush Sr.’s decision to stop the war after U.S. forces pushed the Iraqi invaders out of Kuwait (some had urged Bush to keep going all the way to Baghdad and to topple Saddam Hussein), and (despite some initial internal opposition) testified in favor of massive cuts in the defense budget after the Cold War was over.\n\nHe returned to Wyoming after Bill Clinton beat Bush Sr. in the 1992 election. In 2000, Bush’s son, George W., won the GOP nomination and, on his dad’s advice, asked Cheney to vet possible running mates. In the end, Cheney thought the best choice would be … himself.\n\nBack during his time in Nixon’s White House, and then in the House leadership, Cheney had formed an entourage of his own acolytes and had mapped out the real positions and linkages of power throughout the federal government. After Bush won the election, during the transition, Cheney placed his people in those slots of real power. As Barton Gellman reported in his book Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, by the time of Bush’s inauguration, Cheney had grasped control of the executive branch.\n\nThis was true especially in foreign and defense policy. He formed a parallel National Security Council inside the Office of the Vice President. More crucially, he persuaded Bush to bring back his old friend Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary (this, over the objections of Bush Sr., who had grown to despise and distrust the man in his own term).\n\nWorking as a tag team, Cheney and Rumsfeld outmaneuvered the official National Security Council, headed by Bush’s highly educated but politically green national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice—and did the same to Bush’s secretary of state, now-retired Gen. Colin Powell. The latter displacement took everyone by surprise, not least Powell, who came into the job as a worldwide celebrity who thought that he would be running foreign policy.\n\nBack in 1992, when Cheney was running the Pentagon, he had supervised a Defense Planning Guidance which concluded that America’s objective should be not only “to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region” but also to discourage any “advanced industrial nations” from challenging U.S. leadership. In the Middle East and South Asia especially, the goal should be “to remain the predominant outside power … and preserve U.S. and Western access to the region’s oil.”\n\nNow as vice president, Cheney revived the document as policy (not merely policy guidance) and installed its chief authors in top second-tier positions in the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House.\n\nThe terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, stamped these ideas with new urgency. Unlike the authors of the earlier document, notably Paul Wolfowitz, Cheney had no special interest in restarting the Iraq war or overthrowing Saddam Hussein. But he was now on the lookout for threats everywhere and bought into raw intelligence reports that drew links between the al-Qaida terrorists and Saddam’s regime in Baghdad, as well as other reports that Saddam was developing nuclear weapons—and so, just days later, laid the groundwork for an invasion of Iraq.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Cheney believed these reports or merely cited them as an excuse to pursue his real goal of expanding—and crushing anyone challenging—U.S. power. Specialists in the CIA and other intelligence agencies dismissed reports of an Iraqi–al-Qaida link; some of them also rebutted suggestions that Saddam was close to building a nuclear weapon. But Cheney (and Rumsfeld) had a history of disputing the CIA; sometimes they’d been in the right. Even if the agency’s analysts were right about the unreliability of certain sources claiming the worst about Iraq, they might be missing the true picture.\n\nMaybe Cheney really thought Saddam was building nukes and cutting deals with al-Qaida, and decided to go with the sources who confirmed his beliefs. Or maybe he thought that making those claims about Iraq would legitimize his desire to invade Iraq for its own sake.\n\nEither way, Cheney consciously misled the nation into its deadliest war in decades—and one of its deepest strategic errors ever.\n\nFor his entire first term, Bush had ceded control of foreign policy to Cheney and Rumsfeld. After he won reelection, Bush started taking back some of that power. Realizing that the Iraq war was going badly, he fired Rumsfeld and replaced him with an old favorite of his father’s, former CIA Director Robert Gates.\n\nWith U.S. forces enmeshed in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gates made it his top priority to stay out of a third war in a Muslim country. Right away, Gates realized that Cheney was trying to coax Bush into bombing the nascent nuclear program in Iran. But Cheney no longer had Rumsfeld as a tag-team partner, and Gates—well aware of the team’s former tactics—traveled across the Potomac to the White House nearly every day, making sure to attend every interagency meeting, to keep Cheney from winning the argument.\n\nWith nearly every issue on the table, Cheney argued for using force and opposed diplomacy. Early on in his first term, Cheney had single-handedly thwarted nuclear talks with North Korea, which Bill Clinton had started and Colin Powell, as secretary of state, wanted to continue. “We don’t negotiate with evil, we defeat it,” Cheney had said publicly. Halfway into his second term, Bush tried to restart the talks, but by now it was too late.\n\nAs a general matter, Bush finally understood how Cheney had railroaded his entire presidency. Now the vice president grew steadily more isolated—and so it remained through the rest of his term.\n\nPresident Barack Obama had Gates stay on as secretary of defense. Cheney was left in the wilderness, no longer even a power within the GOP, whose leaders now recognized that Iraq had been a disaster in every way. The consensus view was, and remains, that Saddam was not developing nukes, that he had no ties to al-Qaida, and that the war was badly run from the get-go.\n\nHad Dick Cheney devolved into a different person—more hard-line and ideological—from the man he’d been as Bush Sr.’s defense secretary? Some of his former colleagues have long thought he had changed, perhaps the lingering result of four heart attacks (plus a fifth after he left office), which can affect blood flow to the brain.\n\nColin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when Cheney was defense secretary, told me later that, in his view, Cheney never changed. Under Bush Sr., he was “surrounded by grown-ups,” not least Powell himself. Under Bush Jr., he was not.\n\nHistorians will no doubt quarrel about the point for years to come.\n\nThe aftermath, though, is very clear. Partly as a result of the failures in Iraq, the Republican Party moved away from Cheney’s brand of interventionism—and even toward, under Donald Trump’s MAGA movement, a sort of isolationism. Meanwhile, the Democrats had never bought his policies.\n\nIn his first few years out of power, Cheney was invited on TV to rail against Obama’s foreign policy, but, especially after Obama ordered the raid on Osama bin Laden’s lair and ordered hundreds of drone strikes in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the tirades against Obama’s supposed weakness seemed not only clichéd but simply wrong.\n\nAnd so he retreated back to Wyoming. His daughter, Liz, won his seat in Congress, rose to a leadership position, and eventually leveled attacks on President Trump for trying to overthrow the 2020 election, especially by inciting the Jan. 6 riots. Dick Cheney applauded his daughter, criticized Trump himself, and even endorsed Kamala Harris for president. But his words had no impact. Even his daughter, who had risen more recently, was expelled by the party’s new elders.\n\nDick Cheney, for many years the ultimate insider, ended his life a nowhere man.","summary":"He died an irrelevant, all-but-forgotten figure—and mostly had himself to blame.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/11/dick-cheney-death-iraq-george-w-bush-vice-president-legacy.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/fdea8ced-4f4e-44dc-8271-58218d0edf24.jpeg?crop=4156%2C2770%2Cx0%2Cy1&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 21:58:11","author":"Fred Kaplan","authors":["Fred Kaplan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.23},{"id":375789368,"title":"Dick Cheney, former US vice president, dies","text":"By Stephen Collinson, Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN\n\n(CNN) — Dick Cheney, America’s most powerful modern vice president and chief architect of the “war on terror,” who helped lead the country into the ill-fated Iraq war on faulty assumptions, has died, according to a statement from his family. He was 84.\n\n“His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed,” the family said, adding that he died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.\n\n“Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,” the family added.\n\n“We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”\n\nThe 46th vice president, who served alongside Republican President George W. Bush for two terms between 2001 and 2009, was for decades a towering and polarizing Washington power player.\n\nBush described Cheney in a statement Tuesday as a “decent, honorable man.” “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position,” Bush said.\n\nIn an ironic coda to a storied political career, he cast his final vote in a presidential election in 2024 for a liberal Democrat, and fellow member of the vice president’s club, Kamala Harris, in a reflection of how the populist GOP had turned against his traditional conservatism.\n\nCheney was plagued by cardiovascular disease for most of his adult life, surviving a series of heart attacks, to lead a full, vigorous life and lived many years in retirement after a heart transplant in 2012 that he hailed in a 2014 interview as “the gift of life itself.”\n\nCheney, a sardonic former Wyoming representative, White House chief of staff and defense secretary, was enjoying a lucrative career in the corporate world when he was charged by George W. Bush with vetting potential vice-presidential nominees. The quest ended with Cheney himself taking the oath of office as a worldly number two to a callow new president who arrived in the Oval Office after a disputed election.\n\nWhile caricatures of Cheney as the real president do not accurately capture the true dynamics of Bush’s inner circle, he relished the enormous influence that he wielded from behind the scenes.\n\n“At that moment, you knew this was a deliberate act. This was a terrorist act,” he recalled of that day in an interview with CNN’s John King in 2002.\n\nCheney reflected in later years on how the attacks left him with overwhelming sense of responsibility to ensure such an assault on the homeland never happened again. Perceptions however that he was the sole driving force behind the war on terror and US ventures into Iraq and Afghanistan are misleading.\n\nContemporary and historic accounts of the administration show that Bush was his own self-styled “The Decider.”\n\nMultiple former presidents paid tribute to Cheney on Tuesday, with Bill Clinton and Joe Biden highlighting the former vice president’s “public service.”\n\nA changed man\n\nFrom a bunker deep below the White House, Cheney went into crisis mode, directing the response of a grief-stricken nation suddenly at war. He gave the extraordinary order to authorize the shooting down of any more hijacked airliners in the event they were headed to the White House or the US Capitol building. For many, his frequent departures to “undisclosed” locations outside Washington to preserve the presidential chain of succession reinforced his image as an omnipotent figure waging covert war from the shadows. His hawkishness and alarmist view of a nation facing grave threats was not an outlier at the time – especially during a traumatic period that included anthrax mailings and sniper shootings around Washington, DC, that exacerbated a sense of public fear even though they were unrelated to 9/11.\n\nThe vice president’s aggressive warnings about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction programs, alleged links to al Qaeda and intent to furnish terrorists with deadly weapons to attack the United States played a huge role in laying the groundwork for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Congressional reports and other post-war inquiries later showed that Cheney and other administration officials exaggerated, misrepresented or did not properly portray faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq turned out not to possess. One of Cheney’s most infamous claims, that the chief 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, met Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, was never substantiated, including by the independent commission into the September 11 attacks.\n\nBut Cheney insisted in 2005 that he and other top officials were acting on “the best available intelligence,” at the time.\n\nWhile admitting that the flaws in the intelligence were plain in hindsight, he insisted that any claim that the data was “distorted, hyped, or fabricated” was “utterly false.”\n\nThe conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan also led the US down a dark legal and moral path including “enhanced interrogations” of terror suspects that critics blasted as torture. But Cheney – who was at the center of every facet of the global war on terrorism – insisted methods like waterboarding were perfectly acceptable.Cheney was also an outspoken advocate for holding terror suspects without trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – a practice that critics at home and abroad branded an affront to core American values.\n\nCheney became a symbol of the excesses of the anti-terror campaigns and the fatally false premises and poor planning that turned the initially successful invasion of Iraq into a bloody quagmire. He left office reviled by Democrats and with an approval rating of 31%, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nTo the end of his life, Cheney expressed no regrets, certain he had merely done what was necessary to respond to an unprecedented attack on the US mainland that killed nearly 3,000 people and led to nearly two decades of foreign wars that divided the nation and transformed its politics.\n\nOf the Iraq war, he told CNN in 2015: “It was the right thing to do then. I believed it then and I believe it now.”\n\n‘He’s a coward’\n\nCheney’s aggressive anti-terror policies fit into a personal doctrine that justified extraordinary presidential powers with limited congressional oversight. That was in line with his belief that the authority of the executive branch had been mistakenly eroded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of his first presidential boss, President Richard Nixon.\n\nYet in his final years, Cheney emerged as a fierce critic of a man who had an even more expansive view of the powers of the presidency than he did – Trump. Cheney had supported Trump in 2016 despite his criticism of Bush-Cheney foreign policies and his transformation of the party of Reagan into a populist, nationalist GOP. But the ending of the president’s first term, when his refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat led to the January 6 insurrection, caused Cheney to speak out, in a rare, public manner.\n\n“In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said.\n\n“He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”\n\nEarly days out West\n\nRichard Bruce Cheney was born January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska. While living in the small mountain town of Casper, Wyoming, he met his high school sweetheart and future wife Lynne Vincent. Cheney was accepted to Yale University on a scholarship, but he struggled to fit in and maintain his grades. By his own admission, he was kicked out.\n\nHe returned West to work on power lines and was twice arrested for driving under the influence. In a turning point for Cheney, he was given an ultimatum from Lynne, who had “made it clear she wasn’t interested in marrying a lineman for the county,” he told The New Yorker. “I buckled down and applied myself. Decided it was time to make something of myself,” he told the magazine.\n\nCheney went back to school and earned a bachelor’s and master’s in political science from University of Wyoming. The couple was married in 1964.\n\nCheney is survived by Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney and seven grandchildren.\n\nA veteran Washington power broker\n\nCheney began honing his inside power game – at which he became a master – as an aide to Nixon.\n\nHe was later picked by Donald Rumsfeld as his deputy White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford and then succeeded his mentor and close friend in the job in 1975 when Rumsfeld departed to become defense secretary. Cheney was instrumental in reviving their partnership in 2001 when he recalled Rumsfeld from the political wilderness to return to the Pentagon.\n\nWhile Democratic President Jimmy Carter was in the White House, Cheney decided to run for Congress and was elected to Wyoming’s sole US House seat in 1978. Cheney served six terms, rising to become House minority whip, and racked up a very conservative voting record.\n\nIn 1989, President George H. W. Bush, who had served with Cheney in the Ford administration, tapped him to serve as his defense secretary, calling him a “trusted friend, adviser.” He was confirmed by the Senate in a 92-0 vote.\n\nAs Pentagon chief, Cheney showed considerable skill in directing the US invasion of Panama in 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to push Iraq’s troops out of Kuwait. Following his stint as defense secretary, Cheney briefly explored a run for president in the 1996 election cycle but decided against it.\n\nDuring Clinton’s presidency, Cheney joined Dallas-based Halliburton Co. serving as its chief executive officer.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until the younger Bush decided to run for office that Cheney was chosen to lead the Republican candidate’s search for a running mate and, after initially turning down the job, ended up being added to the GOP ticket.\n\n“During the process, I came to the conclusion that the selector was the best person to be selected,” Bush said in the 2020 CNN film “President in Waiting.”\n\nCheney brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to areas where critics complained Bush was weak. As a former Texas governor, Bush had no elected experience in Washington and little military and foreign policy background compared with Cheney.\n\nEarly in Bush’s presidency, Cheney led a task force to develop the administration’s energy policy and sought to keep its records secret in a fight that lasted Bush’s first term and went all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n\nHe was, however, at odds with Bush over the issue of same-sex marriage, saying that it should be left to the states to decide. In a 2004 town hall, he noted his daughter Mary’s sexual orientation reportedly for the first time publicly, according to The Washington Post. “With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone.People … ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to,” he said, the Post reported.\n\nIn one of the most notorious moments in his personal life, which added to his grizzled legend in 2006, Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner in the face with birdshot, causing relatively minor wounds.\n\nHealth issues\n\nCheney’s health issues began in 1978, when he had his first heart attack at age 37 while running for Congress. Three more followed in 1984, 1988 and November 2000, just a few days into the Florida presidential ballot recount that resulted in a Bush-Cheney win.\n\nCheney at the time said that he’d be the “the first to step down” if he learned he’d be unable to do the job and had a resignation letter in case he was deemed incapacitated.Cheney completed both terms under Bush, attending Barack Obama’s inauguration in January 2009 in a wheelchair.\n\nA year after a fifth heart attack in 2010, Cheney received a heart pump that kept the organ running until his transplant in 2012.\n\nLife after the White House\n\nAfter leaving office, Cheney returned to private life, penning two memoirs — one about his personal and political career and the other about his struggles with heart disease as well as a book with his daughter, Liz. He became one of the most strident GOP critics of President Barack Obama, who had based his election campaign on promises to end the wars and other changes from what he called failed policies of the Bush-Cheney administration.\n\nYears later, Cheney was decrying his own party — especially its leadership’s response to the attack on the Capitol — when he returned to the US Capitol with then-Rep. Liz Cheneyon the one-year anniversary of January 6, 2021.\n\nIn a remarkable moment, Democrats lined up to greet the former Republican vice president and shake his hand. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hugged Cheney. The former vice president slammed Republican leaders in Congress, saying they do not resemble the leaders he remembered from his time in the body.\n\nIt was a scene that would have been unthinkable two decades earlier and an illustration of how the extraordinary changes in American politics wrought by Trump had made former bitter political foes find common cause in the fight for democracy.\n\n“It’s not leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Cheney said at the Capitol in 2022.\n\nCheney continued his criticism of Trump in the following years and went as far as to endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat and Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential campaign.

Bush, as a “calm and steady presence” and “among the finest public servants of his generation.” \n\nCheney built long lists of both admirers and adversaries during his years in politics, a career that went from him growling at reporters to stop calling him a “moderate” to endorsing Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe Washington Post on Tuesday remembered Cheney peevishly telling an aide to “call the Post and tell them I’m a conservative” after the paper described him as a “moderate” during his days as a congressman from Wyoming. Cheney, and later his daughter Liz, have been very insistent upon describing themselves as the metaphysical center of conservatism.\n\n“Calm” is the word most often associated with Cheney after his death on Tuesday at age 84, but once upon a time, another word was branded upon him by the media with comical fervor: “gravitas.” The media narrative of Cheney’s ascent to the vice presidency was that he supposedly added “gravitas” to a ticket headed by the boyish and goofy George W. Bush.\n\n“Mr. Cheney’s most obvious asset as a running mate is that he could provide an instant gravitas injection for a ticket headed by Governor Bush. Given Mr. Cheney’s role in running the gulf war, his presence would shore up Mr. Bush in his weakest areas, foreign policy and national security,” the New York Times said in 2000, setting the tone for media coverage of Cheney’s role in the Bush campaign.\n\nAnother label the Left liked to slap on Cheney was “evil.” His redemption in the eyes of the Left for claiming “there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump” and calling Trump a “coward” in a political ad for his daughter, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), was surely the strangest of the Strange New Respect awards handed out by left-wing media, considering that Dick Cheney was routinely compared to Darth Vader and Satan during his vice presidency. Hollywood turned him into an inhuman supervillain, a rapacious oil baron who started wars to line his own pockets.\n\nCheney was involved in politics, business, and the intersection between the two for a very long time, so some of the seeming paradoxes and contradictions in his long career were a result of the political pendulum swinging, the world changing around him. His entry into public service came during the Nixon Administration. He was a deputy assistant to President Gerald Ford, Secretary of Defense for the elder President Bush, and then vice president to the younger. The world changed a great deal around him during those years – in no small part because of decisions he made and advice he gave.\n\nThe War on Terror under George W. Bush was the defining event of Dick Cheney’s career. Those were the years that crystallized the Left’s hatred of him as a warmonger. In the years afterward, as a growing segment of the Republican electorate came to see the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as expensive follies, Cheney’s star among conservatives began to sink. Cheney was far too intelligent to be surprised by this, but he did not seem to like it very much. The animosity between Cheney and Trump Republicans was mutual.\n\nThe new breed of Republicans who found themselves at odds with Dick Cheney could take a moment to understand the figure he cut as vice president – a man of steely determination and tremendous political skill during a time of fear and confusion after 9/11. Conservatives of a certain age can remember a time when we very much wanted Darth Vader in the White House.\n\nAnother word used in every Cheney eulogy is “powerful.” The vice presidency is a job often mocked for its ceremonial and ineffective nature. Friend and foe alike regard Cheney as one of the most powerful vice presidents to ever hold the office, and not just because he had President George W. Bush’s ear. He got things done. He went into political negotiations with a strong hand. He was good at handling hostile press. In his hour of power, Cheney demonstrated many of the qualities that today’s Republicans admire.\n\nCheney was the “architect” of the Iraq War – another word you’ll see a lot of today! – and that particular exercise of power is not as popular among Republican voters as it once was. The relationship between Republicans and their political elites has changed profoundly over the past two decades, and the War on Terror is a key factor in that change. Cheney was the face of the war, so he has taken a lot of the heat for it.\n\nIt is a sad irony that Cheney ended his time in politics by endorsing Kamala Harris, who was absolutely no one’s idea of a powerful, effective, or intelligent vice president. The Cheney family’s political calculations are their own to explain or defend, but for what it’s worth, the elderly Cheney seemed genuinely horrified by the events of January 6, perhaps seeing them as an assault on the system he devoted much of his long life to serving and protecting.\n\nThe media is remembering Cheney today as “divisive” and “controversial,” which is what they say about every Republican. It’s more true of Cheney than most because he had a hand in events that have shaped the modern world, for good and ill.\n\nRepublicans, Democrats, and America itself have changed a great deal since Dick Cheney signed on with the Nixon Administration. His career demonstrated how yesterday’s moderate becomes today’s extremist, and yesterday’s conservative icon can become today’s Kamala Harris voter.","summary":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney was eulogized on Tuesday by his running mate, former President George W.

Alex Padilla rules out run for California governor","text":"Sen. Alex Padilla finally put the rumors about a potential run for California governor to rest: He’s not running.\n\n“It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I’m choosing to not run for governor of California next year,” Padilla said in a speech at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, Nov. 4.\n\n“I choose not just to stay in the Senate. I choose to stay in this fight because the Constitution is worth fighting for. Our fundamental rights are worth fighting for,” Padilla said.\n\nPadilla had brushed aside growing speculation in recent weeks that he would jump into the race for California’s chief executive, saying his focus was on Proposition 50, the redistricting ballot measure before California voters on Tuesday.\n\nWithout a clear, strong frontrunner emerging in the race for California governor yet, Padilla was considered to be a formidable candidate should he have gotten in the race.\n\nBut Padilla ended that speculation Tuesday, chastising the Trump administration and the president’s policies in his speech.\n\n“Countless Californians have urged me to do everything I could to protect California and the ‘American dream’ from a vindictive president who seems hellbent on raising costs for working families, rolling back environmental protections, cutting access to health care, jeopardizing reproductive rights,” said Padilla.\n\nThe U.S. senator also recalled the now infamous press conference in Los Angeles held by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials in June, amid the administration’s ramped-up immigration enforcement efforts in Southern California.\n\nPadilla was forcibly removed from the press conference when he tried to ask questions. Video showed Padilla kneeling on the ground after being removed from the room, before officers pushed him to the ground and handcuffed him with his arms behind his back.\n\n“As alarming as that experience was, not just for me and my family but for most people who have seen the video, countless people have told me I’m glad you’re fighting for us. I’m glad you’re there, Padilla said.\n\nPadilla, 52, was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 when the seat was vacated by then-Sen. Kamala Harris to become the country’s vice president. He ran for, and won, a full six-year term in 2022, becoming California’s first Latino to hold a full-term seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRaised in Pacoima, the son of Mexican immigrants, Padilla’s entry into politics in the early 1990s was fueled by the politics of the late 1980s and early 1990s San Fernando Valley and L.A., amid the city’s growing Latino base.\n\nThose politics were defined in part by another intense era of anti-immigrant sentiment. Proposition 187, a 1994 California ballot initiative approved by voters, aimed to deny undocumented immigrants access to public services, including education, health care and social services. It also required reporting of suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\nThe courts ultimately struck it down, but the fervor propelled Padilla and many in his generation into public service. He would join protests against Proposition 187 in the early ’90s, ultimately finding a path into politics and government, managing political campaigns for several legislative candidates and serving as a field representative for then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nNow that Padilla is not running — and with Harris also forgoing a run — attention turns back to those who have already declared their candidacies.\n\nFormer U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, former Fox News host Steve Hilton, former Rep. Katie Porter, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa have been trending toward the top of recent polling, although no one has boasted a massive lead.\n\nRyan Carter contributed to this report. \n\nThis is a breaking news story.

Liz Cheney, publicly condemned President Donald Trump. At the time, Liz Cheney was chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, but she faced a mutiny after bucking the party with her criticisms of Trump regarding the Capitol riots. She went on to lose her seat in 2022, despite her father making a cameo in a campaign ad on her behalf, in which he continued to criticize Trump.\n\nAccording to Gurdon, when Liz Cheney lost, it represented “an almost complete break” from her father’s old Republican Party.\n\n“That [election] was sort of a moment when the Republican Party showed that it had had it with the old Bush era and the Dick Cheney era,” Gurdon said. “It was rid of the Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, … that whole side of it, and moving in the direction of Donald Trump.”\n\nDick Cheney was so distant from the Republican Party that he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

According to Business Insider, the CEO tied Palantir&apos;s success to its mission of helping everyday Americans, who he argued often get \"screwed\" by policies such as open borders that directly affect their lives. Karp praised Palantir employees as advocates for free speech and for \"fighting for the right side of what should work in this country — meritocracy, lethal technology.\" He argued those values have enabled the company to \"give normal Americans venture-quality results.\" PALANTIR&apos;S CEO WARNS THE US IS FACING A &apos;LEGITIMATION CRISIS&apos; AS DEFENSE EXPERTS MEET AT REAGAN FORUM Moving into more political territory, Karp touched upon some of the work Palantir has done alongside the United States government, including supporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in its operations. \"We power ICE,\" he said. \"We&apos;ve supported Israel. OK, these are very controversial. I don&apos;t know why this is all controversial, but many people find that controversial.\" Karp also defended the Trump administration&apos;s strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats, urging a refocus on average Americans when addressing immigration. \"If fentanyl was killing 60,000 Yale grads instead of 60,000 working-class people, we&apos;d be dropping a nuclear bomb on whoever was sending it from South America,\" Karp said. \"At Palantir, we are on the side of the average American who sometimes gets screwed because all the empathy goes to elite people, and none of it goes to the people actually dying on our streets. And that&apos;s why, when you have an open border, it means that the average poor American earns less.\" TRUMP DEFENDS LABELING ANTIFA A &apos;TERRORIST ORGANIZATION&apos; AS HE TARGETS LEFT-WING EXTREMISM Addressing his \"fellow progressives,\" Karp warned that although they may believe that open borders are going to make the country better, \"they&apos;re actually [representing] elite people instead of the working class.\" \"To believe our Constitution does not give us a right to stop 60,000 deaths a year of working-class men and women, is insane. This country is right to stop that. To the extent we’re involved in these efforts, I and many Palantirians are proud,\" he added. Despite backing former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; campaign in 2024, Karp is now a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and his immigration policies. During a CNBC appearance Tuesday ahead of New York City&apos;s mayoral election, he took a shot at newspapers he believes are helping Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani. During an appearance on Fox Business&apos; \"The Claman Countdown\" last month, Karp defended his support of Trump against detractors.

Axios reports the book, by journalist Michael Steinberger, traces how Karp went from a self-described progressive to going \"full MAGA.\" Although Karp called the biography \"mostly true\" but \"not all true,\" he argued its author has a little bit of \"Trump derangement syndrome.\" \"I support the president a lot, and [the author] thinks I&apos;ve gone nuts,\" Karp said.

Alex Padilla announced Tuesday that he will not run for California governor next year, ending months of speculation about the possibility of the Democrat vying to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I am choosing to not run for governor of California next year,\" Padilla told reporters outside his Senate office in Washington. Padilla instead said he will focus on countering President Trump's agenda in Congress, where Democrats are currently in the minority in both the House and Senate, but hope to regain some political clout after the 2026 midterm elections. \"I choose not just to stay in the Senate. I choose to stay in this fight because the Constitution is worth fighting for. Our fundamental rights are worth fighting for. Our core values are worth fighting for. The American dream is worth fighting for,\" he said. Padilla said his decision was influenced by his belief that under President Trump, \"these are not normal times.\" \"We deserve better than this,\" he said. Padilla's decision to bow out of the 2026 governor's race will leave a prominent name out of an already crowded contest with many contenders but not a clear favorite. For much of the year, the field was essentially frozen in place as former Vice President Kamala Harris pondered whether she would run, with many donors and major endorsers staying out of the game. Harris said at the end of July that she wouldn't run. But another potential candidate — billionaire developer Rick Caruso — remains a question mark. Caruso said Monday night that he was still considering running for either governor or Los Angeles mayor, and will decide in the next few weeks. \"It's a really tough decision,\" Caruso said. \"Within a few weeks or so, or something like that, I'll probably have a decision made. It's a big topic of discussion in the house with my kids and my wife.\" Major Democratic candidates include former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, current California Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former state Controller Betty Yee and wealthy businessman Stephen Cloobeck. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative commentator Steve Hilton are the most prominent Republicans running. Amid fire recovery aftermath, immigration raids and a high-octane redistricting battle, California voters have yet to turn their attention to next year's gubernatorial matchup, despite the vast power that Newsom's successor will wield. California is now the world's fourth-largest economy, and policy decisions in the Golden State often have global repercussions. Newsom is nearing the end of his second and final term. Recent polling shows the contest as wide open, with nearly 4 in 10 voters surveyed saying they are undecided, though Porter had a slight edge as the top choice in the poll. She and Bianco were the only candidates whose support cracked the double digits. Candidates still have months to file their paperwork before the June 2 primary to replace Newsom. Known for soft-spoken confidence and a lack of bombast, Padilla's public profile soared in June after he found himself cuffed by federal agents, at the center of a staggering viral moment during a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Despite identifying himself, Padilla was tackled after trying to interrupt Noem with a question. The manhandling of California's senior senator was filmed by a staffer and broadcast around the world, provoking searing and widespread condemnation. Days later, Vice President JD Vance joked about the incident and referred to Padilla — his former Senate colleague — as \"Jose Padilla,\" a misnaming that Padilla suggested was intentional and others characterized as racist. The event put Padilla on the national spotlight and rumors of Padilla's interest in the gubernatorial race ignited in late August. Padilla told reporters Tuesday that he received an \"outpouring of encouragement and offers of support for the idea\" of his candidacy and that he had \"taken it to heart\" Alongside his wife, Angela, the senator said he also heard from many people urging him to keep his fight going in Washington. \"Countless Californians have urged me to do everything I could to protect California and the American Dream from a vindictive president who seems hell-bent on raising costs for working families, rolling back environmental protections, cutting access to healthcare, jeopardizing reproductive rights and more,\" he said. Padilla said he had listened. \"I will continue to thank them and honor their support by continuing to work together for a better future,\" he said.

Maybe just enough weight as Bush-Cheney lost the 2000 popular vote but won the presidency on the strength of 537 votes in the Florida recount. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney moved into the White House.\n\nIn the next few months, the team enacted much of its campaign agenda, passing the Bush tax cuts and making substantial progress on the president’s education initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act. At that point, just eight months into the term, the Bush-Cheney administration seemed oddly without direction, with little else to do. I recall writing a story in late August 2001 about the president’s “values initiative,” part of which included holding tee-ball games on the White House lawn.\n\nThen came September 11, 2001, and Bush, Cheney, and the nation had an urgent new direction for the future. Cheney was at the White House when it happened; Bush was in Florida on a meaningless trip to promote child reading. From that moment on, Cheney took a leading role in formulating what became known as the Global War on Terror.\n\nIt would take too long to recount all the details. But first, the United States attacked Afghanistan and found and killed every person who planned, executed, financed, or otherwise aided or abetted 9/11. That is what Bush and Cheney began, but after making initial progress, the mission went on and on, became bogged down in nation building, and in more than seven years failed to find and kill the one man most responsible for the attack — Osama bin Laden.\n\nMeanwhile, around the White House, there was talk suggesting that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had some connection to 9/11 and that there was some link between Saddam and al Qaeda. Then the White House argued that Saddam had WMD, weapons of mass destruction, which in a mad dictator’s hands created an intolerably dangerous situation for the United States. Cheney became the administration’s most aggressive promoter of invading Iraq, toppling Saddam, and neutralizing the weapons.\n\nEveryone knows what happened then. The intelligence was wrong, there were no WMD, and the war in Iraq turned into a disaster. That was not because of any failure by the U.S. military; they performed beautifully, but because Bush and Cheney had been dreadfully wrong about the premise for invading. Here is what Bush wrote about it in his memoir, Decision Points:\n\nI knew the failure to find WMD would transform public perception of the war. While the world was undoubtedly safer with Saddam gone, the reality was that I had sent American troops into combat based in large part on intelligence that proved false. That was a massive blow to our credibility — my credibility — that would shake the confidence of the American people. No one was more shocked or angry than I was when we didn’t find the weapons. I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it. I still do.\n\nAfter a huge loss in the 2006 midterm elections, Bush and Cheney tried to salvage the situation in Iraq with a “surge” of U.S. troops. But the war ended in a massive failure. And then, as fate would have it, as the Bush-Cheney administration entered its final stretch, the economy nearly collapsed. Disaster upon disaster. By the time of the 2008 election, Bush had a job approval of 24.6%, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.\n\nIn the case of Cheney, here was a man with broad and deep knowledge of how the world and the U.S. government worked, who dedicated himself to protecting the United States in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack in history, who meant well, and who made terrible mistakes that ensured his time in office would be seen as a failure.\n\nCheney’s time in office also changed Republican politics. It is impossible to imagine the 2016 GOP primary race unfolding as it did without the legacy of the Bush-Cheney administration. The Bush-Cheney team was in the field in 2016 in the person of Jeb Bush. Candidate Donald Trump took great delight in bashing Jeb, and he was remarkably effective at it.\n\nTrump called the Iraq war “a big, fat mistake,” and Republican crowds applauded. He called the entire Bush-Cheney administration a “disaster.” He dumped all over the Bush-Cheney legacy and went on to win the Republican nomination. Things had changed.\n\nStill, Cheney actually supported Trump as the Republican nominee in 2016. Only after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot did Cheney declare Trump a “coward” and a “threat to our republic.” Cheney ultimately cast his last vote for president for Kamala Harris in 2024. \n\nBy then, Cheney’s brand of Republican politics, whatever you might think of it, had receded far into the past. The man who was Gerald Ford’s chief of staff half a century earlier could find no place in today’s GOP politics. The bitter irony was that Cheney, with the misadventure in Iraq and the calamitous end of the Bush-Cheney administration, had himself contributed to creating Trump’s Republican Party.","summary":"DICK CHENEY’S COMPLICATED LEGACY.&#160;When George W.

He was reportedly surrounded by his wife of 61 years, Lynne, and daughters, Liz and Mary.\n\nCheney's political career spanned multiple critical roles in Washington: Vice President of the United States (2001–2009) under George W. Bush; Secretary of Defense (1989–1993) under George H.W. Bush, overseeing the Gulf War; White House Chief of Staff (1975–1977) for President Gerald Ford; and US Congressman representing Wyoming (1979–1989).\n\nAs Vice President, Cheney became one of the most consequential holders of the office, credited with fundamentally reshaping the role into one of immense political power. He was a central architect of the so-called “War on Terror” following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, strongly advocating for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. This stance led many to view him as the de facto power behind the throne, driving policies that included an expansive view of executive authority and controversial measures like secret detentions and the establishment of the Guantanamo Bay prison.\n\nBorn in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1941, Cheney's life was also marked by persistent cardiovascular issues. He suffered a total of five heart attacks between 1978 and 2010 and received a heart transplant in 2012.\n\nDespite his decades-long commitment to the Republican establishment, Cheney made headlines in recent years for his fierce opposition to Donald Trump. In a notable television ad, he stated that “in the 246-year history of our nation, there has never been an individual who posed a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.” In a final political maneuver that surprised many, he endorsed and voted for the Democratic candidate, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush released a statement, calling Cheney a “calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges,” adding, “I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best.”","summary":"Richard \"Dick\" Bruce Cheney, a towering figure in Republican politics for over three decades and the 46th Vice President of the United States, died Monday night at the age of 84.","url":"https://en.mercopress.com/2025/11/04/former-us-vp-dick-cheney-dies-aged-84","image":"https://en.mercopress.com/data/cache/noticias/107638/600x315/cheny.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 20:44:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"uy","sentiment":0.579},{"id":375777002,"title":"Caldwell: The Democrats Have Become The Party Of The Elite, Not The People","text":"Fox News Political Analyst Gianno Caldwell joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to give his take on former President Barack Obama hitting the campaign trail over the weekend to stump for Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey.\n\n“It’s really a two-faced statement from Barack Obama, who tried to tell the brothers, Black men specifically, that they should be voting for Kamala Harris, otherwise it was a sexist, you know all these isms if they didn’t do it, but now he was like no vote against a Black woman And you know, it’s just really hard to keep up with the Democrats these days They don’t seem to have any principles whatsoever And it just slows you whatever the moment is, we’ve seen this time and time again We’ve seen it with Joe Biden.

Known for her staunch conservative beliefs, Liz famously took a stand against former President Donald Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election. Her dedication to upholding the U.S. Constitution and democratic values led to her removal as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, following her continued criticism of Trump. Despite the backlash, Liz remained vocal in her political pursuits, even endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, distinguishing herself from many in her party. In recognition of her service and commitment to democracy, President Joe Biden awarded her the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2025. Liz Cheney is often seen as a divisive figure, prioritizing principles and integrity over party alignment.\n\nMary Cheney: Personal and Political Life\n\nMary Cheney, Dick Cheney’s younger daughter, is recognized for both her personal life and her behind-the-scenes political involvement. As an openly lesbian woman, she has been a pivotal voice in LGBTQ+ rights discussions within conservative spheres. Her sexual orientation has occasionally sparked public interest and familial tension, particularly during debates over gay marriage with her sister Liz. Nonetheless, the Cheney family has consistently shown support and love for Mary and her family. Politically, Mary has been active in Republican consulting and various nonprofits, advocating for causes like the Keystone XL pipeline through her firm, BKM Strategies. While less publicly visible than Liz, Mary Cheney maintains a significant influence in Republican advocacy and consulting circles.\n\nFamily Dynamics and Public Statements\n\nThe Cheney family’s public life sometimes highlights personal and political disagreements, especially regarding LGBTQ+ rights and Trump’s presidency. Liz Cheney’s outspoken opposition to Trump contrasted with other family members, including Dick Cheney, who joined her in denouncing Trump’s actions related to the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection. Liz has responded to threats against her by emphasizing the dangers posed by aggressive political rhetoric, stating, “this is how dictators destroy free nations.” Dick Cheney’s public support for Kamala Harris in 2024 marked a notable deviation from typical Republican endorsements, reflecting a historic moment in the family’s public engagements.\n\nDon’t Miss | Meet Miami Dolphins Coach Mike McDaniel Family: Partner and Children Revealed","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn November 3, 2025, former Vice President Dick Cheney passed away, leaving&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Cheney Sisters: Unveiling the Legacy and Latest Updates on Liz and Mary first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/the-cheney-sisters-unveiling-the-legacy-and-latest-updates-on-liz-and-mary/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dick-Cheneys-Daughters-Liz-and-Mary-Legacy-and-Updates.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 20:11:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.383},{"id":375780484,"title":"Trump has been silent about Dick Cheney’s death.

He was surrounded by wife Lynne and their daughters Liz and Mary, according to People. His family said Cheney’s cause of death was complications from pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease. \n\nIt was the quiet close to a very loud life.\n\nCheney has an impressive five decades in America’s public service with an amazing array of political credentials within his career: from White House chief of staff, defense secretary, congressman, and finally the most influential vice president in modern U.S. history.\n\nAs The Washington Post noted, when 9/11 struck, Cheney reshaped the office itself by letting the American people into what was once a private space. Suddenly, the public had a front-row seat to how decisions were being made at such a crucial time in history.\n\nBut the same force that made him indispensable also made him divisive. To admirers, he was the steady hand that guided America through chaos. To critics, he was the architect of an era defined by war, secrecy, and surveillance. \n\nFormer President George W. Bush praised his former VP in his statement after his death. He said that Cheney was “a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges… a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,” Reuters reported.\n\nMike Pence, a vice president who once cited Cheney as a model, wrote that he and his wife Karen were “saddened to learn of Vice President Cheney’s passing.” Pence further stated, “He was an American patriot who championed the men and women in our Armed Forces and the importance of maintaining a strong national defense for America’s security at home and abroad.”\n\nStatement by President George W. Bush on Vice President Dick Cheney:\nThe death of Richard B. Cheney is a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends.

Bush Presidential Center (@TheBushCenter) November 4, 2025\n\nHowever, not everyone was ready to eulogize and remember Cheney’s service for his country. The White House has so far remained silent, offering no formal statement. And that pointed silence speaks volumes. It is a heavy, wordless reminder of how hard it is to fit Cheney neatly into the American story.\n\nAnd then there’s Donald Trump, another absent voice. The two men’s feud became one of the most dramatic Republican splits of the last decade.\n\n Once the face of GOP establishment power, Cheney turned on Trump after January 6, saying there had “never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic.” AOL reported that Cheney even voted Democratic in 2020, a symbolic but stinging rejection of his party’s future under Trump.\n\nCheney said, “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.”.\n\nFor his part, Trump has long mocked Cheney and his daughter Liz, calling them “warmongers” and “losers.” \n\nBut why was Cheney so divisive?\n\nNewsweek reported back in 2015 that his biggest lie was “There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.” The unvetted speech led to a war and the loss of so many lives, both American and foreign.\n\nHis policies shaped a generation. Cheney’s decisions are still debated in classrooms, podcasts, and living rooms.\n\nCheney remains divisive even after his death. And maybe that’s the truest measure of his impact, a man whose shadow was never meant to fade quietly.","summary":"Dick Cheney is gone at 84.

In addition, several important political contests are on Tuesday ballots, including the New York City mayor’s election, gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, and California’s Prop. 50 to decide whether officials can redraw the state’s congressional map to favor Democrats.\n\nDisney on Monday sought a temporary thaw in tensions with Google Inc. after the two sides failed last week to strike a new distribution contract covering Disney’s television channels on Google’s YouTube TV.\n\n“Despite the impasse that led to the current blackout, we have asked YouTube TV to restore ABC for Election Day so subscribers have access to the information they rely on,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement Monday. “We believe in putting the public interest first and hope YouTube TV will take this small step for their customers while we continue to work toward a fair agreement.”\n\nA Google spokesperson was not immediately available for a comment.\n\nABC’s “World News Tonight With David Muir” is one of television’s highest rated programs.\n\nMore than 10 million YouTube TV customers lost access to ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels late Thursday after a collapse in negotiations over distribution fees for Disney channels, causing one of the largest recent blackouts in the television industry.\n\nThe two TV giants wrangled for weeks over how much Google must pay to carry Disney’s channels, including FX, Disney Jr. and National Geographic. YouTube TV — now one of the largest pay-TV services in the U.S. — has balked at Disney’s price demands, leading to the outage.\n\nYouTube TV does not have the legal right to distribute Disney’s networks after its last distribution agreement expired.\n\n“We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement last week. “We continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV.”\n\nYouTube has said that should the outage stretch for “an extended period,” it would offer its subscribers a $20 credit.\n\nSpanish-language TelevisaUnivision-owned channels were knocked off YouTube TV in a separate dispute that has lasted more than a month. Televisa has appealed to high-level political officials, including President Trump and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr.\n\nLast year, after Disney-owned channels went dark on DirecTV in a separate carriage fee dispute, Disney offered to make available to DirecTV subscribers its ABC coverage of the sole presidential debate between President Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDirecTV viewed ABC’s offer as something of a stunt, noting the debate would be streamed. DirecTV countered by asking Disney to instead make all of its channels available.\n\nThat fee dispute resulted in a 13-day blackout on DirecTV, one that was resolved a few days later.\n\nHeightened tensions in the television industry have led to numerous blackouts.\n\nIn 2023, Disney and Charter Communications were unable to iron out a new contract by their deadline, resulting in a 10-day blackout of Disney channels on Charter’s Spectrum service. A decade earlier, Time Warner Cable subscribers went nearly a month without CBS-owned channels.\n\nProgramming companies, including Disney, have asked for higher fees for their channels to help offset the increased cost of sports programming, including NFL and NBA contracts. But pay-TV providers, including YouTube have pushed back, attempting to draw a line to slow their customers’ ever-increasing monthly bills.\n\nMore than 40 million pay-TV customer homes have cut the cord over the last decade, according to industry data. Many have switched to smaller streaming packages. YouTube TV also benefited by attracting disaffected customers from DirecTV, Charter Spectrum and Comcast.

Bush but found himself at odds with the direction of the Republican Party later in his life. He was a critic of President Donald Trump following the January 6, 2021, riot at the United States Capitol building and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential bid. His Trump critiques drew rebuke from MAGA. But many of the Trump supporters paid tribute to the former vice president on Tuesday.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nCheney, 84, died on November 3 due to complications of pneumonia, cardiac and vascular disease, his family wrote in a statement. \n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney’s family wrote in a statement: “For decades, Dick Cheney served our nation, including as White House Chief of Staff, Wyoming’s Congressman, Secretary of Defense, and Vice President of the United States. Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing. We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”\n\nHis death drew a wave of reactions on social media, with many Republicans honoring his legacy, which was also questioned by many of his critics.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham was among those Trump supporters who paid tribute to Cheney.\n\n“I had the privilege and pleasure of knowing Vice President Cheney personally and professionally for many years. We spent a lot of time hunting together, and during the course of our political lives, we interacted often. I enjoyed his company tremendously and always believed he was one of the smartest people I’ve ever known,” Graham wrote.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney attends an interview in Jackson, Wyoming, on July 15, 2011.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson offered prayers and condolences to the Cheney family during a press conference.\n\n“Scripture is very clear we give honor where honor is due, and someone who gave their life, loved their country, loved serving their country in so many capacities. As you know, Dick Cheney served as vice president. He served as a secretary of defense. He served as a congressman, of course, from Wyoming and as the youngest chief of staff to any president in the history of the country,” he said. “And so the honor is certainly due to him.”\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, wrote to X that Cheney was “dedicated to keeping this country safe.”\n\n“My condolences and prayers are with the entire Cheney family, who have lost their patriarch and a public servant who made a real difference,” he said.\n\nSome Trump supporters were more critical.\n\n“NeoCon Globalists Unite,” Steve Bannon wrote in a post to Gettr in response to an article about MSNBC’s Morning Joe paying tribute to him.\n\nFormer Congressman George Santos wrote in a post to X, “Dick Cheney will meet his maker and will have lots of explaining to do. I wish his family well all things considered, but I haven’t and won’t ever shed a tear for a war criminal of his ilk.”\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote on X: “I admired Vice President Cheney for his integrity and his love of our country. I am grateful that I had the chance to serve with him twice — when he was Secretary of Defense for President George H.W. Bush at the end of the Cold War — a triumphant time for America and its values. And then when as Vice President, he helped to chart a course to protect America after the dark days of 9/11. He was an inspiring presence and mentor who taught me a great deal about public service.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, wrote to X: “Dick Cheney was a lifelong public servant who believed very deeply in our country and brought his considerable knowledge and intelligence to its service.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nDetails about his funeral have not been announced.","summary":"MAGA offered mix reactions to the death of the former vice president on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/maga-reacts-dick-cheney-death-10991293","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-590101237_ec52eb.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 19:17:24","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.302},{"id":375794164,"title":"Former United States Vice President Dick Cheney dies at 84","text":"Cheney forged an influential role in the traditionally inconsequential job and was a major power behind the throne as Bush thrust America into the so-called war on terror, with a dark underbelly of renditions, torture and the Guantanamo prison site. A hate figure to many on the left, he made a remarkable pivot toward the end of his life, opposing Donald Trump&apos;s ultimately successful campaign to return to the White House in 2024. Cheney&apos;s daughter Liz Cheney, a former congresswoman from Wyoming, said her deeply Republican father had voted for Trump&apos;s Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. Cheney, also a former congressman and defense secretary, \"died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease,\" according to a family statement. As 46th vice president, Cheney served for two terms between 2001 and 2009. The job is often frustrating for ambitious politicians, but Cheney&apos;s Machiavellian skills gave him considerable sway. He helped usher in an aggressive notion of executive power, believing the president should be able to operate almost unfettered by lawmakers or the courts, particularly during wartime. It was an approach that saw Bush enter military quagmires in Afghanistan and Iraq, and prompt major controversy over his impact on civil liberties. Bush on Tuesday hailed his former vice president as \"among the finest public servants of his generation\" and \"the one I needed\" when in the White House. Cheney was \"a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,\" Bush added. Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on 30 January 1941, Cheney grew up mostly in the sparsely populated western state of Wyoming. He attended Yale University but dropped out of the prestigious east coast school and ended up earning a degree in political science back home at the University of Wyoming. He spent ten years in congress as a representative for Wyoming before being appointed defense secretary by George H.W. Bush in 1989. Cheney presided over the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Gulf War, in which a US-led coalition evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait. As vice president, Cheney brought his neo-conservative ideology to the White House and played a greater role in making major policy decisions than many of his predecessors in the role. Cheney was one of the driving forces behind the decision to invade Iraq following the 11 September 2001 attacks by Al-Qaeda on New York and Washington. His inaccurate claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction fuelled the drumbeat for war ahead of the 2003 US invasion. Seen as Bush&apos;s mentor on foreign policy, Cheney remained loyal to his former boss and was a staunch defender of Bush-era policies. In a 2015 interview, Cheney said he had no regrets over the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and credited a so-called \"enhanced interrogation program\" for the capture of 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden in 2011 during Barack Obama&apos;s presidency. download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"Cheney became one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history as George W.

Cheney had a long career in government and was considered by many as one of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history.\n\nCheney started his career in politics in 1968 in the office of William Steiger, a Republican representative from Wisconsin, before joining the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was at the time the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. By 1974, Cheney was brought on to the team of Gerald Ford, who had assumed the US presidency that year following the resignation of Richard Nixon. He followed Rumsfeld as Ford’s White House chief of staff in 1975, at the age of 34.\n\nCheney then went on to spend over a decade serving as a member of the House of Representatives. He represented a district in Wyoming until 1989 when he was appointed secretary of defense by the then-president, George H.W. Bush. \n\nThis experience would prove critical to Cheney’s subsequent selection as running mate by Bush’s son, George W. Bush, for his 2000 presidential campaign as the Republican candidate. Bush Jr. went on to win that election, and his partnership with Cheney would ultimately prove incredibly significant in reshaping US foreign policy in the Middle East. \n\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the neo-conservative movement gained momentum in Washington and found an ally in Cheney. He was a founding signatory of the so-called Project for the New American Century, which became a major forum for neo-conservative thinking. The goal was to promote US interests – namely spreading democracy abroad – through a bold deployment of military power.\n\nThis interventionist foreign policy culminated in the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Considered by some to be a shadow president, Cheney had a huge influence over Bush Jr. He reportedly played a major role in convincing Bush to go to war in Iraq.\n\nCheney expressed no regrets about this decision, calling critics of the war “spineless” in 2005. But a majority of Americans considered this decision to be a grave error. \n\nThe war is estimated to have cost the US well over US$1 trillion (£800 billion), and as much as US$3 trillion when taking the wider regional conflict it sparked into account. The war also led to the deaths of as many as 600,000 Iraqi civilians, according to an estimate published by the Lancet medical journal. \n\nThere were also questions about whether Cheney had a conflict of interest. He had previously served as the chief executive of Halliburton, a company that won billions of dollars in US military contracts to restore Iraq’s oil sector – this included some of the biggest military logistics contracts in history. Cheney was even accused of coordinating preferential awarding of contracts to the company, though he and Halliburton denied it.\n\nHe was also accused of circumventing due process, constitutional checks and congressional oversight during his time as vice-president. A prominent example of this was his involvement in a programme to intercept domestic communications without a judicial warrant. \n\nCheney was also widely disliked in the intelligence community. Many of these people resented the way he undermined the CIA by, for example, instructing subordinates in the agency to transmit raw intelligence directly to his office.\n\nChange of heart?\n\nGiven that Cheney believed executive power needed to be expanded, there was a degree of irony in his decision to endorse the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election. The winner of that election, Donald Trump, also favours an executive unencumbered by institutions. \n\nBut Cheney clearly had his limits. While Bush Jr. was reticent to publicly attack Trump, Cheney became one of his harshest critics. This was especially so after Liz Cheney, his daughter and a now former congresswoman, voted to impeach Trump after the insurrection of January 6 2021, which made her enemy number one in Trump’s eyes. \n\nHowever, some critics claim that it was Cheney’s shadow presidency that paved the way for Trump’s aggressive expansion of the executive power of the presidency. Along the way, he wielded the power of the vice-presidency in a way not been seen before or, arguably, since. \n\nCheney was not just powerful but prone to operating clandestinely, even creating an independent operation inside the White House. All of this helped fuel mistrust of the government.\n\nAs Cheney advanced in age, his stances seemed to be softening from the Darth Vader image he had embraced as vice-president. More than half of the multi-million fortune that Cheney gained from selling his Halliburton stock options, for example, was donated to the Cardiac Institute at George Washington University. \n\nCheney, who survived five heart attacks and eventually a heart transplant, was seen a political survivor. But the Republican party that he had led in the shadows has been transformed. Once a towering figure in the conservative movement, today his brand of conservatism is a relic of the past.","summary":"The former US vice-president is widely regarded as the driving force behind George W.

In short, Tuesday is the most significant election in the United states since last November, experts say, when President Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate. It’s also being viewed as a way to gauge the pulse of voters a year before the 2026 elections, when control of the House, Senate and governor’s offices will be up for grabs.\n\n“Tuesday has become an early referendum on Trump,” said Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. “There are different states, different turnouts and different issues. But that’s the overall theme.”\n\nA CNN poll Monday showed voters aren’t happy. Trump’s approval rating was 37% — the lowest of his second term. A majority of voters said his polices have worsened the economy, hurt America’s standing in the world, and that his immigration crackdown has “gone too far.” But the same voters had an even lower view of the Democratic Party, giving it just a 29% approval rating.\n\nFive key races to watch Tuesday:\n\n1) Proposition 50\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom’s statewide ballot measure, if approved by voters, would redraw California’s congressional districts in a way that could cost five Republicans their seats, tilting the state’s delegation from the current 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans to 48-4 after next year’s elections. Newsom and Sacramento Democrats placed the measure on the ballot after Trump pushed governors in red states, including Texas, to redraw their district lines this year, instead of every 10 years after the Census, as had been the custom, in an attempt to boost Republicans’ chances of keeping control of the House of Representatives next year.\n\nIf Democrats win the House in 2026, they could impeach Trump again, haul his cabinet secretaries under oath before investigations, and block funding for everything from new offshore oil drilling to expanded immigration detention centers. Republicans led by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — who worked hard to create California’s non-partisan commission that draws district lines — have fought Prop 50. But Democrats have outraised opponents $122 million to $44 million. Polls show the measure leading in California, a state Trump lost by 20 points last November. If it passes, Newsom’s national profile as a 2028 presidential candidate will be boosted.\n\n2) Virginia\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Youngkin will leave office due to term limits in this purple state. Former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat and former CIA agent who has focused on cost-of-living issues, is running to succeed him against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Trump supporter and former Marine. Spanberger is leading in the polls, particularly as the federal government shutdown has hit Virginia residents hard. Whoever wins will be the first female governor in Virginia history.\n\nA big question mark: Whether Democrat Jay Jones can hang on to beat Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in the attorney general’s race. Jones led until last month. But the National Review published text messages Jones sent to a fellow state lawmaker wishing a Republican state leader and his family would die. Jones also was cited in 2022 for driving 116 mph. As part of a plea deal, he performed 500 hours of community service for his own political action committee. His image and poll numbers have suffered.\n\n3) New Jersey\n\nThe other marquee governor’s race Tuesday is in the Garden State, where a close battle is playing out. Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a four-term member of Congress and former Navy helicopter pilot, faces Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state Assemblyman who came within 3 points of defeating incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.\n\nA normally reliable blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee for president in every election since 1992, New Jersey has occasionally elected Republicans as governor, most recently Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013.

But Harris only defeated Trump there in November by 5.9%, and Ciattarelli, with Trump’s backing and solid fundraising, is looking for a breakthrough win.\n\n4) New York City\n\nThree candidates are vying to run America’s most populous city: Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67, a Democrat who won four statewide elections, only to resign his Albany office in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations; Republican Curtis Sliwa, 71, who founded the Guardian Angels crimefighting group; and state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist who has built momentum with charismatic speeches, clever social media and promises to raise taxes on billionaires, provide free bus service and a pass a $30 minimum wage. Mamdani, a darling of progressives nationwide, is leading in the polls, even though many traditional Democratic leaders, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have not endorsed him or Cuomo.\n\n5) Pennsylvania\n\nFew states are more important in winning the presidency than Pennsylvania.

In short, Tuesday is the most significant election in the United states since last November, experts say, when President Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate. It’s also being viewed as a way to gauge the pulse of voters a year before the 2026 elections, when control of the House, Senate and governor’s offices will be up for grabs.\n\n“Tuesday has become an early referendum on Trump,” said Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. “There are different states, different turnouts and different issues. But that’s the overall theme.”\n\nA CNN poll Monday showed voters aren’t happy. Trump’s approval rating was 37% — the lowest of his second term. A majority of voters said his polices have worsened the economy, hurt America’s standing in the world, and that his immigration crackdown has “gone too far.” But the same voters had an even lower view of the Democratic Party, giving it just a 29% approval rating.\n\nFive key races to watch Tuesday:\n\n1) Proposition 50\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom’s statewide ballot measure, if approved by voters, would redraw California’s congressional districts in a way that could cost five Republicans their seats, tilting the state’s delegation from the current 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans to 48-4 after next year’s elections. Newsom and Sacramento Democrats placed the measure on the ballot after Trump pushed governors in red states, including Texas, to redraw their district lines this year, instead of every 10 years after the Census, as had been the custom, in an attempt to boost Republicans’ chances of keeping control of the House of Representatives next year.\n\nIf Democrats win the House in 2026, they could impeach Trump again, haul his cabinet secretaries under oath before investigations, and block funding for everything from new offshore oil drilling to expanded immigration detention centers. Republicans led by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — who worked hard to create California’s non-partisan commission that draws district lines — have fought Prop 50. But Democrats have outraised opponents $122 million to $44 million. Polls show the measure leading in California, a state Trump lost by 20 points last November. If it passes, Newsom’s national profile as a 2028 presidential candidate will be boosted.\n\n2) Virginia\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Youngkin will leave office due to term limits in this purple state. Former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat and former CIA agent who has focused on cost-of-living issues, is running to succeed him against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Trump supporter and former Marine. Spanberger is leading in the polls, particularly as the federal government shutdown has hit Virginia residents hard. Whoever wins will be the first female governor in Virginia history.\n\nA big question mark: Whether Democrat Jay Jones can hang on to beat Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in the attorney general’s race. Jones led until last month. But the National Review published text messages Jones sent to a fellow state lawmaker wishing a Republican state leader and his family would die. Jones also was cited in 2022 for driving 116 mph. As part of a plea deal, he performed 500 hours of community service for his own political action committee. His image and poll numbers have suffered.\n\n3) New Jersey\n\nThe other marquee governor’s race Tuesday is in the Garden State, where a close battle is playing out. Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a four-term member of Congress and former Navy helicopter pilot, faces Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state Assemblyman who came within 3 points of defeating incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.\n\nA normally reliable blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee for president in every election since 1992, New Jersey has occasionally elected Republicans as governor, most recently Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013. Sherrill holds a narrow lead in the polls. But Harris only defeated Trump there in November by 5.9%, and Ciattarelli, with Trump’s backing and solid fundraising, is looking for a breakthrough win.\n\n4) New York City\n\nThree candidates are vying to run America’s most populous city: Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67, a Democrat who won four statewide elections, only to resign his Albany office in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations; Republican Curtis Sliwa, 71, who founded the Guardian Angels crimefighting group; and state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist who has built momentum with charismatic speeches, clever social media and promises to raise taxes on billionaires, provide free bus service and a pass a $30 minimum wage. Mamdani, a darling of progressives nationwide, is leading in the polls, even though many traditional Democratic leaders, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have not endorsed him or Cuomo.\n\n5) Pennsylvania\n\nFew states are more important in winning the presidency than Pennsylvania.

For voters and political watchers alike, the races have taken on huge importance at a time of tense political division, when Democrats and Republicans are sharply divided over the direction of the nation. Despite President Trump not appearing on any ballots, some viewed Tuesday's races as a referendum on him and his volatile second term in the White House. In New York, self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, 34, was favored to win the mayoral race after winning the Democratic ranked-choice mayoral primary in June. Such a result would shake up the Democratic establishment and rile Republicans in near equal measure, serving as a rejection of both former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a more establishment Democrat and Mamdani's leading opponent, and Trump, who has warned that a Mamdani win would destroy the city. On the eve of voting Monday, Trump threatened that a Mamdani win would disrupt the flow of federal dollars to the city, and took the dramatic step of endorsing Cuomo over Curtis Sliwa, the Republican in the race. \"If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Monday. A vote for Sliwa \"is a vote for Mamdani,\" he added. \"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\" Mamdani, a Ugandan-born naturalized U.S. citizen and New York state assemblyman who already defeated Cuomo once in the primary, has promised a brighter day for New Yorkers with better public transportation, more affordable housing and high-quality childcare if he wins. He has slammed billionaires and some of the city's monied interests, which have lined up against him, and rejected the \"grave political darkness\" that he said is threatening the country under Trump. He also mocked Trump's endorsement of Cuomo — calling Cuomo Trump's \"puppet\" and \"parrot.\" Samantha Marrero, a 35-year-old lifelong New Yorker, lined up with more than a dozen people Tuesday morning at her polling site in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn to cast her vote for Mamdani, whom she praised for embracing people of color, queer people and other communities marginalized by mainstream politicians. Marrero said she cares deeply about housing insecurity and affordability in the city, but that it was also \"really meaningful to have someone who is brown and who looks like us and who eats like us and who lives more like us than anyone we've ever seen before\" on the ballot. \"That representation is really important.\" And she said that's a big part of why people across the country are watching the New York race. \"We're definitely a beacon in this kind of fascist takeover that is very clearly happening across the country,\" she said. \"People in other states and other cities and other countries have their eyes on what's happening here. Obviously Mamdani is doing something right. And together we can do something right. But it has to be together.\" Elsewhere on the East Coast, voters were electing governors in both Virginia and New Jersey, races that have also drawn the president's attention. In the New Jersey race, Trump has backed the Republican candidate, former state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli, over the Democratic candidate, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, whom former President Obama recently stumped for. Long a blue state, New Jersey has been shifting to the right, and polls have shown a tight race. In the Virginia race, Trump has not endorsed Republican candidate Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears by name, but has called on voters to \"vote Republican\" and to reject the Democratic candidate, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a 46-year-old former CIA officer whom Obama has also supported. \"Why would anyone vote for New Jersey and Virginia Gubernatorial Candidates, Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, when they want transgender for everybody, men playing in women’s sports, High Crime, and the most expensive Energy prices almost anywhere in the World?\" Trump recently wrote on Truth Social, repeating some of his favorite partisan attacks on Democrats from the presidential campaign trail last year. At a rally for Spanberger in Norfolk, Va., over the weekend, Obama put the race in equally stark terms — as part of a battle for American democracy. \"We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don't need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,\" Obama said. \"We all have more power than we think. We just have to use it.\" Voting was underway in the states, but with some disruptions. Bomb threats disrupted voting in some parts of New Jersey early Tuesday, temporarily shutting down a string of polling locations across the state before law enforcement determined the threats were hoaxes. In California, voters were being asked to change the state Constitution to allow Democrats to redraw congressional maps in their favor through 2030, in order to counter similar moves by Republicans in red states such as Texas. Leading Democrats, including Obama and Gov. Gavin Newsom, have described the measure as an effort to safeguard American democracy against a power grab by Trump, who had encouraged the red states to act, while opponents of the measure have derided it as an anti-democratic power grab by state Democrats. Trump has urged California voters not to cast ballots by mail or to vote early, arguing such practices are somehow \"dishonest,\" and on Tuesday morning suggested on Truth Social that Proposition 50 itself was unconstitutional. \"The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,\" Trump wrote, without providing evidence of problems. \"All 'Mail-In' Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are 'Shut Out,' is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Both individually and collectively, the races are being closely watched as potential indicators of political sentiment and enthusiasm going into next year's midterm elections, and of Democrats' ability to get voters back to the polls after Trump's decisive win over former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Voters, too, saw the races as having particularly large stakes at a pivotal moment for the country. Michelle Kim, 32, who has lived in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn for three years, stood in line at a polling site early Tuesday morning — waiting to cast her vote for Mamdani. Kim said she cares about transportation, land use and the rising cost of living in New York, and appreciated Mamdani's broader message that solutions are possible, even if not guaranteed. \"My hope is not, like, 'Oh, he's gonna solve, like, all of our issues,'\" she said. \"But I think for him to be able to represent people and give hope, that's also part of it.\" Lin reported from New York, Rector from San Francisco. Times staff writer Jenny Jarvie in Atlanta contributed to this report.","summary":"Voters were casting ballots in high-stakes elections Tuesday, including for mayor of New York and new congressional maps in California.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-11-04/mamdani-cuomo-new-york-new-jersey-virginia-elections","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ad7cd7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5367x3578+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2F0c%2F7880e0154337b91dac7affcd87ff%2F2243986855.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 18:37:45","author":"Kevin Rector,Summer Lin","authors":["Kevin Rector","Summer Lin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":375756684,"title":"Battle for New York: Mamdani, Cuomo clash in pivotal mayoral race","text":"A win would make Mamdani New York’s first Muslim and youngest mayor in decades\n\nVoters in New Jersey and Virginia will choose their next governors on Tuesday in a pair of races that will serve as an early gauge of the American electorate's mood after President Donald Trump's norm-shattering nine months in office.In New York City's mayoral race, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, faces 67-year-old Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary, four years after resigning as New York state's governor in disgrace. The campaign has laid bare the Democratic Party's generational and ideological divides as it seeks to rehabilitate its damaged brand.And in California, voters will decide whether to give Democratic lawmakers the power to redraw the state's congressional map, expanding a national battle over redistricting that could determine which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives after next year's midterm elections.Polls close first in Virginia at 7 p.m. ET (0000 GMT), followed by New Jersey, New York and California throughout Tuesday evening.Democrats will be watching Tuesday's results carefully, with the party locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find consensus on the best path out of the political wilderness.Live EventsUnderscoring the stakes for Democrats, former President Barack Obama, still the party's most popular figure, headlined 11th-hour rallies over the weekend in New Jersey and Virginia, exhorting voters to elect Democrats to counter what he branded the Republican Trump's \"lawlessness.\"More than 3 million people voted early in Virginia, New York and New Jersey, in each case far exceeding the totals from four years ago. In New York City, there were 735,000 ballots cast, according to the city elections board, more than four times the number in 2021.The New Jersey race has emerged as the most hotly contested campaign, with opinion polls showing Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a congresswoman and former Navy pilot, holding a narrow lead over her Republican challenger, former state lawmaker and small-business owner Jack Ciattarelli.The day's other races appear less competitive. In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, a former Democratic U.S. representative, held a comfortable opinion polling lead over the state's Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican.Voters in Stafford, Virginia, which Democrat Kamala Harris won by less than one point in last year’s presidential elections, said Trump's efforts to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally and impose costly tariffs on imports of foreign goods were top of mind.\"This is an election about state and local issues but I'm leaning more Democratic this year because you don't hear enough from Republicans in Virginia disagreeing with what is going on at the federal level,\" said Dan Gomez, a 63-year-old computer network engineer who describes himself as an independent.Gomez, who voted Democrat in last year's presidential election, said he's upset about Trump's deployment of masked immigration agents and National Guard soldiers in some cities.Jennifer Manton, 47, said she had voted for Trump all three times he ran for president, and backed Republican candidates on Tuesday, citing Trump's tariffs as a major issue. In New York, Mamdani, who was a little-known lawmaker in New York's state legislature only a few months ago, has led by double digits over Cuomo, with Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, 71, a distant third in most opinion polls.California's ballot measure, Proposition 50, which would install a new Democratic-backed congressional map that aims to flip five Republican seats in response to a similar move by Texas, is also widely expected to pass.AFFORDABILITY, TRUMP WEIGH ON RACES While Tuesday's results will offer some insight into the mood of American voters, the midterm elections are a year away, an eternity in politics.\"There's nothing that's going to happen in Virginia or New Jersey that's going to tell us much about what will happen in a congressional district in Missouri or a Senate race in Maine,\" said Douglas Heye, a Republican strategist.For Democrats, Tuesday's candidates offer a chance to assess differing playbooks.Spanberger and Sherrill, both moderate Democrats with backgrounds in national security, have put Trump front-and-center in their campaigns, seeking to harness anger at the president's no-holds-barred agenda.Trump has given each some recent grist during the government shutdown, freezing billions of dollars in funding for a badly needed rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York and threatening to fire federal workers, many of whom live in Virginia. Mamdani, running an insurgent campaign, has proposed more ambitious left-wing policies, including freezing rents for nearly a million apartments, taxing the wealthy and making the city's buses free. On Monday, Trump endorsed Cuomo, urging supporters to vote for the former governor and repeating his threat to cut federal funds to his native city if Mamdani wins, although the president has no legal power to unilaterally refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress.Despite their ideological differences, nominees have relentlessly focused on the cost of living, an issue that has remained top of mind for voters after last year's presidential election.\"Whether it's in New York City, whether it's in Virginia, whether it's in New Jersey – frankly, throughout the country – Democratic candidates are focused on the economy, focused on affordability, focused on the issues that are really driving anxiety in this country right now,\" Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in an interview.For Republicans, Tuesday's elections will test whether the voters who powered Trump's victory in 2024 will still show up when he is not on the ballot himself.But Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears, each running in Democratic-leaning states, have faced a difficult conundrum: criticizing Trump risks losing his supporters, but embracing him too closely could alienate moderate and independent voters who disapprove of his policies.Trump remains unpopular: 57% of Americans disapprove of his job performance, a Reuters/Ipsos poll shows. But Democrats are not gaining support as a result, with respondents evenly split on whether they would favor Democrats or Republicans in 2026.

Bush, and then again when Cheney was vice president.\n\n“I admired Vice President Cheney for his integrity and his love of our country,” Rice wrote as a caption for a photo of the two of them together.\n\n“As Vice President, he helped to chart a course to protect America after the dark days of 9/11,” Rice continued. “He was an inspiring presence and mentor who taught me a great deal about public service. Most of all, I will remember Dick Cheney as a mentor and a friend. I will remember his toughness but also his sense of humor. He was indefatigable in his determination to defend this country and patriotic to his core.”\n\n“I am grateful for having had him in my life,” she concluded. “May he rest in peace.”\n\n“Spent 8 years working on the Bush-Cheney team and wouldn’t have had it any other way,” bioengineer Rory Cooper wrote. “Dick Cheney served his country faithfully and with honor. RIP sir.”\n\nOthers expressed their admiration for Cheney despite not knowing him personally.\n\n“Dick Cheney’s years of public service and dedication to American leadership left a lasting impact on the conservative project, the US and the world,” former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote. “He was a successful energy field services CEO who, when called, sacrificed again to serve our country. Susan and I extend our condolences and prayers to his family and friends at this time.”\n\n“Dick Cheney was a genuine conservative, a patriotic Republican, and a man who made hard calls in tough times, even when it meant being excommunicated from the GOP,” the Lincoln Project wrote. “Our thoughts are with his family.”\n\nThe Lincoln Project was referring to Cheney’s vehement opposition to Trump. He endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\n“RIP Vice President Dick Cheney,” talk show host Hugh Hewitt wrote. “He was a great man and a servant of the Republic.”\n\nThen, a third group emerged, Cheney’s critics, who continued to condemn his actions in life following his death.\n\n“Dick Cheney will meet his maker and will have lots of explaining to do,” former Rep. George Santos wrote. “I wish his family well all things considered, but I haven’t and won’t ever shed a tear for a war criminal of his ilk.”\n\nCheney is largely credited with the strategy behind the Iraq War.\n\n“Dick Cheney, one of the most evil men in modern history, died yesterday at 84,” talk show host Alex Jones said in a video post. “Whereas I don’t really like to ever celebrate anybody’s death, this is just another bellwether sign of the old, evil, neocon, global establishment, dying and passing away.”\n\n“So we’re talking about an evil, evil, evil person,” Jones added. “I’m not going to judge him. From God’s position, I don’t know he’s burning in hell, but he’s burning in hell in my opinion.”\n\nCheney is survived by his wife, Lynne, and his daughters, Liz and Mary.","summary":"The death of former Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday prompted a variety of reactions on Tuesday.

The campaign has laid bare the Democratic Party’s generational and ideological divides as it seeks to rehabilitate its damaged brand.\n\nAnd in California, voters will decide whether to give Democratic lawmakers the power to redraw the state’s congressional map, expanding a national battle over redistricting that could determine which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives after next year’s midterm elections.\n\nPolls close first in Virginia at 7 p.m. ET (2 p.m. Hawaii time), followed by New Jersey, New York and California throughout this evening.\n\nDemocrats will be watching today’s results carefully, with the party locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find consensus on the best path out of the political wilderness.\n\nUnderscoring the stakes for Democrats, former President Barack Obama, still the party’s most popular figure, headlined 11th-hour rallies over the weekend in New Jersey and Virginia, exhorting voters to elect Democrats to counter what he branded the Republican Trump’s “lawlessness.”\n\nMore than 3 million people voted early in Virginia, New York and New Jersey, in each case far exceeding the totals from four years ago. In New York City, there were 735,000 ballots cast, according to the city elections board, more than four times the number in 2021.\n\nThe New Jersey race has emerged as the most hotly contested campaign, with opinion polls showing Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a congresswoman and former Navy pilot, holding a narrow lead over her Republican challenger, former state lawmaker and small-business owner Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nThe day’s other races appear less competitive. In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, a former Democratic U.S. representative, held a comfortable opinion polling lead over the state’s Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican.\n\nVoters in Stafford, Virginia, which Democrat Kamala Harris won by less than one point in last year’s presidential elections, said Trump’s efforts to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally and impose costly tariffs on imports of foreign goods were top of mind.\n\n“This is an election about state and local issues but I’m leaning more Democratic this year because you don’t hear enough from Republicans in Virginia disagreeing with what is going on at the federal level,” said Dan Gomez, a 63-year-old computer network engineer who describes himself as an independent.\n\nGomez, who voted Democrat in last year’s presidential election, said he’s upset about Trump’s deployment of masked immigration agents and National Guard soldiers in some cities.\n\nJennifer Manton, 47, said she had voted for Trump all three times he ran for president, and backed Republican candidates today, citing Trump’s tariffs as a major issue. In New York, Mamdani, who was a little-known lawmaker in New York’s state legislature only a few months ago, has led by double digits over Cuomo, with Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, 71, a distant third in most opinion polls.\n\nCalifornia’s ballot measure, Proposition 50, which would install a new Democratic-backed congressional map that aims to flip five Republican seats in response to a similar move by Texas, is also widely expected to pass.\n\nWhile today’s results will offer some insight into the mood of American voters, the midterm elections are a year away, an eternity in politics.\n\n“There’s nothing that’s going to happen in Virginia or New Jersey that’s going to tell us much about what will happen in a congressional district in Missouri or a Senate race in Maine,” said Douglas Heye, a Republican strategist.\n\nFor Democrats, today’s candidates offer a chance to assess differing playbooks.\n\nSpanberger and Sherrill, both moderate Democrats with backgrounds in national security, have put Trump front-and-center in their campaigns, seeking to harness anger at the president’s no-holds-barred agenda.\n\nTrump has given each some recent grist during the government shutdown, freezing billions of dollars in funding for a badly needed rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York and threatening to fire federal workers, many of whom live in Virginia.\n\nMamdani, running an insurgent campaign, has proposed more ambitious left-wing policies, including freezing rents for nearly a million apartments, taxing the wealthy and making the city’s buses free. On Monday, Trump endorsed Cuomo, urging supporters to vote for the former governor and repeating his threat to cut federal funds to his native city if Mamdani wins, although the president has no legal power to unilaterally refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress.\n\nDespite their ideological differences, nominees have relentlessly focused on the cost of living, an issue that has remained top of mind for voters after last year’s presidential election.\n\n“Whether it’s in New York City, whether it’s in Virginia, whether it’s in New Jersey – frankly, throughout the country – Democratic candidates are focused on the economy, focused on affordability, focused on the issues that are really driving anxiety in this country right now,” Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in an interview.\n\nFor Republicans, today’s elections will test whether the voters who powered Trump’s victory in 2024 will still show up when he is not on the ballot himself.\n\nBut Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears, each running in Democratic-leaning states, have faced a difficult conundrum: criticizing Trump risks losing his supporters, but embracing him too closely could alienate moderate and independent voters who disapprove of his policies.\n\nA recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump remains unpopular with 57% of Americans disapproving of his job performance. But Democrats are not gaining support as a result, with respondents evenly split on whether they would favor Democrats or Republicans in 2026.","summary":"Voters in New Jersey and Virginia will choose their next governors today in a pair of races that will serve as an early gauge of the American electorate&#8217;s mood after President Donald Trump&#8217;s norm-shattering nine months in office.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/11/04/breaking-news/trumps-agenda-faces-early-test-in-elections-in-several-states/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/web1_20251104_WEB__USA-ELECTION-NEW-YORK-MAYOR.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 17:48:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.03}]}
