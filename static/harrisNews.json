Both of the riders have been detained by police as the officers are treated by medical personnel on the scene. \n\nElsewhere, officers were reportedly struck by fireworks as they worked to break up a violent crowd, while protesters were filmed brandishing 3D creations of Trump's severed head on a pole.\n\nExtraordinary footage shows at least five Waymo self-driving cars being set alight and vandalized, prompting an indefinite shutdown of Los Angeles St north of Arcadia, and south of Alameda amid safety concerns about the lithium batteries. \n\nOne protester repeatedly smashed the driver side window of a Waymo which had been surrounded by demonstrators as flames engulfed another car nearby.\n\n'Burn, burn, burn,' the protesters cheered.\n\nAt the Los Angeles City Hall, authorities on horseback were locked in a tense standoff with even more demonstrators, sparking fears from local law enforcement officers that they were in for a 'rough night.'\n\nFurther arrests have been made throughout the Civic Center area of Downtown LA. \n\nProtesters gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center were warned that the LAPD incident commander had approved the use of 'less lethal munitions' to break up the crowd.\n\nThis came as authorities declared the area an 'unlawful assembly' and warned any protester who chose to stay would be subject to arrest. \n\nThe LAPD began issuing rolling dispersal orders and declaring some of the protests acts of 'unlawful assembly' as violence ramped up on Sunday afternoon. \n\nProtesters within regions now under a dispersal order have been warned to evacuate now or face arrest. \n\nDemonstrations even reached the upscale AC Hotel Pasadena by Sunday afternoon after the arrival of emergency vehicles.\n\nWhile that protest had not descended into violence, those who had gathered chanted 'ICE is not welcome here' and blasted songs in Spanish in a display of solidarity. \n\nAuthorities issued a separate warning that the city has been placed on 'tactical alert', meaning all of the department's officers are now on notice that they could be called up for service at any given moment. \n\nOfficers who are already on duty are not allowed to end their shift until they have been relieved by their commanders, and residents of Los Angeles are warned that low priority calls may go unanswered while the alert is ongoing. \n\nThese officers will now join the 2,000 California National Guard troops Trump earlier deployed to Los Angeles to quell the protests, which he called 'a form of rebellion.'\n\nTrump issued an extraordinary directive on Sunday vowing to 'liberate Los Angeles' from illegal aliens which have 'invaded and occupied a once great American city.'\n\nA combined effort led by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi will restore order, Trump said. \n\nHe has directed his key personnel to 'to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots.\n\n'Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free,' Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday afternoon.\n\nTrump lamented the current state of the city, expressing concern that 'a once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. \n\n'Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations.'\n\nBut he vowed 'these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve' as images emerge of troops on the ground in the downtown area of the city ready to defend the city from more violent demonstrations.\n\nThe president congratulated the National Guard on doing a 'great job' in the city in the early hours of Sunday morning, although they hadn't arrived yet. \n\nBut Governor Newsom shared a very different perspective just hours later, revealing he has urged Trump to 'rescind the order [and] return control to California.'\n\n'We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved,' Newsom said in his extraordinary rebuke.\n\n'This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they're actually needed.\n\n'These are the acts of a dictator, not a President.' \n\nMayor Karen Bass echoed those statements, telling CNN: 'This sows chaos that is not warranted nor needed in the city of Los Angeles.\n\n'It's as though troops were rolled out in a provocative manner and I do not see how that is helpful to Los Angeles right now, it's not the type of resources that we need in the city.\n\n'We do not need to have our city under siege.' \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris joined in on the Democrat pile-on on Sunday, denouncing the ICE raids which sparked the civil unrest.\n\n'Deploying the National Guard is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos,' Harris wrote in a statement on X. \n\n'In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump Administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.' \n\nEarly Sunday, the violence was limited to a small area in downtown Los Angeles, with the rest of the city of 4 million people largely unaffected. Since then, pockets of protests have began popping up in broader parts of the community.\n\nThe arrival of the National Guard and federal reinforcements follows days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount and neighboring Compton.\n\nHegseth had warned on Saturday that 'active duty Marines' were on 'high alert' as the riots created havoc on the streets. \n\nOn Sunday, Noem said the National Guard would 'keep peace and allow people to be able to protest but also to keep law and order.'\n\nThe troops included members of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense that showed dozens of National Guard members with long guns and an armored vehicle.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor´s office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.\n\nNewsom described Trump's decision to call in the National Guard as a 'provocative show of force' that would only escalate tensions. \n\nHe added that Hegseth's threat to deploy Marines on American soil was 'deranged behavior.' \n\nRioters have also been warned that the use of non-lethal munitions has been authorized to maintain order, prompting a warning from the LAPD urging people to 'leave the area' to avoid the 'pain and discomfort' such weapons can bring.\n\nBut the escalation comes in response to rioters using flaming projectiles and throwing rocks at authorities, as they set fire to cars in their path of destruction. \n\nThey were met by federal agents in riot gear and gas masks. The mob was warned to leave in both Spanish and English.\n\nTear gas and smoke filled the air as confrontations between immigration authorities and demonstrators extended into a third day.\n\nThese riots were set against the backdrop of Trump's latest immigration raid, targeting the safe haven of Los Angeles on Friday.\n\nDHS said in a statement that the recent ICE operations resulted in the arrest of 118 immigrants.\n\nTrump's border czar Tom Homan said those arrested included child sex offenders, gang members and national security threats.\n\n'They arrested a lot of bad people yesterday and today,' Homan asserted. 'We're making Los Angeles safer.'\n\nHoman also remarked that ICE agents were often wearing masks as they conducted raids because they were worried about their families being doxxed.\n\nBy Saturday night federal agents reported having arrested more than a dozen 'agitators who impeded agents in their ability to conduct law enforcement operations.","summary":"Horrifying scenes of violence have stretched into a third day and sparked a political war of words between Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14792657/los-angeles-anarchy-freeway-101-blocked-violent-clashes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/09/00/99164117-0-image-a-17_1749426479086.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/09/1233893888698203758/1024x576_MP4_1233893888698203758.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-09 01:28:44","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":329429692,"title":"Protests intensify in Los Angeles after Trump deploys hundreds of National Guard troops","text":"Los Angeles: Law enforcement officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in Los Angeles on Sunday as they gathered downtown in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard over the objections of the governor and mayor.The clashes came on the third day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 federal troops spurred anger and fear among some residents.By midday, hundreds had gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Centre in downtown Los Angeles, where people were detained after earlier immigration raids. Protesters directed chants of shame and go home at members of the National Guard, who stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields.After some protesters closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully.

On Sunday the show’s social media team put together the top 10 most-watched monologues from this season — and there are some truly great moments in the list.\n\nBill Burr: November 9, 2024\n\nBurr had the task of hosting the sketch series after the 2024 election, which saw Donald Trump assume the helm of the United States for the second time. He nearly immediately addressed the topic, telling the audience, “All right ladies, you’re 0 and 2 on this guy. But you learn more from your losses than your wins. Let’s get into the game tape.”\n\nIn reference to ensembles frequently worn by Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, who lost their election races to Trump, Burr added, “Ladies, enough with the pantsuit. OK? It’s not working! Stop trying to have respect for yourselves.”\n\n“You don’t win the office on policy; you gotta whore it up a little! I’m not saying go full Hooters,” he continued. “But find the happy medium between Applebee’s and your dad didn’t stick around. All right? You all know how to get a free drink.”\n\nTimothée Chalamet: January 26, 2025\n\nChalamet returned to “SNL” in January 2025 and spent a portion of his monologue poking fun at himself. He asked the cameras to zoom in on his face and noted he had a “little goatee, a little ‘stache.”\n\n“That’s 37 hairs right there,” Chalamet said. “Yeah, count it. I’m literally going to be 30 years old next year.”\n\nChalemet also joked about his recurrent awards losses for his turn as Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” \n\nWalton Goggins: May 10, 2025\n\nGoggins, who was fresh off the success of the third season of “White Lotus” when he hosted the show in May, spent part of his monologue on being a sex symbol in his 50s. “Some of my friends have even asked me, ‘Walton, what’s it like to become a sex symbol at 53 years old?’”\n\n“And you know what? If I’m being honest, it feels fantastic! At least, it did until I Googled myself and read some of the headlines.”\n\nThe actor also poked fun at headlines about his allegedly receding hairline (“I’ve had the same hairline since I was 7! It’s not receding. It’s holding its ground,” he explained) and celebrated his mother ahead of Mother’s Day.\n\nChris Rock: December 14, 2024\n\nRock, who is no stranger to “SNL” by any stretch of the imagination, was back on the soundstage in December. He lobbed a few verbal punches at Jake Paul, who had recently bested Mike Tyson in a boxing match.\n\n“Who is this Jake Paul? This 27-year-old punching a 60-year-old in the face. Is this what the white man has reduced himself to? Stop it! Who’s he going to fight next, Morgan Freeman? I hate Jake Paul. I got landlord hate for him,” Rock said.\n\nRock also tackled the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. “I really feel sorry for the family. Everybody’s fixated on how good-looking this guy looks. If he looked like Jonah Hill, no one would care. They’d already given him the chair already — he’d be dead. But he actually killed a man — a man with a family, a man with kids. I have condolences. This is a real person, you know? But you also got to go, ‘You know, sometimes drug dealers get shot.’”\n\nQuinta Brunson: May 3, 2025\n\n“Abbott Elementary” writer and creator Quinta Brunson hosted “SNL” in May and didn’t miss a moment to joke about her height. “Yeah, that’s right, I’m short,” Brunson, who is 4’11”, said. “You know, they even tried to cast me as a kid on ‘Abbott Elementary’, and I wrote that. But I love being short, and I want other short people to know the sky’s the limit. So, shorties, tonight, this one’s for us.”\n\nBrunson was also joined onstage by Sabrina Carpenter, who is 5’0\" for a musical number celebrating being short. \n\nNate Bargatze: October 5, 2024\n\nBargatze returned to “SNL” for the second time in October, and began his monologue by expressing his concern about the perils of DoorDash.\n\n“DoorDash is what’s gonna kill me,” he said. “I look at it like it’s Tinder, just scrolling through, seeing who’s open … I’m just laying there, like bring me a Blizzard now. I want it right now, lay it quietly on my porch, don’t let anybody in this house know I’m doing this, it cost 3 grand for this Blizzard. All right, I’ll pay it.”\n\nHe also admitted to placing multiple orders with different drivers at the same time. “Now I’m watching the GPS, and I’m like they’re gonna come at the same time. It’s my worst nightmare. I need one of them to get in a wreck, it happens. I see them both, they make the turn at the same time. I’m mortified. McDonald’s comes in, drops it off, Dairy Queen has to let him back out. He was just in the cul de sac, like I was having construction done at my house at 11 o’clock at night, just ‘Go ahead!’”\n\nShane Gillis: March 1, 2025\n\nGillis offered an uncomfortable monologue when he returned to “SNL” in March. He had jokes about Trump and Joe Biden, and also said putting on a Ken Burns documentary is “kryptonite to women. If you put that on, they will fall asleep immediately. They’re yapping a little bit, how about a little Ken Burns? That’s a [Bill] Cosby tip for you: Who needs roofies when we have Ken Burns presents the history of the buffalo on PBS?” \n\nPaul Mescal: December 5, 2024\n\nMescal’s monologue in December was a big hit. Mescal told the crowd he takes “great pride in being Irish” and proceeded to hit back at various negative stereotypes. \n\n“People also think the Irish hate British people,” he said. “That’s not true, we just don’t consider them people.”\n\nHe also said that Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish mascot isn’t offensive. “Not at all, we do the same thing with the Americans. In fact, my high school’s mascot was the ‘Fighting Fat-Asses,” Mescal explained.\n\nDave Chappelle: January 18, 2025\n\nChappelle delivered the longest monologue in the show’s history in January, and mostly focused on his reluctance to host the show for a fourth time, the wildfires that destroyed much of southern California, Donald Trump’s second term, and the life and legacy of President Jimmy Carter. \n\n“Do not forget your humanity. And please, have empathy for displaced people, whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine,” Chappelle said at the end of the nearly 17-minute-long delivery.\n\nAriana Grande: October 12, 2024\n\nGrande, who was in the middle of promoting the first installment of “Wicked” when she graced the “SNL” stage, poked fun at her status as a theater kid, “Well, it’s every theater kid’s dream to lose their virginity, but their second dream is, of course, to be in ‘Wicked’,” she told the crowd.\n\nGrande also insisted she wanted to keep things lowkey and let musical guest Stevie Nicks do all the singing… before launching into a song about keeping it lowkey. Grande offered impersonations of Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani.","summary":"Ariana Grande, Dave Chappelle, and Timothée Chalamet all make the list\n\n\nThe post &#8216;SNL&#8217; Shares Top 10 Most-Watched Monologues From 2024-25 Season | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/snl-shares-top-10-most-watched-monologues-from-2024-25-season-video/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ariana-grandesnl.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 22:33:43","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.054},{"id":329416190,"title":"DNC chair unloads on David Hogg in Zoom call: ‘It’s really frustrating’","text":"Democratic Party chair Ken Martin said Sunday that he wasn’t stepping down from the job after Politico obtained audio of a meeting at which Martin expressed doubts about his ability and willingness to unify the party.\n\nIn the audio recording, Martin lays the blame on the party’s continued infighting at the feet of one of his youngest colleagues, March for our Lives co-founder David Hogg, and claimed that Hogg had “destroyed” his ability to lead the party out of an electoral abyss it found itself in after 2024.\n\n“I don’t think you intended this, but you essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to. So it’s really frustrating,” Martin told Hogg on the Zoom call, according to Politico, after stating:“No one knows who the hell I am, right?”\n\n“I’m trying to get my sea legs underneath of me and actually develop any amount of credibility so I can go out there and raise the money and do the job I need to to put ourselves in a position to win,” claimed the chair on the call.\n\nOn the same Zoom, Martin would go on to make a frank admission: that he’d faced his first doubts about his desire to hold his job any longer.\n\n“I’ll be very honest with you, for the first time in my 100 days on this job … the other night I said to myself for the first time, I don’t know if I wanna do this anymore,” said Martin on the May 15 call.\n\nThe Independent reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the party released a statement from Martin to Politico, in which Martin said he was “not going anywhere.”\n\n“I took this job to fight Republicans, not Democrats,” said the chair, according to Politico. “As I said when I was elected, our fight is not within the Democratic Party, our fight is and has to be solely focused on Donald Trump and the disastrous Republican agenda. That’s the work that I will continue to do every day.” \n\nMartin’s gripes are at least somewhat grounded in reality. The relatively unknown Minnesota Democrat-Farmer-Labor party chair was selected to lead the party after 2024 over several other candidates including at least one with arguably better name recognition: Ben Wikler of neighboring Wisconsin’s Democratic Party. Since his election, Martin has not been timid from news cameras but has still struggled to step out of the shadow of Hogg, whose activism in the wake of the Parkland school shooting propelled him to national prominence long before Martin.\n\nHogg, as well, continues to generate headlines — further complicating Martin’s position. The brash, young DNC vice chair vowed earlier this year to support primary challenges against the party’s graying electeds in Congress, drawing immediate and visceral anger from the party’s chastened yet still powerful establishment. \n\nHogg and Martin personally clashed over this issue, and have apparently not reached an amicable compromise.\n\nThere’s also the issue of the party’s overall brand, which is in tatters after the 2024 election. A botched campaign season saw former President Joe Biden, wracked by physical and mental decline, run for re-election until the summer, well past any viable point for his party to hold a primary to select his replacement. He then was unceremoniously jettisoned from the Democratic ticket in favor of his former running mate, Kamala Harris, after he appeared lost and confused onstage during a debate with Donald Trump — who’d go on to win the general election.\n\nMartin and others face questions about why those closest to Biden, including Martin’s predecessor, insisted for months (years, even) that Biden’s decline was a right-wing conspiracy and a result of journalists ginning up a fake story. Harris’s defeat in 2024 also saw the party fail to make gains in the House while losing multiple seats in the Senate, ending a Democratic Senate majority.","summary":"Activist’s promise to challenge entrenched Democratic veterans ‘destroyed’ chair’s ability to unify party, Ken Martin claims","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/david-hogg-dnc-democrats-primaries-b2766109.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/08/21/34/GettyImages-2172670513.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/02h5txwf-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-08 22:28:01","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":329417068,"title":"Trump stumbles on steps up to Air Force One","text":"President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both stumbled as they boarded Air Force One on Sunday on their way to Camp David.\n\nThe stumble came after Trump gaggled with reporters in Hagerstown, Maryland, when he was asked if he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to the protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\n“Depends on whether or not there's an insurrection,” said Trump.\n\nA reporter asked if he believes there is an insurrection taking place. \n\n“No, no, but you have violent people,” he added. “And we're not going to let them get away with it.”\n\nAsked if he would deploy troops even without invoking the Insurrection Act, Trump said, “We’re going to have troops everywhere.

York noted how the news of this project received a lot of “deserved ridicule,” and that the party’s loss among voters stems from its “record” in advocating for policies like transgender rights and reparations.\n\nAn example York cited was when Trump highlighted how former Vice President Kamala Harris supported taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for imprisoned illegal immigrants during the presidential debate. York suggested that many voters likely thought that Trump was incorrect before discovering that he was telling the truth, and that the Democratic Party simply cannot make its “long record” of supporting policies like this “go away.”\n\nTHE ABOLITION OF DEMOCRATIC MEN\n\nAhead of the 2028 election, several potential Democratic presidential candidates like Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) have begun to shift toward the center in terms of policy, with York pointing to the governor calling it unfair for biological men to compete in women’s sports. However, York also questioned if this would work with voters given the party’s recent record, as one cannot simply “reinvent yourself in a day.”\n\nUFC 316 pic.twitter.com/Npxi9LXplw— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 8, 2025\n\nPresident Donald J.

Gov. Phil Murphy, who was first elected in 2017.\n\nThe primaries come as New Jersey voters appear to have grown weary after eight years of Democratic control, and kitchen-table issues such as crime, the cost of living and property taxes have risen to the fore — factors that could give the GOP an edge in the blue-leaning state.\n\nAmong the wide-open field of six Democrats and five Republicans, observers will be closely watching Trump-backed candidate Jack Ciattarelli to see if the president’s on-again, off-again Midas touch will help propel a MAGA Republican to be the next chief executive of the Garden State.\n\nCiattarelli, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2017 and narrowly lost to Murphy in 2021, has openly embraced Trump’s endorsement, as well as the president’s anointing of the former state rep as “100% MAGA.” The hopeful is sitting at a sturdy 44% among GOP voters in recent polling from Emerson College and The Hill.\n\nRounding out the frontrunners among Republicans is former conservative talk radio host Bill Spadea, who aggressively vied for Trump’s backing with Ciattarelli, and moderate state Sen. Jon Bramnick, whose district includes tony towns such as Bernardsville and Chatham.\n\nSpadea is polling around 18% among prospective voters, while Bramnick is at a meager 8%, leaving a strong opening for Ciatterelli to easily claim the GOP nod.\n\n“There is every chance that the Republican can win this year because there’s a sense of disgust,” longtime New Jersey political operative Hank Sheinkopf told The Post.\n\n“Jersey Dems are over the Murphy era — if they weren’t, his wife would be a senator,” Sheinkopf said, referring to the badly botched senatorial bid by New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy last year. \n\n“The GOP needs to be organized,” the expert said. \n\nLeading the pack among Democrats is Mikie Sherrill, a US representative in Monmouth County, former prosecutor and former Navy helicopter pilot.\n\nOther GOP contenders such as Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and US Rep. Josh Gottheimer of North Jersey were all polling neck-and-neck around between 9%-11% but far behind Sherrill, who held a comfortable lead at 28% in the same polls.\n\nSherrill is widely seen as this year’s establishment candidate and has enjoyed the support of much of the state’s Democratic Party luminaries.\n\n“The only one who can beat Ciattarelli is Mikie Sherrill. Her campaign is better, and she’s seen as a warrior,” Sheinkopf said.\n\n“Her profile is much more of what the state is looking for: someone with big balls, someone who stop the corruption, which has always been an issue, specifically with the pension system,” he said.\n\nThe New Jersey governor’s race — one of just two gubernatorial contests this year, with the other in Virginia — is being eyed as a referendum on Trump as well as Murphy, who has overseen a spike in energy costs and clumsily waded into the immigration debate in February when he claimed to be housing an illegal immigrant at his home.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Trump and Vice President JD Vance lost in New Jersey to Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz by just 6% — the best performance by a GOP ticket in the state since the early 1990s. Trump lost the Garden State in 2016, 2020 and 2024 but improved his performance with each contest.\n\nIn New Jersey, a traditionally a blue-leaning state which typically favors centrist Republican governors, voter registration is lopsided in favor of Democrats.\n\nAs of March, there were more than 2.4 million registered Democrats in the state, compared to just 1.6 million Republicans, although GOP registrations have inched up slightly in the past year.\n\nStill, despite its blue leanings, Republicans have won six of the past 11 governor’s races.\n\nJersey politics has particular rhythm, and Sherrill [and] Ciattarelli fit the picture’’ of a likely November matchup, Sheinkopf said.\n\n“Ciattarelli is organized like [GOP former Gov. Chris] Christie, he represents anger in voters. If he wins, it will be because he represents the moment,” he said.\n\nAs for the remaining Dems, “Fulop, forget it, Gottheimer has faded,” Sheinkopf said.\n\nBut “the one who could get in front of it is Ras Baraka. He’s from Newark and has a built-in voter base.”\n\nPollster John McLaughlin, CEO and Partner of McLaughlin & Associates, said he also likes Ciattarelli’s chances for governor, particularly given his strong support among Hispanics.\n\n“We did a poll for Univision among likely Hispanic voters, Ciattarelli was within single digits of the leading Democratic candidates,” McLaughlin told The Post. “Typically, Democrats win Hispanic voters two-to-one in New Jersey.”\n\nAlso boding well for the GOP in Jersey this year is the fact that Trump shockingly flipped diverse Passaic County in last year’s election, observers said. The county has a nearly 45% Hispanic population and went 74% for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n“Trump’s backing will help Ciattarelli, he will certainly win the Republican nomination,” McLaughlin said. “Trump wants to cut taxes, which is the leading issue in New Jersey.”\n\nTrump has heaped praise on Ciattarelli since endorsing him last month, calling him “a true champion for the people of your state” at a tele-rally ahead of early voting kicking off in New Jersey.\n\n“He’s been a friend of mine, and he’s been a real success story,” Trump said of the candidate’s successful medical publishing company.\n\nDemocratic hopefuls have sought to cast this year’s Trump-tinged governor’s race as a “MAGA battle,” claiming there’s “extremism in the GOP primary.”\n\nThe general election will be held Tuesday, Nov. 4.","summary":"Republicans are making a serious play for the New Jersey statehouse this year -- with a possibility for the MAGA wing of the party to make inroads in a state that has usually favored more moderate GOPers.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/08/us-news/maga-eyes-nj-governorship-as-tuesdays-primary-looms-dem-fatigue-sets-in/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/105925217.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 16:22:38","author":"Carl Campanile,Chris Nesi,Craig McCarthy","authors":["Carl Campanile","Chris Nesi","Craig McCarthy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":329342652,"title":"Marc Anthony endorses Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York City","text":"Latin superstar Marc Anthony is endorsing Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York City, Page Six has learned.\n\nTo coincide with Puerto Rico Day on Sunday, the “Ahora Quien” — who was born in East Harlem to Puerto Rican parents — threw his weight behind the former governor, citing Cuomo’s support for the island after a series devastating natural disasters.\n\nThe then-governor mobilized the New York National Guard to help with recovery after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the earthquakes of 2019 and 2020.\n\nIn a video to be played during Sunday’s festivities and reviewed by Page Six, the eight-time Latin Grammy winner called Cuomo “a proud New Yorker who has been in the forefront every single time that Puerto Rico needs help.”\n\n“I know for a fact that he stood by Puerto Rico not just in words, but in action, when he established the New York State Office for Trade and Tourism on the Island, deepening the relationship between New York and Puerto Rico.

The Republican Party needs to be “restored,” the group argues, to one without the “chaos and division that populism has unleashed.”\n\nIn other words, a party with choices that are not carbon copies of President Donald Trump and his frenetic, often defiant and anti-establishment governing style.\n\nAnd with just over 500 days until the 2026 midterm elections, the group has mobilized a grassroots campaign “to restore the party’s core conservative principles and reclaim its future.”\n\nIn California, it’s Willing, an Encinitas resident, leading those efforts.\n\n“We feel there are a lot of people who have been part of the Republican Party in the past but don’t feel there is a place for them anymore, or for people who have traditional conservative values, and they don’t see MAGA as being the same,” said Willing, referring to the “Make America Great Again” slogan linked to Trump.\n\nSo Willing, and Our Republican Legacy, has set out to recruit like-minded Republicans, with a goal of attending local GOP events and driving conversations about the party’s goals and future.\n\n“We want the debate, but we want it to be civil,” said Willing. “We want to try to work with the Republican Party the best we can, but it can be difficult sometimes when it gets caught up in MAGA or ‘our way or the highway’ mentalities.”\n\nThe group boasts big-name former Republican lawmakers among its founders and leadership team, including former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, former Vice Presidents Mike Pence and Dan Quayle and former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele.\n\n“Faced with the chaos and division that populism has unleashed in our party, we are stepping forward to give Americans a Republican alternative they can once again be proud to support,” said former Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican and one of the Our Republican Legacy founders.\n\nThe group also includes among its leadership former Sen. William Cohen, who served as defense secretary in the Clinton administration; former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024; and former Rep. Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican who backed Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThose Democratic connections are important to note, said Jon Fleischman, a veteran political strategist in California and former executive director of the state’s GOP.\n\n“One of the challenges for this group is they have to decide: Is it the case that Donald Trump is so bad that we’d rather have a liberal Democrat as president,” Fleischman said.\n\n“They want to have a conversation inside of the Republican Party, but they’ve made it clear they have no problem leaving the Republican Party, and that makes it harder for them to make their case because they are not loyal or diehard Republicans,” he said.\n\nBut former Rep. Mimi Walters, a founding member of Our Republican Legacy, was more optimistic that pro-Trump and anti-Trump camps can coexist.\n\nWalters — who climbed the ranks in Orange County politics and served two terms in Congress representing an Orange County seat before losing to now former Rep. Katie Porter in a 2018 blue wave election — likened the GOP divide to a married couple who might not share every viewpoint but still respect each other’s ideas.\n\n“The president has brought in many new people into our party and a lot of viewpoints in terms of populism, which absolutely there is a place for that. We want to be a big tent,” said Walters, who, when she was in Congress, voted to support Trump policies nearly 99% of the time, according to data from FiveThirtyEight, which in 2018 was a news site that analyzed political data.\n\n“We just want to also make sure that people know that our party stands for,” Walters added, noting that those values include adherence to the Constitution, fiscal responsibility, free enterprise and a “peace through strength” foreign policy strategy.\n\nThe group says it’s “deeply concerned about the future of our country,” on its website.\n\nBut its focus is on the future of the Republican Party.\n\nIn a recent op-ed, Danforth wrote said the country’s “core political well-being depends on the existence of a healthy two-party system.” Members of Our Republican Legacy, he said, are “may be Republicans in exile,” but they vow to “serve as the resistance to the new populist direction taken by the GOP.”\n\nFor now, it’s still fairly early days for Our Republican Legacy’s mobilizing efforts. The group convened in Washington, D.C., last week for what Willing described as a “kick-off” event.\n\nAlthough he’s a longtime Republican voter, Willing, 59, is making his first foray into Republican politics.\n\nBut he’s drawing on his experiences in the business world and his international travels as he heads up the group’s efforts to mobilize like-minded Republicans in California.\n\n“I didn’t want to just complain about the government,” Willing said.\n\n“All my experience tells me we are throwing away something valuable.”","summary":"The group was founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, former House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican lawmakers.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/08/anti-maga-republican-group-mobilizes-in-california-ahead-of-midterms/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OCR-L-ORLGROUP-0607-01_c85781.jpg?w=1024&h=576","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 14:00:22","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":329342556,"title":"DAVID MARCUS: CNN’s airing of ‘Good Night And Good Luck' proves it has learned nothing","text":"It takes a lot for me to object to a television program that includes gratuitous smoking and jazz, but CNN found the exception Saturday night with its breathtakingly sanctimonious live telecast of Broadway’s \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" This was as shameless as it gets. Many are familiar with the 2005 hit movie that the play, starring George Clooney, is based on, in which brave 1950s CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow takes on the red-scare baiting of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. CNN’s message was clear, they are the heroic journalists and President Donald Trump is McCarthy. TRUMP CALLS '60 MINUTES' GEORGE CLOONEY SEGMENT A 'PUFF PIECE' As if this metaphor wasn’t already incessantly slamming us in the head like a giant inflatable hammer for two hours, CNN’s resident media guru Brian Stelter wrote an entire column comparing McCarthyism to the current lawsuit against CBS News’ \"60 Minutes,\" whose extremely friendly (read: dishonest) edit of an interview with Kamala Harris could have tilted the 2024 election, according to Trump. \"The real-life drama recounted in the play took place at CBS, the same network that is currently being targeted by President Donald Trump,\" wrote Stelter. \"That’s one of the reasons why the play’s dialogue feels ripped from recent headlines.\" CNN’s media expert basically left out the whole part about \"60 Minutes\" editing a Kamala Harris interview to make her incoherent answers seem somewhat sensical, because for Stalter and CNN fighting against Trump is more important than journalistic integrity every day of the week. Even if Stelter, who once championed the absurd Biden White House lie that videos of decrepit Joe Biden were \"cheap-fakes,\" won’t say it, \"60 Minutes\" disgraced itself and lied to the American people. But there was Scott Pelley, the \"60 Minutes\" anchor on CNN, after the show, with an air of gravity and profound conceit, insisting that, \"if you have the courage to speak, we are saved. If you fall silent, the country is doomed.\" Do these people listen to themselves? Do they own any mirrors? CNN and most of the liberal legacy media spent the entirety of the first Trump presidential term fostering a fake Russian collusion story. They then spent the four years under Biden ignoring the fact that he was demonstrably unfit. Where on earth do these people get off lecturing us about journalism? Then, of course, there is the star of the show, George Clooney himself. This is the same George Clooney who lied about the president of the United States being a zombie until it became politically expedient to be honest. Just like CNN lied about Russiagate, just like \"60 Minutes\" lied about editing Harris, Clooney lied about Biden’s fitness. Because to these people, any lie is justifiable as long as it hurts Donald Trump. I really wish that was hyperbole, but it's not. Clooney has no contrition over his lies, and neither does CNN, Jake Tapper, Brian Stelter or Scott Pelley. They don’t think they did anything wrong. If they did, they wouldn’t be dressing themselves up as heirs to the courageous journalism of Murrow. After the play, there was an assemblage of journalists, speaking before journalism students about the importance of what they had just witnessed. Of course, the closest thing CNN had to a conservative was Brett Stephens, a nice guy, but widely acknowledged as the Washington Generals of conservative political punditry. Needless to say, they congratulated themselves on being so enlightened and brave and speaking truth to power, while the handful of people watching threw up a little in their own mouths. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION You almost have to admire the audacity of CNN. Just weeks after bombshell books and reporting finally confirmed the obvious about Biden’s incapacity and the liberal media’s lies, the network aired a play in which it dressed itself up as brave heroes of the newsroom. It's amazing. It’s also informative. This bizarre effort by CNN to paint itself in historical glory is proof positive that the network has learned nothing from its lies over the past eight years, and there is no reason to believe it will start being honest anytime soon. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This reckoning by the liberal press regarding their failure to tell the truth about Biden is over. In fact, it never really began, and if they had somehow dragged bag-a-bones Joe over the finish line and gotten him elected, we’d have likely never known a thing about it. There’s an old saying, when people tell you who they are, believe them. On Saturday night, CNN showed America exactly what they are: a shameless, unrepentant, and unreliable source for news.

Some have issued comments Trump's defenders consider vicious threats. All could have to brace for government probes, unless it turns out the president was merely trying to get a rise out of them through his online threats.\n\nTrump continues to re-litigate the 2024 election, which he won, even as he continues to rail against the 2020 election, which he didn't.\n\n'How much did Kamala Harris pay Bruce Springsteen for his poor performance during her campaign for president,' Trump wrote. 'Why did he accept that money if he is such a fan of hers? Isn't that a major and illegal campaign contribution? What about Beyonce? And how much went to Oprah, and Bono???'\n\n'I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment,' Trump said.\n\nTrump's hit on the Boss came after Springsteen, during a concert in Manchester, England branded him 'corrupt, incompetent and treasonous.' Springsteen has for years lent his Jersey-twanged voice to Democrats, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \n\nCelebs including Oprah Winfrey have knocked down Trump's accusation, which he offered without providing evidence.\n\nA statement from Winfrey said she didn't get any 'personal fee' after disclosure reports revealed hefty production fees. \n\n'However, the people who worked on that production needed to be paid. And were. End of story,' she wrote on Instagram.\n\nPrior to Trump's insinuation against Springsteen and Winfrey, he tore into Taylor Swift.\n\n'Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I hate Taylor Swift,' she's no longer HOT?' Trump asked online.\n\nTrump has brought back some of his political nemeses from his first term at the start of his second, railing against Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nTrump's allies pounced after Comey posted a photograph of shells on beach sand spelling out '86 47.' \n\nThe former lawman denied the image had anything to do with a physical threat against the president, calling it 'totally innocent.' But he was questioned by members of the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nIn early May, Trump called New York AG Letitia James a 'horrible, horrible human being' as well as a 'total crook' and a 'sick person.'\n\nBut he made clear it was entirely up to Attorney General Pam Bondi how to handle an April referral against her by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte that accused her of mortgage fraud.\n\n'Pam's gonna have to do what she wants,' said Trump, adding that 'we don't discuss anything pending or not within my office.'\n\nThe White House denied the existence of an 'enemies list.' \n\n'There is no enemies list – the President is holding corrupt institutions and public officials accountable to the American people,' said White House spokesman Taylor Rogers when asked for comment.\n\n'President Trump’s only retribution is success and historic achievements for the American people,' he said in a statement. \n\nTrump's comments about James, who led the prosecution of Trump's New York fraud case, are just one of the times when he unloaded on a potential subject of an investigation, even if he stopped short of calling for one.\n\nThe DOJ's Civil Rights Division sent a letter to Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson announcing it had opened a 'pattern and practice' investigation of whether he illegally made hiring decisions 'solely on the basis of race.' \n\nJohnson has called Trump a 'monster' and in response blasted 'the tyranny that's coming from the federal government.'\n\nIn April he accused Trump of engaging in 'terrorism' after the president threatened to yank $3.5 billion in funds from the city over its policy of sanctuary cities.\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, has decided to reopen or 'push' cases where Trump has expressed an interest.\n\nOne involves the Supreme Court leak of the Dobbs abortion decision, something Trump has speculated was done by liberals.\n\nIt is also looking at who left a bag of cocaine at the White House back in 2023. Trump has publicly speculated it was 'either Joe or Hunter,' in references to the Bidens, without offering evidence.\n\n'Could be Joe, too,' Trump added.\n\nA third probe will look at the unsolved case of who left pipe bombs outside the DNC and RNC party committees on January 6. Trump has long stoked conspiracies that Antifa was behind the Capitol riot, when a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol. \n\nTrump also signed executive orders directing the DOJ to investigate former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, who anonymously penned a critical op-ed during his first term, and former cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, who vouched for the security of the 2020 election.\n\n'I think he's guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth. But we will find out,' Trump said of Taylor, who also penned a book called A Warning.\n\nOther Trump adversaries are getting heat from agencies or facing pressure not from law enforcement, but from government agencies. \n\nThe U.S. General Services Administration directed federal agencies to scour the books for contracts with Harvard University, with more than $2 billion worth cancelled. Trump has repeatedly attacked Harvard and accused it of antisemitism.\n\nThe president has also inked multiple executive orders targeting top law firms – prompting court fights.\n\nPotentially weakening the government's position is language contained within the orders themselves specifically mentioning Trump adversaries. \n\nA federal judge who struck down the order targeting Jenner & Block as violating free speech said it 'seeks to chill legal representation the administration doesn’t like,' according to U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, a George W. Bush appointee.\n\nThe order noted that Andrew Weissmann, a top Robert Mueller aide during the Russia probe, worked for the firm (he left in 2021). \n\nWeissmann played a role in the investigation of his links to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign and has been a frequent critic on TV.\n\nThe order accused Weissmann of 'dishonesty, and said the firm 'was “thrilled” to re-hire the unethical Andrew Weissmann after his time engaging in partisan prosecution as part of Robert Mueller’s entirely unjustified investigation. Andrew Weissmann’s career has been rooted in weaponized government and abuse of power.'\n\nA separate order targeted Wilmer Hale, a firm long associated with Mueller himself. \n\nRichard Leon of the Federal District Court ruled against Trump on the matter Tuesday, calling an 'independent bar' the 'cornerstone of the American system of justice.' \n\nIn his annual Memorial Day message, Trump tore into 'the scum that spent the last four years trying to destroy our country through warped radical left minds', indicating that he is still seething over his criminal prosecutions.\n\nBut he also made room for 'good and compassionate judges throughout the land' who he said 'will save us from the decision of the monsters who want our country to go to hell.'\n\nTrump has hasn't been shy about public threats to go after those who have crossed him politically.\n\nLast week he blasted California Gov. Gavin Newsom – Trump called him 'Newscum' – and threatened that 'large scale federal funding will be held back' from California over its policy toward transgender athletes.\n\nDuring the campaign Trump called Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi the 'enemy from within.'\n\nAlthough his administration hasn't gone after Pelosi personally, early DOGE actions took aim at the Presidio in San Francisco and the Health and Human Services Department announced the closure of a regional office in the Nancy Pelosi Federal Building.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused former Joe Biden aides of running the country and directing use of his autopen on pardons and legislation. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has said his panel will investigate.\n\n'I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real,' Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told constituents in April.","summary":"Trump has gone after figures from Bruce Springsteen and Oprah Winfrey to James Comey Letitia James.

OK, sort of — but blink and you'll miss it","text":"Who wasn’t mesmerized by last week’s epic, if profoundly embarrassing, catfight between Elon Musk and Donald Trump? No one, that’s who. I browse a lot of random publications from all over the world, and the online feud between the president of the United States and the richest person on the planet (along with the associated memes: “high-agency males going at it”!) was front-page news in Finland, Italy, Kenya and Argentina, just for starters. \n\nSo I’m not here to tell you that the Musk-Trump throwdown was some kind of calculated distraction or, as in the vivid imaginations of some right-wing influencers, a 5D-chess gambit meant to force the “Big Beautiful Bill” through the Senate and compel the release of the so-called Epstein files. Seriously, can you believe the stupidity of the times we live in? I recently read a lengthy book extract about the devastating impact of the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago, wiping out nearly all life for millions of years after that, and found myself wondering whether that would be such a bad idea. \n\nBut “the girls are fighting” — no disrespect to girls, or to fighting! — definitely obscured a handful of disconnected but related events whose consequences might last a lot longer. Much of the Elon-related pseudo-news emerged from one of Trump’s hair-raising Oval Office encounters with a foreign leader, in this case newly-elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Before that meeting devolved into chaos, it had in fact already gone off the rails: Trump clearly assumed that Merz must be sad about the Nazis losing World War II, and seemed mildly puzzled to learn otherwise. \n\nMERZ: Tomorrow is the D Day anniversary, when the Americans ended a war in Europe TRUMP: That was not a pleasant day for you? This is not a great day MERZ: This was the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) June 5, 2025 at 12:15 PM\n\nThere’s certainly room for historical cynicism about postwar Germany and the role of Merz’s center-right party, the Christian Democratic Union, in laundering the reputations of many former Nazis or collaborators. But please don’t try to convince yourself that Trump knows anything about that. He is simply too ignorant, and too small-minded, to imagine a scenario in which you’re glad your country didn’t conquer all of Europe, or to understand that the avowed purpose of the CDU, over its eight decades of existence, has been to rehabilitate Germany as a modern democratic state, free of antisemitism and ultra-nationalism. \n\nMerz put a brave face on this moment of grotesquerie, because that’s his job; the European media was justifiably horrified, because that’s theirs. But there was an intriguing undertow below all this that wasn’t readily discernible; bear with me for a minute while we work through it. \n\nAs I wrote here a few weeks ago, Merz is in an unlikely position and he knows it: He’s a finance-capital multimillionaire from the Catholic aristocracy who emerged from an indecisive federal election as the accidental leader of European democracy. In more innocent times he was described as the most pro-American politician in Germany. Now, with Trump back in the White House, Britain self-exiled from the EU and French President Emmanuel Macron fading into irrelevance, Merz more than anyone else is tasked with charting the course of European independence and fending off the continent-wide rise of the far right.\n\nMerz’s electoral victory over the somewhat-fascist AfD — the object of transatlantic mash notes from JD Vance and Elon Musk — coupled with recent wins by center-left parties in Canada and Australia, suggested something of a global \"centrist\" comeback. (Let's agree to set aside the question of whether that deliberately meaningless word actually means anything.) This wasn’t entirely an illusion, and for those with a candle burning in the window for democracy, it was a sign of hope. The grandiose overreach of the second Trump regime has clearly fueled a normie backlash in many parts of the world, pumping new life into mainstream political parties that had seemed to be in terminal decline. \n\nAs it happens, Merz’s visit to Washington coincided with a strange only-in-2025 event taking place in a nearby hotel basement: WelcomeFest, a day-long series of speeches and events billed as the “largest public gathering of centrist Democrats.” (There’s that word again!) I wasn’t there, and reports from the no-doubt-riveting scene were decidedly mixed. It sounds like a blend of entirely reasonable debate about how Democrats can craft a broadly popular message and a full-on declaration of war on the Bernie/AOC left and \"the groups,\" a codeword used to denigrate social justice movements of many varieties without quite naming them. The groups in question would seem to include LGBTQ activists, the climate justice movement, police and prison reformers or abolitionists, and anyone who utters the word \"Palestine.\" \n\nAs Aída Chávez of The Nation reports, pundit Matt Yglesias — pseudo-intellectual poster boy for this entire phenomenon — still thinks it was a bad idea for Democrats to give a crap about Kilmar Ábrego García’s illegal deportation to El Salvador. Pollster David Shor told Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, according to David Weigel of Semafor, that “voters really hate electric cars.” Slotkin, who clearly hopes to be the Democrats’ centrist savior in 2028, politely demurred: What voters actually hate is too much regulation, blah blah blah. Talk of \"abundance\" was abundant — speaking of meaningless catchphrases of the moment — and deployed to attack labor unions and to suggest that left-wing rhetoric about oligarchy and corporate power was strictly for the kids’ table. \n\nSo is this the centrist moment? Is neoliberalism back from its remarkably brief and partial ideological exile, under the inspiring and all-unifying banner of not being quite as bad as Trump? Are we about to witness the end of the end of the end of history? I’m sorry for posing such dumb questions, especially since the answer to all of them is \"kind of.\" \n\nIn domestic politics, the agenda of WelcomeFesters like Yglesias, Slotkin, Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington is clear enough: They want to party like it’s 1992. They want to make sex less fun, freedom less free and state repression more repressive, on the endlessly disproven hypothesis that surrendering your principles, cowering in fear and giving hateful people most of what they supposedly want might win the next election. I try to avoid overt editorializing in this space, but as my Uncle Fred would have said: F**k that for a game of darts.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon. Sign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nMore specifically, the centrist vanguard wants to use the Democratic Party’s post-Kamala crisis to cancel the 2020 peace treaty between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders and return to the time-honored ritual of punishing and purging the left. God knows there’s enough blame to go around for the failures of the 2024 Harris campaign, but the not-so-hidden message here is a thoroughgoing rejection of the former president that basically all these people claimed to adore until about this time last year: Biden was too old, too stubborn and too woke, and led us into this disaster.\n\nOn the global stage, there are already signs that the centrist renaissance may be a transitory phenomenon, not much more than \"kicking the can down the road,\" as Armida van Rij of Chatham House wrote last week in Foreign Policy. Poland’s presidential election ended in a narrow victory for far-right nationalist Karol Nawrocki, a conspicuous Trump ally in one of Europe’s largest and most strategically important countries. Poland is deeply divided along lines of class, culture and geography (not entirely dissimilar to America’s), and Nawrocki’s win shouldn’t be simplistically understood as a referendum on Trumpism, even if DHS fembot Kristi Noem — without the slightest idea of where she was or what she was doing there — showed up to campaign for him. This is likely to mean several more years of political paralysis, midway between authoritarianism and democracy, along with increasingly fraught relations with Ukraine, Poland's eastern neighbor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dutch government has collapsed (once again) after anti-immigrant agitator Geert Wilders pulled his newborn far-right party (and his impressive pompadour) out of an already wobbly conservative coalition, clearly hoping to win a greater share of power in an October election. It’s entirely possible, as many analysts believe, that Wilders has overplayed his hand and that the migrant crisis is no longer the dominant issue in European politics, largely thanks to Trump 2.0. \n\nBut Wilders’ chaos-agent antics, along with the Polish result and the startling gains made in recent British local elections by Nigel Farage’s gleefully shambolic Reform UK, should make clear that reassuring reports about the global demise of the Trump-style far right — politics is healing itself! — have been exaggerated. \n\n\"Centrist\" leaders like Merz, Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have repeatedly tried to triangulate themselves toward some democracy-salvaging consensus by repackaging the right’s most seductive ideas and offloading all remaining vestiges of left-flavored economic populism. Whether that’s hard-headed realpolitik or deep-seated cynicism and corruption is up for debate, but it should sound familiar to anyone acquainted with the 40-year trajectory of the Democratic Party. Look how well that has worked.","summary":"So \"centrism\" is back and neoliberalism will save us from fascism.

Is it needed, or just needy?","text":"To hear Republicans tell it, California is a failed state and Donald Trump won the presidency in a landslide that gives him a mandate to do as he pleases. No surprise there. But more and more, Democrats are echoing those talking points. Ever since Kamala Harris lost the election, the Democratic Party has been on a nationwide self-flagellation tour. One after another, its leaders have stuck their heads deep into their navels, hoping to find out why so many Americans — especially young people, Black voters and Latinos — shunned the former vice president. Even in California, a reliably blue state, the soul-searching has been extreme, as seen at last weekend's state Democratic Party convention, where a parade of speakers — including Harris' 2024 running mate, Tim Walz — wailed and moaned and did the woe-is-us-thing. Is it long-overdue introspection, or just annoying self-pity? Our columnists Anita Chabria and Mark Z. Barabak hash it out. Chabria: Mark, you were at the convention in Anaheim. Thoughts? Barabak: I'll start by noting this is the first convention I've attended — and I've been to dozens — rated \"R\" for adult language. Apparently, Democrats think by dropping a lot of f-bombs they can demonstrate to voters their authenticity and passion. But it seemed kind of stagy and, after a while, grew tiresome. I've covered Nancy Pelosi for more than three decades and never once heard her utter a curse word, in public or private. I don't recall Martin Luther King Jr., saying, \"I have a [expletive deleted] dream.\" Both were pretty darned effective leaders. Democrats have a lot of work to do. But cursing a blue streak isn't going to win them back the White House or control of Congress. Chabria: As someone known to routinely curse in polite society, I'm not one to judge an expletive. But that cussing and fussing brings up a larger point: Democrats are desperate to prove how serious and passionate they are about fixing themselves. Gov. Gavin Newsom has called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" Walz told his fellow Dems: \"We’re in this mess because some of it’s our own doing.\" It seems like across the country, the one thing Democrats can agree on is that they are lame. Or at least, they see themselves as lame. I'm not sure the average person finds Democratic ideals such as equality or due process quite so off-putting, especially as Trump and his MAGA brigade move forward on the many campaign promises — deportations, rollbacks of civil rights, stripping the names of civil rights icons off ships — that at least some voters believed were more talk than substance. I always tell my kids to be their own hero, and I'm starting to think the Democrats need to hear that. Pick yourself up. Dust yourself off. Move on. Do you think all this self-reproach is useful, Mark? Does Harris' loss really mean the party is bereft of value or values? Barabak: I think self-reflection is good for the party, to a point. Democrats suffered a soul-crushing loss in November — at the presidential level and in the Senate, where the GOP seized control — and they did so in part because many of their traditional voters stayed home. It would be political malpractice not to figure out why. That said, there is a tendency to go overboard and over-interpret the long-term significance of any one election. This is not the end of the Democratic Party. It's not even the first time one of the two major parties has been cast into the political wilderness. Democrats went through similar soul-searching after presidential losses in 1984 and 1988. In 1991, a book was published explaining how Democrats were again destined to lose the White House and suggesting they would do so for the foreseeable future. In November 1992, Bill Clinton was elected president. Four years later, he romped to reelection. In 2013, after two straight losing presidential campaigns, Republicans commissioned a political autopsy that, among other recommendations, urged the party to increase its outreach to gay and Latino voters. In 2016, Donald Trump — not exactly a model of inclusion — was elected. Here, by the way, is how The Times wrote up that postmortem: \"A smug, uncaring, ideologically rigid national Republican Party is turning off the majority of American voters, with stale policies that have changed little in 30 years and an image that alienates minorities and the young, according to an internal GOP study.\" Sound familar? So, sure, look inward. But spare us the existential freakout. Chabria: I would also argue that this moment is about more than the next election. I do think there are questions about if democracy will make it that long, and if so, if the next round at the polls will be a free and fair one. I know the price of everything continues to rise, and conventional wisdom is that it's all about the economy. But Democrats seem stuck in election politics as usual. These however, are unusual times that call for something more. There are a lot of folks who don't like to see their neighbors, family or friends rounded up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in masks; a lot of people who don't want to see Medicaid cut for millions, with Medicare likely to be on the chopping block next; a lot of people who are afraid our courts won't hold the line until the midterms. They want to know Democrats are fighting to protect these things, not fighting each other. I agree with you that any loss should be followed by introspection. But also, there's a hunger for leadership in opposition to this administration, and the Democrats are losing an opportunity to be those leaders with their endless self-immolation. Did Harris really lose that bad? Did Trump really receive a mandate to end America as we know it? Barabak: No, and no. I mean, a loss is a loss. Trump swept all seven battleground states and the election result was beyond dispute unlike, say, 2000. But Trump's margin over Harris in the popular vote was just 1.5% — which is far from landslide territory — and he didn't even win a majority of support, falling just shy of 50%. As for a supposed mandate, the most pithy and perceptive post-election analysis I read came from the American Enterprise Institute's Yuval Levin, who noted Trump's victory marked the third presidential campaign in a row in which the incumbent party lost — something not seen since the 19th century. Challengers \"win elections because their opponents were unpopular,\" Levin wrote, \"and then — imagining the public has endorsed their party activists' agenda — they use the power of their office to make themselves unpopular.\" It's a long way to 2026, and an even longer way to 2028. But Levin is sure looking smart. Chabria: I know Kamala-bashing is popular right now, but I'd argue that Harris wasn't resoundingly unpopular — just unpopular enough, with some. Harris had 107 days to campaign. Many candidates spend years running for the White House, and much longer if you count the coy \"maybe\" period. She was unknown to most Americans, faced double discrimination from race and gender, and (to be fair) has never been considered wildly charismatic. So to nearly split the popular vote with all that baggage is notable. But maybe Elon Musk said it best. As part of his messy breakup with Trump, the billionaire tweeted, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.\" Sometimes there's truth in anger. Musk's money influenced this election, and probably tipped it to Trump in at least one battleground state. Any postmortem needs to examine not just the message, but also the medium. Is it what Democrats are saying that isn't resonating, or is it that right-wing oligarchs are dominating communication? Barabak: Chabria: Mark? Barabak: Sorry. I was so caught up in the spectacle of the world's richest man going all neener-neener with the world's most powerful man I lost track of where we were. With all due respect to Marshall McLuhan, I think Democrats need first off to figure out a message to carry them through the 2026 midterms. They were quite successful in 2018 pushing back on GOP efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, if you prefer. It's not hard to see them resurrecting that playbook if Republicans take a meat-ax to Medicare and millions of Americans lose their healthcare coverage. Then, come 2028, they'll pick a presidential nominee and have their messenger, who can then focus on the medium — TV, radio, podcasts, TikTok, Bluesky or whatever else is in political fashion at the moment. Now, excuse me while I return my sights to the sandbox.","summary":"Democrats in California and across the country have been beating themselves up since the election, looking for a new identity.

Has the generation committed to a life of tradwives and the manosphere, leaving activism behind? Are they simply disenfranchised? Or has activism taken on a new meaning for a generation raised on tech? Newsweek spoke with experts to find out more.Where Is Gen Z, politically?Looking at the perceived absence of Gen Z from the protest scene, the easy conclusion to make is they're not protesting Trump because they support him.The reality is a bit more complicated. As with much of American politics, where Gen Z sits politically is in a state of sharp polarization.Trump has had a significant amount of support from young men, having secured 55 percent of the vote from men aged 18 to 29 in 2024. There is, though, a wide gender gap in this age group, with 61 percent of women from the same demographic having voted for Vice President Kamala Harris.As of late April 2025, though, polling found that Trump's support among Gen Z had tailed off since the election, with 37 percent approving of him and 58 percent disapproving.Shifting Protest CultureIt's not that young people are completely absent from political protests.\"Young people's participation in major protests on issues like gun violence after the Parkland school shooting in 2018, racial justice after the George Floyd murder in 2020 and the Israel-Palestine conflict in the past two years have been a major feature of this generation's political engagement,\" Alberto Medina, communications team lead at the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), told Newsweek via email.But there's been a recent shift, and the image of an angry young person at a protest could now be relegated to the historical archives.\"At the hands-off rally, there was a very clear demographic representation that excluded younger people,\" Dana Fisher, director of the Center for Environment, Community & Equity and a professor at America University, told Newsweek, adding that young people are \"just not turning up at these mainstream protest events.\"As for why, Fisher said: \"Young people are feeling really frustrated with the political process. They're feeling really frustrated with the two-party system in America, and they have lost confidence in the notion that democracy in America can work for them.\"She recounted an interaction with a young student in her research team who put it bluntly, telling her: \"Young people have given up on democracy in America.\"And young people's relationship with activism is changing, too. Newsweek spoke with Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, about this.\"We have to consider that over the last year and a half, or last two years, when Gen Z has showed up to protest at college campuses in the last year in particular around what's happening in Gaza, they have been harangued, harassed, kicked out of school,\" Litman said. \"They have faced incredible consequences.\"I think the culture of protest, even in the last two years, has changed drastically.\"The current conflict between Israel and Hamas began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Israel retaliated and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to eradicate Hamas. The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least 54,677 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict began, and there is a widespread humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with nearly all of the population having been displaced, according to the U.N.Students at universities across America have protested the conflict, with Columbia University becoming the epicenter of pro-Palestinian protests last spring. Protests have led to arrests, unrest and concerns have been raised about antisemitism.Commitment To Other CausesBut just because Gen Z isn't out on the streets protesting Trump doesn't mean they're not out on the streets protesting.\"A lot of young people who were engaged in all sorts of activism [are] shifting their focus to Gaza in the past year, year and a half since the violence broke out,\" Fisher told Newsweek.Newsweek spoke with Hatem Abudayyeh, national chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN) about Gen Z presence at pro-Palestine protests.\"We're still organizing protests every single week, and we still have a lot of college students, and even high-school-age students, Gen Z kids, who are coming to those,\" he said.\"College-age young people and campus organizers and activists have been a part of all the social justice movements in the United States for decades.\"Pointing to the encampments and college protests, he said: \"That clearly was something that not only the Palestine Support Movement had not seen in the United States before, but none of the social justice movements had seen [it] in the U.S. before since probably the Vietnam War era,\" and described Israel vs. Palestinians as \"the Vietnam War issue of this era.\"New Era Of ActivismIt seems that activism, and political engagement itself, is changing significantly for young people.\"It's evolving,\" Litman said. \"Not all activism is flashy. It doesn't always make for a compelling video or photo. That doesn't mean it doesn't work.\"\"In the first Trump administration, protesting was one of the primary ways that people showed their anger at Trump. And that was good for that moment. But we also saw the limits of that as a tactic. Gen Z is thinking about different ways that they can make their voice heard.\"We're seeing young people be really intentional about the ways in which they can move the needle,\" Litman added, pointing to consumer activism and social media activism and highlighting that Trump cares about the latter.Medina told Newsweek:\"Engagement online can serve as an entry point for youth to learn about and find opportunities to engage in issue advocacy or other forms of political participation. The key is ensuring that those opportunities are available and accessible to young people, that the structures and support systems are in place for youth to get involved and find political homes.\"Young people are looking for opportunities to learn, to be heard and to have an impact on issues they care about. That process can begin with a post on social media but requires more sustained support that can empower youth to do more than be passive consumers of political ads or information.\"And beyond the discourse online or on the streets protesting, Litman highlighted one thing young people are clearly thinking about: running for office, she said.\"Run for Something has had nearly 50,000 young people raise their hands to say they want to run for office in the last seven months,\" she said. \"We've had more people raise their hands since the election than we did in the first three years of Trump's first term.\"","summary":"Dana Fisher told Newsweek that young people have \"lost confidence in the notion that democracy in America can work for them.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gen-z-protest-culture-donald-trump-2082051","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2656172/genz-dont-seem-care-about-protesting.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 08:00:01","author":"Marni Rose McFall","authors":["Marni Rose McFall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":329261272,"title":"Donald Trump's No Tax On Tips Crusade Could Backfire","text":"Ending federal income taxes on tips, one of President Donald Trump's signature campaign pledges in the 2024 election, could potentially backfire as Americans grow weary of tipping, experts have told Newsweek.No tax on tips was something the president said he would enact \"first thing\" if he won the November election. The idea, launched in the service industry behemoth that is Las Vegas, quickly took hold with the electorate, so much so that his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris was quick to pledge the same relief for tipped workers should she win the White House race.Fast forward 5 months into the second Trump administration, the pledge hasn't yet been enacted, but the idea is certainly beginning to take shape. As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Republicans have proposed a new tax deduction on tipped income up to $160,000 while keeping payroll taxes that are used to pay for Social Security and Medicare. Other legislative efforts have also been made. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, along with a bipartisan group of co-sponsors, introduced the No Tax on Tips Act to Congress in January, which would establish a new tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tips, subject to certain restrictions.\"Whether it passes free-standing or as part of the bigger bill, one way or another, 'No Tax on Tips' is going to become law and give real relief to hardworking Americans,\" Cruz said on the Senate floor. The bill passed the chamber in May with support from both parties.Lawmakers are clearly keen on the idea, and the proposal is certainly popular with the American public, too. Polling conducted exclusively for Newsweek by Redfield & Wilton Strategies back in July 2024 showed that 67 percent of Americans do not believe tips given to service workers should be taxed.But the proposal, if enacted, could have some unintended consequences, business experts have told Newsweek.Tipping Culture FatigueJavier Palomarez, founder and CEO of the United States Hispanic Business Council, told Newsweek the policy could \"reinforce tipping in the short term but erode it over time,\" pointing to a growing phenomenon of tipping fatigue—a weariness among consumers increasingly asked to tip in situations where it wasn't previously expected.A BankRate survey conducted between April and May this year found that 41 percent of Americans believe tipping is \"out of control\" and that businesses should better compensate their employees instead of relying on gratuities to provide a wage. Thirty-eight percent reported being annoyed with pre-entered tip screens, which are usually used in automated checkouts, particularly in cafes or fast food restaurants.Still, the generosity of many Americans could pull through, at least for a short while. \"By framing tips as a tax-free bonus, the policy may temporarily boost the perceived generosity and importance of tipping, encouraging consumers to view it as a more impactful way to support service workers,\" Palomarez said.But it's unlikely to be straightforward. \"Cultural norms around tipping are sticky,\" he said. \"By signaling that tipped workers deserve special tax treatment, the policy may further divide and complicate service industry compensation norms—bolstering tips in some sectors like restaurants while emphasizing reform calls in others like delivery services or app-based platforms. Over time, this could lead to service charges or higher base pay as consumers question tipping.\"Speaking to Newsweek, Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer's Tax and Accounting Division North America, warned that \"the perception that tipped employees have a tax advantage may discourage tipping or at least the same amount of tipping by customers who are fully taxed on their incomes.\"Pay Boost for WorkersWhile tipping fatigue is certainly on the rise, the pay boost for workers in the service industry is tangible. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center has estimated that middle-income households could pocket an extra $1,800 per year under the plan.Joseph Camberato, CEO at NationalBusinessCapital.com, emphasized that the policy is not necessarily designed to address tipping culture—for all its pros and cons—at large.\"We've all seen those 'tip' prompts at self-checkout machines for things you grabbed off a shelf yourself,\" Camberato told Newsweek. \"This policy doesn't fix that, and honestly, it's not meant to. It's for the 1.8 million restaurant servers who rely on tips to pay their bills. For them, not getting taxed on that income is a big deal. This policy targets the right group and gives them a meaningful raise, basically overnight.\"He added, \"If anything, it's going to help the people who deserve tips the most like servers, bartenders, hospitality workers, walk away with more money. Remember, they usually get taxed 15 to 20 percent on tips. Take that off the table, and it's like giving them a 15 to 20 percent raise.\"If you're already a tipper, you're not suddenly going to stop because of this bill. But the person on the other side of the transaction is going to be walking away with more money, and that's the point.\"","summary":"Nixing federal income taxes on tips could have some unintended consequences, business experts have told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-no-tax-tips-crusade-could-backfire-2080749","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2655733/no-tax-tips-crusade-could-backfire.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 08:00:01","author":"Aliss Higham","authors":["Aliss Higham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":329266518,"title":"My 'Uncertain' Journey Through an Unsettled America ","text":"I hate travelling with uncertainty, like an unconfirmed flight or seat allocation. But now I was flying to America, currently the land of unknown unknowns. Plus, India was in a tense stand-off with Pakistan after the Pahalgam ceasefire – overflights were banned. Plus, it was a newly configured Air India aircraft. It was difficult to fathom which was the most debilitating uncertainty! And random people were sharing scary WhatsApp forwards about horrible things happening at America’s immigration counters:\"My uncle and aunt were forced to share their social media passwords. My uncle did, but my aunt, always feisty and quick to fly off the handle, cursed Trump for being so intrusive. My uncle was let through, but aunt was detained and put on the return flight...\"\"My sister had to open her Instagram account and read out hyper-critical posts about Trump’s Gaza policy. She was kept in detention for 24 hours and forced to return...\"While I bravely repudiated all these forwards as “nonsense”, a lurking fear got the better of me in the airport lounge. Why take a chance? Discretion is the better part of valour, right?So, with just a few minutes left to board, I furiously deleted dozens of groups and scrubbed hundreds of posts. I called my office and got passwords to my Instagram, LinkedIn, and X accounts. A Political Travelogue From a Post-Trump, Post-Truth AmericaBut before landing in America, I had to deal with another unknown - the new Air India direct service to New York! They had killed first-class seats and created a large business cabin with individual suites. Everything looked good in pictures and videos, but you know, it was Air India, the mother of uncertain flying experiences. Would I live to regret my choice? Mercifully, the new aircraft was sparklingly clean. The cabin lighting was seductive.The entertainment system, well for one, it worked; besides, the audio and video quality was excellent for a reasonably attractive selection of international movies. The suite was competently laid out, with a large side table to place plenty of medicines, beverages, and electronics. The headphone and electrical sockets were easily reachable, without having to twist your body and pull a muscle. The seat did go flat, although it was much narrower than the old-world first-class seat. The crew was cheerful and efficient. Wait, before you think the flight was perfect, let me give you the spoiler. The business cabin had 32 seats, but only two toilets, which were also used by the pilots and forward crew. Remember, it was a 16-hour flight with plenty of alcohol and oily, spicy Indian food. So, the frequent toilet calls were callous and nauseous. Why has Air India blundered on this key scatological metric? Especially since their old aircraft are notorious for turning back after take-off because of “clogged toilets”. I shudder to think what will happen when these newbies get old. Anyway, as I got off at Kennedy International, the dread of excrement was replaced by a foreboding of the immigration encounter. My fears turned out to be totally exaggerated. The immigration official was exactly as they used to be in the pre-Trump era. He asked a few perfunctory questions: “Why are you here? How many days do you plan to stay? Are you travelling to other locations within America?”. Pretty standard stuff, and I was through. Nobody asked to see my devices or intrude into social media posts. So, uncles and aunties on WhatsApp, please relax! When I was comfortably seated in the cab for Manhattan, I eagerly turned to quiz my regular Pakistani driver. “I remember you were such a big Trump supporter last year. You thought he would be great for the economy. What’s your call now?”. “Kya baat kar rahey ho, sir?! Yes, I voted for Trump, but what’s happening is terrible. Young Muslim students being picked up and deported. Court orders being ignored. I am a citizen, I have lived here for over 40 years, but even I am scared that I could be thrown out.”The rest of the journey was a litany of angry, unknown fears - punctuated by snatches of Pahalgam war talk, with the usual guesses and rumours about “who won” and “who lost” in that fierce four-day encounter. Trump vs Musk: When a Bromance Becomes a CoupNext day, I had an all-American lunch on a bright sunny terrace by the Hudson River. As I sauntered out to pick a cab, I saw an old Sikh gentleman with a long, flowing, intimidating beard. I naturally gravitated towards his cab and asked in Punjabi: “Daar ji, lai ke challogey mainu?” (Will you take me as a customer?). “Lau ji, thonnu tay mana nahin kar sakda na?” (How can I refuse to take you?) He was sharply disappointed that my destination was a very short distance away. So, he said: “Main meter down nahin kitta hai. Thonnu charge nahin karanga. Tussi tay Pakistan ton saddey guest ho. Assi jad vi Pakistan jaunday ne, koi paisa nahin leta hai.” (Since the distance is so short, I am not starting the meter. I will not charge my fare. After all, you are from Pakistan, and every time I’ve been to Pakistan, they don’t let us pay for anything. So, I will also not charge you). I had to break the “sad” news to him that I was not from Pakistan, but India. He went sullenly quiet, almost hostile. Clearly, he harboured a separatist ideology, and was perhaps convinced, and therefore secretly exulting, that Pakistan had “done well” in the Pahalgam war. Our short journey ended, and I slipped him a 20-dollar bill for the ride. I did not want to be indebted to the “enemy”. I had two more noteworthy encounters, both with Americans with one hundred percent white lineage. The first one was with a highly intelligent, thirty-something, blue-eyed broker in New York City. She hails from a family of pedigreed brokers who had close links with Donald Trump during his young, entrepreneurial forays. She is convinced that you cannot take Trump at face value. He will say and do things to shock, even appear foolish to his detractors, but “he’s playing to a plan”. When he makes up his mind to do something, he has full clarity, even if his method is chaotic. “See the way he came back, despite the concerted campaign to finish him. But he is tough, very tough. He won’t break”.Since she was such a Trump backer, I did not bring up the tariffs, deportations, Gaza, the family’s open enrichment, and a host of other follies. Her parting shot was about Kamala Harris: “How could I vote for her? I knew nothing about her. Who is she?”. And there hangs a tale that I’ve written about earlier, ie that the white woman simply did not turn out for Kamala. That single constituency, which ought to have been her cheering squad, undid her bid. MAGA Republicans, QAnon & Racism: The Landscape of Political Violence in the USMy last meaningful exchange was with a retired high school teacher who lives in America’s most white state, but one that traditionally has been “blue” or Democrat-supporting. He was a bit reticent to talk about Trump. When I asked about the price of eggs, he said “they are slowly coming back on shelves, and the price too seems to have softened”. I countered with the recent 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, saying how will America compete if steel costs about $ 1100/ton in America, $ 650/ton in Europe, and only $ 390/ton in China. He just shrugged: “I have no plans to buy a car, and the things that I usually buy, those seem to be unaffected by the tariffs”. While it’s very hazardous to prognosticate from such a small, scattered sample, it does appear that Trump’s appeal among his “white base” is not irretrievably damaged yet. But he could be losing the immigrant, Latino, and black votes. On another plane, non-resident Pakistanis and anti-India elements seem to have bought into the propaganda of an “honourable draw” in the Pahalgam war.Postscript: On my return flight, there were four toilets near the business cabin; but my seat did not recline, and the headphone did not work. Both were replaced. The more things change, the more they remain the same on Air India! Also, during my 17-hour flight back home, the bromance between Trump and Musk crumbled. If only I had stayed on for two more days! I would have enjoyed commenting on this vicious dogfight from the streets of America.

She appeared to distance herself even further from the MAGA movement after promoting a book written by an author who actively campaigned against her father during the 2024 election cycle.The President's eldest daughter posted a shot of 'Untamed' Glennon Doyle’s 2020 memoir, amongst a collection of photographs documenting the highlights of her week, according to The Independent. The post appeared on Ivanka’s Instagram story.Ivanka Trump supports father's criticsIvanka Trump has chosen to openly support one of her father President Donald Trump’s critics.The model-turned-business-woman has stepped away from the limelight, solely sharing glimpses into her glam life that includes lavish rehearsal dinners and Miami boat rides.This week, she shared an array of photos showing her “week in Miami,” which includes working out, eating gourmet meals, spending time with her family and friends and lastly, but most intriguingly, reading Glennon Doyle’s book Untamed.The novel’s synopsis says, “It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member's ability to bring her full self to the table.”The book topped the New York Times bestseller list, but that wasn’t what truly captured her fans’ attention. The author has been an outspoken critic of the President and even publicly endorsed Kamala Harris during his presidential campaign last fall. When the former Vice President replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee last summer, she expressed support for Harris—while also taking a subtle jab at the sitting President.'Winning this election to save America'On Instagram, she said, “Winning this election to save America from fascism will be hard. WE CAN DO HARD THINGS. AND WE WILL. No more fear. We gotta BELIEVE and we gotta WORK. CHINS UP SHOULDERS BACK: Let’s effing go. Listen at link to our incredible conversation with the future POTUS @KamalaHarris about her vision for America, Roe v. Wade, and HOW WE MUST RECLAIM PATRIOTISM.”Untamed is Doyle's memoir, described on Amazon as a story about how she learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member's ability to bring her full self to the table. A few weeks before the results of the election was announced, she also said, “If Trump wins, we lose, out daughters will have fewer rights than our mothers.” Her dislike for the President extends for the past decade, even when he was running for President for the first time in 2016.A month before that election, she took to Facebook with another strong message, stating, “I am an American woman and I am appalled and furious that people I know and respect might vote into the presidency a man who brags about sexual assault. Go ahead, list the excuses for this. There are none.”“There's a hell of a lot of misogyny surfacing right now and silence about it is a CHOICE,” she continued. “If you are a woman or love a woman Speak Up Now before it's too late.”","summary":"Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, openly supported an author who criticised her father.

Who, along with vast numbers of other members of the LGBT community, have descended on Washington DC this weekend for World Pride.\n\nIt’s perhaps the biggest LGBT event in the world. And, somewhat awkwardly, it’s happening right under the nose of Donald Trump, who has been vocal in admonishing trans people since the moment of his inauguration. \n\n“I am scared because I don’t know what the end game is for Trump – I don’t know where this will all lead,” Taylor Lianne Chandler, a board member of the Capital Pride Alliance, the organiser of World Pride, told news.com.au.\n\n“He’s made trans people enemy number one – which is bizarre since we’re less than 1 per cent of the population”.\n\nThe fear isn’t just swirling around people’s heads; it manifests itself in the very visible presence of multiple security guards in a Washington DC hotel. They’re guarding the World Pride human rights conference. \n\nThat would have been unthinkable last year. But since Donald Trump came back into the Oval Office, organisers have said they have been forced to beef up their safety plans, concerned anti-LGBT violence could occur.\n\nWorld Pride worries\n\nLike the Olympics, different global cities bid to hold World Pride every two years. In 2023, it was Sydney’s turn.\n\nThe US capital was awarded World Pride in 2022. Back then, it was a very different political climate. LGBT-friendly Joe Biden was in the White House which was lit in rainbow colours for Pride. Then vice president Kamala Harris marched in 2021’s DC Pride. \n\nThen Donald Trump turned up, and everything changed.\n\nJust last week, in an apparently calculated move to coincide with Pride, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly “ordered” a US ship named after gay navy veteran and LGBT campaigner Harvey Milk be renamed. \n\nBut the Trump White House’s ire has been particularly focused on trans Americans. \n\nOn the campaign trail, Mr Trump pledged to “stop the transgender lunacy” and called health care for young gender dysphoric people as “child abuse”. \n\nThe administration has stopped allowing people who have transitioned to change their gender on official documents, it’s attempting to kick trans people out of the military and move trans women into male prisons. A trans congresswoman, Sarah McBride, has repeatedly been called “Mr” by Republicans.\n\nMr Trump has had an effect on World Pride too. When Sydney hosted, the Opera House was illuminated in rainbow colours, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese joined the parade as it crossed the Harbour Bridge.\n\nThe White House’s response to Pride, World or otherwise, could not be more muted. While Mr Trump has recognised June’s National Ocean Month, he’s said nothing about June’s Pride Month. It feels deliberate. \n\nIn Washington, the Kennedy Arts Centre – which Mr Trump is now chair of – cancelled any events associated with World Pride. Although fears the government might try, somehow, to ban or hamper World Pride have not come to pass.\n\nSeveral corporates – including consultants Booze Allen Hamilton and auditors Deloitte – have pulled funding from World Pride apparently wary of upsetting the White House. Overseas visitors are fewer than expected. \n\n“World Pride is more important in 2025 than a Pride has ever been in my lifetime,” said Dr Nichols, who is a director for the National Trans Visibility March. \n\n“We’re seeing the intentional attempt of erasure for trans folks.”\n\nGenuine fears, he said, that people could be attacked during World Pride “has led some (trans) folks to stay home”.\n\n‘I’d shake Trump’s hand’\n\nBut, Dr Nichols added, “If Donald Trump wandered by,” “I would greet him and shake his hand”.\n\n“After that, I’d say ‘you just shook the hand of a trans man’ – and he probably wouldn’t have known.\n\n“I would tell him I have a family, I have dedicated 25 years to the military, I love this country and I hope that one day he realises he is taking the country in the wrong direction”.\n\nDr Nichols, who rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, fears he could now lose access to health care through the veterans department due to being trans. \n\nHe has little time for Mr Hegseth claiming he is “unqualified” for the role of defence chief. \n\n“There is no data that says trans folks serving impacts our readiness level.\n\n“Hegseth’s perspectives put the country at greater risk than trans people serving”.\n\n‘Why does Trump hate us so much’\n\nMiss Trans USA Beyonce Black St James, from Spokane in Washington state, has been a guest of honour at World Pride. \n\n“I was a little concerned being so close to this gentleman who just despises us,” she admits to news.com.au.\n\n“How can this leader hate us so much when we love our country?\n\n“This is the land of the free but he’s trying to take our freedom”.\n\nHeartbreaking conversation because of Trump\n\nWithin the extremes of the Republican Party and the dark corners of social media, the abhorrence for trans people seems almost visceral. \n\nBoth Dr Nichols and Ms Chandler said they hadn’t experienced direct bigotry since Mr Trump came to office. But, they said, that is likely down to them “passing” – essentially not appearing to be trans.\n\nHowever, Damien Serrato, who has been crowned Mx Trans USA, a gender-neutral accolade, told news.com.au they had received hate for their gender.\n\nIt’s forced them to have “serious conversations” with their mum and friends about safety.\n\n“Nobody wants to hear this, but I’m a target. God forbid something were to happen to me. \n\n“But at the same time, I can’t let fear rule my heart”.\n\nMs Chandler, from Virginia, said the trans pile on was a distraction to “blindside Americans” as the government “took away benefits”.\n\n“That’s what politicians have always done, but never to the magnitude as under the Trump administration.”\n\nMost Americans, she said, “didn’t really care” either way about trans people – but the MAGA fringes were being whipped up into a rage. \n\n“The rhetoric they put out there is not true. We’re not predators or groomers. There’s nothing to back that up.\n\n“I have a husband, blue nose pitbull dog and two kids. My life is just normal, boring even. \n\n“Since Caitlyn Jenner came out, no one can say they don’t know a trans person – even if she’s not a voice for the community”.\n\nDr Nichols said he wanted to see the whole LGBT community – the lesbians, gays and bisexuals too – step up to defend trans Americans. He cautioned it could be them next, after trans people. \n\n“I definitely believe that it will the LGB too – and sooner rather than later.\n\nFor Ms St James, this weekend is a chance to protest and party even harder. \n\n“I love that we’re all here in his face, taking up space, letting him know were not going nowhere,” she said.\n\n“And I hope it makes them nervous, as much as I’ve been made to feel nervous.\n\n“I hope it makes them sit back and realise there’s a lot of us.\n\n“You’re just gonna have to deal with it. And if you can’t deal with it, why don’t you take yourself to your room and take a nap”.","summary":"For a group of Americans, everything has changed in just six months and now they say they are “terrified” of Donald Trump’s next move.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/world-pride-2025-im-a-target-fear-for-trumps-next-move/news-story/076734a538cc827bd6a0344aba67d411?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/1432dd5baa10f77c771b934a67a2c53a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 03:39:32","author":"Benedict Brook In Washington Dc","authors":["Benedict Brook In Washington Dc"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":329200872,"title":"Gina Ortiz Jones, a Progressive, Is Elected San Antonio’s Mayor","text":"Gina Ortiz Jones, a Filipino American who served as under secretary of the Air Force during the Biden administration, won a runoff election on Saturday to become the mayor of San Antonio, making her the first openly gay leader of the seventh-largest city in the country.\n\nMs. Jones, 44, defeated Rolando Pablos, 57, a Mexican immigrant and former Texas secretary of state known for his close ties to Gov.

That doesn’t look like their finest hour.”\n\nAs CBS-parent Paramount Global seeks Trump administration approval of its merger with Skydance, company lawyers have been in talks to settle the president’s lawsuit against the network. Trump sued CBS for $20 billion over the way that a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris was edited. The lawsuit, filed under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a law typically invoked for false advertising claims, has been deemed baseless by a number of legal observers.\n\nCooper called the situation “very strange.”\n\n“You really wish the company was behind you 100%, right?” Pelley said. “You really wish the top echelons of the company would come out publicly and say, ’60 Minutes, for example, is a crown jewel of American journalism, and we stand by it 100%. I haven’t heard that.”\n\n“On the other hand, my work is getting on the air, and I have not had anyone outside 60 Minutes out their thumb on scale and say, ‘You can’t say that. You should say this. You have to edit the story this way. You should interview this person. None of that has happened.’ So I while I would like to have that public backing, maybe the more important thing is the work is still getting on the air.”\n\nStill, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, Bill Owens, resigned in April, concluding that he no longer had the ability to make independent decisions about the show, as in the past it has been walled off from corporate interference.\n\n“Bill’s decision to resign may not have been much of a decision for him, because he was always the first person to defend the independence of 60 Minutes. Bill didn’t work for Paramount. Bill worked for our viewers, and he felt very keenly about that, and so I’m not sure Bill had any choice once the corporation began to meddle in Bill’s decisions about the editorial content, or just place pressure in that area. Bill felt he didn’t have the independence that honest journalism requires.”\n\nDuring CNN’s post-performance coverage of Good Night, And Good Luck, Cooper also talked to a panel that included Kara Swisher, Connie Chung, Abby Phillip and Bret Stephens, with comparisons made to the situation that Murrow faced as he took on Joe McCarthy to today, when journalists are under attack by Donald Trump and his allies.\n\nIn their interview, Cooper asked Pelley how he thinks that Murrow would have handled the current situation at the network.\n\nPelley noted that Murrow’s producer, Fred Friendly, went on to become president of CBS News and eventually quit in principle over a disagreement about coverage of the Vietnam War.\n\n“I wonder if Ed might have done the same thing, given our present situation. He would probably be waiting to see how this lawsuit with the president works out, and how the Paramount corporation deals with that and whether it fights. I think that would mean everything to Ed, and I also know where he would be on that question. It would be for fighting.”\n\nPelley also addressed a commencement speech he gave to Wake Forest University last month, “Speaking to Wake Forest University graduates, Pelley said that “our sacred rule of law is under attack. Journalism is under attack. Universities are under attack. Freedom of speech is under attack. An insidious fear is reaching through our schools, our businesses, our homes and into our private thoughts. The fear to speak. In America?”\n\nMAGA commentators blasted Pelley for the comments.\n\nPelley, though, said that he “felt very strongly that this was something that needed to be said. It did not strike me that this would impact people’s thought of me as a journalist, because part of that speech is a speech about freedom of speech. That should be non-controversial.”\n\nHe said that “there was a little bit of hysteria among some about this speech. And I simply ask you, what does it say about our country when there’s hysteria about a speech that is about freedom of speech?”\n\nPelley said that what has surprised him the most about his reporting on the administration is “how pervasive the fear is.” He said that it is more difficult to get people to talk about Trump on camera.\n\n“They do not want to stick their head up over the foxhole,” Pelley said. “And that is part of what the Wake Forest speech was all about, that we must not be in fear. This is exactly what Ed Murrow was saying in that editorial at the end of the McCarthy broadcast. We much not walk in fear of one another. We are not descended from fearful people.”\n\nPelley said that he believe that the U.S. is moving in a “similar direction” as the McCarthy era. “People are silencing themselves for fear the government will retaliate against them, and that’s not the America we all love.”\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

That represents a huge decline from 2008, the climax of the Barack Obama coalition, when the Democrat candidate won 62% of the young male vote against GOP challenger John McCain.\n\nClearly, Democrats have a young man problem—and they’ve vowed to do something about it. Accordingly, the party is spending $20 million on a special multiyear effort called “Speaking With American Men: A Strategic Plan.” The project, The New York Times recently reported, will “study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces.”\n\nYes, really. Hold your laughter.\n\nIt’s true that leading Democrat figures could use some help on the “syntax” and “language” fronts. They might begin to right the ship, on that score, by ditching the infamous gobbledygook “gaffes” of Joe Biden and the “unburdened by what has been” word salads of Harris. But the rubber will meet the road for Democrats when it comes to the critical, elusive third category of concern for their new young male outreach effort: content.\n\nTo paraphrase a venerable saying, one can put lipstick on a pig, but the pig, at the end of the day, is still a pig. And something big has to change for the Democrats. Nor is their problem limited to young men; the party’s overall favorability ratings, in recent months, have hit record lows in public polling.\n\nHere, Democrats, is some (entirely) unsolicited advice on steps you might consider taking to become less catastrophically unpopular with young men—and many other Americans too.\n\nOn the issue of sexuality and the human person, you might consider beginning your vaunted young male outreach efforts by deigning to properly define what exactly a “man” is—and, by extension, what a “woman” is as well. Indeed, your party’s most recent Supreme Court nominee publicly struggled to crack this case. It is probably best, before attempting to devise pro-young-man public policy ideas, to familiarize yourselves with your target audience. The definition of “man” as it has existed since the Garden of Eden is a pretty good place to start.\n\nAfter successfully defining “man” and “woman,” you might consider not indulging recurring grievances levied against so-called toxic masculinity. It is generally a good idea, in political outreach, to not hold in dripping disdain the demographic group you are trying to reach. Sure, men have been killing each other since Cain slew Abel, but many of them have also been doing some pretty good things for humanity since around that same time period. One key to publicly rejecting misandry will be ditching support for “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives, which, along with also now being illegal, invariably take a pretty dim view of the heterogametic sex.\n\nOn the issue of immigration, you might consider not opening up America’s borders to, well, pretty much the whole world—but especially young males in search of economic opportunity in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Democrats might not have gotten this impression from the Harvard faculty lounge, but over half of Americans these days live paycheck to paycheck. Far too many young men struggle to provide for their families; indeed, many delay marriage in the first place because of finances. Flooding the zone with more wage competition may please the wokerati, but it won’t help you regain credibility with American breadwinners.\n\nOn the issue of environmentalism, you might consider not so conspicuously sacrificing American energy on the altar of climate alarmism. The young male voter simply wants a fair shot to make a decent living and provide safety and security for his family. The ham-handed restriction of hydrocarbon extraction does more than anything else to spike the price of every good or service. You might think that Trump’s tariffs are a threat to price stability, but you’d be wrong—at least so far. The real threat to the fiscal well-being of the median American comes from the price of energy, from which all other prices flow. Maybe, just maybe, don’t sacrifice all that on the altar of “Mother Earth”?\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that there is a lot of potential upside from their efforts to reach young men. The bad news for Democrats is the same: There’s so much to gain precisely because of how unpopular they currently are with that cohort.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Now it’s apparently Trump’s turn to trash his former ally, saying he will not make amends. \n\n Musk’s departure from the Trump administration was announced last week after Trump pulled his nomination for Musk’s ally, Jared Isaacman, to lead NASA. Musk then made the feud public when he began dumping on Trump’s tax bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” A Trump administration official said they are “taking away Elon’s friends,” Rolling Stone reported, and now, Trump has deemed the relationship over. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News that he is too busy to speak to Musk. \n\n The president called Musk, who reportedly took so much ketamine during the 2024 campaign that he could not pee right, “a big-time drug addict” in a phone call, a source told The Post. Trump reportedly made several phone calls to those in his inner circle as well as acquaintances about the split. \n\n Musk’s drug habits on the campaign trail included ketamine, Ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms, The New York Times reported late last month. His drug usage, and the media discussion surrounding it, helped drive the breakup, White House officials told the Post. \n\n The former head of the Department of Government Efficiency lobbed insults at Trump earlier this week that culminated into one alleging there were files showing the president’s connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which he has since deleted. Vice President J.D. Vance said in response that Trump “didn’t do anything wrong” with Epstein. \n\n “Most entertaining outcome is most likely,” Musk, who has been posting less often than usual, wrote on X Saturday. \n\n Those close to the president expected him to be more vitriolic toward his new adversary, The Post reported, but he was quieter at first this time, reportedly telling people not to escalate the situation. He even reportedly told Vance to be diplomatic. \n\n “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday.\n\n “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” he wrote in another post. The furthest Trump went earlier this week was to threaten to cancel Musk’s government contracts. \n\n Now the president is looking more and more like his regular self. When NBC News asked on Saturday whether he had any interest in making amends, Trump said, “No.” The outlet also asked whether he thought his relationship with Musk was over. “I would assume so, yeah,” he said. \n\n When NBC News asked Trump whether he would speak to Musk soon, he said he was otherwise occupied. “I’m too busy doing other things,” he said. “I have no intention of speaking to him.”\n\n He also told the outlet that Musk had been disrespectful. “I think it’s a very bad thing, because he’s very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the President.” \n\n Even so, this sounds tepid for a person who, for example, insulted how Heidi Cruz, Ted Cruz’s wife, looks and suggested Cruz’s father was linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He called Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley “birdbrain” and Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate Tim Walz “tampon Tim.” \n\n Musk has been the recipient of Trump’s classic insults as well. “When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it’s electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he’d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, “drop to your knees and beg,” and he would have done it…” Trump posted on Truth Social in 2022. \n\n Trump’s biggest escalation was a threat toward Musk in the NBC News interview. He said that there would be “serious consequences” if Musk funds Democrats to run against Republicans who support Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” \n\n “He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” he told NBC News. He did not say what those consequences would be. \n\n Musk had previously slammed the bill in a post on X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,” he wrote. \n\n The political arm of SpaceX, Musk’s company, has made donations to Democrats. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) received $24,000 from SpaceX’s PAC, which she donated to a food bank, Axios reported.

That represents a huge decline from 2008, the climax of the Barack Obama coalition, when the Democratic candidate won 62% of the young male vote against GOP challenger John McCain.\n\nClearly, Democrats have a young man problem – and they’ve vowed to do something about it. Accordingly, the party is spending $20 million on a special multi-year effort called “Speaking With American Men: A Strategic Plan.” The project, The New York Times recently reported, will “study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces.”\n\nYes, really. Hold your laughter.\n\nIt’s true that leading Democratic figures could use some help on the “syntax” and “language” fronts. They might begin to right the ship, on that score, by ditching the infamous gobbledygook “gaffes” of Joe Biden and the “unburdened by what has been” word salads of Harris. But the rubber will meet the road for Democrats when it comes to the critical, elusive third category of concern for their new young male outreach effort: content.\n\nTo paraphrase a venerable saying, one can put lipstick on a pig, but the pig, at the end of the day, is still a pig. And something big has to change for the Democrats. Nor is their problem limited to young men; the party’s overall favorability ratings, in recent months, have hit record lows in public polling.\n\nHere, Democrats, is some (entirely) unsolicited advice on steps you might consider taking to become less catastrophically unpopular with young men – and many other Americans too.\n\nOn the issue of sexuality and the human person, you might consider beginning your vaunted young male outreach efforts by deigning to properly define what exactly a “man” is – and, by extension, what a “woman” is as well. Indeed, your party’s most recent Supreme Court nominee publicly struggled to crack this case. It is probably best, before attempting to devise pro-young-man public policy ideas, to familiarize yourselves with your target audience. The definition of “man” as it has existed since the Garden of Eden is a pretty good place to start.\n\nAfter successfully defining “man” and “woman,” you might consider not indulging recurring grievances levied against so-called toxic masculinity. It is generally a good idea, in political outreach, not to hold in dripping disdain the demographic group you are trying to reach. Sure, men have been killing each other since Cain slew Abel, but many of them have also been doing some pretty good things for humanity since around that same time period. One key to publicly rejecting misandry will be ditching support for “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives, which, along with also now being illegal, invariably take a pretty dim view of the heterogametic sex.\n\nOn the issue of immigration, you might consider not opening up America’s borders to, well, pretty much the whole world – but especially young males in search of economic opportunity in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Democrats might not have gotten this impression from the Harvard faculty lounge, but over half of Americans these days live paycheck to paycheck. Far too many young men struggle to provide for their families; indeed, many delay marriage in the first place because of finances. Flooding the zone with more wage competition may please the wokerati, but it won’t help you regain credibility with American breadwinners.\n\nOn the issue of environmentalism, you might consider not so conspicuously sacrificing American energy on the altar of climate alarmism. The young male voter simply wants a fair shot to make a decent living and provide safety and security for his family. The ham-handed restriction of hydrocarbon extraction does more than anything else to spike the price of every good or service. You might think that Trump’s tariffs are a threat to price stability, but you’d be wrong – at least so far. The real threat to the fiscal well-being of the median American comes from the price of energy, from which all other prices flow. Maybe, just maybe, don’t sacrifice all that on the altar of “Mother Earth”?\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that there is a lot of potential upside from their efforts to reach young men. The bad news for Democrats is the same: There’s so much to gain precisely because of how unpopular they currently are with that cohort.","summary":"'1 key to publicly rejecting misandry will be ditching support for DEI initiatives'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/06/how-democrats-can-stop-alienating-young-men/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/group-of-young-men-silhouette-pexels.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 22:06:16","author":"Josh Hammer","authors":["Josh Hammer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":329167496,"title":"Coco Gauff throws shade at Donald Trump and opens up on 'dark times' for America after French Open triumph","text":"Coco Gauff throws shade at Donald Trump and opens up on 'dark times' for America after French Open triumph\n\nREAD MORE: Coco Gauff French Open prize money revealed\n\nBy MATTHEW LAMBWELL AT ROLAND GARROS\n\nPublished: 23:00 BST, 7 June 2025 | Updated: 23:00 BST, 7 June 2025\n\nCoco Gauff revealed she was driven to her French Open title by a desire to give Americans something to smile about during dark times.\n\nAsked how it felt to hear the US national anthem after her 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 defeat of Aryna Sabalenka, the 21-year-old said: 'It means a lot. Obviously there's a lot going on in our country right now.\n\n'To be able to be a representation of people that look like me in America who maybe don't feel as supported during this time period, and so just being that reflection of hope and light for those people.\n\n'I remember after the election and everything, it kind of felt like a down period. My mom told me during Riyadh (the WTA Finals in November, which Gauff won), \"Try to win the tournament to give something for people to smile for\". So that's what I was thinking about today when holding the trophy.\n\n'And seeing the flags in the crowd means a lot. Some people may feel some type of way about being patriotic, but I'm definitely patriotic and proud to be American.

Just lean on God with your concerns. He is the highest power. Remember that.'\n\nIn the past few days, Trump's second term has reached ever more bizarre heights, after the president began an ugly, and very public, feud with Elon Musk.\n\nMusk - the richest man in the world and previously Trump's right-hand man in charge of DOGE - has left the government and is strongly opposing the new 'big, beautiful bill', which includes tax cuts and increased border spending.\n\nMusk even took to X to claim that Trump is 'on the Epstein list', and Trump has also threatened Musk's federal contracts.\n\nMeanwhile, in Paris, the first person Gauff celebrated with after her victory was filmmaker Spike Lee, who was courtside.\n\n'That was the first time I really met him,' said the world No2.

I was, like, \"Oh, my gosh, Spike Lee is there.\"\n\n'Then when I saw him on the court, I'm like, \"If I win this match, the first person I'm going to tap up is Spike Lee.\"\n\n'So once I won the match, I went on the ground and everything, then I headed straight to Spike Lee.

In three consecutive presidential elections in the United States. In the latest polls in Britain, where the 2016 Brexit referendum was the first notable outbreak. In France’s most recent national election and in Germany’s. In Canada’’ election last month. And maybe in Poland and South Korea last weekend.\n\nThe pattern can be summarized in a simple formula. M+M versus H. Or, increasingly and to the discomfort of established politicians and press personnel, M+(1-x)M<H+xM.\n\nThe first M stands for “metropole,” the dominant governmental, media and cultural center of each country. London and Paris in Britain and France, obviously, with 16% to 20% of the nation’s population and practically all its elites. In the U.S., metro New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In Canada, Toronto and Anglophone Montreal. In South Korea, Seoul.\n\nThe second M stands for “minorities,” racial and ethnic. In Britain, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Muslims in industrial cities. In the U.S., the various peoples, bracketed by the Census Bureau ukase, as blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Francophone Canadians. Peoples whose experiences have set them apart as alien and potentially adversary to the dominant society.\n\nI first discerned the M+M vs. H patterns in June and November 2016. As I wrote in 2019, in the Brexit referendum, 60% or more of voters in metro London and Scotland voted against leaving the European Union, but Brexit won because 57% in England outside London voted for it.\n\nSimilarly, in the U.S, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump 65% to 30% in the NY/DC/LA/SF metropole, which is 15% of the nation, but Trump won 49% to 45% in the heartland in between. Key electoral votes came from 2012 Obama voters switching to Trump in the nonmajor metropolitan half of the Midwest.\n\nThe heartland doesn’t always lose. Joe Biden’s November 2020 victory over Trump is one example of that. The ouster of pro-Brexit Prime Minister Boris Johnson in summer 2022, and the Labour party victory in the July 2024 general election, is another.\n\n2022 saw incumbent French President Emmanuel Macron, who in the first round ran behind a leftist in the metropole and just four points ahead of the populist anti-mass-immigration Marine Le Pen in the heartland. Macron won the runoff but by only half the margin of four years before.\n\nThe elites have fought back. Johnson was ousted following an ethics complaint, and a French court barred Le Pen from running for five years on a flimsy rationale. European Union elites removed the candidate who led the first ballot in Romania from the runoff and have threatened to bar Germany’s AfD party, the second-place finisher in the February election, from future contests.\n\nYou can see the similarities with the lawfare attacks on Trump and the kangaroo court prosecution by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nElites justify these moves by invoking the tragic history of the first half of the 20th century. But objecting to having economic policies set by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels is not undemocratic. And barring or limiting the uncontrolled influx of often culturally hostile immigrants is not the moral equivalent of murdering 6 million Jews.\n\nPreventing voters from exercising their free choice is a funny way of “saving democracy.” And not a very effective way. Le Pen’s deputy Jordan Bardella is running well in polls, and Labour in Britain polls way behind Nigel Farage’s Reform party by 362 to 136 seats at present, with nearly 40% of the party’s seats in metro London.\n\nAnd Donald Trump’s 2024 victory seems to have produced a realignment in his direction. The metropole-minorities alliance is fading, as Hispanics, Asians and, to a lesser extent, blacks have trended Republican. Kamala Harris’ 61-36 margin in the NY/DC/LA/SF metropole is notably less than Hillary Clinton’s 65-30, while in the heartland beyond, Trump increased his 49-45 plurality in 2016 to a 52-46 majority in 2024.\n\nA brilliant New York Times graphic shows that Trump has gained percentages in each of the last three elections in 1,433 counties with 42 million people, while his Democratic opponents have gained percentages three times in only 57 counties with 8 million people.\n\nAs Jewish Insider’s Josh Kraushaar noted on X: “For years, the belief was Democrats have had demographic destiny on our side. Now, the inverse is true.”\n\nOne corollary of this largely unpredicted movement of minorities away from metropole attitudes and toward the heartland is that the young, for minorities tend to be younger than average, are moving that way too.\n\nPerhaps that helps account for the victory of Karol Nawrocki, who was trailing in preelection polling and even in the exit poll in Poland. There’s polling evidence that young voters switched from the center-left in 2020 to the Right this time. Nawrocki may have been helped, or at least wasn’t hurt, by his May 1 Oval Office visit or by elite efforts to disqualify populist candidates in Romania and Germany.\n\nAt the same time, the map of last weekend’s Polish election results looks almost identical to those from 2005 to 2020. And they’re correlated with historic patterns. The center-right party wins areas within the pre-1914 tsarist Russia empire, minus the large cities of Warsaw and Lodz. The center-left wins those areas within pre-1914 Germany. The strongest right areas are in southeast Poland, along the Ukrainian border, which were in pre-1914 Austria, the only one of those multi-ethnic empires with a Catholic monarch.\n\nAll of which is to say that the “metropole plus minority versus heartland” pattern does not apply everywhere, and history still has its claims on many voters. But we’re watching some new electoral history being made, with no clear end in sight.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The modern feminist movement began as a cry for liberation—yet in recent years, it seems to have circled right back to restriction. The script has flipped, and instead of championing real choice, mainstream feminism is now dictating which choices are acceptable, rewarding women not for excellence but for optics. \n\nMany women today feel pressured to conform to a political checklist—where individuality is erased in favor of identity boxes, be it by chasing a seat in the boardroom or posting about sourdough on Instagram. But quietly, a new form of femininity is rising. One that reclaims true power through merit, integrity, and earned opportunity. One that doesn’t shout—but instead leads with real talent. \n\nThis new approach is well exemplified by the current White House administration. President Donald Trump’s appointment of Karoline Leavitt as the youngest-ever White House press secretary is more than a historic move but a blueprint for this new approach to empowering women. At just 27, Leavitt is not only a trailblazer in her role in politics, but also a new mother—a dual role that has been championed and assisted by the White House and Leavitt’s family support system. \n\nShe now works alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, forming what many are calling the most female-led administration in modern political history, with one-third of Trump’s senior leadership team being women. And notably—they weren’t chosen to fulfill quotas but have robust careers qualifying them for these positions of power. \n\nIn his Women’s History Month address this year, Trump confirmed that this administration has “more women in our cabinet than any Republican president in the history of our country.” \n\nThis is what some are calling Opportunity Feminism—a cultural and political response to modern feminism that champions women’s advancement not through mandates, but through merit. Originally articulated by Karin Lips, founder of Network of Enlightened Women, it’s not about pushing men aside or checking boxes. It’s about placing capable women in positions of influence because they can, not because they must. \n\nContrast this with the Biden administration’s 2021 Executive Order mandating DEI benchmarks across all federal agencies. While intended to promote inclusivity, critics argue that these mandates have had the opposite effect—prioritizing identity over ability, as characterized by Kamala Harris’ drastic defeat. When representation becomes the end goal rather than the result of a fair process, women’s unique talents are often overlooked and in turn, demeaned. The original effort of giving women equal opportunity gets squashed. \n\nTake California’s SB 826, which required every corporate board to include at least one woman. On the surface, it sounded empowering. But in 2022, the law was ruled unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court, as it was found to violate the equal protection clause. The aftermath? Many women on boards were quietly labeled “diversity hires,” undercutting their contributions and feeding the very stereotype feminism was supposed to dismantle. Today, women occupy 32.75% of board seats in California—proving that many women rise without government mandates. \n\nGovernment intervention has too often become a crutch rather than a catalyst when it comes to modern feminism. Instead of opening doors for women, it’s built with artificial scaffolding—one that many women don’t want or need. And worse, it often fails to account for the real needs of working women. \n\nOver 41.4% of self-employed workers in the U.S. are women, yet many face regulations that prevent them from working at home or launching cottage-based businesses, despite the Home-Based Business Fairness Act. City licensing laws, zoning restrictions, and outdated labor codes conflict with this act and disproportionately impact mothers trying to raise families while contributing economically from home. Where’s the modern feminist outrage for them? \n\nThis is where fourth wave feminism has run its course and true empowerment lies—not in a headline, but in the everyday freedom to choose what kind of life a woman wants to build. As a small-business owner working from home, I may still face governmental barriers that hold me back, like occupational licensing laws that restrict job mobility, and others like me face regulations that prevent home-based businesses from thriving. And it’s not just a boardroom issue. It’s a kitchen table issue. A side-hustle-at-naptime issue. A build-a-legacy-on-your-own-terms issue.\n\nSo no, the future isn’t feminist in the way pop culture might define it. Instead, it’s fair, by allowing women to be truly valued for their contributions, not just the benchmark they meet. This not only allows for women to be recognized, but inspired to be called higher, no matter their passions or season of life-—whether that’s running a campaign, a company, or a kitchen. \n\nTrump’s countercultural approach to empowering women, by selecting women like Leavitt, Bondi, and Wiles based purely on merit, has the potential to create a ripple effect nationally. This differing approach to feminism should inspire legislation nationwide and allow for women to have thriving opportunities to support themselves and their families. In turn, women will aid in boosting our economies and nurturing future generations simultaneously, like only we can. \n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

A major reason is that employers pocketed workers’ fair share of productivity increases. Wages used to rise when productivity did; if that had continued, workers’ wages would be 43% higher than they are today. \n\nYou won’t hear about this from President Trump. Instead, his villain is foreign trade, and his solution is to use tariffs to bring back blue-collar jobs. But tariffs won’t work quickly, because onshoring means building new factories, which takes years. And it may never happen. \n\nMeanwhile, tariffs threaten to take away the only real benefit workers got from globalization: cheap Nikes, T-shirts, and party favors. To add to that, the Trump administration is DOGE-ing away stability at the Veterans Administration and Medicaid, which middle-class and rural Americans rely on. \n\nIn short, the right isn’t doing right by Lunchpail Joe and Jane.\n\nBut neither is the left. Instead, it’s obsessing nonstop about Trump’s flouting of democratic norms — that’s all progressives want to talk about. Defense of democracy was a top priority for those who voted for Kamala Harris, but way, way down for those who voted for Trump.\n\nThe left also wants to talk about how DOGE is firing government workers, making professionals’ jobs unstable and nerve-wracking. \n\nWelcome to our world, say non-college voters. Thirty years ago, sales personnel at Macy’s had full-time jobs with benefits. Today, associates worry constantly about whether they will accrue enough hours to pay the rent, in jobs that typically lack health insurance. \n\nAs a result, many workers without degrees are working all kinds of hours. \n\nA 38-year-old construction worker described the impact on family life: “People can’t get or stay married because it takes so much effort to survive. My ex-fiancée said, ‘You’re never around.’ But I was working to get a better life for us. No one has time for their kids. It’s the American Nightmare.”\n\nDOGE is placing college-educated professionals where workers without degrees have been for decades — worried sick about how they’re going to support their families. Don’t expect workers to care. \n\nIn earlier eras, the left was focused on good jobs for blue-collar workers and universal programs to ensure stability for the middle class, like Social Security, Medicare, and VA home loans and college benefits. In the 1970s, the focus changed to prioritize issues of greater concern to liberal college grads: environmentalism, racism, and sexism.\n\nAs political priorities changed, so did “feeling rules” that set the parameters of our heartstrings. A good lefty should feel angst about climate change, the poor, LGBTQ+, racism, and immigrants. But blue-collar Americans who vote for Trump? They’re deplorable. \n\nIf you care deeply about people disadvantaged by race, gender, and country of origin — but ignore class disadvantage — then people disadvantaged by class will seek solace by flocking to those who channel their anger. In both Europe and the US, those who flock to the far right are middle-status voters in routine jobs, holding on for dear life and just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nA reality check: Democrats have generally done better for working people than Republicans. Obamacare is only the most recent example. \n\nThe Trump administration has cut funding to programs that underlie the stability of middle-class Americans, like the VA and Social Security, creating overly lengthy wait times. \n\nThis is what the left should be focusing on, not the defense of democracy. Americans who feel they’ve been screwed for the last 40 years feel democratic institutions haven’t delivered for them.\n\nIf Democrats are seen as defending the status quo, they won’t win over non-college voters who feel like the status quo isn’t working for them. And nearly two-thirds of Americans lack college degrees. Without them, Democrats can’t win elections.\n\nHere’s the bottom line. My message for Republican powers-that-be is a question: Does the current business climate, rife with chaos, instability, and the corrosion of both democratic norms and the US credit rating, really work for you? If you’d prefer a more orderly political and business climate, you need to deliver a stable, middle-class future for Americans without college degrees.\n\nMy message for Democratic powers-that-be is also a question: Do you want to win elections? If you do, you need to change policies and feeling rules to deliver both economic stability and respect for non-college voters. Because if you don’t, what you now see is what you’ll get. \n\nThere’s your coalition out of this mess. \n\nJoan C.

He referenced 10 to 20 specialist physicians.”\n\nBut the tests did not include any neurocognitive work, nor did Biden submit to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, as Trump did in his first term, a two-minute screening comprising around 30 questions to test for signs of dementia, according to Obama’s ex-physician.\n\n“I have no doubt that President Trump aced it,” he said of the test, but said the current White House, in the interest of full transparency, should also release CT scans that were taken after the assassination attempt against the Republican candidate in Butler, Pa., last July.\n\nKuhlman added the Montreal Cognitive Assessment isn’t adequate to determine more serious mental slippage, one of the three main areas that medical professionals should be considering when evaluating the president, along with cancer and cardiovascular issues.\n\nMemory, reasoning, speed of processing and spacial visualization all begin to decline around the age of 60, he also said.\n\nO’Connor served as Biden’s doctor during his vice presidency, overlapping with Kuhlman in the White House medical unit.\n\nKuhlman said he “respects” O’Connor’s “medical judgment,” but also told The Washington Post: “Sometimes those closest to the tree miss the forest.”\n\nIn apparently his only media interview during Biden’s term, O’Connor insisted to The Post in July 2024 that the president’s cognitive health was “excellent” — days after being forced out of a re-election bid and replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris due to a dismal debate performance June 27.\n\nIn a break from his predecessors, Biden’s doctor never answered questions from the press in the White House briefing room but submitted annual physical reports that noted some physical ailments without addressing the president’s mental acuity, other than to say he was “fit for duty.”\n\n“The president doesn’t need a cognitive test,” claimed White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a February 2024 briefing following what would be Biden’s final physical as commander-in-chief. “He passes a cognitive test every day.”\n\nWhite House visitor logs show the oldest-ever president did submit to evaluation from an expert in Parkinson’s disease and 20-year veteran of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Dr. Kevin Cannard, but O’Connor said the January 2024 meeting was part of Biden’s annual physical.\n\n“If somebody turns up a report that Kevin Cannard said he has Parkinson’s,” said Kuhlman, “then that’s a completely different story, but we have 14 years of Kevin Cannard evaluating him and that’s who I would trust.”\n\nO’Connor said that was part of his annual physical and ruled out a Parkinson’s diagnosis, though other doctors expressed skepticism.\n\n“I could’ve diagnosed him from across the Mall,” neurologist Dr. Tom Pitts told NBC in July 2024, pointing to Biden’s “rigidity,” “shuffling gait” and “slow movement.”\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Hur, who determined that Biden “willfully” hoarded classified documents after leaving the Obama White House, chose not to bring charges months earlier that year in February, in part because a jury would view the president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.”\n\nThe Republican-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed O’Connor on Thursday to appear for questioning about the former president’s mental abilities on June 27.\n\nOversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) in a cover letter accompanying the subpoena suggested the doctor’s past “financial relationship with the Biden family” may have “contributed to an effort to hide former President Biden’s fitness to serve from the American people.”\n\nJean-Pierre, who left the Democratic Party and is publishing a tell-all book about the “broken” Biden administration, is also expected to be hauled in for testimony.\n\nDays before a book was set to be published alleging a vast cover-up of his decline during his last two years in the White House, Biden announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.\n\nThe book, “Original Sin,” notes that O’Connor was reluctant to administer a cognitive test, according to co-authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.\n\nKuhlman said O’Connor had conducted tests for that kind of cancer between 2009 and 2014 when they served together in the White House, but it may not have been “worth doing in the next 10 years” based on the findings of that final exam, known as a PSA, in the vice presidency.\n\n“I hope that Kevin O’Connor had that conversation every year with his patient, Joe Biden, and documented that in the medical record,” he said. “If he did the PSA and chose not to release it, I don’t agree with that.”","summary":"\"Any

Lack of Scrutiny of Biden’s Mental Decline","text":"Piers Morgan Uncensored\n\nPIERS MORGAN: The presidential scandal on many sides is the biggest in United States history, Richard Nixon's role in the infamous Watergate break-ins. However, the shocking details revealed in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book on President Biden's cognitive decline whilst in office and the conspiracy to cover it all up, could now well rival it, or as I believe, even worse. Here's what Tapper himself said when I pressed him on it on Uncensored.\n\nJAKE TAPPER: It is a scandal. It is without question and maybe even worse than Watergate in some ways, um, because Richard Nixon was in control of his faculties when he wasn't drinking.\n\nMORGAN: Well, in this special edition of Uncensored, we've assembled some real political, academic and media heavyweights to debate the question, Biden or Nixon, who scandalized the US presidency more?\n\nChuck Todd, let me start with you. You've covered a lot of scandals in your time, a lot of presidencies in your time. I was genuinely fascinated when I pressed Jake Tapper, because there's a line at the end of the book, I'm sure you've read it, where they, they talk about this is not a Watergate. And they, they kind of leave it floating as whether they think it's better or worse. Jake actually conceded to me that actually he thinks it probably is worse. What is your view?\n\nCHUCK TODD: Well, I think we have to have proof that there was a belief of cognitive decline and intentional cover up, right? We're still not there. There's certainly plenty of evidence that he wasn't really up to doing the job, that he was going to struggle to have a second term, that his behavior in the first term was indicative of somebody that couldn't handle the modern rigors of the presidency. So if you look at the damage Donald Trump is doing to our current economy or the current relationships around the world, uh, do you hold Biden accountable for that? \n\nI know plenty of Democrats who do, right? So it's almost like every piece of bad information. That or bad decision making that Donald Trump makes only ratchets up the anger among some on the left at Joe Biden and his family's selfishness, but more importantly, the staff around, right?\n\nTo me, the scandal is the Democratic Party and the staff because you know who was screaming at the top of their lungs that they wanted different choices for presidents, the voters. They were ignoring the polling. They were ignoring what voters were actually saying, you know, to me that was the original sin of this mess. \n\nBut to equate it, look, I actually think the worst scandal of any president is, is what is Teapot Dome and Harding, although we, we may yet have any something that rivals both Watergate and Teapot Dome when this crypto thing collapses on the Trump family, but for now I'm not ready to say it's Watergate, but inside the Democratic Party, biggest scandal in their history, arguably in the modern era.\n\nMORGAN: And do you accept, Chuck, as Jake pretty much did and Alex did. The mainstream media in America, both television, cable, and newspapers and so on, just collectively massively dropped the ball with this, and that one of the reasons is that there clearly has been an inherent bias against Trump and pro pretty much anyone that might stop him pervading through the mainstream media, so there wasn't the intent perhaps to go looking for the real story as there might have been had it been Trump.\n\nTODD: Well, look, I always try to divide it in half because I don't accept the premise that a cable host is a journalist, right? And there was one cable host in particular that would attack members of the press, attack any columnist that came out and said, Joe Biden doesn't have it, he shouldn't run again.\n\nAnd so, but I accept the premise. Look, where I think the ball was dropped was the White House press corps in that building, right? That's where, you know, this is the conversation Jake and I have had, you know, and we've been in those chairs, you know, that's where you, sort of notice these things. Where's the president today? How come he's not coming to talk to us? That missing relentlessness.\n\nAnd I think that, you know, I, I joke Trump derangement syndrome is something that a lot of people have, right? It's not just people that are Trump opponents that have it. Trump fans sometimes have it, right? They think there's mystical powers in in sort of Trump derangement syndrome. But I do think there are a lot of people in that Biden White House and then some in sort of the intelligentsia of the press, not the day to day journalists who were looking at like, well yeah, Biden is struggling, but Trump's crazy, so the choice is kind of impaired Biden versus crazy Trump.\n\nSo it became sort of a, it was that became the rationalization. I'm not saying it was the right rationalization, but I don't think it was like a collective cover up more than it was sort of almost human response to geez, I have a bad idea over here and a worse one over there, which do I choose?\n\nJEFFERSON MORLEY: But Piers, maybe, maybe your question is, you know, which is the bigger scandal in terms of the president? Well, what's, which is the bigger scandal in terms of the press? You know, the press distinguished itself in Watergate and the press did not distinguish itself in this, so for the press, this is a bigger scandal than Watergate. \n\nPIERS: But this comes in the backdrop also, Chuck, of page 85 of the book, “a long time Biden aide, he just had to win that he could disappear for 4 years, he'd only have to show proof of life every once in a while.”\n\nI found that the most shocking thing I read in the whole book, and there were a lot of candidates. Just the fact that a long time Biden aide basically saying he could be a zombie, that we just shook into life with an electric bolt everywhere.\n\nTODD: Look, Pierce, I'm gonna, I'm gonna defend some members of the press in this because look, I was somebody that spoke out early questioning whether this was the case. I was interviewing Dean Phillips when other people at the organization that I was at was trying to get him unbooked from the shows when he was challenging basically on the entire premise this guy's not up to the job, right? That was the entire premise of the campaign.\n\nBut let's remember – I, I really think that the attempt to make this a media scandal is usually by folks who are trying to promote their own media. This is a scandal of the Democratic Party and this is where I do think that any Democrat that served in the Biden administration, should answer for this, should have to answer for this, and I think it's gonna have a hard time answering for this.\n\nI mean, I think this is a moment and, and what it is is you have a party that went three straight elections that they did not let their voters decide who the nominee was. The voters didn't make the decision in 16, Barack Obama did. The voters didn't make the decision in 2020, Jim Clyburn did. The voters didn't make the decision in 2024. Essentially Joe Biden did by giving, by giving the party Kamala Harris. \n\nSo this is a party that had a leadership atrophy and at the same time those that were sort of almost behaving like the old Soviet Union, which is, you know, the leader dies and everybody wants to keep their power and keep their influence. So I do think this scandal should be more laser focused on the Democratic Party.\n\nI think the press is again, I always look at the criticism of the press here. Um through the person that's making the criticism and I think in some ways there's a, there's almost an eagerness to blame the press without looking at actual who should be blamed here and it's the leadership and frankly the members of the Biden administration and the leadership of the Democratic Party who they're the ones that lied.\n\nLook, at the end of the day, no journalist is as good as their sources. The end of the day, the Democratic Party lied to the American people. The leadership of the party lied to the American people, and that's where the scandal should be centered.\n\nPIERS: Yeah, I largely don't disagree with you. I, I kind of think the bigger villains are the people in the White House who obviously knew for a fact what was actually going on with Biden. I, I do think the media are culpable too, and I do think if it had been Trump, there would have been an absolute frenzy. To get to the bottom of any cognitive issues if he was face planting left, right, and center.\n\nTODD: Is there a frenzy now though, Piers? We've got a president. If I told you a president doesn't sleep at night and instead tweets crazy stuff in the middle of the night, would you wonder if there was cognitive decline? Would you say, are they correctly covering this guy's manic behavior, because his behavior in office-\n\n[Crosstalk]\n\nPIERS: Don't not talk at once. I would say to that I've known Trump 20 years and he's behaved in this kind of way for the entire time I've known him in various, he used to behave like-\n\nTODD: I’ve heard that defense for Biden, Piers. “I've known Biden 20 years. He's always been misspeaking and stuff,” so I'm just saying, well, I\n\n[Crosstalk]\n\nPIERS: I’m not saying there’s a difference. Here’s the difference, Chuck, I would day is that Trump makes himself always available. He's always doing two hour rally speeches. He's doing endless,huddles with the press, endless interviews. He's making himself-\n\nTODD: But if the words are crazy, does that make it better?\n\nPIERS: I think it's a, I think it's a different kind of thing. You could say that Trump's a bit crazy, but I don't think you see evidence of cognitive decline. There's not a lot of difference between Trump now than there was first time round in 2016-2017. To me, watching him, I just think he's the same guy. \n\nTODD: He’s a little slower, but yeah.","summary":"Former President Biden’s health decline had been an obvious issue throughout his presidential term, but more concerns have been raised for why the media didn’t cover it enough.

The behind-the-scenes documentary follows Trump's return to the White House - and in one scene, Brian can be seen alongside the then president-elect in a VIP box at the Army-Navy game. On that occasion, Brian book a photo with Trump and confessed to a group of surprised women in the box that he had voted for the Republican. At that point, the women asked him: \"You mean, you're not voting for Kamala ?\" to which he replied: \"I just can't do that.\" Brian explained: \"And then, one of them leaned in further, and said, 'Are you voting for Trump?' And I said, 'I am. I swear!'\" As part of the series, the producer, known for working on films such as A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13, confessed the reaction he received made him feel like he was \"getting cancelled.\" The New York Times reported that Brian explained his Trump vote by saying: \"As a centrist, it was because I could feel and see Biden's deterioration and the lack of direction in the Democratic Party at that time.\" The second season of Art of the Surge, produced by former Tucker Carlson Tonight executive producer Justin Wells, is currently streaming on Fox Nation. Before voting for Trump, Brian reportedly donated to Kamala Harris in the past, and also raised money for other Democrats. After his confession emerged, fans took to Reddit to share their reactions - and while some agreed with his thought process, others said the fact that he no longer agreed with the direction of Democrats doesn't justify voting for Republicans, as there are \"other choices\" too.

Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nJust this past week, following the Boulder, Colorado, attack against people protesting for Hamas to release Israeli hostages, President Donald Trump announced a new travel ban targeting many Muslim-majority nations. Notably, Egypt—where the Boulder attacker was from—wasn’t on the list.\n\n“It should come as no surprise that Trump’s racist travel ban overwhelmingly targets Black and brown people from countries in Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean,\" said Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib in a statement. \"These policies are rooted in white nationalism and will only increase hate, xenophobia, and Islamophobia in our country.\"\n\nTlaib, notably, refused to endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president last year. And she wasn’t alone. \n\nIn 2020, heavily Muslim Dearborn, Michigan, backed Joe Biden, giving him 69% of their vote. In 2024, only 36% of the city voted for Harris, while 42% backed Trump. Another 18% backed Green Party candidate Jill Stein. As Politico summarized in a headline, “Dearborn’s Arab Americans feel vindicated by Harris’ loss.”\n\nAh yes, sweet, sweet vindication. Weirdly, there aren’t many protests outside the White House. Where are the numerous rallies against “Killer Vance”? Where are the chants of “Genocide Don”?

Big publishers generally consider taking on only writers already represented by agents, which makes literary agencies a front line of sorts. As the person opening the mail, I was the front line of the front line. I saw the true democratic range of the slush pile, full of pitches that no one had vouched for and, for the most part, that no one ever would.\n\nOne thing I learned: There’s a lot of writing out there that you, the reader, just don’t need in your life. Some of it is inaccurate. Some of it is self-serving. Above all, a lot of it is just not interesting enough to find many readers: generic, predictable, telling you something you’ve already heard. Editorial gatekeepers get a bad name, but from another point of view, they are heroically holding back a tidal wave of crap while, ideally, letting the good stuff through.\n\nThat early lesson in the value of editorial judgment came back to me this week, when The New York Times reported on an effort taking shape at The Washington Post under its owner, Jeff Bezos, and its publisher, Will Lewis. Through a project internally called Ripple, Post executives intend to dramatically expand opinion writing at the paper, creating an offering outside the paywall that will include content from partner news organizations and Substack. More controversially, a final phase of the plan will employ an AI writing coach called Ember to assist “nonprofessional writers” in submitting op-eds.\n\nThis effort was not exactly news to me. Until January, I was a senior editor at the now almost completely hollowed-out Opinions section of the Post. Along with others from across the organization, I’d participated about a year ago in a brainstorming session on what would become Ripple. At that point, it was clear already that Bezos was interested in massively scaling up the output of our section, perhaps on the model of Amazon—which had scaled up and up for years before turning a profit. It had also become clear that the way to management’s heart was to cite artificial intelligence as the means to any end, a special technological sauce to be drizzled on everything.\n\nAlthough I’d started out skeptical, by the end of the session, I was convinced that the Post did have the potential to reach a larger audience. Readers want locally relevant news, but local outlets are succumbing one by one to the dynamics of a centralized online market for both content and advertising. If we were so determined to scale up, why couldn’t the Post partner with existing local news sources, offering them a tech back end, a network effect, and a cut of resources while tapping a much larger pool of locally written and edited work?\n\nSome elements of those ideas seem to have trickled into the Ripple project. But another vision was presented at the brainstorm too, the spark of what is now called Ember. The concept seemed to be that anyone could write a good op-ed, if only they had coaching from an AI editor. As a newsroom AI strategist explained the premise to the members of the group—most of whom had never faced an inbox of op-ed submissions—I felt filled with dread, because the content that this program would yield sounded dreadful.\n\nWhen you consider pitches, as an editor of opinion content, you look for surprise: insightful analysis of new information, diagnosis of and perhaps solutions to an unappreciated problem, a personal tale told in a way that makes you laugh or tear up, an original way of experiencing something familiar. Generative AI based on large language models, by contrast, is optimized to produce writing with the opposite qualities. It is a predictability machine, operating by asking what word is most likely to come next in a sentence based on all the other text that has fed into its training data. This doesn’t mean that AI can’t be a useful tool for certain kinds of writing and editing, but it does mean that an AI editor will probably exacerbate exactly the qualities that make the opinion slush pile so slushy in the first place. What Ember seems likely to produce, in other words, is the kind of writing I have spent my whole career trying to hold back.\n\nThere are good uses for AI at a newspaper, which is why it’s so puzzling that everyone keeps trying to make AI do not those tasks but the ones it is bad at, the ones that we humans most want to keep for ourselves. Just to take one example, much of the Washington Post archive is inaccessible via search; why not use AI to crawl, tag, and make discoverable this huge body of work?\n\nMaybe because that’s not showy enough. Everyone these days seems to want to make AI the writer, the editor, the creator, the star. But within media, at least, that’s not the best use case for this technology. Instead, we should be using these powerful tools for scut work, data crunching, even brainstorming—not as a substitute for the editorial judgment and critical thought that make writing worth reading.\n\n“The values of The Post do not need changing,” Bezos wrote when he bought the newspaper, in 2013. “The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.” That declaration became harder to trust last year, when Bezos blocked the Post editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, on the pretext that he had suddenly decided that making presidential endorsements gave the impression of bias—only to cheer the “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory” of Donald Trump just a few weeks later.\n\nThe proposed use of Ember casts doubt on the commitment to readers too. If Bezos is really interested in scaling up opinion writing beyond the scope of human editors, what he’s essentially doing is either starting a social blogging network—something like Medium, Reddit, or Substack—or a contributor platform of glorified press releases, such as the one abandoned in 2018 by HuffPost as a drag on its brand. As the New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen wrote on X, “When I was editor of HuffPost we shut down our contributor platform because it was bad for our journalism and it did not contribute significant traffic or revenue.” If Bezos wants to run a social network, perhaps to compete with Elon Musk for clout, that’s fine. But let’s not pretend that it’s journalism, or that it’s good for the Post and its readers.\n\nAs recently as 2021, when the paper had already been under Bezos’s ownership for years, the Post was touting a plan to add 41 new editors to the newsroom. “This expansion demonstrates anew that The Washington Post is an ascendant news organization, with boundless ambitions and a growing capacity to meet them,” wrote then–Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and her team.\n\nThat memo might as well be from another universe. Today, the Post’s owner seems to have lost track of those ambitions, or replaced them with other ones. But if the journalistic or commercial health of the paper as an institution still matters to him, I hope he will realize that using AI to scale up the slush pile is a poor idea. If that’s really Bezos’s dream for the nation’s readers, he should pursue it separate from the Post, rather than risk undermining the editorial tradition that has made the paper great.","summary":"Reducing the role of human editorial judgment is the last thing opinion journalism needs.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/washington-post-ai-opinion/683064/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3NyILIeUVw0CuiSrVeiCa217U9A=/0x169:4994x2770/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/06/2025_06_06_Wapo_Slushpile/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 13:30:00","author":"Amanda Katz","authors":["Amanda Katz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":329081646,"title":"JD Vance stays silent as Musk and Trump clash publicly — could he be the ultimate winner in this feud?","text":"JD Vance silence on Musk feud raises big 2025 questions — is this the most Game of Thrones move in US politics?- JD Vance, the vice president under President Donald Trump, is quietly navigating a political storm that’s pitting two of the most powerful figures in America—Trump and Elon Musk—against each other. And while their public fallout has grabbed headlines, Vance’s calculated silence is drawing just as much attention. Known for his combative defense of Trump, Vance is now choosing diplomacy over drama, fueling speculation that his endgame might involve much more than just loyalty. Let’s break down what’s going on—and why it matters for the future of the Republican party, the tech elite, and the White House. Why is JD Vance staying silent in Trump vs Musk feud? JD Vance’s quiet response to the Trump vs Musk feud is out of character. The Ohio senator-turned-vice-president has a history of jumping into political fights—especially when Trump is under fire. But when Musk unloaded harsh criticism on Trump on May 23, calling him ungrateful and even connecting him to the late Jeffrey Epstein, Vance didn’t rush to defend the president. For a man who once told Vice President Kamala Harris to “go to hell” over Afghanistan and criticized Pope Francis indirectly over deportation policies, this unusually calm tone raised eyebrows. Is JD Vance taking orders—or playing his own game? According to The Independent, there may be a simple reason: Trump asked Vance to stay diplomatic when it comes to Musk. That would explain his low-key tone. But insiders believe there’s more at stake here than just loyalty to his boss. Vance’s political career has been closely tied to the tech billionaire circle, especially Peter Thiel, who backed his 2022 Senate campaign with $15 million. Thiel also reportedly introduced Vance to Trump. Elon Musk and David Sacks, part of the so-called “PayPal mafia,” were also instrumental in promoting Vance’s rise in Republican circles. The same trio allegedly lobbied for Vance to become Trump’s running mate in 2024. So when Musk publicly endorsed the idea of impeaching Trump and replacing him with Vance, replying “Yes” to a tweet suggesting the switch, it wasn’t just political noise—it was a signal. And it placed Vance in a tight spot. Could JD Vance really replace Donald Trump? That’s the big question. In today’s political climate, Elon Musk’s influence in the Republican party is stronger than ever. He spent $395 million backing Republicans during the 2024 election cycle. If Musk throws his full weight behind Vance, it could fast-track the vice president’s path to the top job—especially if Trump stumbles legally or politically. Vance’s critics argue he’s always been a man with two faces: a former Trump critic who once called him noxious and reprehensible, now his most loyal second-in-command. But loyalty in Washington has a short shelf life. And Trump, known for firing even his closest allies, may not appreciate someone who’s seen as too close to the billionaire tech elite now turning on him. Is Vance’s silence a calculated climb to power? Political observers are comparing Vance to Petyr Baelish, better known as Littlefinger from Game of Thrones—a man who saw chaos not as danger, but as opportunity. “Chaos is a ladder,” Littlefinger said. And Vance may be climbing it. By staying quiet, he avoids alienating Musk, who publicly supports him, while still appearing loyal to Trump. It’s a risky game, but one that could pay off if Trump falters and the Republican party needs a fresh face to take over. This approach also keeps him out of direct conflict—something that could damage his chances in the long run. For now, he’s simply letting Trump and Musk fight it out while maintaining ties with both. What’s next for JD Vance and the Republican party? It’s clear that JD Vance is more than just a vice president. He’s a central figure in a high-stakes power struggle between traditional Trump loyalists and a new wave of tech-aligned libertarian conservatives. His silence may seem passive, but it could be strategic. Trump has spent years eliminating “traitors” from his inner circle. If Vance wants to stay in the game—and maybe even win it—he needs to walk a careful line. So far, he’s doing just that.FAQs: Q1: Why is JD Vance silent on the Trump-Musk feud? JD Vance may be staying quiet to balance loyalty to Trump and support from Elon Musk. Q2: Could JD Vance replace Trump as president? Elon Musk’s public support hints Vance could be a future presidential pick if Trump stumbles.","summary":"JD Vance silence on Musk feud is turning heads as the vice president chooses not to defend Donald Trump in his explosive clash with Elon Musk. Known for fiercely backing Trump, Vance’s quiet stance suggests a deeper strategy—possibly eyeing future power. With ties to Musk, Peter Thiel, and the “PayPal mafia,” his silence may be a bold political move. As Musk publicly signals support for Vance, Trump may see betrayal.
