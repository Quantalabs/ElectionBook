He then pivoted to speculating about the future of Norah O'Donnell, who left \"CBS Evening News\" earlier this year but remains at the network. \"Pay her $12 million a year, and she’s not going to be there very long,\" Trump told the Daily Caller. \"But if she’s not already out, I mean, she’s pretty close, I would say she’s pretty close.\" MARCO RUBIO ACCUSES CBS REPORTER OF PUSHING ‘STUPID MEDIA NARRATIVE’ IN FIERY CLASH OVER ZELENSKYY Trump then invoked Brennan, saying, \"The woman on the ‘Face the Nation’ is so bad.\" He turned to Leavitt, who was present during the interview, and asked, \"What do you think of her?\" \"She’s stupid. You can put that on the record,\" Leavitt said. \"She's nasty,\" Trump added. LEAVITT BALKS AT REPORTERS' LA RIOT COVERAGE, ‘DISINGENUOUS ATTACK’ IN BRIEFING: ‘WHAT A STUPID QUESTION’ Trump went on to praise Secretary of State Marco Rubio, saying, \"He handled her\" during a recent interview. After Daily Caller White House reporter Reagan Reese noted Rubio's frequent appearances on \"Face the Nation,\" Trump replied, \"Because he’s good and he’s smart.\" Neither Brennan nor CBS News responded to requests for comment. Last month, Rubio had a contentious exchange with Brennan over Trump's highly-anticipated meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders after his Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as backup tomorrow,\" Brennan said. \"That is not true,\" Rubio interjected, as the two spoke over each other. \"But that's not true, they're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied.\" \"We had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy… They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They are coming here because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week… The President talked to these leaders as early as Thursday… This is such a stupid media narrative,\" Rubio said.

Only 4 percent aligning with Donald Trump on this issue is incredibly low,’ Enten remarked during a segment on CNN’s News Central.\n\n‘I’ve never seen anything quite like it.’ \n\nFor left-leaning respondents, 60 percent said they were dissatisfied with the case as well and 3 percent said they were satisfied.\n\nEnten pointed out that Trump had relied on the backing of conspiracy theorists to secure his reelection and had frequently vowed to fully disclose Epstein’s case file.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department released findings stating that Epstein never even kept a ‘client list’ and that he killed himself in jail.\n\nThe announcement sparked strong criticism from prominent MAGA supporters and fringe theorists, whom Enten noted were instrumental in reviving Trump’s political standing after his 2020 election defeat.\n\n‘Donald Trump, from the very beginning, has been pushing conspiracy theories over and over and over again, and he has benefited from them historically,’ the data expert said.\n\n ‘And now, finally, it’s coming back to actually bite him.’\n\nWhen asked by host Sara Sidner what the poll indicated overall, Enten replied: ‘I would say that the word is dissatisfied. \n\n‘That is how Americans feel in terms of the releases so far in the Epstein case.’\n\nHe highlighted how QAnon’s support for Trump in last year’s election proved crucial to his win over Kamala Harris, when the Republican repeatedly suggested there was more to the case than meets the eye. \n\nSuch claims stoked the interests of many, especially on the right. \n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are now calling on Trump to make good on his promise. \n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday said that the files should be released.\n\nThe Justice Department’s announcement on the findings earned harsh criticism from leading MAGA figures, including Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Laura Loomer.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had insisted in February that the Epstein list was ‘sitting on my desk right now to review.’ She subsequently released Epstein documents to right-wing influencers that turned out to contain no new information.\n\nSome critics have called for Bondi to be fired while pointing to the announcement as proof of a conspiracy surrounding Epstein and his associates.\n\nEpstein and Trump have were pictured together several times in the ’90s and 2000s. Both carved out presences in Manhattan and Palm Beach.\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump blamed Barack Obama, Hilly Clinton, former FBI boss James Comey and ‘the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration’ for the Epstein files, painting it as unreliable.\n\nHe also reiterated the Justice Department’s stance that a list of Epstein’s old clients did not exist, angering many who voted for him in the process. \n\nEnten hit this home with data from a series of older polls, including one of registered voters who believed in conspiracy theories peddled by QAnon.\n\nThe poll, conducted by nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute two months before the election, showed Trump beating Harris by a margin of +61.\n\nThe same poll found registered voters who rejected such conspiracies preferred Harris over Trump by a margin of +16.\n\nAnother poll showed how registered GOP voters and right-leaning independents who picked Trump in 2024 and 2016 have repeatedly sided with conspiracy theories the president has pushed for years. \n\n‘Trump swam in the conspiracy theorist waters for years, and now, finally, the sharks in those waters are coming to try and get him,’ Enten said in response. \n\nOn Saturday, Trump tried to wave off disgruntled voters clamoring for the full case file with a widely ridiculed post to Truth Social.\n\n‘What’s going on with my “boys” and, in some cases, “gals”?’ asked the president. ‘We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and “selfish people’ are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.’\n\nA report from Wired last week found the surveillance footage released to back up the Justice Department’s claim that Epstein killed himself in a New York City prison cell in 2019 was likely edited.\n\nFurther analysis from the publication revealed a full three minutes of the footage was cut out. \n\nDaily Mail contacted the Federal Bureau of Prisons for comment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCNN&#8217;s resident data expert revealed that Donald Trump may be in deep trouble with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Faces Fresh Criticism in Handling of Jeffrey Epstein Scandal, According to CNN Poll first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/trump-faces-fresh-criticism-in-handling-of-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-according-to-cnn-poll/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-Poll-How-Americans-feel-about-info-released.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 22:37:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":356847380,"title":"ICE director accuses CBS of trying to 'stop Secretary Noem from telling the truth'","text":"Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Todd Lyons said Tuesday it was a \"shame\" that CBS News allegedly edited Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem’s comments on \"Face the Nation.\" Noem claimed on X that CBS cut half her answer about Kilmar Abrego Garcia and \"the threat he poses to American public safety\" to \"whitewash the truth\" about him. CBS responded that the edit was made for time and that the full response was available in the show’s online transcript and on its YouTube page.

CBS ACCUSED OF 'SIGNIFICANT AND INTENTIONAL NEWS DISTORTION' IN FCC COMPLAINT OVER '60 MINUTES' EDIT Lyons praised Noem and the Trump administration for transparency in ICE operations and the people being arrested and deported, including Garcia. \"In the last administration, we were always on defense when it came to media,\" Lyons said. \"Now we want to make sure the public actually knows what the men and women of ICE are doing out there every day. In the interview, she talked about this offender and why he needs to be deported back to his country. I think it’s a shame they would go ahead and edit that because this person isn’t a ‘Maryland man.’ He is a criminal alien from El Salvador that’s living in Maryland that we need to take off the streets.\" In the clip that aired, Noem was asked why the Trump administration was working to deport Garcia instead of forcing him to face charges in the United States. \"Prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and Pam Bondi’s department, so we will let them do that, although this individual does have criminal charges pending. He has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States of America,\" Noem said. The on-air portion cut off the rest of her answer and went directly to host Ed O'Keefe's next question about whether the government would still seek to deport him to Uganda.

He was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children.

There’s a not-insignificant likelihood Democrats could take the House in the 2026 midterms. It’s not out of the question that he could win the presidency in 2028, as well. It will only take one term to turn back most of President Donald Trump’s executive agenda. \n\nIN FOCUS: CALIFORNIA’S MARIJUANA MARKET: FROM HIGH HOPES TO ‘COMPLETE FAILURE’\n\nRepublicans scoff at the prospects of an oily politician like Gavin Newsom winning the presidency. But it’s not exactly far-fetched. The California governor is more shrewd and effective than Kamala Harris, who lost the race by a relatively narrow margin considering her situation and abilities. \n\nNewsom has already situated himself as the leader of the opposition. His appeal to Democrats is predicated on the notion that the national party isn’t fighting and is being emasculated by the opposition, which is pretty much the same grievance Trump ran on in 2015. Newsom “fights” by employing aggressive, often juvenile, Trumpian tactics. Sure, mimicking the president online is transparently cringy to many of us. But this brand also works with a lot of voters. Let’s not forget that a large chunk of the Republican Party also mimics Trump. Most of them, not very well. \n\nNewsom isn’t a good governor, you say. Does it matter? Was former President Joe Biden a good senator? He could barely cobble together coherent sentences when he ran in 2020. What were former President Barack Obama’s accomplishments? Trump had no record, either. So perhaps not doing anything but tweeting a lot is the best model for campaign success. We’re in age of the influencer. If the most vital aspect of a candidacy were accomplishments, few of these people would be in power. \n\nTrump first began “exploring” a 2016 presidential run in 2013, letting the press know he was dropping a million dollars to investigate his odds. I don’t for a second believe that Trump cared what some pinhead statistician told him about his presidential chances. Legend has it that Trump decided to run for the White House back in 2011, after Barack Obama mocked him for his reversal on “birtherism” at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. That was five years out. \n\nAt the time, the Republican Party’s favorability had fallen to historic lows in Gallup polling. Republicans agonized over “autopsies” while Democrats were concern-trolling over the prospects of a nation without two functioning major political parties. \n\nAt that time, Democrats believed Obama, with the help of demographic fate, had created a permanent political realignment in the country. And they comported themselves accordingly, with hubris and abuses of executive and bureaucratic power. A few years earlier, George W. Bush’s inner circle had convinced themselves of the same. Without fail, political parties see their election as special and enduring. It never works out that way. Voters aren’t automatons. Coalitions break up. History happens. \n\nAnd in many ways, the Trump coalition is even more rickety than most, as it relies on the will and personality of a single man. \n\nTrump is a generational political whirlwind, whose celebrity uniquely appeals to many non-traditional Republican voters. Latinos almost certainly are one group more comfortable supporting him than they would an average Republican. And the personal loyalty Trump engenders from around 30% of Republicans is also quite rare. To this group, anything the man says or does is championed as truth. “Let him cook” is the kind of inane ode we hear to this alleged genius, irrespective of the topic. \n\nVery few politicians can lean on such adulation, even if voters are predisposed to agreeing with them. This Trumpian contingent isn’t the majority, but it’s enough to sink any Republican who challenges Trump.\n\nCan this loyalty be transposed onto a successor? It’s unlikely. Will the mantle holder be Vice-President JD Vance, the favorite of anti-market ideologues on the “new right” who backfill Trump’s messy, instinctive politics with antiquated mercantilist and isolationist ideas? Most voters don’t really understand how antagonistic the “new right” is towards economic dynamism. What happens if Trump‘s watered-down protectionist policies catch up with the economy? Even if they don’t, would Vance generate a similar devotion from voters? Right now, even in good times, he is as unpopular as Kamala Harris. \n\nOr will the successor be Marco Rubio, who’s really found his calling as an effective Secretary of State? As a politician, “Little Marco” is one of the great trend chasers in recent American political history, from Tea Party libertarian to establishment dealmaker to economic statist. Or will it be Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was not only overwhelmingly rejected by Republican primary voters in 2024 but now tainted because he came at the king too early and missed? \n\nWhoever ends up the nominee will have to face the reality of the GOP losing ground among the fastest growing and most vital demographic, the suburban voter. A populist Republican candidate will have to recreate Trump’s success among the fastest shrinking demo in the country, the “working class” white voter, in places like Michigan and Pennsylvania. \n\nNone of this is to say that Trump-obsessed Democrats are in a great spot, either. Perhaps they’ll be able to detach a national campaign from the weird extremist planks of the activist class. Perhaps they will turn to someone like Josh Shapiro. The popular governor of Pennsylvania’s biggest problem, of course, is that he is both Jewish and relatively moderate in an era in which antisemitism and radicalism have been normalized among many progressives. It is almost surely Shapiro’s support of Israel — though the governor cowardly walked it back — that derailed his veep chances in 2024. Then again, perhaps the Gaza war wraps up by 2027, and progressives will have moved onto a new cause de jour. \n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about Trump’s success is that his appeal centers on “far-right” positions, when the president can barely even be considered a political conservative. Many voters believe the nation, and major parties, lost the plot. Trump’s positions would have been familiar to most liberals 20 years ago.\n\nThe question is whether or not Democrats come back to the middle, and whether the post-Trump Republican Party will be able to sell the president’s populist message. It would only take one downturn to turn American elections upside down again. Because nothing is a sure thing in politics. Which is always worth remembering.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

In his announcement video, he said it was time for a younger voice in Congress. \n\nOther strong potential candidates include Assembly Member Micah Lasher, Assembly Member Alex Bores, and New York City Council Member Erik Bottcher, according to City and State New York.\n\nJacob Rubashkin, deputy editor at Inside Elections, anticipated that more than 20 people could realistically run for Nadler’s vacant seat, which is expected to remain in Democratic hands. He also noted that a familiar face and fellow colleague of Nadler’s could shake things up.\n\n“This is going to battle royale — and don’t sleep on the possibility Dan Goldman switches districts since NY-12 fits him better, and lets more progressive candidates fight over NY-10,” Rubashkin said.\n\nLasher, 43, served as an aide to Nadler, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He defeated his more progressive challenger to win the seat representing the Upper West Side and West Harlem.\n\nBottcher, 46, represents much of Manhattan’s neighborhoods, including Greenwich Village, Chelsea, and Hell’s Kitchen. Prior to serving on the city council, he worked in former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, handling marriage equality issues.\n\nHe celebrated Nadler’s years of service in a statement to X on Monday evening.\n\n“Let us honor Jerry’s extraordinary legacy not only with gratitude, but by carrying his fight forward with the urgency this moment demands,” Bottcher said. “From protecting democracy to advancing equality to defeating fascism, we must take his work further.”\n\nBores, who is around a decade younger than either Lasher or Bottcher, represents the east side of Manhattan and is in his second term in the state legislature. He gained a reputation for introducing numerous bills to regulate artificial intelligence technology.\n\nHe also praised Nadler’s years in politics in a statement.\n\n“From the NY Assembly to the US Congress, Congressman Nadler has always led with the conviction of his beliefs and a deep commitment to his constituents,” Bores said. “The people of the 12th Congressional District deserve that kind of [representation].\n\nCity and State New York reported that Lasher is likely to be the top target to beat for Democrats, given his young age and connection to Nadler. He gained credibility with the party’s grassroots base after endorsing New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, whom Nadler also endorsed. As a staunch supporter of Israel, Lasher has become a bridge for pro-Israel New Yorkers who are concerned about Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist and Muslim, winning the election this fall.\n\nNadler’s retirement is one of four from the House Democratic caucus this cycle, opting to vacate their seats instead of face progressive challengers and competitive primary races in 2026. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) announced her retirement in April after gaining a primary challenger in Kat Abughazaleh, 26.\n\nOther retirees include Reps. Dwight Evans (D-PA) and Danny Davis (D-IL). \n\nHowever, many older and establishment Democrats are facing primary challengers next year and, for now, are not retiring. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), a 15-term incumbent, is facing a challenge from a 37-year-old former staffer. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is facing a primary competitor who is a former aide to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-CA).\n\nYounger Democrats have been eager for generational change within the congressional delegations in the wake of the 2024 election. Former President Joe Biden was insistent on running for reelection, but eventually, due to mounting pressure from Democratic colleagues and polling, he stepped aside for former Vice President Kamala Harris to secure the nomination.\n\nNadler said the fervor surrounding Biden and the growing stubbornness of elderly members in politics clinging to power pushed him to the decision to retire.\n\nHOUSE RETURNS TO PACKED SCHEDULE, LONG TO-DO LIST, AND EPSTEIN DRAMA\n\n“Watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that,” the congressman told the New York Times, adding that a younger successor “can maybe do better, can maybe help us more.”\n\n“I’m not saying we should change over the entire party,” he continued. “But I think a certain amount of change is very helpful, especially when we face the challenge of Trump and his incipient fascism.”","summary":"Longtime Rep.

But how competitive the race becomes will ultimately depend on who secures the Democratic and Republican nominations, he added.Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kauffman wrote in a statement that the party is \"confident the next generation of Republican leaders will continue building on her incredible legacy.\"Newsweek reached out to the Iowa Democratic Party for comment via email.Why It MattersIowa has shifted rightward over the past decade and backed President Donald Trump by double digits in November, but Democrats are eyeing it as a potential opportunity in the 2026 midterms. Historically, the party of the president performs poorly in the midterms, fueling Democratic optimism about competing in more conservative states.They'll need to win in some double-digit Trump states to win a Senate majority, currently held by Republicans, 53-47. Maine, which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 points, and North Carolina, which supported Trump by about 3 points, are Democrats' top targets. But no other GOP-held seat in a single-digit Trump or Harris-won state is up for grabs—meaning they have to turn to states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio or Texas to compete for control of the upper chamber.What To KnowErnst confirmed she will not seek reelection in a video posted to X, saying, \"After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I will not be seeking reelection in 2026. This was no easy decision.\"Her announcement leaves the race with a sense of uncertainty, as it's unclear who will run to replace her on the Republican side. Before her decision to exit the race, she was viewed as the favorite, though forecasters did view the contest as potentially competitive. The Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball classify the race as \"Likely Republican,\" and it's unclear whether that would change by Ernst no longer being the candidate.There has been no polling on how other Republicans would fare against Democratic candidates. Betting odds, however, still gave Republicans an advantage. The GOP held a 68 percent chance of victory in Kalshi's betting market, down from a 75 percent chance August 26.Hagle said the party that is not in the White House typically performs better in the midterms but noted that Democrats have also been seeing lackluster polling numbers.\"It's kind of a headwind that they're running into,\" he said. \"So it's hard to say whether Ernst not being in the race is going to give Democrats much more of a chance. We'll have to see, of course, it also depends on who the Republicans end up picking as their nominee, as well as who the Democrats pick as theirs in terms of the quality of the candidates and so forth.\"David Peterson, professor of political science at Iowa State University, told Newsweek that Ernst's decision \"is likely to shake this race up a fair amount.\"\"First, this is likely to be a competitive Republican primary. I know that people often work behind the scenes to clear the field, but there are a few high profile Republicans who avoid the gubernatorial race who would be well positioned to challenge for this race. A tough primary fight could weaken the nominee more than the clear field that Ernst would have,\" he said.Whoever emerges from that primary will also lack the same incumbency advantage Ernst would have had, Peterson added.He said he believes the election will likely be \"a more competitive race than people might think.\"\"Iowa has trended to the right since 2016, but the Democrats are better positioned than they have been in the last several cycles. They will have a top tier candidate for the open Governor's race in likely nominee Rob Sand. He has already raised a lot of money and is well respected. Two of the four House seats will likely be close again with the Democrats also having strong candidates in those races. If [Ashley] Hinson runs for Senate, her seat will also be close. This is also just likely to be a very good year for Democrats,\" he said.Republican Candidates in Iowa US Senate RaceAt the moment, former state Senator Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, former vice chair of the Libertarian National Committee, are running on the Republican side. But others are likely to jump into the race now that Ernst has made official her plans to retire.Representative Ashley Hinson, who represents the northeastern region of the state, wrote on X she will \"have an announcement soon about how we believe we can best serve Iowa, and how we can help President Trump make America great again.\"NATO Ambassador Matt Whitaker or Attorney General Brenna Bird have also been floated as potential candidates.A hopeful like Hinson or Bird, who are well known among Iowa voters, may be stronger candidates in terms of name recognition and experience, Hagle said.\"But of course. It's dependent on the personality and how well those candidates are able to articulate their message and whether they're talking about the right things for the race as it develops over the next 14 months,\" he added.Democratic Candidates in Iowa US Senate RaceSeveral Democrats are already in the race, including Des Moines school board member Jackie Norris, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage, state Representative Josh Turek and state Senator Zach Wahls. Former state Representative Bob Krause, who was running for Iowa's 1st Congressional District, also announced he will instead run for Senate after Ernst's call to exit.Iowa Democrats are running stronger candidates across the board than in recent elections, likely because they see 2026 as a stronger opportunity for victory than 2022, viewed as a less Democratic year. But Senate candidates are not necessarily as prolific at this point, Hagle said.\"It's going to be tougher for somebody who had only been a state legislator to then make that jump up to the U.S. Senate as opposed to maybe taking as a first step U.S. Congress,\" he added.What People Are SayingKauffman wrote in a statement: \"Senator Joni Ernst is a dedicated public servant, and Iowans have been proud to have her representing our state in the U.S. Senate for the past decade. From the start, Joni set out to make Washington squeal, and she delivered. Her work to cut government waste, stop the abuse of taxpayer dollars, protect Iowa's farms and small businesses, and pass Sarah's Law has left a lasting impact. Iowa is better off because of Senator Ernst's leadership, and we are confident the next generation of Republican leaders will continue building on her incredible legacy.\"Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote in a statement: \"A few months ago, Joni Ernst said the quiet part out loud: Republicans don't give a s*** about whether their own constituents live or die, as long as the richest few get richer.

J.B. Pritzker’s resistance to the National Guard deploying in Chicago.\n\nChicago, a city that has a third of the population New York City does, had 54 shootings over Labor Day weekend (“Chi-town hell,” Sept. 2).\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have both made clear their intent to sue the Trump administration if the National Guard is deployed to their city to restore order.\n\nTheir intentions are solely to protect the illegal occupation of Chicago. They fear that the presence of the National Guard would somehow be an ICE operation.\n\nJupiter, Fla.\n\nGov. Pritzker stated he “will not stand idly by” if the National Guard is sent to Chicago.\n\nIn other words, the governor would rather have criminals harming Chicagoans than admit help is needed.\n\nEileen Corr\n\nBrewster, Mass.\n\nI just don’t get why these Democrats are fighting President Trump on crime issues. Are they in favor of more crime?\n\nIf Democrats were smart — which I know is asking a lot — they would let Trump try to fix the issues. If he fails, then they have ammunition, and if he succeeds, even better.\n\nDems have fought Trump on everything, and have nothing to show for it. It’s time they got back to protecting their citizens, and got off Trump’s back.\n\nCharlie Honadel\n\nVenice, Fla.\n\nThe only people who would be intimidated by ICE and the National Guard are illegal aliens and other criminals.\n\nWhen Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom — two presumptive 2028 Democratic presidential candidates — are all but admitting their electoral prospects are tied directly to immigrants and criminals voting in our elections, you know that sanity is completely lost.\n\nIt’s time for Democrats to find new leaders who American citizens will vote for, instead of trying to import the hordes of the Third World to become permanent Democrats and lifelong welfare recipients.\n\nNick McNulty\n\nWindham, NH\n\nPresident Trump has been making great strides to reduce violent crime in America. All politicians should give a thousand cheers to this — yet many don’t.\n\nWhy do we permit so much criminality, lawlessness and violence to be so commonplace in America?\n\nCome on, lawmakers; put your big pants on, then collaborate. No more pampering criminals.\n\nJack Ridolph\n\nThe Villages, Fla.\n\nThe Issue: President Trump revoking former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Secret Service detail.\n\nPresident Trump truly should not cancel Secret Service Protection for Kamala Harris or any other person who heretofore has warranted it (“Don cuts off Kam’s security detail,” Aug. 30).\n\nThere are people who have displeased the president, but are nevertheless vulnerable to harm —and should one of them become a victim, it would reflect badly on Trump.\n\nHe must remember that he is the “peace president” who wants to protect all Americans from crime.\n\nGracie Desiato\n\nOne wonders what goes on in the mind of a person like Trump when he withdraws former President Joe Biden’s extension of protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump must be fully aware of the danger he is inflicting upon Harris, granted our extraordinary and dismal record of gun violence and the enthusiastic loyalty of his MAGA followers, who don’t seem capable of any moral judgment.\n\nIn effect, Trump is throwing her to the wolves for disposal.\n\nNicholas Molinari\n\nWant to weigh in on today’s stories?

Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker blamed the delay partly on the “shitshow” merger between Skydane and Comedy Central’s parent company Paramount, which was finally approved last month.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nFirst Look at ‘28 Years Later: The Bone Temple’ Promises ‘Bonkers, Off-the-Wall Energy’\n\nFour Best Friends Made an Album as Kids. 25 Years Later, It's a Cult Classic\n\nSee Cyndi Lauper Bring Out Joni Mitchell, Cher, SZA at Final Show of Farewell Tour\n\nBurning Man Homicide: Police Seek Help Identifying Victim\n\nSince returning, South Park has relentlessly attacked Trump and his administration. In the first episode, for instance, they satirized part of Paramount’s pre-merger lawsuit settlement with Trump after the president accused CBS News’ 60 Minutes of election interference for how it edited an interview with Kamala Harris. Trump has said that the deal includes a $16 million settlement, plus $20 million “from the new Owners, in Advertising, PSAs, or similar Programming.” South Park skewered the PSA arrangement with a phony spot showing a fully nude Trump wandering the desert with a “teeny tiny” penis.\n\nSubsequent episodes, meanwhile, have focused on ICE raids and conservative “debate” culture, as well as Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Washington D.C.\n\nSamuel L.

He says I’m a pessimist. Whatever, I’m too anti-Trump,” he said.\n\nHe added that, when he broadcast his “War Room” program last Thursday, he felt like he had a “babysitter” that was “looking over my shoulder,” which prompted his exit. \n\nJones initially described Shroyer’s exit from Infowars as a family emergency, but Shroyer clarified that “there was no family emergency. I walked off the show.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Jones lashed out at his former employee, directly addressing the content of Shroyer’s stream.\n\n“You couched each statement—perfectly thought out and looking down at your notes—to be able to lie about us and try to hurt this organization for your benefit so you can be a hero,” Jones said. “You are a snake. You are a rat. You are a fraud. You are a backstabber. You are a hand biter. You are a disgrace.”\n\nShroyer has been a long-time presence on Infowars and an apparent true believer in the outlet’s extreme right-wing politics. In fact, Shroyer served time in prison after he was convicted for helping to lead the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Though he didn’t enter the Capitol, he pleaded guilty to entering a restricted area.\n\n“Shroyer helped create January 6,” federal prosecutors said in their filing at the time. \n\nAlong with pushing conspiracies and election violence on Infowars, Shroyer also used racial epithets about Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Black.\n\nJones has been backing Trump since he first ran for president in 2016. But in covering up the Epstein scandal instead of offering the full transparency he once championed, Trump has been making a departure from the beliefs Jones touts on Infowars.\n\nSimilarly, after years of Jones falsely accusing Democratic presidents like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden of hoping to deploy military assets against Americans, it is Trump who has done so.\n\nJones faces more pressure from a mess of his own making. He is on the hook for millions owed to the families of Sandy Hook survivors that he smeared, and the assets of Infowars are still set to be auctioned off as payment.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Jones hasn’t been having a great year, even as he watches his favorite politician retake the presidency.","summary":"Pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Alex Jones lashed out against former Infowars host Owen Shroyer Monday, describing him as a “backstabber” and “snake.” Shroyer recently left Jones’ Infowars network, alleging that he felt pressure to soft-pedal criticism of President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nJones, Shroyer, and other Infowars contributors specialize in promoting baseless, debunked conspiracy theories.

Another image shows him on one knee presenting Lewis with the studded band engagement ring, a surprised but gleeful look plastered on her face. \n\nBooker, 56, and Lewis’ relationship was confirmed by the senator just last month. The senator was explaining to the Washington Examiner that on one of their first dates, Lewis asked him to open his TikTok app to the “For You” page.\n\n“I sort of held my breath as I opened it up, and she could see that I’m a nerd who loves food videos, animal videos,” Booker said. \n\n“It was just a funny moment, because I never thought of it through the dating lens, but here it is, you know, a year and a half later, and we’re still together.\"\n\nThe two are believed to have been dating for about a year and a half and reside together in Washington, D.C.\n\nBooker’s previous relationship with Dawson ended in February 2022.

His performance was later clipped up and turned into a pop remix.\n\nDuring the speech, Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, sparking even more reaction online.\n\nMany also posted congratulations online following the conclusion of his remarks, including former Vice President Kamala Harris. “The true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down but on who you lift up,” she wrote on X.","summary":"Booker was previously in a relationship with actor Rosario Dawson","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/cory-booker-engaged-alexis-lewis-b2818847.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/02/21/08/GettyImages-2207539404.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UDeJc4Vm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-02 21:16:15","author":"Caitlin Hornik","authors":["Caitlin Hornik"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.069},{"id":356862390,"title":"NewsBusters Podcast: Did CBS News Think We Wouldn’t Notice Their New Hatchet Job?","text":"NewsBusters Associate Editor Nick Fondacaro and I were stunned by Sunday’s Face the Nation in which the show made a baffling decision to deceptively remove a key portion of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s answer about the alleged criminal record of illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nAs our Bill D’Agostino wrote, this was part of a pattern of behavior from CBS News, stretching far beyond last year’s 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that led to a lawsuit from now-President Trump and a settlement of at least $16 million.\n\nWe also dove into CBS’s attempt to save face before diving into some delicious hypocrisy from The Atlantic’s Ashley Parker, who wrote a story over the Labor Day weekend mocking the increased law enforcement presence and National Guardsmen in Washington D.C. to combat crime.

He was very polite and hit his mark and did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business.\"\n\n To that, Maher referenced Allen's controversial reputation, quipping, \"If you think you were cancelled before…\"\n\n But Allen didn't back down. \"I only wish I could direct him now,\" he continued, prompting Maher to burst out laughing. \"If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders. He was very easy to work with.\"\n\n Trump cameoed briefly as himself in Allen's 1998 dramedy Celebrity, an ensemble film revolving around a divorcing couple played by Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis. Trump's singular scene sees Davis' Robin Simon hosting an interview show at a New York City restaurant where she spots the then-real estate mogul in the crowd and asks what he's working on. Trump then describes his plans to tear down Manhattan’s iconic St. Patrick's Cathedral to build a \"a very tall and beautiful\" office block in its place.\n\n Allen clarified that despite his interest in working with Trump again, he is registered as a democrat and voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n \"I take issue with him on 95 percent of the things, maybe 99 percent. But as an actor, he was very good,\" Allen said. \"He was very convincing.

This was a guy I used to see at the Knicks games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge beauty contests and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing.

Allen himself earned a polarizing reputation after years as a venerated director: the 89-year-old filmmaker has long been accused of sexual abuse by his daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was a child. Allen has consistently denied the allegations against him and has never been charged with a crime (though a Connecticut prosecutor said there was probable cause for a criminal case).

Trump’s New Policy Set To Include Influencers, Uber Drivers And More","text":"Influencers, rideshare drivers, performers, baristas and more will be covered under the “No Tax on Tips” policy passed as part of President Donald Trump’s recent spending bill, multiple reports suggest, as the Trump administration is poised to roll out more details about one of the president’s signature economic policies, which could impact millions of taxpayers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak on his policy to end tax on tips in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 25.\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nThe “No Tax on Tips” provision passed as part of the megabill that Trump signed into law in July, allowing workers in service professions to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes, starting with their 2025 tax return and continuing through 2028.\n\nThe $25,000 can be taken on top of the standard deduction, which is $15,750 for single filers in 2025, meaning single filers taking the standard deduction and reporting the full $25,000 in tipped income can shave a little over $40,000 off their income for tax purposes.\n\nThat amount is lower for people who earn more than $150,000 annually: For each $1,000 that a worker makes over $150,000, the amount of their deduction is reduced by $100.\n\nThe legislation says only that the law applies to workers “in an occupation which customarily and regularly received tips on or before December 31, 2024,” but did not specify professions, and the Trump administration has been expected to issue further guidance on who will be eligible for the exemption.\n\nAccording to a draft occupation list that was first reported by Axios and confirmed by multiple other outlets, the list includes 68 jobs, ranging from typical tip-based service professions like wait staff to more novel professions, like influencers, online streamers and other digital content creators.\n\nThe Trump administration has still not confirmed the exact list, and the Treasury Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nWhich Occupations Are Eligible For ‘no Tax On Tips’?\n\nAccording to the draft list first published by Axios, the list of eligible professions includes the following jobs, which the Treasury Department has divided into eight categories:\n\nBeverage & Food Service: Bartenders, Wait Staff, Food Servers (non-restaurant), Dining Room Attendants, Cafeteria Attendants, Bartender Helpers, Chefs, Cooks, Food Preparation Workers, Fast Food and Counter Workers, Dishwashers, Host Staff (Restaurant, Lounge, and Coffee Shop), Bakers\n\nEntertainment & Events: Gambling Dealers, Gambling Change Persons, Booth Cashiers, Gambling Cage Workers, Gambling and Sports Book Writers and Runners, Dancers, Musicians, Singers, Disc Jockeys (except radio), Entertainers, Performers, Digital Content Creators, Ushers, Lobby Attendants, Ticket Takers, Locker Room, Coatroom and Dressing Room Attendants\n\nHospitality & Guest Services: Baggage Porters, Bellhops, Concierges, Desk Clerks (Hotel, Motel and Resort), Maids, Housekeeping Cleaners\n\nHome Services: Home Maintenance and Repair Workers, Home Landscaping and Groundskeeping Workers, Home Electricians, Home Plumbers, Home Heating/Air Conditioning Mechanics and Installers, Home Appliance Installers and Repairers, Home Cleaning Service Workers, Locksmiths, Roadside Assistance Workers\n\nPersonal Services: Personal Care and Service Workers, Private Event Planners, Private Event and Portrait Photographers, Private Event Videographers, Event Officiants, Pet Caretakers, Tutors, Nannies, Babysitters\n\nPersonal Appearance & Wellness: Skincare Specialists, Massage Therapists, Barbers, Hairdressers, Hairstylists, Cosmetologists, Shampooers, Manicurists/Pedicurists, Eyebrow Threading and Waxing Technicians, Makeup Artists, Exercise Trainers, Group Fitness Instructors, Tattoo Artists, Piercers, Tailors, Shoe and Leather Workers and Repairers\n\nRecreation & Instruction: Golf Caddies, Self-Enrichment Teachers, Recreational and Tour Pilots, Tour Guides and Escorts, Travel Guides, Sports and Recreation Instructors\n\nTransportation & Delivery: Parking and Valet Attendants, Taxi and Rideshare Drivers, Chauffeurs, Shuttle Drivers, Goods Delivery People, Personal Vehicle and Equipment Cleaners, Private and Charter Bus Drivers, Water Taxi Operators, Charter Boat Workers, Home Movers, Rickshaw, Pedicab, and Carriage Drivers\n\nApproximately 4 million. That’s the approximate number of Americans who worked in tipped occupations as of 2023, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University, making up approximately 2.5% of all U.S. employment. It’s unclear how that estimate may be affected by the specific occupations the policy is set to cover. Many of those workers would not benefit from the “No Tax on Tips” policy, however, as the Budget Lab notes approximately 37% of tipped workers in 2022 had incomes that were low enough that they didn’t owe any federal taxes.\n\nHow Much Will No Tax On Tips Cost The Government?\n\nApproximately $40 billion through 2028, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nThere are still some outstanding questions when it comes to how the policy will play out in practice. The law specifies that the tips eligible for deductions only include ones that are “paid voluntarily without any consequence in the event of nonpayment” and are “determined by the payor,” which means it’s unclear if tips like gratuities that are automatically added on for large restaurant parties could be deducted. It’s also still unclear how tipped income will be reported so it can be eligible for the deduction, CNBC notes. While the deduction will apply for workers’ federal returns, they will also still likely have to pay state taxes on their tips in states with income tax.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump first introduced his “No Tax on Tips” policy on the campaign trail ahead of his election, making the policy one of his key economic proposals along with other policies like sweeping tariffs and eliminating taxes on Social Security payments. The policy proved to be one of Trump’s less controversial proposals, with former Vice President Kamala Harris also endorsing the policy ahead of the election. The Senate then passed a “No Tax on Tips” measure in a unanimous vote in May, which was ultimately integrated into the larger spending bill.\n\nFurther Reading:\nForbesNo Taxes On Tips, Overtime, And Social Security?

Leader Jeffries is right that he should try legislating instead of litigating, retaliating, and dominating.

Today, I will attempt to regulate my own apoplexy.\nRecently, Wired published an article revealing the existence of a secret Democrat influencer incubator that trained liberal and progressive content creators to push coordinated messaging across their shared social media platforms and paid them handsomely to do so. The fallout has been chaotic, at least in the left-wing influencer world: creators are shanking their rivals for participating in the program, and the paid influencers are trying to defend themselves for taking the money. But the controversy around the Chorus Creator Incubator Program stems from the fact that it was so secret: participants had to sign contracts that gave Chorus control of their interview bookings, limit what they said about other creators or non-approved political figures, and were forbidden from even acknowledging they were part of the program. \nIn response, Chorus — a group funded by the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a liberal 501(c)(4) that’s often drawn comparisons to the libertarian Koch Network and often outspends them — has stated that it was trying to organize left-wing influencers to match their counterparts in MAGA world. In a statement to The Verge, Chorus founder Brian Tyler Cohen defended the program and said that the program had received hundreds of new applicants since the Wired story. “I’m incredibly proud that Chorus has received financial support from over 1,000 individuals who recognize that there’s a desperate need for more pro-democracy voices in the online space. They want to fund a bunch of diverse creators to do this full-time who wouldn’t be able to pay their bills otherwise and we’re incredibly grateful.” (After the Regulator newsletter was sent to subscribers on Tuesday, The Sixteen Thirty Fund sent a second statement from president Amy Kurtz, disputing Wired’s claims about the restrictions Chorus placed on creators over guests, content, and disclosing their participation in the program.)\nI technically understand what the Democratic establishment were trying to accomplish with Chorus. (The Sixteen Thirty Fund is not formally affiliated with the official Democratic Party.) I actually have significant experience with what they’re trying to counteract on the right. I also think they suck at it, and for the most characteristically Democratic Party reasons. \nMy longtime readers will know this about me, but if you’ve discovered me through The Verge, I should probably give you a little context. Last year, I published a memoir called The MAGA Diaries, which goes a bit into how I got ensnared in right-wing activism in my early 20s — specifically, how I got lured into the right-wing media career pipeline as a college student seeking a journalism internship in 2008, placed by my program mentor in a post-grad job at Tucker Carlson’s Daily Caller in 2011, and then was nearly sent to Wisconsin to work at a fake newspaper funded by dark money that wanted to undermine the teachers’ union protests, all under the guise of credentialing a “journalism fellow” to write hit pieces on them. (Instead, I quit the “journalism” network on the spot, yeeted myself out of Washington, and began a magazine-writing career in New York so I’d never have to deal with the conservative movement ever again. Unfortunately, the arc of history had other plans.)\nThe Chorus influencer program, in many ways, is a Dem-coded version of the right-wing journalism summer camp that I attended during my sophomore year of college. But let me back up a bit: I thought I had received a paid summer internship in journalism for “liberty-loving students,” funded through the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University, which promised to get me hired at a non-right-wing place like MSNBC. (Seriously, the program advertisement said that alumni got “placed” at MSNBC.) The generous internship stipend was contingent on me going to a weeklong journalism seminar and assisting in research about the Founding Fathers’ views on state-funded education. But looking back on it over a decade later, it was actually a training camp on how to be a proper libertarian thought leader. There were a lot of lectures about liberal media bias, breakout discussion groups on whether Obamacare was an overreach of federal powers, and tips on how to write a resume when applying for jobs. (And, of course, no one in my cohort got a job at MSNBC.)\nDozens of other right-wing journalism talent incubators exist inside the conservative movement, some of which have been around for decades, and are constantly learning how to leverage new technology for political gain. Over the years, other boot camps and programs have opened up for aspiring social media influencers, livestreamers, and the like. (I recently learned that the Leadership Institute, a group that’s been turning young college Republicans into powerful elected officials since the 1970s, just launched a conservative podcasting school.) But ask any right-wing influencer if they’ve ever gone to some training camp — hell, ask them in public — and not only will they quickly say yes, they’ll also tell you what program they enrolled in, who they took classes with, and what they thought of their coursework. They might even be proud of getting into some elite program or getting accepted into a certain seminar. \nBut one can’t simply copy the right-wing formula and paste it on the left. The famous Andrew Breitbart saying — “politics is downstream from culture” — isn’t just an observation, but an organizational principle on the right. If you can use culture to change people’s values, then you can then get them to vote a certain way. There’s a lot to be said about the right’s attempts to drive culture forward (or backward), but they were far better at manipulating and taking over where it existed on the internet — or, in most cases, ceding control and riding the wave of the internet entirely, so long as they ended up in power. On the internet, it helps to be shameless. Either way, MAGA influencers have the ability to define what is and is not culture, because their followers want to follow a culture warrior, dammit. (Why do you think they try to make everything about what is and is not “woke”?)\nIn contrast, I’m hardly surprised that Chorus and the Sixteen Thirty Fund went to these lengths to restrict what these creators could say: the octogenarians of the Democratic establishment, and the rising young leaders who remind said octogenarians of themselves, seem sclerotically incapable of existing in a media environment they cannot control. The culture is no longer run by blue donors in Hollywood and New York. After all, its last president, Joe Biden, had an extremely hostile relationship with reporters and celebrities asking too many questions about his age. And its last presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, was so allergic to appearing on popular podcasts that she would only do so if the hosts flew to her and conducted the interview on a set completely controlled by the campaign. She reportedly refused to appear on The Joe Rogan Experience if they had to go to the host’s Texas studio, and reportedly shelled out six figures to build a DC-based Call Her Daddy set for her interview with Alex Cooper, who records her podcast in California.\nThough they’ve tried to avoid being described as a liberal copycat, the Sixteen Thirty Fund has been compared to the Koch Network, the secretive group of right-wing billionaires that created (among other things) the right-wing media training camps that the fund is trying to counter. (“We reject any notion that the right-wing has been more transparent in this area. STF takes great pride in supporting critically important causes,“ Kurtz said in her statement to The Verge.) As a Koch alumni (via technicality), I think they’re pretty dang similar, even if they’re somewhat faster to ‘fess up their involvement. Between 2009 and 2016, the Koch Network was unparalleled in funding the rise of the Tea Party — the candidate selection, the digital media apparatus, the voter turnout machine, etc. — to the point that the American political right briefly existed as this cadre of wealthy libertarian billionaires envisioned it: limited government, open borders, free trade, not too racist. \nThen Donald Trump found Twitter, got elected president twice, the MAGA influencers overrode the think tank people and media training camp grads, and even though the Koch Network still technically exists, free-market libertarianism died in America. Republican voters may not have liked Trump back then, but they preferred his brand over a bunch of old billionaires trying to define what “Republican” meant, and now those billionaires are getting absolutely reamed by Trump’s tariffs.\nSo, yeah, I think it’s a very apt comparison.\nMia Sato covers influencers and the power of their parasocial relationships for The Verge, which is the massive other half of this story, and we go more into that below the fold. But before that, here’s some of The Verge’s latest stories about Regulator world...\nThis Week at The Verge:\n“Temu, Shein, and Amazon Haul are about to get wrecked”: Months ago, Mia Sato pulled together this video explaining the de minimis tariff exemption on international packages and what would happen when Trump killed it in his trade war, because The Verge is staffed with doomscrollers who think too far into the future (myself included). That exemption formally expired last weekend, so…yeah, please enjoy this educational video.\n“The Trump administration promised a fourth wireless carrier — America got a hot mess instead”: Once upon a time, TV provider Dish Network tried to enter the wireless market. Last week, it gave up and sold $23 billion worth of valuable spectrum to AT&T. Karl Bode delves into the complicated political backstory behind it all, and, unsurprisingly, it involves a lot of shady behavior in both Trump administrations.\n“FDA approves new covid vaccine, but with new limits”: Emma Roth goes into the RFK Jr. of it all. Enough said. \nBut what about the fans?\nI can rant about Democrats until the cows come home, but, ultimately, the point of Chorus was to mobilize these influencers’ followers — and that is a very, very new form of what a poli sci major might call “community outreach.” After angrily sending Slack messages to each other about it for a full Friday afternoon, we realized that we should probably enjoy our Labor Day weekend and then have a more fulsome, less rage-driven conversation about whether internet communities care about political sponcon.\nMia: There are a bunch of different industries that are colliding here: the influencer industry, the media (journalism, specifically), and politics. And each of those industries has its own set of norms and practices and expectations. Many of the influencers at the center of this saga have built platforms by blurring these lines — are they “reporters” regurgitating news and offering analysis? Are they “content creators” who happen to talk about politics and policy? Or are they messengers for a political party, an extension of Democratic Party messaging and voter activation?\nWhat’s unique about this — and what is stoking some of the discontent and disagreement — is that a lot of people don’t see the issue with these creators taking money from politically aligned groups. They see it like partnering with a liberal brand to advance liberal causes. “The right does this, so we should, too,” is the thinking. I’m sympathetic to this argument, honestly. But the actions of the creators and of the group that has been brokering these dark money payments makes no sense if there really is nothing to hide. If this is something that Dems need to do to keep up with the current state of politics, why not say publicly what you’re doing to fight Trumpism? It almost feels like people are less upset about these undisclosed partnerships than they are about, like, undisclosed makeup or tech sponcon or something.\n“People” being the progressive influencer community or their followers? Though the funny thing is, the moment I asked that, I immediately thought about the double standard in the MAGA influencer community and their following. It’s pretty much a given that MAGA influencers are the product of donor grants, training camps, academic programs, etc., and not only do their followers accept that, they find it absolutely necessary for the promotion of their cause — mainly because they think all the general cultural institutions that shape politics like “the mainstream media” are captured by the libs. So any sort of organizational advantage that the right can throw together, no matter how it’s funded, gives them an advantage in the culture wars. \nPeople being the followers. And, yeah, I think there’s actually a demand from liberals that the Democrats figure out their own version of this. Which is why it’s sort of bizarre to me that this program was hush-hush, that they didn’t want creators to talk about specifics of it. A lot of followers don’t care and are actually happy that their fave liberal influencers are getting paid.\nSo it looks to me like Chorus and Sixteen Thirty took a bit too much inspiration from the early / mid-2010s Koch Network, which was notoriously secretive and really, really did not like people tracking exactly where its money went — media, ground game, etc. The New Yorker’s Jane Meyer once reported that they would run white-noise machines during their closed-door meetings to prevent people from listening. There’s an entire freaking chapter in my memoir where I learned that a bunch of the post-grad “journalism” jobs I applied for were connected in some bizarre, secret way to Koch-funded entities. \nThe Koch Network was effective, but only what it was designed for, which was to pump money into the Tea Party to make it appear as if it were actually a grassroots, libertarian organization. And, more importantly, that didn’t last very long at all. The Koch Network was completely incapable of stopping Trump in 2016, and every time it tried to “stand up against Trumpism” or reinsert small government back into the GOP’s core party values or whatever, it just… didn’t. \nI truly think that it had to do with the fact that Americans overall were pissed off at the idea of a bunch of rich people trying to hide behind a bunch of ostensibly grassroots organizations, whereas other groups like Turning Point USA would come in with their influencer affiliate program, be pretty open about who they were funded by and what they did, and everyone was like, “Okay, sure, we’re chill with it.” \nTo me, it seems more like the Sixteen Thirty Fund is still in Part One of the Koch arc — that they have to pretend that their movement is actually grassroots and not something that’s turbocharged with donor money.\nWhat’s interesting is that a lot of the creators do seem to have started from a grassroots place. It makes sense that the Dem establishment would want to tap into that, but the execution has been so painfully messy.\nHow much do you think the brand matters here? Like, is it a situation where the audience will accept someone who’s, like, “progressive” or “left-leaning,” but then react negatively to anyone that’s associated with the official Democratic Party establishment — i.e., anything Biden / Harris-coded? “Gave money to Israel”-coded? \nI think there is some of that but the biggest frustration (where there is any) seems to be about the lack of transparency. I feel like if there was a DSA adjacent group doing this, people would also be mad.\nSo I’ve covered my share of MAGA influencer civil wars, for (oh, god) 10 years, and on the surface they’re kind of similar: so-and-so is taking money from this guy secretly! But clearly, MAGA hasn’t suffered from it. This is the first time that the Democrats have had actual community internet drama. Tell me if I’m being totally cynical, or are the Dems actually handling this meltdown worse than, like, any corporation caught in a sponcon scandal?\nI do think the damage control is a little clumsy — I think it looks bad to have none of the content creators respond to Wired prepublication, and then for them to all make videos the next day saying, “Nothing to see here!” Why not say that to Wired from the jump? And if the defense is that Chorus doesn’t let influencers talk to the media… Well, that’s weird, too!\nI don’t know how long this will live on, though. People only have so much bandwidth to be mad about this, and if there’s one thing that’s certain about influencer culture it’s that there will always be some new thing that is dividing people. One thing I keep thinking about is how not upset audiences seem to be about the payment element, so much so that I saw a lot of viewers actually say they were glad somebody was paying creators for their work. People are primed to view ads like organic content and this idea of “selling out” is not really a thing like it was 20 years ago. Payment is almost implied — but it still looks bad when you’ve been getting money without disclosure.\nAnd now, Recess:\nOr if you’re following what happens in Congress (watch this space), farewell to August recess.

Santiago / Getty Last week, the Trump administration announced that Ashli Babbitt, the Jan. 6 rioter who was shot and killed while attacking the U.S. Capitol, will receive military funeral honors from the U.S. Air Force, which anyone with half a brain could tell was a transparent attempt by President Donald Trump to reframe Jan. 6, and, by extension, the damage done by his thoroughly debunked 2020 election fraud propaganda. Well, on Monday, Trump announced that his administration will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, to none other than Rudy Giuliani, the ex-NYC mayor who has been drowning in debt and legal woes ever since he signed on to help Trump spread his election fraud nonsense, both in the media and in the courtroom. “I am pleased to announce that Rudy Giuliani, the greatest Mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot, will receive THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. (You know who else Trump called patriots? The more than 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters he pardoned.) The White House’s official X account shared a screenshot of the president’s post. Trump’s announcement came days after Giuliani was injured in a car crash in New Hampshire, which left his vertebra fractured, according to his security chief, Michael Ragusa. The crash has the MAGA-net flooding social media with thoughts and prayers for Giuliani as his supporters wish him a speedy recovery. It’s almost as if Trump saw an opportunity there and decided this would be the perfect moment for his former attorney to be offered an honor that would make him look more like a “patriot” than an accomplice who helped a wannabe dictator in his efforts to steal an election by undermining democracy. Honestly, though, if Giuliani had any integrity at all, he wouldn’t even accept the honor. After all, what did he get out of joining Trump in his nonsensical bid to overturn the 2020 election results? On Trump’s behalf, Giuliani accused Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Arshaye “Shaye” Moss of stuffing ballots for then-President-elect Joe Biden with no real evidence to substantiate the claim. This resulted in the ex-mayor drowning in litigation. He ended up owing millions to Freeman and Moss, and was ordered by the court to forfeit assets to the two Black women he repeatedly defamed. He basically ended up begging Trump to help him pay his bills. His own lawyers filed lawsuits against him, claiming he hadn’t paid them what he owed. Then, a whole different set of attorneys asked a judge to remove them as Giuliani’s counsel, fearing that they would suffer the same losses and frustrations as his first set of lawyers. He filed for bankruptcy, but was forced to end his bankruptcy case. He got disbarred after his license to practice law in New York was suspended. He caught a RICO case. All of this happened to Giuliani due to his participation in Trump’s big beautiful farce. Trump became president again, but WTF has Giuliani gotten out of his blind support for the president besides a seemingly endless journey of Ls? Of course, Giuliani has said repeatedly that he has no regrets for the damage he has done to himself and those he has made reckless allegations against, so once he’s healed up enough to accept the president’s honor, he’ll gladly do so gleefully like the rotten-tooth lapdog that he is.

Love him or loathe him, he has a peculiar habit of reflecting back at people everything they long to see in a hero or villain.\n\nLike many fine actors, Trump often comes across as an empty vessel just waiting to be filled with another person’s dialogue and direction.\n\nTrump is often blasted as being all charisma and no substance. Both traits are integral to any actor who wants to go the distance.\n\nWoody Allen may not know a lot about politics, but he knows a lot about actors. He was once one himself, and in 1998, he once directed Trump in the film “Celebrity.” \n\nThe Guardian reports that as far as Allen was concerned, Trump was not only “a pleasure to work with,” but “a very good actor.” \n\n“Celebrity” was an ensemble film by Woody Allen, and alongside Trump, it also featured fellow ladies’ man Leonard DiCaprio. \n\nTrump makes the briefest of cameos, but his hulking presence fills every inch of the screen and leaves the viewer breathless and panting for more. \n\nIn a scripted segment, Trump is interviewed by a TV reporter about his forthcoming projects. \n\nWith his trademark humour and habitual knack of spinning outlandish stories, Trump replies that he’s “working on buying St Patrick’s Cathedral. Maybe doing a little rip-down job and putting up a very, very tall and beautiful building.”\n\nAll these years later and it doesn’t seem so much like acting but Trump being Trump. \n\nSpeaking on Bill Maher’s Club Random, Allen said that Trump’s “charismatic quality” made him a natural in front of the lens, and he was “pleasant, very professional, very polite.”\n\nWoody also admitted he was surprised that Trump wanted to go into politics. \n\nHe explained, “Politics is nothing but headaches and critical decisions, and agony. This was a guy I used to see at the Knicks games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge beauty contests, and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing. Why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is beyond me.”\n\nAlthough one of the President’s fiercest critics, Bill Maher agreed that Trump had a habit of turning on the charm in person when he’s not busy acting the politician. \n\nMaher told Allen, “Yeah, he’s different in person, and when you say that, people who are purely emotional get very upset, even though it’s just the truth. We’re just saying the truth.” \n\nWoody, who was keen to point out that he voted for Kamal Harris in the 2024 presidential election, explained, “Well, you know, I’m a Democrat. I voted for Kamala Harris. And I take issue with him on, you know, 95% of the things, maybe 99%. But as an actor, he was very good. He was very convincing and very—you know, he had a charismatic quality as an actor.”\n\nHe added that although he disagreed with “many, almost all, not all, but almost all of Trump’s politics,” he would like to “direct him now as president and let me make the decisions. But that’s not gonna happen.”\n\nNever say never, Woody. In Trump world anything is possible.","summary":"He’s got a point.

He has charges pending against him civilly as well, and the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States of America.”\n\nTheWrap was directed to the DHS statement from Sunday upon request for comment.\n\nThe accusation came more than a month after CBS News’ parent company, Paramount Global, secured approval from the Federal Communications Commission to merge with David Ellison’s Skydance Media. \n\nThe merger had been mired in regulatory limbo as the FCC, under chairman and Trump ally Brendan Carr’s control, investigated claims that a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris amounted to news distortion.

Just so you know, there will be news,” he added.\n\nWalz’s statement comes amid ongoing media speculation about President Trump’s health, a topic that has become increasingly prominent, unlike during President Joe Biden’s term when similar concerns were downplayed. Despite multiple public incidents suggesting potential cognitive decline, Biden finished his presidency without such extensive scrutiny from the media.\n\nThat aside, members of the establishment media pointed to Trump’s lack of public appearances after his Cabinet meeting last week.\n\nIn response, Trump shared a Truth Social post from DC Draino, which criticized the media’s inconsistent portrayal of presidential health. It stated, “Joe Biden would go multiple days at a time without any public appearances and the media would say he’s ‘sharp’ and ‘top of his game.’”\n\n“Meanwhile, he was wearing diapers and napping. President Trump puts in more public work hours than any other POTUS in US history and media freaks out if he disappears for 24 hours,” the post continued, highlighting a perceived media double standard.\n\n“NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE,” Trump said, responding to that post and adding, “Also, DC IS A CRIME FREE ZONE!

In fact, colonial racism is the common thread binding the violent, eliminationist politics of Donald Trump in the US and Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. In this installment of our ongoing series “Not in Our Name” on The Marc Steiner Show, Marc speaks with Professor Chomsky about how Israel’s US-backed genocide in Gaza is the grim culmination of the settler-colonial project of Zionism, and how the repression of political dissent under the guise of “combatting antisemitism” is an extension of that violent project.\n\nAviva Chomsky is a professor of history and the coordinator of Latin American studies at Salem State University in Massachusetts. She is the author of many acclaimed books, including Central America’s Forgotten History: Revolution, Violence, and the Roots of Migration; and Undocumented: How Immigration Became Illegal.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nAviva Chomsky, The Nation, “Colonialism is alive and kicking in the US’s obsession with Israel”\nAviva Chomsky, The Nation, “This group’s definition of antisemitism is providing cover for genocide”\n\nProducer: Rosette Sewali\nStudio Production: Cameron Granadino\nAudio Post-Production: Stephen Frank\n\nThe following is a rushed transcript and may contain errors. A proofread version will be made available as soon as possible.\nMarc Steiner:\nWelcome to the Mac Steiner Show here on The Real News. I'm Marc Steiner. It's great to have you all with us once again. My guest today is Dr. Aviva Chomsky. She's an American historian, author and activist. She's a professor of history and the coordinator of Latin American, Latino and Caribbean studies at Salem State University in Massachusetts. And recently she's been speaking out and doing a lot of writing about the slaughter of the tens of thousands of Gazen and the obliteration of Gaza, the hands of Israel, and she joins us today for a deep dive into that reality. So welcome, Aviva. Good to have you with us again.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nThank you. It's great to be here. Thanks for inviting me.\nMarc Steiner:\nI was really interested in the piece that you wrote. I think many people, especially in the Jewish world who are questioning what's going on in Gaza, are wrestling with this question of where's the line of antisemitism and criticism of Israel and what's happening in Gaza? And is Gaza a genocide, is a slaughter. I think people are really trying to wrap their hands around this, and I think you kind of took a deep dive in your article about this. So let's just start there with this battle over what is antisemitism and what isn't antisemitism when it comes to criticizing what Israel is doing in Gaza?\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nSo a couple of things that to me personally, and I am Jewish, just to establish that from the beginning, and I have also been involved in Palestine rights activism for many decades.\nMarc Steiner:\n\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nFor me, it hasn't been a complicated question at all. And I think there are different kinds and different layers of criticism of Israel. I think that for many in the Jewish community, it's possible to criticize what Israel is doing in Gaza to criticize Netanyahu's government, but within a framework of larger commitment to the idea of a Jewish state. And then there are those, and I count myself among those who are not committed to the idea of a Jewish state, in fact, who are quite dubious about the idea of a Jewish state. And I have always felt, in theory, I have nothing against Jewish people joining together to form any kind of Jewish organization. And there are many Jewish organizations in this country that are places where Jewish people gather in community of Jewish people. And I have been to synagogues, I had a bat mitzvah and I enjoyed, it's not part of my life currently, but it certainly has been part of my life, this feeling of being part of a Jewish community.\nSo in theory, perhaps a Jewish state that is a state of buy and for Jews, if it had no population that wasn't Jewish, could in theory be an okay idea. In the case of Israel itself, like the actual historical example of Israel, this is fundamental contradiction that it's not just founding a Jewish state, it's founding a Jewish state in Palestine. And that from the very start, the Zionist project, or at least those elements of the Zionist project that became the predominant elements and became what is Zionism today of founding a Jewish state in Palestine. There's no way that could happen without grave injustice. So the existing population in Palestine and that those grave injustices continue to shape things. So I think that there are many in the Jewish community who don't want to criticize Israel at all. There are many who are quite willing to criticize Israel in terms of its current government and its actions in Gaza, but who are still committed to the idea of a Jewish state in Palestine. And then there are those who are really anti-Zionist and who feel that the entire project of a Jewish state in Palestine has to be fundamentally\nMarc Steiner:\nRevised. One of the things that I wrote about a long time ago in the early seventies was about the formation of Israel itself. And part of that, I posited that if there had not been a Holocaust, if wouldn't be in Israel, a, and people forget historically that the reason that so many Jews fled Europe after World War II and out of the DP camps into Israel is because we wouldn't let them here. America would not open the doors. The only place they go is Palestine. They wanted Jews to go to Palestine so they could colonize Palestine and be used that way as pawns in the game. And I think that's part of the story that gets lost and people don't remember or don't even know.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nI would also just mention as a Latin Americanist, that many Jews in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and even after World War II, went to Latin America, which had more open doors than the\nMarc Steiner:\nUnited States did. I have cousins in Uruguay? I have cousins in Mexico City. They went from Poland to Latin America.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nSo I think when right wing Jewish organizations or right wing pro-Israel organizations, maybe I should say right wing Zionist organizations, many of which also identify themselves as Jewish organizations. And I'm thinking here about apac, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the A DL, the Anti-Defamation League, they kind of try to square the circle between saying any criticism of Israel is illegitimate and antisemitic or kind of overlaying that with, well, criticism of Israel is okay, but not criticism of the Zionist project of Israel, not criticism of Jewish ethnonationalism. That is not acceptable, that is antisemitic. So it's okay to criticize Netanyahu, but I just wanted to pick up on something you said before we even started, which is that antisemitism has deep roots. And on one hand that is completely true, although it's really true of every kind of racism and other sexism and all of those things have deep roots, but that understanding of deep roots is often really flattened and trivialized in the case of antisemitism by pro-Israel organizations to sort of essentialize antisemitism to say that antisemitism is a historical, permanent phenomenon that has always existed and will always exist.\nAnd I think that that understanding of antisemitism is really crucial to the Zionist project and this idea that Jews need a nation state because antisemitism is so a historical, and I want to both acknowledge that antisemitism has certain types of deep roots and insists that antisemitism is a historical phenomenon, just like every other kind of racism, sexism, et cetera, are historical phenomena. So that when we look at the history of the formation of European nation states, the rise of the nation state in Europe and European nationalism, when we look at particularly Christian antisemitism, these are historical phenomena just as anti-black racism is a historical phenomenon that we can trace the way it has evolved in 500 years of European colonialism. We can also trace, if we are historians, we need to look at historical contingency, historical events and understand why antisemitism is not always the same and exist in every time and place, just like anti-black racism. It may be pervasive, especially in certain historical periods and certain times and places, but it is not an essential character of the human race. Neither of those is an essential characteristic of the human race\nMarc Steiner:\nWhen it comes to separating antisemitism from being against what Israel's doing. In many ways, that's a hard thing to untie, not just for Jews, I mean as a whole part of the Christian world that also supports Israel for their own reasons. But you have to kind of parse that out and change it. The question is you're beginning to make the argument, I think the argument is important to make about how to separate antisemitism from opposing what Israel's doing inside Gaza and within the West Bank and within Israel itself,\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nWhich moves into anti-Zionism.\nMarc Steiner:\n\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nWhich I also think, which I also partake of anti-Zionism, that is I would very firmly reject the idea that anti-Zionism is antisemitic. But you mentioned among non-Jews, and I think it's really important to distinguish between the Christian, which I don't think cares one wit about antisemitism and which in fact I think is probably the main source of antisemitism in the United States today, is the Christian right and the liberal Christ. So their support for Israel has nothing to do with caring about Jews or caring about antisemitism. It's purely a evangelical religious and strategic political confluence of ideas about the importance of Israel. And I would say in some ways even motivated by the same kind of antisemitism that led to the founding of Israel to begin with. We don't want the Jews here, let's get rid of them, send them to Israel, that's where they belong.\nAnd then more liberal Christian fears about antisemitism that come more out of the experiences of the 20th century of the United States of understanding Jews as being victims of discrimination in the 20th century in the United States, especially in earlier parts of the 20th century. And that identify with progressive Jewish strands of the second half of the 20th century, Jewish involvement in civil rights movements, anti-war movements, intellectual movements. So that I would say that in liberal Christian communities, there is a sense that Jews have been discriminated against, Jews have been oppressed not only in Europe, but also in the United States, and that Jews represent a progressive cosmopolitan force in the United States. And I think that especially in liberal Christian communities, this right wing pro-Israel argument, that criticism of Israel is tantamount to antisemitism, holds a lot of weight, recognizing it as a right wing political ploy and thinking of it in terms of, oh yeah, we support people who are discriminated against because we're liberal. And so we support Jews in this kind of vague lack of understanding of what's really going on with this argument.\nMarc Steiner:\nSo as we wrestle with this question here in the United States politically, what you just described, where do you think those contradictions take us? I mean, at this moment we have this right wing neofascist government in Israel, and we have this right wing neofascist government in the United States, and that's a dangerous confluence, I think. And I'm wondering where you think that takes the struggle for change given those two forces and where it takes it without falling into antisemitism. They're saying Jews control America. Jews control the money is the Jews that are doing this, which is also a mindset that exists. So I'm saying I think we are weaving our way through and living in a minefield at the moment.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nSo I would begin by pointing out that I was talking about the sort of liberal Christian support for Israel and hand in hand with that association of criticism of Israel or lack of support of Israel with antisemitism that look at Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, I am a Zionist. We will say we're going to be with Israel no matter what. He's kind of a liberal Democrat, right? Kamala Harris who, oh, my heart breaks for the children of Gaza, but I'm not going to mention who's killing them because that would be antisemitic. So I have to show my pros Semitic credentials here by refusing to criticize Israel or even acknowledge what Israel is doing. So when Trump, both in the first Trump administration and in the second Trump administration, one small ray of hope, I saw during those times\nThat a lot of the liberal center, which was loathed to criticize President Obama or President Biden and would've been loathed to criticize a President Harris, had she been elected, who were all, let's gather around our candidate here because he is so liberal. We're more open to speaking honestly about what the Trump administration is doing than they were about speaking honestly about what the Biden administration or even Obama administration is doing. And even if you just look at the responses to immigration, nobody wanted to criticize Biden on immigration. Nobody wanted to criticize. But then there's under Trump administration, nobody wants to talk about what the government is doing wrong when it's a Democrat, but this liberal center is much more willing to talk about what the government is doing wrong. And the opposition to Trump's immigration policies is one example where it was really hard to mobilize people against biden's terrible immigration policies, but it's not as hard to mobilize people against Trump's. So that particular historical conjuncture, I think gives us array of hope that the liberal center could come to its senses and open its eyes about what Israel is and what Israel is doing. But on the other hand, I'm not really seeing it happening. And if you take the New York Times as a exemplar of that liberal center,\nIt has barely moved a fraction of an inch on its support for Israel. And one of the things that always makes me laugh is when you read these sort of mandatory background things that they say in every article about Gaza, about Hamas' brutal attack on October 7th that killed 1200 people. And then in the same paragraph goes on to say, according to the Hamas controlled health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and armed factions, Israel has killed. And of course it goes up every day, 60,000 or whatever it's at now, Palestinians. Well, that figure of 1200 people killed that Hamas killed on October 7th. Also doesn't distinguish between and military, but you don't say that. You only say it and you always say it when referring to Palestinian figures. And you also don't attribute that number to anybody. You just say that's a fact that they killed 12. So just like this differential way of like, Israel is trustworthy, Israel is our ally, Hamas is evil. That just underlies every piece of reporting of the New York Times\nMarc Steiner:\nIn the time we have left together. Today. I'd like to explore something here is a question that I've been writing about and wrestling with that has to do with Israel is how the oppressed become the oppressor.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nWell, certainly not the first time this has happened in history,\nMarc Steiner:\nRight? Oh no, absolutely not. No, absolutely not. No. And we look at our own history, United States and other places. Absolutely. But I'd like to talk a bit about that with you, just how that process happens. I mean, it's Jews fleeing to Israel because they weren't allowed here. Jews fleeing to Israel because of their own oppression, and I grew up with people with numbers in their arms. The kibbutz scene that were attacked is where part of my family lived and were killed. But the process of colonizing and taking over Palestine has turned people who fought for liberation into oppressors. And I'm curious your analysis of that and how that happens.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nWell, so a couple of things. So first of all, when we tried to define a people as a people as if they all think the same,\nMarc Steiner:\nWhich we do not obviously,\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nAnd that's always in mistake, right?\nMarc Steiner:\nYes. Right, right.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nAnd that's part of what nationalism tries to do. Benedict Anderson's idea of the imagined community that you share certain ideas with people you don't know because you belong to the same community. That's part of the basis of nationalism. And nationalism is also a historical phenomenon,\n\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nAnderson's classic book and many others show so clearly that this idea of belonging being part of a nation that includes people, not just the people in your village that you're part of, who you may fight with and dispute with and disagree with a lot, but you're also part of this larger political community that somehow holds your loyalty. And looking at how nationalism worked in Europe and then say in Africa and in Latin America, one thing that nationalism does is it provides a rationale for mobilizing people to go out and kill other people who don't belong to the same nation. And I'm thinking here about all quiet on the Western front. One of my favorite scenes from the book is when the German soldiers are in the trenches and discussing, why are we even here? Oh, because those people, the French are our enemy. Why are they our enemy? Well, because our government said so,\nMarc Steiner:\n\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nThey're probably cobblers and tailors and farmers just like we have more in common with them than we do with the priests and the officials and the generals who sent us here. Why don't we join with them against the people who are really oppressing us? But that's part of what nationalism does. It creates this imagined community and this imperative for loyalty to people who don't have your best interests at heart and you don't really share anything with who are just using you. And we see that happening right now in the United States and always in the United States. In every war that the United States has been involved in, there have been really good reasons why people should not have gone to fight in those wars. And yet it's always a small minority who is able to stop and say, wait a minute, I'm not going to fight in that war. I have no desire to go out and kill those people. And the vast majority go out and do it. And if you read about what's going on in Israeli society right now, it's really practically a psychotic mass delusion. If you look at the polls and the things that people are saying, like huge majorities of people, 80% will say, oh, there's no starvation in Gaza. We know that because our government told us.\n\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nYes. The entire world is against us. The United Nations amnesty International Doctors without borders, they're all just antisemitic. That's why they're criticizing us. But so your question was specifically is how do the oppressed become oppressors? And I guess I would say that first of all, even in situations of great oppression, there's always collaborators with the oppressors\nMarc Steiner:\n\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nThere's very few things historically that I would say are always the case,\nMarc Steiner:\nThe caps in the camps\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nThat oppressors can find collaborators among the oppressed. Absolutely. And when we study the history of slavery in the United States, we must both recognize that it was a European project, that it was a white racial project, African enslavement of Africans, and that Africans in Africa and African-Americans collaborated in the project. There were African free black people in the United States who owned slaves. So that being oppressed doesn't suddenly make you a moral person who opposes all oppression, and you don't necessarily identify as a cohesive Who do you identify as Your people is not necessarily based on race or religion or nation, but that nationalism encourages you. And capitalism encourages you to put yourself first, and everybody has to survive in the world that they're born into. And we all collaborate in things that we think are immoral. Like I fly in planes and drive a car. Those things are completely immoral and unjustifiable, and yet I somehow continue to do them. So we all live with these contradictions, I think, of being oppressed and oppressors at the same time. But there's also, of course, degrees and of collaboration, and I think it's within every individual, how much am I willing to collaborate and where am I going to draw the line?\nMarc Steiner:\nAnd I just so much, you said again, we can say another hour, but at least, but the question of what fuels Israel and other places like that, the nationalism, nationalism can be born out of oppression and it can be born out of the oppressor. It's both can fuel a nationalist feeling. There wouldn't be the power in the black community in America of the nation of Islam and other nationalist forces because people are tired of racism and want out and fuels nationalism. The same thing with Jews. It fuels nationalism. Let me have my own country. I'm done with this. I'm out of here. It's a complexity that has to be used to change that, to turn that around.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nOkay. But is there any national liberation movement that you can point to that has not gone on to oppress people?\nMarc Steiner:\nThat's a good question. That's a really good question. I have to think about that. I mean,\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nSome of my favorite contemporary English language literature out of Africa deals with precisely that issue that African liberation movements encompass many different tendencies. Yet over the course of the second half of the 20th century came to identify and act in the world in ways that oppressed ethnic minorities in their own countries. It's just not okay to oppress anybody. It doesn't matter whether they're our people or somebody else's people and how we define what our people are. But I'll recommend one of my favorite recent books, New York, my Village.\n\nI'll look for\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nIt, which is in part about the Biafra War in Nigeria and how the IBO government in Biafra oppressed non Ebo people in Biafra as part of their liberation movement. But I mean, there's very few things that I would say are historical universals, but our capacity to oppress people and to rationalize, I think are pretty deeply embedded in human beings.\nMarc Steiner:\nSo I don't,\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nSo we need institutions that don't allow people\nMarc Steiner:\nTo, that I was about to say, okay, yes,\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nAn institution of the nation state is not one of those institutions. The institution of the nation state is an institution, and the institution of capitalism are institutions that encourage people's worst instincts. We need institutions that allow space for people to develop their best instincts, not just their worst instincts.\nMarc Steiner:\nI'm glad you said that because I didn't want to end this on a note that we're lost. We're not lost because the struggle is against capitalism. The struggle is to build a different world, and people have to be the voices, lights and movements to do that in this country and across the globe, which you've written about so well. So I really enjoy always speaking with you, Avi, thanks so much for taking your time today with us, and we will have another conversation and we'll do some in-depth exploring about Latin America and more when we talk next.\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\nOkay, sounds great.\nMarc Steiner:\n\nDr. Aviva Chomsky:\n\nMarc Steiner:\nThank you for today, thanks to Cameron Grino for running the program today, audio editor Stephen Frank for working his magic Roset Ali for putting it with me and producing the Mark Steiner show and the tireless Keller Avara for making it all work behind the scenes and everyone here through news making this show possible.

Tim Walz (D), the former running mate of failed presidential candidate and former Vice President Kamala Harris, appeared to fantasize about President Donald Trump’s demise over the weekend.\n\nClips have surfaced of remarks Walz made over the weekend at a Labor Day picnic in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\n“You get up in the morning and doom scroll through things and — although I will say this — the last few days you woke up thinking there might be news,” he said to laughter from the crowd.\n\n“Just saying. Just saying. There will be news sometime. Just so you know, there will be news,” he added.\n\nWalz’s remarks follow repeated establishment media speculation over the state of President Donald Trump’s health over the last several days — a newfound obsession, as this was no concern from the establishment media throughout former President Joe Biden’s four years in office about his health, despite his numerous falls and apparent cognitive decline. As many remember, Biden’s cognitive decline was so undeniable in the end that Democrats ousted him as their elected candidate to run against Trump after a single debate.\n\nThat aside, members of the establishment media pointed to Trump’s lack of public appearances after his Cabinet meeting last week.\n\nBut Trump responded to a Truth Social post by DC Draino, which read, “Joe Biden would go multiple days at a time without any public appearances and the media would say he’s ‘sharp’ and “top of his game.”\n\n“Meanwhile he was wearing diapers and napping. President Trump puts in more public work hours than any other POTUS in US history and media freaks out if he disappears for 24 hours,” the posted continued. “Comical double standard.”\n\n“NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE,” Trump said, responding to that post and adding, “Also, DC IS A CRIME FREE ZONE! President DJT.”\n\nVice President JD Vance has described Trump as being in “incredibly good health” with amazing energy. And all that aside, Trump was spotted over the weekend headed to his golf course in Virginia, to the dismay of rabid leftists.\n\nThe speculation follows the White House confirming in July that Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described it as a “benign and common condition,” especially in individuals over the age of 70.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

NEA also contributed $6,950,000 to the For Our Future Action Fund, a liberal political action committee focused on electing Democrats in the key states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Florida. AFT contributed an additional $2,350,000 to the fund, for a total of $9,300,000 between the groups for Democratic candidates in those states.\n\nThe money, of course, came from the dues of teachers belonging to the unions.\n\nThe NEA gave $2,415,000 to Protect Our Schools KY, an organization that fights Republican education reforms in the Bluegrass State. NEA gave $620,000 to the Democracy Alliance, another left-wing pass-through that distributes money to progressive groups. \n\nThe NEA gave $500,000 to the Hopewell Fund, $500,000 to the Color of Change Education Fund (AFT gave another $100,000), $500,000 to Defend Our Constitution (AFT gave another $150,000), $500,000 to the Center for American Progress (AFT gave another $200,000), $500,000 to Future Forward USA Action (AFT gave another $250,000), and $645,000 to the State Power Action Fund.\n\nTo take one example, if you haven’t heard of the Hopewell Fund, it is a nonprofit group associated with Arabella Advisors, a notorious “dark money” network for Democratic causes. (The nation’s largest charity, the Gates Foundation, recently cut ties with Arabella Advisors.) The Hopewell Fund, according to the monitoring group Influence Watch, “primarily exists to sponsor a number of ‘fake’ groups: websites designed to look like standalone nonprofits … [that] typically exist to effect an issue advocacy campaign pushing left-wing policies and may disappear after the campaign is finished.”\n\nIf you did not recognize Future Forward, it was the biggest political action committee for the Joe Biden reelection campaign and, after Biden withdrew, the Kamala Harris presidential campaign.\n\nDefend Our Constitution, for its national-sounding name, is actually an Alaska group dedicated to stopping Republican initiatives in that state. According to Influence Watch, its top three contributors are the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which the New York Times called a “cryptically named entity that has served as a clearinghouse of undisclosed cash for the left”; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; and the National Education Association.\n\nSpeaking of the Sixteen Thirty fund, AFT gave the group $175,000, and NEA gave it $325,000.\n\nAFT gave $1,600,000 to the House Majority PAC, which seeks Democratic control of the House, and $1,250,000 to the Senate Majority PAC, which seeks Democratic control of the Senate. \n\nAFT gave $870,000 to a group called Red Wine and Blue, which is involved in many left-wing political causes. AFT gave $100,000, and NEA gave $85,000, to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, which is involved in promoting Sharpton. \n\nNEA gave $30,000 to GLSEN, which used to be known as the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network but now just goes by GLSEN. NEA gave $60,000 to the LGBT organization Human Rights Campaign, and $29,250 to something called Gender Inclusivity, which appears to refer to a company called Gender Inc., which says it seeks to “create a gender-sensitive and inclusive environment supportive of the transgender community.”\n\nThe Defending Education report includes many other lefty organizations to which the nation’s top two teachers unions have contributed. And the $43,524,125 listed in the report is not the entire amount the unions spent on political and ideological causes. But you get the idea. The report is not a surprise, and this kind of spending has been going on for years. Still, it is stunning to confront the hyperpoliticized priorities of unions that are supposedly devoted to education.","summary":"AMERICA&#8217;S HYPERPOLITICIZED TEACHERS UNIONS. About 70% of the nation&#8217;s public school teachers belong to a union or employees&#8217; association.

However, a message posted by the show’s social media accounts read simply: “Howard Stern will now speak Monday, September 8.”\n\nLeading up to his highly anticipated return, social media posts promised Stern would have a big announcement. But listeners will be forced to wait until next week to learn more.\n\nThe Independent has contacted SiriusXM and Stern’s representatives for comment.\n\nStern’s postponed comeback comes amid rumors that SiriusXM may be preparing to pull the plug on his long-running show.\n\nThe shock jock’s contract is up for renewal soon, and SiriusXM doesn’t expect he’ll take them up on a new offer, sources told The U.S. Sun.\n\n“Sirius and Stern are never going to meet on the money he is going to want. It’s no longer worth the investment,” the insider claimed, adding that SiriusXM was not able to keep up with Stern’s salary demands.\n\nThose rumors prompted the show to clap back with a slew of ads promising a big reveal upon Stern’s return.\n\n“The tabloids have spoken: Howard Stern fired, canceled, is it really ‘Bye-Bye Booey’? Chaos is swirling at The Howard Stern Show,” a narrator said in a promo for the show that ran on SiriusXM. “Did staffers talk to the press? Are writers withholding their best jokes? Nobody knows what’s going on or who to trust.”\n\n“Now we can reveal all the questions will be answered, all the truths will be told by the one man truly on the inside,” it continued. “Howard Stern will speak Tuesday September 2.”\n\nThe Howard Stern Show experienced a surge in popularity after it was nationally syndicated on terrestrial radio from 1986 to 2005. \n\nIn 2004, Stern became one of the highest-paid radio figures in the U.S. after signing a five-year deal with SiriusXM worth $500 million. He joined the radio giant in response to “censorship” efforts during his time at Viacom by the Federal Communications Commission, which does not regulate the content of satellite programs.\n\nStern became the most fined radio host between 1990 and 2004, after the FCC issued fines totaling $2.5 million to radio licensees for airing material it considered to be indecent from his show, the highest amount of any American radio show.\n\nKnown for his direct and controversial persona, Stern has interviewed countless A-list celebrities and even former Vice President Kamala Harris a month before voters headed to the polls in November 2024.\n\nHe has been openly critical of President Trump, saying he “hated Trump voters,” and branded them as stupid – an opinion that Trump retaliated to by saying that Stern “went woke” and lost listeners as a result.","summary":"Stern will now return to his radio show September 8","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/howard-stern-siriusxm-show-canceled-b2818579.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/02/15/35/GettyImages-2011340606.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/95mtYJ7B-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-02 15:44:00","author":"Caitlin Hornik","authors":["Caitlin Hornik"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":356744760,"title":"Paige Cognetti's Chances of Beating GOP Incumbent in Pennsylvania—Poll","text":"Paige Cognetti, the Democratic mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, is challenging Republican Representative Rob Bresnahan in what is expected to be among the most competitive House elections of the 2026 midterms.Chris Pack, a spokesperson for Bresnahan, told Newsweek that Cognetti's bid amounted to a \"vanity campaign\" and described her as a \"far-left extremist.\"Newsweek has contacted Cognetti's campaign for comment via email.Why It MattersRepublicans hold a 219-212 majority in the House of Representatives, which Democrats are hoping to change in November 2026. Securing a majority means Democrats must win more seats in districts carried by President Donald Trump in 2024.Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, where Bresnahan unseated longtime Democratic Representative Matthew Cartwright last year, is emblematic of the seats Democrats are hoping to win back in the midterms.What To KnowOn Tuesday, Cognetti made her congressional campaign official, launching with a video in which she criticized Bresnahan's record of stock trading and emphasized her record as mayor.\"When our mayor went to prison for corruption, the Democratic machine thought that they could put in another crony, so I took on the powerful and corrupt Democrats and ran for mayor as an independent,\" she said.An internal Democratic poll showed Cognetti with an early lead over Bresnahan, Politico reported.The Public Policy Polling survey of the district showed that 45 percent of respondents said they would vote for Cognetti, while 43 percent would cast their ballots for Bresnahan. Still, 13 percent remained usure of who they'd vote for. Winning over those undecided voters is key for each candidate in November 2026.Fifty percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trump's job performance, while 48 percent said they approved of his time in office so far, according to the poll, which surveyed 615 voters in the district from August 27 to August 28.While internal polls are typically viewed as not carrying the same weight as independent surveys, the results underscore the competitive nature of the race.Still, PA-08 has become increasingly conservative over the past decade, voting for Trump by more than eight points over then-Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Only one Democrat in the House—Representative Jared Golden of Maine—represents a more conservative district.Pennsylvania is set to be home to three of the most competitive races. In addition to PA-08, Democrats are eyeing two other districts as top targets.Those include Pennsylvania's 7th District, which covers Allentown. In November, Republican Representative Ryan Mackenzie won the seat, narrowly defeating then-incumbent Democratic Representative Susan Wild. Democrats are also hoping that Janelle Stelson can unseat Republican Representative Scott Perry in Pennsylvania's 10th District, a Harrisburg-based battleground.What People Are SayingChris Pack, a spokesperson for Republican Representative Rob Bresnahan, told Newsweek: \"Paige Cognetti launching a vanity campaign for Congress while still running for a new term as Scranton Mayor tells you everything you need to know about her priorities. Mayor Cognetti is a far-left extremist who has backed a radical agenda, from open borders and eliminating Medicaid to force everyone into government-run health care, to defunding the police, banning fracking, and even supporting taxpayer-funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants. We look forward to putting a spotlight on her extreme and dangerous positions, which are completely out of step with Northeastern Pennsylvania, where President Trump won by nearly 10 points.\"Democratic Representative Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania wrote on X: \"When Mayor Paige Cognetti sees corruption in Washington, she doesn't just complain about it—she stands tall and fights back. Whether it's politicians voting to make your life a ripoff or raking it in from corrupt stock trades, she's ready to take 'em on.\"Journalist Matthew Yglesias wrote on X: \"Dems have a problem this cycle of way too much grassroots money going to well-known House members in safe seats rather than frontliners or people like Cognetti who are taking on difficult races. Need to show potential recruits that donors will show up for races like this one.\"What Happens NextThe Cook Political Report classifies the race as \"leans Republican,\" meaning that while it is \"considered competitive,\" the GOP has an advantage. Sabato's Crystal Ball also lists the race as leaning toward Republicans.The general election in Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District is scheduled to take place on November 3, 2026.","summary":"Cognetti, the mayor of Scranton, announced her bid for Congress on Tuesday, challenging Republican Representative Rob Bresnahan.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/paige-cognetti-rob-bresnahan-pennsylvania-poll-2123211","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2714263/scranton-mayor-paige-cognetti.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=20545a91caea967dabe4303a335f531a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 15:34:00","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":356785662,"title":"Nolte: Woody Allen Praises Donald Trump, Blasts Cancel Culture","text":"Four-time Oscar-winner Woody Allen sat down with Bill Maher and had only nice things to say about President Trump.\n\nBack in 1998, Allen cast the future two-term president as himself in Celebrity, an underrated gem where Kenneth Branagh plays a celebrity journalist pulled into the heart of that world and all the lunacy that goes with it.\n\nCelebrity is buried in cameos and stars, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Melanie Griffith, and Charlize Theron, who make fun of their own personas. As you will see below, Trump was more than game to do the same:\n\n“Well, I’m working on buying St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Maybe doing a little rip-down job and putting up a very, very tall and beautiful building.”\n\nNear the end of Maher’s 90-minute Club Random interview, and after discussing the appalling blacklisting this genius has faced over a crime he did not commit, a crime that did not happen, a crime where two separate state investigations declared him innocent, Maher pointed out (accurately) that it was primarily the political left that annihilated Allen’s career.\n\nFor his part, and for a guy who doesn’t do many interviews, the 89-year-old handled himself brilliantly. He said he didn’t care about getting cancelled because he had already made about 50 movies and had more than enough money to live comfortably. About those who had worked with him and then stabbed him in the back, disavowing him, Allen was beyond gracious. He basically said, They think they are doing good and don’t know they are wrong.\n\nMaher was less gracious towards them, ripping them (accurately) as cowards and opportunists.\n\nAllen then explained that he was not opposed to the #MeToo movement, which he separates from cancel culture.\n\n“There’s a difference between the #MeToo movement and cancel culture,” he said. “The #MeToo movement, for whatever value it had in terms of advancing women’s rights, is a valuable thing. Cancel culture is a totally different phenomenon … a pernicious thing. It’s quite a bad thing.”\n\n“If you’re going to be canceled by a culture,” he added. “This is the culture to be canceled by. This is not a culture to be proud of.”\n\n“The #MeToo movement may have helped women in many ways,” he continued, “and that’s to the good. But the concept of canceling people is not a good thing in any area … in terms of politics, the McCarthy era… cancellation is just not a way to deal with issues. It doesn’t serve any purpose.”\n\nMaher then brought up Trump. “And all of this has not turned you into Trumper,” he said.\n\n“No, I’m not a Trumper,” Woody replied. “I am one of the few people who can say he directed Trump.”\n\nWoody went on to praise the most-hated man in his professional and social circle: “He was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor. He was very polite, hit his mark, did everything correctly, and had a real flair for show business. I could direct him now. If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders.”\n\n“He was very easy to work with,” Allen added, but then explained, “I’m a Democrat, I voted for Kamala Harris, and I take issue with [Trump] on 95 percent of his [policies], maybe 99 percent. But as an actor, he was very good. He was very convincing. He has a charismatic quality as an actor, and I’m surprised he wanted to go into politics.”\n\nThe whole interview is worth a watch. Maher interrupts too much, but for Woody Allen fans like myself, it is heartening to see that the 89-year-old is still sharp and seemingly at peace, despite all the obscene lies and persecution he’s faced over the last five years.\n\nAnd Maher is absolutely correct about Allen’s 2020 memoir. It’s brilliant and brilliantly funny.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t sound like Allen has any movies in the pipeline, but he says he’s written a play that’s being staged in Europe and has a novel coming out later this month.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

Tim Walz dancing off a mall escalator to Pussycat Dolls’ hit song Don’t Cha. His T-shirt had the text “F— Trump.” Sharing the video on X (formerly Twitter), Rep. Moore wrote, “If you were at the mall with your kids and this guy rolled down the escalator, you would call the cops and get him banned.”\n\nMany people found it awkward that Moore, who probably knew that the video was phony, still dared to share it on his X. In the comment section, some people quickly clarified that it was fake. Some commentators commented that the person who originally shared the video may have “swapped the face.”\n\nSome users think that Moore reposted the video with the intent of mocking Walz. Tim Walz has been a strong critic of the Donald Trump administration since a long time. During the 2024 Presidential election, he also joined as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris’ running mate. So, it’s obvious that the GOP congressman was trying to mock Moore.\n\nHowever, social media users brutally trolled the Republican over the video, as many thought that he failed to understand that it was deepfaked. One user wrote, “Days since a congressman fell for an AI video’ sign set back to zero.”\n\n“This is embarrassing, dude,” added another. Some went a step ahead and bluntly wrote comments like, “You are an idiot.” “How did a congressman get fooled by such a simple AI video?” a third wrote.\n\nIf you were at the mall with your kids and this guy rolled down the escalator, you would call the cops and get him banned. https://t.co/tPajxnLCnw\n— Riley Moore (@RileyMooreWV) August 31, 2025 \n\n“If you’re an elected official and you can’t tell AI MAGA boomer slop from reality, you should probably immediately resign,” Another user added. “Your West Virginia education is showing,” another user wrote.\n\n The comment section is filled with people calling him out for falling for a deepfake video. One user asked Grok, “Is there a political ethics violation for my congressman knowingly and intentionally sharing false information, or is he just a dumbass?”\n\nYou are an idiot\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 1, 2025 \n\n “Imagine being this gullible,” another wrote. “This is just spreading misinformation, knowing this is AI.” Some users even tried to defend Moore, but the numbers were quite low. “Minnesota, THIS is your governor. At least he makes Governor Newsom look reasonable,” one user wrote. “It’s possible since Walz is a buffoon,” wrote another MAGA loyalist.\n\n “West Virginia Rep. Riley Moore earns about 3.5 times more than the average school teacher in West Virginia,” one user mockingly wrote.","summary":"Riley Moore tried his best to mock Tim Walz, but instead, he got trolled.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/youre-an-idiot-republican-gets-mocked-as-he-falls-for-tim-walzs-deepfake-video-mocking-donald-trump","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-2025-09-02T201523.654.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 15:02:30","author":"Moupriya,white House","authors":["Moupriya","white House"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":356777348,"title":"Howard Stern's controversial comeback CANCELLED!

I don't want my mom to be uncomfortable. I just want to fix her,' Howard lamented on his show back in February 2022.\n\nHoward Stern, 71, will not be back on his SiriusXM show this Tuesday, as he previously promised, following summer break\n'I'm so tired and exhausted. Think of five other words for exhausted and tired and that's what I am. I'm so depressed. I mentioned this on the air yesterday that my mom's not doing well. She's just in a lot of pain, you know? Physical pain.'\nHowever, it was Stern's father Ben who wound up passing away five months later from prostate cancer.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Former staffer reveals how Howard Stern lost millions of listeners \nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the famous radio personality's rep and SiriusXM for comment.\nHoward's titular terrestrial radio show, which aired from 1986-2005, used to amass 20M listeners a week but his SiriusXM show has reportedly dropped to as few as 125K listeners.\nStern previously promised on August 15 that all would be explained on this Tuesday's show: 'Fired? Retiring? Canceled? Bye-Bye Booey? Howard Stern will speak. Tuesday, September 2. Only on @siriusxm #Howard100.'\nFormer staffer Steve Grillo called the September 2nd publicity stunt teased by the former 'King of All Media' a 'desperate hoax' to 'try and make Stern relevant again.'\n'I think that if old Howard Stern could go and jump in the time machine, he would punch him right in the face,' Steve told the Daily Mail last Friday.\n'Come September 2, I think it's just going to be everybody's tuning in, and then I think they're going to get disappointed and tune right back out. Unless he decides to put on a leather jacket and a pair of black jeans and then come back and was like, \"I'm back baby,\" which I highly doubt he's going to do.'\nGrillo thinks Howard 'lost many listeners' last September when he declared he was proud to be 'woke' and compared President Donald Trump to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.\n\nA source told the Daily Mail the shock jock announced he would not return in an email penned to his 95 employees on Labor Day evening, which came 'out of the blue' but was carefully worded in order to not panic staffers (pictured August 6)\n\nHe later confirmed his hotly-anticipated comeback show would instead air on September 8 in an Instagram post on Tuesday\n\nThe Queens-born broadcaster is said to be struggling with the ailing health of his beloved mother Ray Schiffman Stern (R, pictured in 1993), who's set to turn 98 on October 22\n\nStern's father Ben (L) passed away in 2002 from prostate cancer\n\n'Those people were the hard working people that wanted a change in this country and made him famous and made him rich,' the 52-year-old author explained.\n'And he turned his back on them by saying, \"If you like a certain political person, I don't want you listening to my show\"...That's why he's got 125,000 listeners. People cared about what he said every single day, and then he turns on them. What kind of arrogance and stupidity is that?'\nPresident Donald Trump gave his take on why the longtime radio show host may be facing cancellation back in August.\n'Howard Stern is a name I haven't heard - I used to do his show, we used to have fun - but I haven't heard that name in a long time,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about his 20 appearances on the show, including one infamous episode with daughter Ivanka.\n'What happened he got terminated?' the president asked.\nWhile Stern is yet to be 'terminated', it's didn't stop Trump giving his opinion on when things turned back for the shock jock.\n'You know when he went down? You know when he went down? 'When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he lost his audience. People said, 'get me a break'. He went down when he endorsed Hillary Clinton.'\nClinton was Trump's 2016 opponent. Stern also had Trump's 2024 rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, on his show last year.\nStern's sycophantic soft-ball interview with a clearly ailing Joe Biden in April 2024 was also widely criticized. \n\nHoward's titular terrestrial radio show, which aired from 1986-2005, used to amass 20M listeners a week but his SiriusXM show has reportedly dropped to as few as 125K listeners\n\nStern previously promised on August 15 that all would be explained on this Tuesday's show: 'Fired? Retiring? Canceled? Bye-Bye Booey? Howard Stern will speak. Tuesday, September 2. Only on @siriusxm #Howard100.'\n\nFormer staffer Steve Grillo called the September 2nd publicity stunt teased by the former 'King of All Media' a 'desperate hoax' to 'try and make Stern relevant again'\n\nPresident Trump scoffed to Real America's Voice on August 6 (pictured) that he believed Stern went downhill in 2016 after he endorsed Hillary Clinton for POTUS: 'He lost his audience. People said, \"Give me a break\"'\n\nBut SiriusXM president/CCO Scott Greenstein (R, pictured in 2023) previously stated that the Private Parts author's exit will be up to him alone: 'He's able, like many great artists, to stop whenever he wants'\n\nMeanwhile, Frank blamed the Private Parts author's decline on the July 22nd death of his 'superagent' Don Buchwald, and that his current COO Marci Turk 'has drastically turned him into what he is right now.' \nBut SiriusXM president/CCO Scott Greenstein previously stated that Howard's exit will be up to him alone. \n'He's been with me and the company going on two decades, and so he's pretty happy, but he's also able, like many great artists, to stop whenever he wants,' Greenstein told THR last October.\n'Nobody will ever replace them. We would never try to replace them. It's not what is even appropriate, but even practical.'\nOn October 3, Stern and second wife Beth Ostrosky Stern will celebrate their 17th wedding anniversary.\nThe grandfather-of-three has three daughters - Emily, 42; Debra, 39; and Ashley, 32 - from his 21-year marriage to first ex-wife Alison Berns, which ended in 2001.\nHoward SternDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHoward Stern's controversial comeback CANCELLED!

Greg Abbott on Friday signed a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to be more friendly to Republicans, capping off a redistricting push that drew national attention. It also led to California's Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.Missouri is following Texas and California's lead, with the state's Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe announcing Friday that he had called for the state's Legislature to convene on Sept. 3 to redraw the state's congressional districts. Missouri has eight representatives in Congress, two of whom are Democrats. Challenges remain for both Texas and California's new maps. While Texas law only requires the Legislature and the governor's approval to set the congressional maps, civil rights groups have already challenged them in court, accusing the maps of being racially biased. The maps the GOP-controlled Legislature created in 2021 are still being litigated in court.In California, the state's congressional map must be approved by voters before it takes effect. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and State Senate both approved a measure called Proposition 50 for the Nov. 4 ballot that, if approved, will overhaul the state's congressional maps. California Republicans challenged the maps in court, saying Democrats ignored the 30-day public review period for new legislation, although the state Supreme Court denied the petition on Aug. 27.Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off by President Trump in mid-July as Republicans seek to maintain — or even expand — their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterm elections are often a rebuke of the party in the White House. Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson zeroed in on Texas, with the president claiming Republicans could gain an extra five seats given how the state voted in 2024.Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor. The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, with Indiana Republicans having met with Mr. Trump and members of his administration on Aug. 27 to try to redraw the state's nine congressional districts to try to oust the two Democratic members. Florida's Republican House speaker last month created a special committee to look into the possibility there. Although both parties are trying to rig their state's congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed. \"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it — I think it's fair to say — in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice. Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly … a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\" See maps of how Texas and California's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:Texas has 38 Congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats. Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but where Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains in the past few years. In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats. In recent years, Texas Democrats have made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district out in the rural areas, making it a district that was 72% Democratic to one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also takes aim at Districts 32 and 33 in Dallas-Fort Worth, changing Rep. Julie Johnson's 32nd District from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's 33rd District remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district. Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts under the proposed maps. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin. California currently has 52 representatives in Congress, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats. The GOP has made inroads in the Golden State, starting in 2020, when Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. Republicans have held onto two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley. Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.Other Republican strongholds in Central California have been spread into other districts. Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps. In Northern California, Districts 1 and 3 both have dramatic shifts. GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part is absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's 3rd Congressional District, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.","summary":"See maps of how Texas and California's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-californias-redistricting-maps/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/31/5c48b38a-70ab-40e2-aaee-15ac7e6bbc55/thumbnail/1200x630/96cda73af9fa342f631b1212b0e4da4c/newsom-abbot.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 14:38:19","author":"Caroline Linton,Kabir Khanna","authors":["Caroline Linton","Kabir Khanna"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":356738800,"title":"Will Trump resign in 2025?

The president will make \"an announcement\" from the Oval Office at 2 p.m. ET, according to the daily guidance and press schedule issued by the White House on Monday night.However, the chances of Trump resigning showed a spike over the last day on a cryptocurrency-based prediction market 'Polymarket' following speculation about his health and absence of public engagements over the last week. According to NewsWeek, Polymarket increased the chances of Trump's resignation after his administration said there would be an Oval Office news conference without specifying the reason for the event.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Newsweek that \"the President will be making an exciting announcement related to the Department of Defense.\" The Oval Office announcement comes amid speculations which included false claims he had died, and rumours of major health issues. Trump quashed the rumours with a Truth Social post and he has been pictured in recent days heading to his golf course in Virginia with his grandchildren.ALSO READ: Has Trump really changed his schedule amid health fear rumours? Mystery around MAGA chief's well-being deepensTrump's last public engagement was a Cabinet meeting on August 26 but the lack of events since then have fueled speculation about the president's health, with some social media users even falsely claiming that he had died. An empty schedule for the president could be explained by the Labor Day weekend. Live EventsWhat added fuel to the fire were recent comments made by Vice President JD Vance to USA Today that he was ready to step into the top job and an unusual Oval Office statement scheduled Tuesday afternoon. Vance said he was prepared to step into the role of commander in chief, should a \"terrible tragedy\" strike. Stressing that the 79-year-old was fit and energetic, Vance said that unforeseen events could not be ruled out.\"And if, God forbid, there's a terrible tragedy, I can't think of better on-the-job training than what I've gotten over the last 200 days,\" JD Vance told USA Today.ALSO READ: Trump to make surprise Oval Office announcement todayWhat is Polymarket and what did it predict?Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction platform, allows users to wager on a wide variety of events—from economic trends to political and legislative outcomes. According to Crypto News, the platform saw over $1 billion in bets during the U.S. election campaign on whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump would emerge victorious.On Polymarket's page, \"Will Trump resign in 2025\" gamblers could bet on the chances of the commander-in-chief stepping down. This level had gone up to around 3.3 to 3.5 percent for much of August. This increased to over 4 percent at 8 a.m. Saturday following social media speculation about the president's public absence and unsubstantiated claims about his health.ALSO READ: No winner yet?

It seems as if there’s no border,'' he said. \n\n'And as it got worse that year, I felt like I needed to understand this problem more, so I reached out to my friends, largely on the Democratic side of the house, at all levels, from the highest level all the way down.' \n\nGebbia made headlines earlier this year after joining forces with Elon Musk to work on his DOGE initiative, an experience that he described as 'pretty unpleasant' due to the backlash he received from the left. \n\nLast week, Gabbia was also named by the White House as the nation's first ever 'chief design officer', part of a push to modernize the federal government's platforms. \n\nHe said at his announcement in the new role that his aim is to make government platforms as 'satisfying to use as the Apple Store: beautifully designed, great user experience, run on modern software.' \n\nGebbia was a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party and even donated to the Kamala Harris - Tim Walz ticket, but ultimately said he voted for Trump. \n\nHe explained his decision in an X post in November, saying: 'We were told by the media that loving this country meant hating Trump, and for many years I believed that. \n\n'Until I committed the second greatest sin that I’d like to confess today: I did my own research. And I found something that shocked me. He is not a fascist determined to destroy democracy. He deeply cares about our nation.' \n\nIn his recent podcast appearance opposite Katie Miller, Gabbia said this 'journey' started when he began questioning top Democrats over illegal border crossings during the Biden administration. \n\nHe said he received 'some answers' but still felt 'unfulfilled' by what he heard, so he turned to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. \n\n'I get on the phone with Jared and say, 'Hey, can you help me? Fill in the gaps for me. Like, what am I missing here? Is this normal? Like, seems there’s no enforcement of our own border. Like, don’t nations need borders to be a nation?,'' he recalled. \n\n'And so he put me on this curriculum of just talking to experts in the field, and I remember just being like holy cow, this is crazy. Like, this is not right. \n\n'This is a real problem and there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be enforcing the laws of our country and our border. \n\n'And so I think, as I started to pull on that thread, I sort of, you know, begin to look at other topics and eventually came to the point where I don’t think I can support a political party that wants to have an open border, that lets in criminals and dangerous people into our country. \n\n'That’s just not something I can get behind.","summary":"The tech mogul slammed Democrats and said he was driven from the party during the Biden administration - despite previously being a top donor.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15057853/Airbnb-Joe-Gebbia-Trump-Maga-Katie-Miller-podcast-Kennedy.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/02/13/101759261-0-image-a-8_1756817520481.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 14:22:36","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":356857438,"title":"Emotionally damaged Trump is a born loser","text":"I must admit, if Trump wasn't such a power-hungry demagogue, a danger to democracy, a sexual predator, racist, sociopath, pathological liar, bully, and impulsive and unstable megalomaniac, I might feel sorry for him.\n\nHe has no real friends, just sycophants. All his relationships are transactions, including with his three wives and his children. When people are no longer useful to him—wives, lawyers, advisors, Cabinet members—he discards them.\n\nHis current wife Melania is transactional, too. She married him for his money. She obviously doesn't love or respect him and she occasionally displays her disdain for him in public. She didn’t even campaign for him last year, except to make a few public appearances. \n\nTrump hardly ever laughs. He has an almost-constant angry scowl on his face. To Trump, the world is a dark and foreboding place, where, like him, people are consumed by greed and lust. He relies on money and intimidation to get what he wants because he has no capacity for empathy or love—or any belief that people can be motivated by idealism and compassion.\n\nTrump grew up in a world of vast privilege, but that doesn't mean that he wasn't emotionally wounded.\n\nBoth the federal raids on immigrants in Los Angeles and the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C. reflect Trump’s need to look tough, manly, and in control.\n\nAccording to his niece Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, he was bullied by his father, who must have told Donald that he wasn't smart and that he was (or should be worried about being) a loser. In 2017, 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts published a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, warning that he was erratic and unstable as pressures mounted on him. Two years later, they updated the book—this time with 37 experts weighing in on Trump’s troubled mental health.\n\nHe has no strong beliefs about governing or public policy. His major motivations are money, power, revenge, racism, and adulation.\n\nOne of Trump’s few joys in life are the cheers from his fans at MAGA rallies. So, to compensate for his insecurities, feed his ego, and to mobilize his MAGA followers, he has planned this massive parade on June 14—today—ostensibly to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, but which also just happens to coincide with this 79th birthday. The plan is to include 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, and seven military bands, and 34 horses—at a cost of about $50 million—money that could otherwise be spent on improving the lives of soldiers and military veterans. The event will require the closure of Ronald Reagan National Airport to accommodate flyovers and fireworks displays. Trump intends it as a display of force, domination, and personal power. It is more about him than about honoring our soldiers and veterans. \n\nIn U.S. history, large military parades have typically come at the end of wars as part of demobilizing troops and celebrating getting the country back to normal. But such spectacles have a long tradition in authoritarian countries, where dictators, including the current rulers of Russian and North Korea, seek to bind themselves to national identity. The most disreputable of these displays of dominance were the mass rallies and parades organized by the Nazis to celebrate Adolf Hitler, depicted in Leni Riefenstahl’s pathbreaking propaganda film “Triumph of the Will,” that celebrated Hitler speaking at a massive Nazi Party rally in Nurenberg in 1934. \n\nHaving won a second term, Trump is now wants to consolidate his grip on power. He’s sought to bend those whom he views as his critics and opponents—universities, media companies, law firms, judges, businesses, scientists, artists and performers, and even professional sports teams—to his will. Both the federal raids on immigrants in Los Angeles and the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C. reflect Trump’s need to look tough, manly, and in control.\n\nFrom his father, who was arrested at a Klan rally in 1927, he also absorbed the racist ideas of the fake science of eugenics, which was popular in America in the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1988, he told Oprah Winfrey that a person had “to have the right genes” in order to achieve great fortune. In 2010, he told CNN that he was a “gene believer,” explaining that “when you connect two racehorses, you usually end up with a fast horse.” He compared his own “gene pool” to that of successful thoroughbreds. During a 2020 campaign speech to a crowd of white supporters in Minnesota, Trump said, “You have good genes, you know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota.”\n\nBut in fact, Trump has thus always been insecure about his family's genes. His father lied about his family's heritage, pretending that the Trumps were from Swedish, not German, ancestry. Trump repeated the lie in his book, The Art of the Deal. (He later said that he wouldn't mind if the US had more immigrants from Scandinavia, but kept out immigrants from \"shithole countries,\" an outrageously racist comment). Trump said at a rally in Iowa that immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of the country. They're destroying the fabric of our country, and we're going to have to get them out.\"\n\nTrump believes that most white Americans share his racism toward immigrants and that he can weaponize that hatred by carrying out a mass deportation of people he calls “illegal” and “criminals.” He’s sent federal agents to Los Angeles to arrest immigrant workers and parents, followed by National Guard troops to intimidate and arrest those who are protesting the anti-immigrant raids. This is all designed to create fear and chaos to give Trump cover as the “law and order” president and, as Rep. Laura Friedman (D-CA) noted, “an excuse to declare martial law in California.” The timing is no accident. The federal raids—which Trump is likely to expand to other cities—are meant to divert public attention from Trump’s legislative plan to cut Medicaid and other essential programs in order to give a huge tax cut to the super-rich. \n\nTrump often claims that he's a self-made billionaire. In fact, he inherited his father's wealth, as reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig explain in their 2024 book, Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success. His father bankrolled his developments and bailed him out when they failed. Despite his boasts, he knows that most of his business ventures—his casinos, hotels, golf courses, fake university, airline, football team, clothing line, steaks, and others—failed. Most banks won't go near Trump, because they consider him a toxic grifter who consistently defrauds his subcontractors, employees, and lenders. According to Forbes magazine—which ranks the world’s billionaires—Trump was never as wealthy as he claimed to be.\n\nThe timing is no accident. The federal raids—which Trump is likely to expand to other cities—are meant to divert public attention from Trump’s legislative plan to cut Medicaid and other essential programs in order to give a huge tax cut to the super-rich.\n\nTrump's favorite insults, directed toward people he considers his enemies, are \"not smart\" and \"losers.\" Clearly the man is projecting.\n\nTrump was terrified of losing last year’s election because he might have had to go to prison and also because he'd be viewed as a \"loser,\" which in his mind is the worst thing you can be, a consequence of his father's disparagement and his mother's neglect. He was doubly worried that he might lose to a Black woman, Kamala Harris, whom he described as “not smart.” \n\nTrump is clearly insecure about his mental abilities and worries that it's due to his inferior genes. He’s boasted that he comes from a superior genetic stock and that he is a \"very stable genius.\" For years, he has constantly insisted that \"I'm smart.\" “Throughout my life,” Trump tweeted in 2018, “my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.” He lied about being first in his class in college. He didn't even make the Dean's List. Whenever he has defended his intelligence, it isn't clear if he's trying to convince his interviewers or himself. \n\nHe’s even defensive about his vocabulary. He claims to have \"great words,\" although linguists who have studied his speeches and other statements say he has the vocabulary of an adolescent. He doesn't read—for pleasure or work. As president, he doesn’t read the memos prepared for him by his staff, including intelligence briefs. Some observers attributed this to his arrogance. But more likely it is because he can’t understand what is in them. He'd rather be considered arrogant than stupid. \n\nAt least 26 of his top aides publicly said that Trump was unfit to be president. They questioned his competence, character, impulsiveness, narcissism, judgement, intelligence, and even his sanity. \n\nAccording to Michael Wolff, in his book, Fire and Fury, both former chief of staff Reince Priebus and ex-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called Trump an “idiot.” Trump’s one-time economic adviser Gary Cohn said Trump was “dumb as shit.” His national security adviser H.R. McMaster described the president as a “dope.” In July 2017, news stories reported that Rex Tillerson, Trump’s first Secretary of State, called the president a “moron.” When asked, he did not deny using that term. In an interview with Foreign Affairs magazine, Tillerson recounted that Trump’s “understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited.” He said, “It’s really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesn’t even understand the concept for why we’re talking about this.”\n\n“Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,” said his former Vice President, Mike Pence. Mark Esper, one of Trump’s Defense Secretaries, said that Trump is not “fit for office because he puts himself first, and I think anybody running for office should put the country first.” In his farewell speech, Mark Milley, a retired Army general who served as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2023, warned “We don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” clearly referring to Trump. John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps four-star general who served as chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, said that Trump “admires autocrats and murderous dictators” and “has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.” \n\nSoon after the January 6, 2021 insurrection, McMaster, the former national security advisor, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Trump had incited the riot through “sustained disinformation… spreading these unfounded conspiracy theories.” He accused Trump of “undermining rule of law.” Sarah Matthews, deputy White House press secretary during Trump’s first term, witnessed Trump staffers trying, without success, to get the president to condemn the January 6 violence. “In my eyes, it was a complete dereliction of duty that he did not uphold his oath of office,” she told USA Today. “I lost all faith in him that day” and resigned from her job. Trump’s “continuation of pushing this lie that the election is stolen has made him wholly unfit to hold office every again,” Matthews said.\n\nWhat kind of president invites the media to attend Cabinet meetings where each member is required to humiliate themselves by telling Trump how wonderful he is?\n\nBut let's give Trump some credit. He does have the kind of intelligence, sometimes called \"street smarts,\" attributed to hustlers, con men, and grifters. That seems to have worked for him.\n\nTrump knows that many Republicans in Congress laugh at him behind his back but don't say anything in public because they fear him—particularly his ability to find candidates to run against them in the GOP primaries. \n\nHe also knows that most world leaders don't respect him. We’ve now been witness to the ritualized Oval Office meetings between Trump and his counterparts, where Trump seeks to bully, coerce, and humiliate them. A few have challenged him, which gets him angry enough to seek revenge. His meetings with Putin are somewhat different, since he envies the Russian autocrat’s power. Trump’s bromance and recent break-up with Elon Musk is partly about policy but mostly a battle of egos and wills.\n\nWhat kind of person craves being famous for telling people, \"You're fired\"? But that's how he became a TV celebrity. What kind of president invites the media to attend Cabinet meetings where each member is required to humiliate themselves by telling Trump how wonderful he is? To Trump, respect is a zero-sum game. He likes to demean others to boost himself.\n\nTrump will try, and fail, to cancel the 2028 elections and remain in power. But don't expect him to fade away. He will seek to become the leader of a white nationalist supremacist movement while continuing to dominate the Republican Party. The MAGA forces he’s unleashed since 2016 will also still be around. It is no accident that racist, anti-immigrant, and anti-Semitic incidents have spiked since Trump began campaigning for president. Trump verbalizes, encourages, enables, tolerates, winks at, and makes excuses for hate groups, most notably when he said that some of the Nazis marching in Charlottesville in 2017 were “good people.”\n\nWhen Trump dies from the side effects of obesity, the nation and the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief.\n\nBut as he gets crazier and crazier, and no longer has the power of the presidency, most of his followers will abandon him, crowds at his rallies will be smaller and smaller, and he’ll become a lonely, decrepit old man, a fallen idol like the Orson Welles character (Charles Kane) in the 1941 film \"Citizen Kane\" and the Andy Griffith character (Lonesome Rhodes) in the 1957 film \"A Face in the Crowd.\" \n\nHe'll retreat to Mar-a-Lago—his Xanadu—by himself and with his paid staff. Or perhaps he'll spend much of his remaining years in federal prison, seething over how he was the victim of conspiracies.\n\nWhen Trump dies from the side effects of obesity, the nation and the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief. And while he can't quite admit it to himself, he knows it, and it terrifies him.\n\nNOW READ: Here's how Trump could be stopped in his tracks","summary":"I must admit, if Trump wasn't such a power-hungry demagogue, a danger to democracy, a sexual predator, racist, sociopath, pathological liar, bully, and impulsive and unstable megalomaniac, I might feel sorry for him.\n\nHe has no real friends, just sycophants.

The tariffs were enacted through emergency authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows the president to “regulate” international trade under a declared national emergency. Trump cited negative trade deficits with foreign nations and the illicit fentanyl entering the U.S. from Canada, China, and Mexico as emergencies justifying the import duties. Yet, as the court’s majority wrote in its ruling, “we conclude Congress, in enacting IEEPA, did not give the President wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs of the nature of the Trafficking and Reciprocal Tariffs simply by the use of the term ‘regulate . . . importation.’” The court’s order permits the tariffs to remain in effect through October 14, providing time for the White House to appeal the ruling. \n\nIsrael confirmed on Saturday that it killed the prime minister of the Houthi terrorist government, Ahmed Ghaleb al-Rahawi, along with several other high-ranking officials in the Iran-backed, Yemen-based rebel group, in a Thursday airstrike in Sanaa, the capital city of Yemen. Muhammad Ahmed Miftah, the Houthis’ deputy prime minister who has managed much of the terror group’s governing duties, succeeded al-Rahawi as the terror group’s new prime minister. In response to the attack, Houthi rebels on Sunday stormed two UN offices—for the World Food Programme and the UN Children's Fund—and took at least 11 UN employees prisoner. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for their “immediate and unconditional release,” adding that they were “arbitrarily detained.”\n\nIsrael also confirmed on Sunday the death of Hamas’ military spokesman, Abu Obaida—identified by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as Hudayfa al-Kahlout—following an air strike one day earlier in Gaza. Hamas has yet to provide public comment in response to Israel’s report. On Friday, Obaida warned that remains of deceased Israeli hostages would “disappear forever,” if a planned assault on Gaza City went forward. The IDF said he was responsible for distributing videos of surviving Israeli hostages trapped in Hamas’ underground tunnels and of the terror group’s October 7, 2023, massacre of Israeli civilians. The IDF added that Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency had, prior to the air strike, identified the hideout location of Obaida. On Friday, the IDF said it recovered remains of two deceased Israeli hostages, Ilan Weiss and Idan Shtivi, who were kidnapped from Israel in the October 7 attacks and held in Gaza. \n\nOvernight Saturday, Russia conducted a large aerial attack targeting several Ukrainian cities and regions, killing one civilian in the country’s southeast Zaporizhzhia region, where at least 29 others, including three children, were also injured. Russia’s military deployed 537 drones and 45 missiles, per Ukrainian authorities, and struck houses, apartment buildings, and business centers, among other civilian infrastructure. Earlier that day, the former chairman of Ukraine’s legislature, Andriy Parubiy, was assassinated in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. According to unverified footage obtained by the BBC, the gunman appears to have been disguised as a courier, and, after shooting Parubiy, fled the scene on an electric bike. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced law enforcement had detained an unnamed suspect, adding that “urgent investigative actions are currently underway.” Zelensky has not yet shared whether the Kremlin is believed to be responsible for Parubiy’s murder. \n\nA magnitude-6 earthquake that struck the mountainous northeastern Kunar province of Afghanistan on Monday night has killed at least 1,124 people, injured 3,251 others, and destroyed more than 8,000 houses, according to Afghan Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian group. Rescue efforts remain ongoing, and the toll is expected to rise as more bodies are cleared from the rubble. The earthquake is the latest humanitarian crisis to hit the impoverished country, which remains at a high risk of drought and has seen a dramatic decline in international aid since Trump's January decision to cut funding to USAID. \n\nChinese president Xi Jinping hosted a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Monday attended by 10 world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. At the meeting, Xi framed the group as the alternative to the U.S.-led global order, pledging $280 million in grants to SCO member states for this year alone, and announced plans for a SCO development bank, a new international cooperation platform for energy industries, and ways for SCO member states to use China’s alternative to GPS. Putin supported the plans, saying SCO “could take on the leading role in efforts to form a more just and equal system of global governance in the world.” Meanwhile, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday morning, with Kim and Putin expected to be the star guests at a Chinese military parade on Wednesday marking 80 years since Japan’s World War II surrender, where the CCP is expected to showcase new weapons technology. \n\nTrump revoked the Secret Service security detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective Monday, following a memorandum he signed last week, several news outlets reported on Friday, citing unnamed administration officials. As stipulated by federal law, vice presidents retain their federally funded security protection for six months following the end of their term. However, shortly before former President Joe Biden left the White House, he signed an executive order to extend Harris’ Secret Service protection for an additional year, setting the security to expire in July 2026 as opposed to last month. Harris reportedly requested the extension from Biden, citing security and safety concerns.","summary":"The firing of director Susan Monarez is RFK Jr.’s latest attempt to exert more control over the CDC.","url":"https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/morning/turmoil-at-the-cdc/","image":"https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2226860939.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 11:01:24","author":"Israel Defense Forces,Peter Gattuso,Ross Anderson","authors":["Israel Defense Forces","Peter Gattuso","Ross Anderson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.071},{"id":356671816,"title":"Donald Trump Reveals New Joe Biden-Inspired White House Artwork","text":"President Donald Trump revealed in an interview with The Daily Caller that there is piece of art inspired by former President Joe Biden being prepared for display in the White House.Trump told the outlet, \"We put up a picture of the autopen.\"Newsweek has reached out to a press representative of Biden outside of regular working hours via email for comment.Why It MattersEarlier this year, Trump used analysis from The Heritage Foundation to accuse Biden of not physically signing multiple documents, including key pardons.The Oversight Project, a branch of The Heritage Foundation—the think tank that wrote Project 2025, a U.S. political movement aiming to shape Republican administration policies—claimed that the Biden White House used an automated signature in order to place Biden's name on several key documents.In June, Trump ordered an investigation into the Biden administrations alleged use of an autopen and alleged that Biden was not aware of presidential orders and appointments.Biden has denied these allegations, calling them ridiculous and false.What To KnowTrump gave an interview with The Daily Caller, the full transcript of which was published on Monday, Sept. 1. In the interview, the president showed the outlet's reporter some of the new features in the White House, including a sketch of Biden's official portrait.The president, who has made multiple changes to the White House since his return to office, said that they are making a \"Presidential Wall of Fame.\"Asked by the reporter if he would be hanging a portrait of Biden, Trump replied that it was an \"interesting question,\" and added, \"We put up a picture of the autopen.\"\"I like it. This is going to be very controversial,\" Trump said.It was not made clear in the interview if the photo would be of the autopen itself, or, Biden with the autopen.Biden's last years in office, and his re-election run in 2024, were marked by concerns over his age and mental acuity. Though he assured voters he was able to beat Trump and complete a second term in the White House, he later withdrew from the race and endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris.The autopen allegations come in the context of larger claims, some of which stem from MAGA and conspiracy theories, that the Biden White House was covering up for an alleged cognitive decline of the president while he was in office.In 2005, the Department of Justice (DOJ) stated: \"The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\" As such, even if Biden had used an autopen for his signature, this is unlikely to have legal implications.The autopen has been previously used by Trump, and was first used by President Barack Obama.Trump has directed multiple major renovations at the White House since the beginning of his second term. This has included redesigning the previously minimalist Oval Office and paving over the iconic White House Rose Garden.What People Are SayingFormer President Joe Biden, in a statement shared in June, said: \"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency.

He’d grown up in an area of the city like this one — predominately Black and Latino, poor, often ignored — and understood how important this hub of social services, child care and physical fitness was to the community.\n\nMarc was also, importantly, a U.S. congressman, representing Fort Worth and parts of Tarrant and Dallas counties. He took Biggins’ call, and helped secure $2.4 million in federal funds to save the YMCA.\n\n“I knew I wouldn’t have to explain to him how things work over here,” said Biggins, a board member of the Eastside YMCA. “He lives in this community too. We see him at the grocery store, and we can hold him accountable.”\n\nFor many on this side of the city, U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey isn’t just another politician. As the first Black congressman from Tarrant County, he’s the embodiment of long-denied political representation they’ve fought hard to achieve.\n\nTwenty years ago, Tarrant County was 75% white, the largest red county in the country. But explosive growth, driven entirely by people of color, has boosted the power of Black and Hispanic voters, who tend to pull the lever for Democrats like Veasey. Now majority non-white, Tarrant County has become a true swing county, and if demographic changes continue, seems on track to eventually turn blue.\n\nUntil redistricting.\n\nNot the usual once-a-decade redistricting to account for population growth, but an extra round to protect Republicans’ narrow majority in the U.S. House. As part of their effort to create five new GOP seats in Texas, state lawmakers erased Veasey’s district from Tarrant County entirely.\n\nThe freshly refurbished YMCA will now be in a district with a majority-white, majority-Republican electorate that extends nearly 150 miles west, almost to Abilene. Other historic Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are tacked onto similarly stretched districts covering wide swaths of rural Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, in June, Tarrant County officials redrew its maps to replace a Black Democrat with one of the state Legislature’s most conservative members on the county commissioners’ court.\n\nIn a county where 47% of voters went for Kamala Harris in 2024, there will likely be just one Democrat on the county commissioner’s court, and one corner of the county represented by a Democrat in Congress. The new districts virtually guarantee Republican candidates their seats, without having to court communities of color they picked up in Tarrant County.\n\nIt’s an evisceration of political power that community leaders fear will set them back decades. It’s especially painful that this is coming right as these communities have finally seen their political clout grow to match their increasing population numbers, Biggins said.\n\n“We don’t have a voice except through our elected officials,” she said. “If you earn something, you’ve earned it. But if you’re demanding it [or] just taking it — that’s not how this is supposed to work.”\n\nA son of Stop Six\n\nLast June, the Stop Six neighborhood in southeast Fort Worth lost a local legend. Robert Hughes, the winningest boys basketball coach in the United States, died at 96, after a nearly five-decade career in which he led the Dunbar High Wildcats to two state titles and more than a thousand regular season wins.\n\nA week after his death, community leaders gathered to honor the coach’s life and legacy at Hughes House, a mixed-income housing development that is the centerpiece of an ongoing effort to revitalize this historic Black neighborhood\n\nHughes House was “going to be almost as outstanding, and just as fabulous for the community, as Coach Hughes,” Veasey said as he presented a check for $4.1 million in federal funding, according to the Fort Worth Report. \n\nThis project is part of a transformation taking place in Stop Six, bringing new housing, businesses and private development to the neighborhood. It’s taken buy-in at every level of government: Gyna Bivens, who then represented this area on City Council, spearheaded an effort to change zoning restrictions to make it easier to build housing. County Commissioner Roy Brooks, part of a newly balanced partisan split on Tarrant County’s governing body, helped improve roads and infrastructure. And Veasey worked with the first Trump administration to get a $35 million grant to kickstart the work.\n\nAt the event, Brooks, who was preparing to step down after 20 years on commissioners court, commended all the elected officials who helped make it happen.\n\n“When you occupy these seats of power, you look mighty good sitting,” Brooks said. “But you look even better when you use the powers and authority that you have to make improvements for the people you represent.”\n\nIt wasn’t always this way in Stop Six, or many of the historic Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in southeast Fort Worth. Sidelined by segregation and discriminatory housing practices, it took generations for these areas to fight their way to representation at City Hall, on the county Commissioners Court and in the state Legislature.\n\nIn Congress, longtime Fort Worth Rep. Martin Frost, a white Democrat, was an ally to these communities until his district was divvied up among Republicans in 2003, when the Legislature’s new GOP majority embarked on mid-decade redistricting to seize control of Texas’ congressional seats for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nThe next year, a former Frost aide and proud son of Stop Six named Marc Veasey ran to represent these areas in the state Legislature. Bivens was glad to give him her vote.\n\n“You really want to know with certainty that the people you elect know your community, know those needs, know those priorities, and just the culture,” she said. “I think that’s key to a representative government … and that was Marc.”\n\nAs he entered office, Veasey’s district and the areas around it were changing fast. Between 2000 and 2010, Tarrant County grew by a quarter, with Black, Hispanic and Asian populations each increasing by more than 40%. Fort Worth was now majority non-white, and Tarrant County was on its way, seemingly a boon for the ability of voters of color to elect their candidates of choice.\n\nAnd yet, when state legislators drew new congressional lines in 2011, Tarrant County was given only majority-white, Republican-leaning districts that carved up communities of color — similar in many ways to the new plan signed by Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday.\n\n“It looked like a racial gerrymander to us,” Nina Perales, the vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said of the original 2011 map. “It looked like these appendages were following racial lines to scoop minority populations out of Dallas and Fort Worth and combine them with majority white populations outside of the Metroplex.”\n\nState legislators maintained that the maps were drawn blind to race, with the sole goal of winning more Republican seats. A panel of three federal judges disagreed, ruling in 2017 that the state had “acted at least in part with a racially discriminatory motive … with regard to the districts in DFW in particular.”\n\nThe court drew up new maps that detached these communities of color from the districts they’d been folded into. What was left was a contiguous stretch from Fort Worth, through east Tarrant County and into Dallas, now known as the 33rd Congressional District. The court-ordered seat was 40% Hispanic, 25% Black and 31% white — an electorate that grew even more diverse by the end of the decade — and would allow Black and Hispanic voters to elect their preferred congressional candidate, according to the court’s analysis.\n\nThey chose Veasey, who became Tarrant County’s first Black member of Congress.\n\n“It's amazing to be able to represent the same areas that I've played in as a kid,” he said recently. “East Fort Worth, we always kind of get the short end of the stick on a lot of different things. … We just need for this area to not be ignored and I’m glad to have been a part of that.”\n\nTwelve years later, Veasey is the county’s longest tenured member in a body where seniority dictates influence. He’s launched affordable housing projects, like Hughes House; worked closely with Rep. Kay Granger, a Republican, on a $1.2 billion flood control project; and secured funding for major transportation projects.\n\nEveryone in Fort Worth, it seems, has Veasey’s cell phone number and is happy to use it, sometimes to the frustration of staff trying to keep him on schedule. When people call state Rep. Ramon Romero with immigration issues, or other concerns that require federal intervention, he knows exactly who to point them to in Veasey’s office.\n\n“His constituent services were as good as any,” said Romero, a Democrat who chairs the House’s Mexican American Legislative Caucus. “This was one district where we were able to choose our representative and be happy with [them].”\n\nAnd if they’re not happy with him, or if they feel like he’s not representing their interests, they have the power to vote him out.\n\n“Had he promised us something, or had he said he would help and he couldn't do it?” Biggins said. “He has to come back and face us. He lives in this community too.”\n\nThe other redistricting\n\nIn mid-May, Veasey attended a town hall meeting in Arlington about an unusual mid-decade redistricting effort to shore up Republican power.\n\n“It is blatant, it is intentional and it violates the Voting Rights Act,” Veasey said from the stage, noting that the process had been “crammed into a period of barely six weeks, and only four public hearings.”\n\nVeasey wasn’t defending his own seat — this was months before the state would redraw its congressional map. Instead, he was speaking out on behalf of the portion of his constituents who are represented by County Commissioner Alisa Simmons, a Black Democrat who was being drawn out of her seat.\n\nTwo of Tarrant County’s commissioner precincts are solidly Republican; one is solidly Democratic. And one is a swing district, covering the fast-growing, rapidly diversifying and politically unpredictable southeastern stretch of the county.\n\nIn 2018, Democrats won the swing district for the first time, electing a Black woman named Devan Allen. Four years later, Simmons beat out a conservative former commissioner by 4,000 votes to succeed her.\n\nSince joining the court, Simmons has spoken out about conditions within the Tarrant County Jail, worked to build affordable housing and pushed solar energy projects, and has joined her Republican colleagues on bipartisan property tax cuts. She has also tried to serve as a blockade against the court’s growing conservative faction, led by County Judge Tim O’Hare.\n\nAt the same time that Tarrant County is becoming a diverse melting pot of races, ethnicities and political ideologies, it has also become a laboratory for far-right governance.\n\nAn uncompromising conservative, O’Hare made headlines in 2020 for co-founding a political action committee that unseated local school board members who supported campus diversity and equity programming in the wake of several racist incidents, including a viral clip where white students chanted racial slurs. O’Hare’s effort drew national attention to the Southlake suburb and kicked off a national battle over how schools should confront issues of race, sex and gender.\n\nO’Hare ran for county judge — the county’s top executive — in 2022 on a platform of respecting “faith, freedom and family values.” He told KERA News that he would “absolutely, unequivocally” make Tarrant County more conservative “every single day.”\n\nSince assuming office, he has tried to shut down early voting on college campuses, cut funding to a program for low-income girls because of the group’s stances on abortion and LGBTQ issues and voted to outsource social services to private companies. Repeatedly stuck on the losing end of 3-2 votes, Simmons has voiced her opposition during court meetings, leading to public clashes, including one where O’Hare told her to “sit there and be quiet.”\n\n“There’s an attitude that they have where they really can’t be embarrassed, they really don’t care what you think and they stay so focused on whatever it is they're trying to decimate,” Pastor Michael Bell, a local civil rights leader, said. “They will not be distracted.”\n\nAfter Tarrant County swung narrowly for Trump in 2024 — while also going for Democratic Senate nominee Colin Allred by a hair — O’Hare began pushing to redraw Simmons’ precinct to make it solidly Republican. The map adopted in early June would pack fast-growing Black and Hispanic communities from her precinct into the sole remaining Democrat-leaning one, giving the GOP a supermajority on the five-person court.\n\nJust days after the map was approved on a 3-2 vote, state Rep. Tony Tinderholt, one of the Texas House’s most conservative members, announced he would run for Simmons’ seat. Tinderholt, who has made headlines for far-right legislation, like allowing women who have abortions to be charged with murder, quickly rolled out a long list of local GOP endorsements — including O’Hare and the two incumbent GOP commissioners — that effectively cleared the primary field. Tinderholt did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwo different groups have since sued the county, arguing the maps are unconstitutional and run afoul of the Voting Rights Act. O’Hare declined an interview but said in a statement that the redraw was based on constitutional, partisan grounds, to “ensure conservative governance of Tarrant County for years to come.”\n\nSimmons said the new map breaks up communities that have grown together, choosing the voters for the candidate rather than the other way around.\n\n“They shuffle people around from their centralized representation and deny them the ability to elect one of their own,” she said. “The previous map respected communities and interests. This new map confuses power over people.”\n\nA return to the past?\n\nJust weeks after the county redrew its map, state legislators embarked down the same path, pushed by President Donald Trump and his concern about losing the GOP’s narrow House majority in the 2026 midterms.\n\nAmid Trump’s pressure campaign, a top Department of Justice official sent Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton a letter that claimed the state’s existing congressional map was unconstitutional.\n\nThe letter said Texas had to redraw four congressional districts, including Veasey’s, because they were “coalition districts,” created to address voting rights violations in areas where Black and Hispanic voters constitute a majority of the population. In 2024, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that coalitions of racial or ethnic groups cannot band together to bring challenges under the Voting Rights Act.\n\nLegal experts told The Texas Tribune this ruling didn’t require states to go back and redraw existing coalition districts, as the DOJ argued, but even if it did — the 33rd Congressional District doesn’t meet the definition of a coalition district.\n\n“It’s not a purposeful majority-minority district,” Perales said. “It’s just what gets left behind.”\n\nLegislators quickly abandoned this letter as the motive for mid-decade redistricting, instead focusing on the explicit goal of holding the GOP majority in the House. Republican Sen. Phil King, the upper chamber’s redistricting committee chair who represents parts of Tarrant County, said on the Senate floor that if Texas didn’t redraw its maps, “the next two years after the midterm, there will be nothing but inquisitions and impeachments and humiliation for our country.\"\n\nWhen the proposed map came out, the 33rd Congressional District — drawn to fix racial discrimination identified by the courts — was erased entirely from Tarrant County. Areas that have been under Veasey’s oversight for a decade will be splintered between three districts with electorates that are majority white and Republican, just like before he took office.\n\nStop Six will end up in a district currently held by Rep. Roger Williams, a six-term Republican who lives in neighboring Parker County. White residents make up about 55% of eligible voters in the new district, which Trump would have carried by 24 points had it existed last year. The seat takes in a dozen largely rural counties outside Tarrant that, collectively, ensure Williams can hold the seat even if he receives meager support in Fort Worth.\n\nOther parts of the city will go to Rep. Jake Ellzey, who lives an hour away in Ellis County, and Rep. Craig Goldman, who succeeded Granger in a district that will now cover west Fort Worth and Parker County. Ellzey, Goldman and Williams did not respond to inquiries about how they will represent the new parts of their districts.\n\nVeasey said he likes them all personally, but the partisan split of their districts means they’ll have no incentive to robustly represent his old district.\n\n“I know their politics well enough to know they would never ask for community funding to help get a YMCA reopened in this neighborhood, and that the priorities of people in West Fort Worth and [the affluent Parker County suburb] Aledo are always going to come first,” Veasey said. “That's just the reality.”\n\nBell, the Stop Six pastor, said it feels like all the momentum they’ve been building over the last few years will be reversed.\n\n“We had someone we knew, someone we could reach, and say, ‘Hey, Marc,’ and he heard us,” he said. “We’re not invisible to Marc, and that’s the best thing I can say about him.”\n\n“Enveloped in hopelessness”\n\nCee Ellis was wrapping up an exercise class at the YMCA last week, when she ran into Veasey on a tour of the recently reopened gym.\n\n“It’s just terrible what they’re doing to you,” she told him. “Are you still in your seat? Still representing us?”\n\nWhen Veasey assured her that he was — for now — she asked a version of the question people have been peppering him with for weeks: “Can we still vote for you?”\n\nVeasey told the Tribune he’s been fighting so hard to stop the new map — educating voters, organizing rallies, speaking at public hearings — he hasn’t had much time to consider what he’ll do if they go into effect. He could run, and likely lose, in a Republican-leaning district in Tarrant County, or run against another Democrat in a Dallas-based district. Or he could try his hand at another level of government, like a county or statewide race.\n\n“I haven’t really thought long and hard about that yet,” he said in a recent interview. “There’s always opportunity, someplace.”\n\nMeanwhile, at the county, Republicans are already showing how they plan to wield the power they’ll glean from the new map. At an August commissioner’s court meeting, O’Hare proposed cutting the number of polling places in Tarrant County by a third, as well as some early voting locations, for the upcoming election.\n\nThe measure passed 3-2. O’Hare said the cuts were to save money, since there’s lower turnout in non-presidential years. But ahead of the presidential election, O’Hare also tried to close voting locations, this time on college campuses. He was voted down by two of his Republican colleagues, one of whom has since been replaced by a hardline ally, Matt Krause. Adding Tinderholt could give him the votes needed to pass these more extreme proposals.\n\nIt also would protect the Republican majority if O’Hare were to ever lose his seat.\n\n“Why would you need four to one, if three to two still gives you the power you need?” Fort Worth City Councilmember Chris Nettles asked. “Because you know at some point, you’re going to lose the judge seat. The county is changing and they know they can’t hold that seat countywide.”\n\nBell is trying to stay optimistic. But with these compounding redistricting efforts and other upheaval — earlier this month, the Fort Worth City Council suspended diversity efforts to protect federal funding — it’s starting to feel like they’re never going to be allowed to win.\n\n“Our community is enveloped in hopelessness like I’ve never seen before, and I’m not a kid,” the Stop Six pastor said. “I’m seeing it in [council] meetings, with the county, with this redistricting. This is mean-spirited backlash and it’s working to make people feel hopeless.”\n\nBivens, who retired from City Council this year, said hopelessness is the one thing these communities can’t afford. They’re going to have to once again learn to govern from the outskirts and fight their way into every room, she said, even if no one has an incentive to hear them out.\n\nIn the long run, Bivens is optimistic that there’s no “magic formula” to help Republicans outrun demographic changes in Tarrant County, or across Texas. And in the short term?\n\n“Guess we’re all going to make some friends in Parker County,” she said.\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15!

(AP) — Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti on Tuesday announced a bid for Congress in Pennsylvania, adding yet another competitive Democrat to the 2026 midterm election lineup in a state that gives her party perhaps its best chance to gain multiple seats without redrawing congressional lines.\n\nThe ranks of Democrats now running for Congress in Pennsylvania include a prominent mayor and a state labor leader, and give the party the kind of candidate-recruitment buzz it needs ahead of next year’s congressional elections. At stake is a controlling majority in the U.S. House.\n\nCognetti, a mainstay on stage when national Democrats campaign in her working-class city, has long been viewed as the party’s best candidate to try to unseat freshman Rep. Rob Bresnahan. The district is full of Democrats who more recently have backed President Donald Trump.\n\nCognetti will campaign as an independent-minded Democrat and can-do corruption-fighting mayor who beat the party’s nominee in 2019 to grab the top office in Scranton, a heavily Democratic city.\n\n“People here are sick of self-serving politicians,” she said in an interview. “I’ve shown in Scranton that we can build government for people and be honest with people. I have done it with an independent streak and I think we will be able to take that successfully to the whole district.”\n\nSeats like Bresnahan’s will be of prime importance in 2026: Democrats need just three seats to flip control of the U.S. House and party leaders say the road to the majority likely goes through Pennsylvania. The state holds four of the 35 seats nationwide that Democrats are targeting.\n\nThree of those — including the neighboring districts now represented by Bresnahan and fellow freshman Republican Rep. Ryan Mackenzie — were among the narrowest races in the country last year. Without Trump on the ballot next year to bring out his loyal voters — and given the long history of midterm defeats for the party of the president — Democrats have reason to feel good.\n\nRedistricting not an option\n\nFor Democrats in Pennsylvania, redrawing the state’s congressional boundaries to increase their chances of picking up seats isn’t an option.\n\nThat requires legislation and no such bill would be likely to pass the state’s politically divided Legislature. That means the party is relying on recruiting good candidates, a task involving Gov. Josh Shapiro, himself a potential 2028 contender for the White House.\n\nThe Scranton-based district Cognetti is running in is often a destination during presidential campaigns, with its split electorate attracting candidates from both parties. It is also the birthplace of former President Joe Biden.\n\nCognetti, 45, has experience in the U.S. Treasury Department and with the Scranton school board and is viewed by party operatives as a rising star in Pennsylvania.\n\nAs mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania’s 7th-biggest city, she has a good relationship with Shapiro and is a sought-after figure at political rallies and during presidential visits, whether greeting Biden or former Vice President Kamala Harris on the airport tarmac or warming up crowds at their rallies.\n\n‘The future of the Democratic Party’\n\nHer task isn’t an easy one: the district has voted for Trump in the last three presidential elections and the Democrat who held it until last year, Matt Cartwright, was a perennial target of Republicans.\n\nCognetti was at the top of practically every Democrat’s list to succeed Cartwright.\n\n“Top down, going into next year, I have been blown away by recruitment,” said Brittany Crampsie, a Democratic campaign strategist in Pennsylvania. “People want to run in seats where we had to do strong-arming to get candidates to say ‘yes’ last year, three years ago.”\n\nCrampsie said people like Cognetti are “the future of the Democratic Party.”\n\nCognetti’s candidacy is the second big get for Democrats in one week. Last week, the head of Pennsylvania’s state firefighters’ union, Bob Brooks, declared his candidacy to challenge Mackenzie.\n\nThe Allentown-area district already has five Democrats running.\n\nBut Brooks has Shapiro’s support, as well as backing from a pair of labor unions, U.S. Rep.

He has also trolled President Donald Trump on social media lately, which has boosted his profile.What To KnowPolitical Polls aggregated eight polls from leading pollsters including Emerson, Morning Consult and Echelon Insight to get to its results.It comes after Newsom has enjoyed a number of positive polls in recent months. According to an August poll by POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab, the governor leads Harris 25 percent to 19 percent among the state's registered Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents in a 2028 presidential primary.And according to online betting market Polymarket, Newsom has a 35 percent chance of winning the nomination. This is a strong lead on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York progressive who is in second place with a 10 percent chance of winning the vote. Harris has a five percent chanceMeanwhile, some members of the far-right have also suggested Newsom is a good candidate because of his genetic profile, widening his appeal.However, an Echelon Insights poll from this month put Newsom in second place among potential Democratic candidates with 13 percent support, behind Harris with 26 percent.What People Are SayingSpeaking to Newsweek, Mark Shanahan who teaches American politics at the University of Surrey in the U.K, previously said: \"We are incredibly early in the presidential election cycle with campaigning proper still years down the line. But everything Gavin Newsom is doing suggests he's serious about running in 2028.\"This started last year when he didn't put his hat in the running once Joe Biden relinquished the Democrat nomination, and has continued through building a sizeable war chest, building his public profile beyond California through everything from the regular media round to launching his own podcast, presenting California as a bastion against presidential overreach, and now mocking Trump through memes and X posts.\"In June 2025, Newsom told the Wall Street Journal: \"I'm not thinking about running, but it's a path that I could see unfold.\"What Happens NextCandidates tend to announce their presidential runs after the midterm elections.In this election cycle, they will take place in November 2026. With over a year until then, there is still time for Newsom, Harris and other potential Democratic candidate's fortunes (and polling situation) to change.","summary":"The California Governor is now tied with former Vice President and 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the race to win the 2028 Democratic primary.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-polling-2028-2122975","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2713971/gavin-newsom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fee6a462b006e3a0c6dab33981347ef4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 09:24:18","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.106},{"id":356721770,"title":"Federal Judge Strikes Down Gavin Newsom's Attempt to Censor 'Deepfake' Humor","text":"A federal judge has thrown out two laws signed last year by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that banned so-called “deepfake” videos of politicians, calling the legislation an unconstitutional form of censorship.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported at the time, Newsom signed the laws, AB 2655 and AB 2839, in response to Elon Musk sharing a spoof campaign ad that made fun of then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nMusk responded at the time that he had consulted with “Professor Suggon Deeznutz” and had been told that parody is still “legal in America.”\n\nThe satirical Babylon Bee also responded to Newsom, with a fake campaign video:\n\nBreitbart News explained:\n\nThe two bills, AB 2655 and AB 2839, are related. The first requires “large online platforms” to “block the posting of materially deceptive content related to elections in California, during specified periods before and after an election.”\nIt also bars “materially deceptive content,” which is defined as “audio or visual media that is digitally created or modified, and that includes, but is not limited to, deepfakes.” That could, in theory, include a broad range of political speech — such as Kamala Harris’s false claims that former President Donald Trump once praised neo-Nazis, a claim known as the “very fine people hoax.”\nThe second bill targets deepfakes, which show “[a] candidate for any federal, state, or local elected office in California portrayed as doing or saying something that the candidate did not do or say if the content is reasonably likely to harm the reputation or electoral prospects of a candidate.” There are exceptions for satire, parody, and news reporting, as long as the “deepfake” is accompanied by a disclaimer.\n\nThe Babylon Bee, among others, subsequently challenged the law in federal court.\n\nAs the California Globe and RedState reported this weekend, a federal judge was not convinced by the laws’ carveouts, and found that both pieces of legislation championed by Newsom violated fundamental free speech rights.\n\nSenior Judge John Mendez of the Eastern District of California, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote:\n\nThe Court finds that AB 2839 discriminates based on content, viewpoint, and speaker and targets constitutionally protected speech.\n\nRather than targeting content that procures tangible harms or materially benefits a speaker, AB 2839 attempts to stifle speech before it occurs or actually harms anyone as long as it is “reasonably likely” to do so and it allows almost anyone to act as a censorship czar.\n\nAB 2839’s expansive terms capture even satire or parody videos since the law does not require that the parody in fact does fool or mislead someone.\n\nMoreover, the State’s contention that parody and satire are excepted is unpersuasive because AB 2839 … imposes a disclaimer requirement on parody or satire that is independently suspect. … Put simply, a mandatory disclaimer for parody or satire would kill the joke.\n\nJudge Mendez also struck down AB 2655, which required online platforms to regulate “deepfakes,” as the Washington Times noted, saying that it violated the companies’ immunity under the Communications Decency Act.\n\nIt was the latest loss in court for Newsom, who likes to portray his opponents, notably President Donald Trump, as enemies of freedom, yet has frequently been found to violate fundamental constitutional rights with his own policies, such as banning many forms of religious worship during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJoel B.

She was still a star for the Missouri Tigers in college basketball when some began referring to her as “MAGA Barbie.” Although Cunningham neither confirmed nor denied the speculations, the nickname has stuck.A story by the New York Times on Monday shed light on Cunningham's political stance. The Indiana Fever guard said in the interview with NBA reporter Tania Ganguli:“I’m clearly white and from Missouri, and so I think there was a lot of assumption there.“All I have to say is I really am right in the middle, and I think a lot of America is like that. In our culture today, you have to choose and you have to be an extremist, and that’s just not me. So I agree with things on both sides; I disagree with things on both sides.”Make America Great Again (MAGA) is a slogan originally made popular by the late US President Ronald Reagan in 1980. Donald Trump rode on the same theme in three elections (2016, 2020 and 2024). Owing to a few Instagram stories that seemed to take a shot at Democrat Kamala Harris, many assumed Cunningham is a Republican.Sophie Cunningham added in the interview that people discussing her political convictions is par for the course, considering her status as a WNBA player. The Fever star insisted that regardless of narratives, she would remain true to herself.Skip Bayless blasted Sophie Cunningham for allegedly leveraging Caitlin Clark’s popularity to become a social media sensationLast month, veteran sports analyst Skip Bayless spoke about Caitlin Clark’s “strange” absence on his podcast. He speculated that the point guard’s prolonged absence could be due to a “mental break from all the jealousy” and other off-court issues.Sophie Cunningham said in her “Show Me Something” podcast in mid-August that Bayless’ take was “literally bulls**t.” Cunningham insisted that the Fever had not lied about the All-Star point guard’s status.Before September rolled, Bayless got back at Cunningham:“She quickly befriended Caitlin (Clark); that was smart. And then she assumed the role of Caitlin's on-court and in interviews defender and protector, or public defender. … Then, with the spotlight shining on Sophie 100 times better than ever before, she started making grand entrances into arenas, wearing spicy outfits, some of them provocative and very cool.”Sophie Cunningham has never shied away from controversy. She has been fined by the WNBA for her comments about the officiating via her tweets or podcast. Only time will tell if she will throw another volley at Skip Bayless.","summary":"Sophie Cunningham’s political leanings have piqued the interest of many for years.

Shortly after the article was published, Moretz turned to Instagram to share photos of their outfits, which were designed by Louis Vuitton. \n\nWhile Moretz wore a light blue gown for the ceremony and a custom-made white jacket with matching trousers and a cowboy hat for the after-party, Harrison wore a white lace bustier with a matching skirt and a bodice and trousers for her after-party attire. \n\n“A big part of the wedding [is about] sharing things that Kate and I love with everyone that’s going to be there,” the Kick-Ass actor told Vogue. “So there’s fishing, horseback riding and poker. Kate made a custom poker mat herself, so we’re going to kind of be leaning into it. Our second day is going to be line dancing and everything.”\n\nWhile the couple never formally confirmed their engagement, Moretz posted on January 1 a photo of her and Harrison wearing matching diamond rings on their ring fingers. “Happiest New Year, so thankful for what this year has brought,” her Instagram post was captioned. \n\n“The people, the places, our families, our health, our love. Wishing all of you a peaceful start to this new year.”\n\nDespite being linked to Harrison since 2018 after the two were photographed kissing in Malibu, California, Moretz did not publicly confirm her sexuality until November 2024, as she encouraged Americans in an Instagram post to vote early in the presidential election. \n\nCaptioning a photo of her “I voted early” sticker, she wrote, “I voted early and I voted for Kamala Harris. There is so much on the line this election. I believe the government has no right over my body as a woman, and that the decisions over my body should come ONLY from myself and my doctor.”\n\nContinuing, the star said that she believed that Harris “will protect that for us” adding that: “I believe in the need for legal protections that protects the LGBTQ+ community as a gay woman.”\n\n“We need protections in this country and to have access to the care we need and deserve.\n\n“SO… Are you voting early?

We’re all human, trying to be with the people that we fall in love with and be the best person that we can be. But don’t assume people’s sexualities. And don’t project your own issues onto them.

He was very convincing and he has a charismatic quality as an actor.

This was a guy I used to see at the Knick games,” Allen said. \n\nTrump apparently appreciated the director’s comments, reposting an article on Truth Social that shared the laudatory comments.\n\nMaher agreed with Allen’s positivity on Trump’s personality but insisted the president had distinct on-stage and off-stage personalities which the host likened to acting.\n\n“But that doesn’t bother me,” Allen retorted. “They all have to put on a certain patina for the public.”\n\n“I would like to direct him now that he’s president,” Allen joked.\n\nMaher came under fire back in April when he visited Trump at the White House for dinner and came away with overwhelmingly positive reviews which irked his audience of liberals.\n\n“Just for starters, he laughs,” Maher said in a tea-spilling monologue on “Real Time.”\n\n“I’d never seen him laugh in public.

The former VP, as noted in the news reporting, had only a “statutory six months of protection” coming her way after leaving office. That time period expired. So there was nothing unusual about her Secret Service protection ending. The real question is:\n\nWhere is former Vice President Dan Quayle’s protection? I know, I know. Quayle has been out of the vice presidency since January 20, 1993, when the defeated President Bush and Vice President Quayle had to turn over their White House keys to incoming President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.\n\nBut if the complaint here is that Harris should have her protection time extended, then why not for Quayle in the day? Or, for that matter, ex-VP Al Gore? Or ex-VP Mike Pence? Or ex-VP Dick Cheney? Or have all ex-VPs had their protection extended up until today?\n\nThe hard fact here is that there appears to be a double standard on this issue with the left. If Harris’s protection time is up, there’s hell to pay. But if it’s Dan Quayle or Dick Cheney? Who cares.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that often enough America has former vice presidents floating around the country. And they have managed to do so without their once-upon-a-time in-office Secret Service details.\n\nFormer Vice President Richard Nixon spent eight years as a private citizen without Secret Service protection between losing the 1960 presidential election to John F. Kennedy and winning the presidency in 1968.\n\nSo too did ex-VP Spiro Agnew, who resigned the vice presidency in October of 1973 after charges of income tax evasion, faced demands that he lose his Secret Service protection. The New York Times reported back in the day that incumbent President Nixon: “Rep. Moss Tells Treasury to End Agnew Guard (Published 1974)”\n\n“Asked that the detail be assigned to Mr. Agnew for ‘a reasonable period of time.’ Treasury officials have indicated that the detail may be withdrawn in April, six months after Mr. Agnew’s resignation.”\n\nSuffice to say, in the case of former Vice President Harris, it has been 8 full months — not 6 like that for Agnew — since departing the vice presidency. Much is being made of her current book tour. Surely the Harrises can afford their own security as they see fit when their security disappears. (RELATED: Time to Cut Off Security Clearances for Ex-Gov Officials)\n\nThe hard fact and concerning problem for Americans is that when people of high rank, other than the president, leave office, there is always a move to let them keep everything from Secret Service protection to top secret clearance for security briefings.\n\nSurely there comes a time when this should stop. The phrase “Out of Office” means just that.\n\nREAD MORE from Jeffrey Lord:\n\nNo One Elected Trump-fired CDC, Federal Reserve Bureaucrats\n\nThree Cheers for US Ambassador Charles Kushner\n\nKirk Cameron’s Story House Triumph","summary":"Ya can’t make it up.

I’m a religious college football watcher and, when I’m in the mood, an observer of the NFL. That doesn’t leave much room for the high school game. Maybe before I’m dead I’ll have a son who plays; at that point, I’ll be in the stands trying not to be one of those dads.\n\nThat said, I know a good number of people who did watch Arch play. And I did see quite a few games his famous uncles, Peyton and Eli Manning, played at Newman when I was younger, not to mention I remember the reaction among observers of my alma mater’s team to their exploits. (RELATED: Hope Returns, Miraculously, To Baton Rouge)\n\nEveryone I talked to was adamant that Arch wasn’t in Payton or Eli’s league.\n\nHe’s good, was the general reaction. Nice size, pretty good arm, moves fairly well, knows the game. But Peyton and Eli had the “it” factor. When they played, even in high school, there was zero question they were going to be NFL Hall of Famers and legendary quarterbacks, even beyond the repute of their father, Archie Manning, who starred at Ole Miss and with the then-terrible New Orleans Saints. (RELATED: NFL Tries Male Cheerleaders. That’s the Left’s Plan to Win Back Men?)\n\nArch? Probably a pretty good college quarterback. Might make a roster in the NFL and hang around a while. Maybe even get to start a little during his career.\n\nSo why was there so much hype around Arch Manning? After all, coming out of high school following the 2022 season, Arch was rated the top high school football player in America at any position, and when he signed with Texas, the hype train left the station and went into orbit.\n\nWas it his last name?\n\nAfter Saturday, when the #1 Longhorns went up to Columbus to face defending national champion Ohio State and came away on the short end of a 14-7 decision in which Manning struggled, to put it kindly, it’s tempting to say the answer is yes.\n\nNot that any of this is fair.\n\nOne of the problems with college football in the era of NIL and the transfer portal is that star power has been elevated to a level past what should be regarded as healthy. After all, this year’s true freshman phenom quarterback, Michigan’s Bryce Underwood, signed a $12 million NIL package — a number so outrageous that it throws the basic economics of the college game into question. Manning, after all, is valued at only $6.8 million according to the college sports site On3.\n\nBut Manning is college football’s most visible player, sporting endorsements including deals with Warby Parker, Raising Cane’s, Panini America, Red Bull, and Uber.\n\nAnd one of the Raising Cane’s ads, which is showing in Texas and Louisiana, pairs Arch Manning with LSU’s senior quarterback Garrett Nussmeier…\n\nThe Warby Parker ad was also everywhere, including during the loss to Ohio State…\n\nAnd naturally, this was poorly received not only by Texas fans but by a lot of the same media people who had pumped Arch Manning into the stratosphere over two seasons as a backup quarterback in Austin (his stats last year, 61 of 90 for 939 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions, were good, but they were largely skewed by one outstanding game he played as a starter against woeful Mississippi State in late September). An example…\n\nReviewing Arch Manning’s performance on the day.Great in the Warby Parker ad.Decent in Vuori and Raising Cane’s.Football game against Ohio State? … Not great!https://t.co/OJHFUwqrmE— Stewart Mandel (@slmandel) August 30, 2025\n\nDuring the game, there were fans joking on social media that Arch had more commercials on TV than touchdown passes.\n\nOr completed passes.\n\nHe finished the game with somewhat serviceable numbers — 17 of 30, 170 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions.\n\nBut the visuals were not exceptional.\n\nArch Manning is a redshirt sophomore starting the third game of his career at perhaps the toughest venue in college football against a star-studded defense coached by a former NFL head coach with multiple Super Bowl rings (Matt Patricia, who was the defensive coordinator with the New England Patriots in their glory years, as well as a head coach of the Detroit Lions).\n\nIt was eminently foreseeable that this would go badly.\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe isn’t the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, as the media hacks have continuously touted him to be, even though the Mannings have said repeatedly that Arch isn’t leaving for the NFL after this year. Perhaps now they’ll listen.\n\nNussmeier, who played an error-free game in leading LSU past No. 4 Clemson and might have nudged into a slight lead for this year’s Heisman Trophy, seems a better bet than Manning for those honors.\n\nWhy? Because he’s a fifth-year senior who went through the tribulations of a first-year starter last year and is actually prepared for the spotlight now.\n\nPaying your dues actually matters.\n\nWhy can’t the people in the media, whether in sports or otherwise, recognize this obvious fact?\n\nOne answer, obviously, is that American media doesn’t thrive on truth or information. It thrives on hype, controversy, and stupidity. Just look at this…\n\nIf anybody ought to be taken to the abattoir over the failure to deliver on the hype, it isn’t Arch Manning or Texas’s coach, Steve Sarkisian. It’s the Paul Finebaums and Stephen A. Smiths of the world, who anointed a kid with two starts to his name as the greatest thing in college football since Tim Tebow.\n\nWith zero justification other than that last name.\n\nThey did this with Kamala Harris, you know. That hype-tastic crash and burn might even have been worse than what’s happening to Arch Manning — especially given that Kamala had already proven herself to be a bust, and what they were hyping was something they already knew was a warmed-over political turd.\n\nAnd when Harris failed to deliver, the political media at least managed to show a small modicum of embarrassment.\n\nSports media people aren’t quite as intelligent as political media. As hard as that might be to believe.\n\nREAD MORE from Scott McKay:\n\nFive Quick Things: A Glorious Revolution Across the Pond?\n\nThe Demons Have Taken Hold of Minneapolis\n\nPlease Deliver Us From the Poorly-Behaved Women","summary":"I never saw Arch Manning play in high school, though he went to Newman High in New Orleans, which is...","url":"https://spectator.org/last-year-it-was-kamala-this-year-its-arch-manning/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/105-Arch-Manning-was-TERRIBLE-?-Paul-Finebaum-is-WORRIED-after-Texas-loses-to-Ohio-State-_-SportsCenter-5-e1756761276737.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 02:04:53","author":"Scott McKay","authors":["Scott McKay"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.068}]}
